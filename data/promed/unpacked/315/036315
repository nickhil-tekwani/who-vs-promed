Three more babies at an Adelaide [the capital city of the state of South Australia (SA), Australia] hospital have tested positive for a rare bacterium, after health authorities yesterday [Wed 3 Jun 2020] confirmed 5 had been infected.

Southern Adelaide Local Health Network medical services director Diana Lawrence said the latest cases at Flinders Medical Centre had tested positive for the bacteria _Serratia marcescens_ but had "no symptoms of infection" [that is, these patients were colonized, not infected].

The outbreak has been linked to a basin, and the bacteria can cause meningitis and other conditions including urinary and respiratory infections.

"Three additional babies have now been confirmed as colonised with _Serratia_ but have no symptoms of infection," Dr Lawrence said in a statement. "An active investigation is underway to determine any links between the confirmed cases and babies colonised and the hand basin."

SA Health yesterday [Wed 3 Jun 2020] revealed one baby at the southern suburbs hospital was in a serious but stable condition after becoming infected with the bacteria. Another of the infants is showing symptoms, and 3 more had tested positive but were showing no symptoms, SA Health said. Dr Lawrence said antibiotics would be administered "only on a case-by-case basis, dependent on clinical need."

The bacterium was 1st detected in the unit 2 weeks ago, but the outbreak was not publicly revealed until yesterday [Wed 3 Jun 2020]. The hospital is carrying out an investigation into how the bacteria entered the neonatal unit.

One of 200 environmental swabs taken of the unit, from a hand-washing basin, came back positive for the bacteria. The basin has since been removed and replaced.

Australian Medical Association state president Chris Moy said the hospital was "unlucky" to have had an outbreak. "This hospital's got the highest rating on handwashing that you can get; it's also the one with the least number of serious infections in Australia," Dr Moy said.

Dr Lawrence said closing the area where the bacteria was found left the capacity of the hospital "slightly reduced" but said expectant parents should not change their plans. "While we're diverting some to the Women's and Children's, and we can't divert them all, we've only closed 4 out of 16 neonatal beds," she said. "We're very much open for business; we've just decreased our activity somewhat."

[Adelaide, with a metropolitan population (including suburbs) of more than 1 345 777 residents, is the capital of the Australian state of South Australia, and the 5th-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide). A map showing the location of Adelaide can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adelaide+SA,+Australia. Flinders Medical Centre, opened in 1976, is a major public tertiary teaching hospital, co-located with Flinders University and the 130-bed Flinders Private Hospital in Bedford Park, a southern suburb of Adelaide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre).

_Serratia marcescens__ is a Gram-negative bacillus and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Although not normally part of the human flora, it is an important pathogen, especially in healthcare settings in adult and pediatric patients (1-8). Colonized or infected patients and contaminated environmental surfaces represent important reservoirs for _Serratia_. Transmission through carriage on the hands of healthcare personnel and on sinks and other hospital equipment are important routes in many nosocomial outbreaks.

_S. marcescens_ has also caused NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) outbreaks due to contamination of intravenous (IV) fluids (see ProMED-mail post Serratia marcescens - Venezuela (02): (CA) NICU, fatal 20120417.1103584). Contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing has also been found to be a source in another NICU outbreak (7). A multistate outbreak of _S. marcescens_ bloodstream infection was reported in 2009 to be associated with contamination of unopened prefilled heparin and saline syringes manufactured by single company, which grew _S. marcescens_ that genetically matched clinical isolates (8).

Genotyping of the isolates has been used to establish transmission pathways. A common source would be suggested if the genotypes of clinical isolates match each other, and the basin would be the possible, although perhaps incidental, "source" if the basin isolate's genotype matches that of the clinical isolates. How the basin was contaminated will need to be further investigated. - Mod.ML
