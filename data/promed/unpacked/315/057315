Equine viral arteritis in the United Kingdom/Great Britain, isolation
of the virus from an imported horse
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 27 Jan 2005 from Dr. Debby Reynolds, Director
General for Animal Health and Welfare, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
Report date: 27 Jan 2005.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 15 Dec 2004.
Date of start of the event: 18 Oct 2004.
Clinical disease: no.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Details of outbreak:
1st administrative division: Suffolk.
Lower administrative division: Newmarket.
Type of epidemiological unit: pre-export quarantine premises.
Name of the location: Gazeley.
Number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 18.
Number of cases: 1.
Description of affected population: A 5-year-old Friesian stallion,
imported from the Netherlands.
During transport from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, the
horse shared the same transport vehicle with other horses that
entered pre-export quarantine for onward transport to Australia and
New Zealand and with one horse destined for a non-quarantine premises
in the United Kingdom.
Before entering the approved pre-export quarantine premises, the
horse was rested overnight in a non-quarantine premises that was not
under official supervision.
As part of the pre-export requirements of the intended country of
destination, New Zealand, the stallion was subjected, on the
quarantine premises, to a serological test (virus neutralization
test) for equine viral arteritis (EVA). This serological test was
positive. Subsequent laboratory examination of semen collected from
the seropositive stallion confirmed that the animal was an EVA virus
carrier. Clinical signs of the disease were not reported.
A number of other horses destined for Australia and New Zealand were
present on the same quarantine premises.
Origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive. The infection was
detected shortly after the animal was imported into the United
Kingdom. On the basis of the serological test results, the horse may
have been infected shortly before transport to the United Kingdom.
Control measure undertaken:
- Quarantine.
- Breeding restrictions were immediately imposed on the stallion in
the United Kingdom. The animal was re-exported to the Netherlands on
3 Jan 2005.
Other details/comments:
- The horse may have been capable of spreading infection by the
respiratory route. Subsequently, all contact animals were traced. 3
contact animals residing in the United Kingdom have now tested EVA
negative. All other in-contact animals in quarantine were exported to
Australia and New Zealand. The investigation is now complete, and
there has been no evidence of any onward spread within the United
Kingdom.
- The authorities of Australia and New Zealand were notified, and no
feedback has been received to indicate spread of infection to other
horses exported from the same pre-export quarantine.
- The last outbreak of EVA in the United Kingdom/Great Britain
reported to the OIE occurred in 1997.
- Further details will be published in the next issue of Weekly
Disease Information, available on line from Fri 4 Feb 2005 afternoon
(GMT).
