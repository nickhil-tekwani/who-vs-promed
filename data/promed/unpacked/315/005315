Corsica: sausages seized after a case of trichinellosis
------------------------------------------
A ton of charcuterie was seized in Aullene, Corse-du-Sud [South Corsica], following a complaint from a person who has fallen ill after consuming it. The recalled products, with an estimated street value of more than EUR 50 000 [about USD 56 000], will be destroyed.

A ton of charcuterie was seized Thursday [7 May 2015] in Aullene in Corse-du-Sud, after reporting a case of trichinosis, a disease which is characterized by fever or complications if the patient goes untreated, we learned Friday [8 May 2015] from the gendarmerie.

The seizure was conducted Thursday morning by the Departmental Directorate of Social Cohesion and Protection of Populations (DDCSPP) in collaboration with the police.

The reason for the operation was that a person fell ill after eating cold cuts and contacted the DDCSPP, said the gendarmerie, confirming information to "France 3 Corse."

"The charcuterie produced was seized by the precautionary principle," added an investigator. With an estimated market value more than 50 000 euros, the sausages must be destroyed.

According to the Ministry of Health, "Trichinellosis is transmitted to humans through the consumption of undercooked or uncooked meat, mainly horse or boar in France. Trichinella can cause serious complications and sometimes leave sequelae." In the recent years, cases of trichinellosis were observed in France, especially among hunters who consumed wild boar.

Popular with tourists and mainland France, the Corsican charcuterie in 2013 was the source of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in Pietralba in Haute-Corse [Upper Corsica]. For _Listeria_ infection, symptoms are usually fever and headache, and the risk of symptomatic infection is higher for pregnant women and the elderly and/or immunocompromised.

[It is important to investigate the source of infection. One possibility -- if the sausages were manufactured in Corsica -- is that meat from wild boar was illegally used without proper veterinary inspection. Another possibility is that meat with _Trichinella_ was imported and used -- for instance, horse meat. - Mod.EP
