The discovery of cases of children suffering polio in Pidie District, Aceh is shocking news. Because of this, the Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) officially implemented it as a Polio Extraordinary Event (KLB). Even though only one case was found, this step needs to be taken because, since 2014, Indonesia has received a polio eradication certificate (polio-free Indonesia).

"Because, Indonesia has declared eradication, but it turns out that there is (appearing) wild poliovirus, especially type 2 (polio) virus which is considered to no longer be there," said Director General of Disease Prevention and Control (P2P) Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, Saturday (19 Nov 2022) quoted from Kompas. [given descriptions this is mostlikely a cVDPV and not a WPV2 - Mod.MPP]

This case in Aceh was found in a child aged 7 years and 2 months who was infected with type 2 poliovirus. The child experienced wasting in the left thigh and calf muscles.

In addition, it is known that the child with polio has not received any vaccinations so the Complete Basic Immunization (IDL) is not fulfilled. "The child is shrinking in the thigh and calf muscles and indeed there is no history of immunization, no contact trips outside. I saw his child was walking even though he was still limping," said Maxi.

At first, it was known that the child had a fever on 6 Oct 2022. The child was taken to the Tgk Chik Ditiro Sigli Regional General Hospital (RSUD) on 18 Oct 2022. The treating doctors suspected that there was an indication of the polio virus.

Indonesia, the 16th country to report type 2 poliovirus cases. RT PCR results and sequencing on 7 and 10 Nov 2022 showed the patient was infected with type 2 poliovirus

It is known that the patient has no history of immunization or travel contact with the traveler. Director General of Disease Prevention and Control (P2) Maxi Rein Rondonuwu said, with these findings, Indonesia became the 16th country to report cases of type 2 polio this year [2022].

Maxi said that as many as 15 countries such as Yemen, Congo, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ghana, Somalia, Niger, Chad, USA, Algeria, Mozambique, Eritrea, Togo, and Ukraine have also reported findings of type 2 polio cases as of [15 Nov 2022]. This year [2022] we are the 1st, reporting from Aceh. So the 16th country and every discovery of one case of polio is an extraordinary incident," said Maxi in an online press conference, Saturday, 19 Nov 2022.

Indonesia has a high risk of poliovirus spread due to low polio vaccination coverage, Director General of Disease Prevention and Control at the Health Ministry Dr Maxi Rein Rondonuwu, DHSM, MARS said.

"If we look at 30 provinces and 415 districts and cities, they all fall into the criteria of high risk because their polio vaccination coverage is low. So, Indonesia runs a high risk of polio extraordinary occurrence (KLB)," he said at an online press conference, which was followed from Jakarta on Saturday [19 Nov 2022].

Indonesia is currently using a bivalent oral polio vaccine (BOPV) for polio immunization, he noted. The oral vaccine, which is used to prevent types 1 and [3] polioviruses, needs to be administered four times at an interval of 4 months.

The vaccine then needs to be administered in combination with the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the form of an injection. A booster vaccine needs to be provided to children at the age of 9 months along with the measles or rubella vaccine, he informed.

However, OPV4 and IPV vaccination coverage is relatively low. In 2020, the vaccination coverage stood at 86.8 percent for OPV4 and 37.7 percent for IPV. In 2021, OPV4 coverage fell to 80.2 percent, while IPV coverage rose to 66.2 percent.

Therefore, the government must work hard to achieve the target of the child immunization program, he added.

He said a polio case was detected in Aceh in November 2022 because the OPV4 and IPV polio vaccination programs did not work for four consecutive years in districts and cities in the province.

The active involvement of the Family Welfare Movement (PKK) and regional governments will increase polio immunization coverage, he added.

[The MOH announcement mentions type 2 virus identified and mentions other countries where cVDPV2 has been identified, so one presumes the involved poliovirus is a cVDPV2. The absence of travel history or contact with known travelers suggests the responsible virus has been circulating in the community. The results of genomic studies to further identify the virus and its provenance would be greatly appreciated.

Indonesia was early among countries in implementing polio eradication activities as evidenced by the last indigenous wild poliovirus case reported by Indonesia in 1995 (https://polioeradication.org/where-we-work/polio-free-countries/). Since then, there was a wild poliovirus outbreak associated with the West African outbreak in 2005 (see ProMED posts in 2005 listed below) and a cVDPV1 case with onset on 28 Nov 2019 (see ProMED posts below). A very interesting review of the polio eradication activities in Indonesia can be found at Cintyamena U, Azizatunnisa' L, Ahmad RA, et al. BMC Public Health. 2021; 21(1):614; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10647-6.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. The green dots signify cVDPV2 cases reported during this period. According to official reports of cVDPV2 associated AFP cases, Indonesia is the 15th country to report cases with dates of onset in 2021 -- the Ukraine case had date of onset 24 Dec 2021 (see https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/weekly-polio-analyses-cVDPV-20221108.pdf). - Mod.MPP
