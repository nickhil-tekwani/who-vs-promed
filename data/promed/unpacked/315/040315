Children get HIV from blood transfusions
----------------------------------------
At least 23 children suffering from a rare genetic disorder have
tested positive for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] infection after
receiving tainted blood transfusions in western India, officials said
on Monday [12 Sep 2011]. The children all received free blood
transfusions at a government-run hospital in the Junagadh district of
Gujarat state between January and August [2011], hospital head G.T.
Dayalu said.

State government spokesman Jai Narayan Vyas said a team of doctors has
been sent to investigate. News reports quoted Vyas as saying that many
of the infected children had received transfusions from more than one
hospital. But the Indian Express newspaper reported that parents of
the children said they had received blood only at the government
hospital.

The children suffer from thalassemia, a genetic disorder that requires
regular transfusions. The children all belong to poor families.

[Junagadh District is located on the Kathiawar peninsula in western
Gujarat. It is shown in the map at:

HIV infections now wide-spread in India and unfortunately transmission
of HIV by blood transfusion is not unknown in India, as the
ProMED-mail references below indicate. It appears that the children
receiving transfusions in the Junagadh district hospital in the Indian
state of Gujarat for treatment of their thalassemia were recipients of
improperly screened blood.

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder in which an abnormal form of
haemoglobin is produced. The disorder results in excessive destruction
of red blood cells, which leads to anemia. There are 2 main types of
thalassemia: alpha-thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to
the alpha globin protein are missing or mutated. Beta-thalassemia
occurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin
protein.

Alpha-thalassemias occur most commonly in persons from southeast Asia,
the Middle East, China, and in those of African descent.
Beta-thalassemias occur in persons of Mediterranean origin, and to a
lesser extent, Chinese, other Asians. There are many forms of
thalassemia. Each form (type) has many different subtypes. Both alpha
and beta thalassemia exist in 2 forms. The most severe form of alpha
thalassemia major causes stillbirth (death of the unborn baby during
birth or the late stages of pregnancy). Children born with thalessemia
major (Cooley's anemia) are normal at birth, but develop severe anemia
during the 1st year of life.

Persons with the minor form of alpha or beta thalassemia have small
red blood cells but no symptoms.

Treatment for thalassemia major often involves regular blood
transfusions and folate supplements. Persons who receive significant
numbers of blood transfusions need therapy to remove excess iron from
the body. Bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some
patients, especially children. For further information, see:
