In Buenaventura, Colombian Pacific Littoral, 600 malaria cases have been
reported in the last two months; 10 fatalities have been registered.
Most cases have been admitted at the Buenaventura Regional Hospital, where
80% of cases are said to come from rural areas. However, health authorities
are much concerned, as there may be substantial under-reporting due to lack
of transportation and substandard communications.
