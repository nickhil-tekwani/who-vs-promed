West Nile Virus-positive Crow Found in Alexandria, Virginia
-----------------------------------------------------------
RICHMOND: Virginia's Commissioner of Health E. Anne Peterson, M.D.,
M.P.H., announced today that a dead crow found in Alexandria has been
confirmed as having West Nile virus. The crow is the first bird to
test positive for West Nile virus in the state of Virginia this year
[2001.
"State and local governments will continue to collaborate and monitor
the situation to protect the public's health. We expect to find
positive crows in Virginia this year, which is why we are working hard
to increase surveillance and inform citizens. We want to remind
citizens that they can reduce their risk by preventing mosquitoes from
breeding around the home and protecting themselves from mosquito
bites," Dr. Peterson said.
The crow testing positive for West Nile virus was found on East Glebe
Road in Alexandria, Virginia on Sun 15 Jul 2001. The crow tested
positive and was confirmed by the state's Division of Consolidated
Laboratory Services in Richmond on Mon 23 Jul 2001. To date, 458 birds
in Virginia have tested negative for West Nile virus. In all 23 birds
from Alexandria have tested negative this year [2001. Last year
[2000 7 crows tested positive for West Nile virus in Virginia.
Citizens should continue to report all dead birds to their local
health departments. Only certain crows, blue jays, and raptors will be
tested for West Nile virus, because those bird species are the best
early indicators of virus activity in an area. West Nile virus is
spread to birds, humans, horses, and other mammals through the bite of
an infected mosquito. "Most people bitten by an infected mosquito do
not get sick. People who do get sick usually suffer a mild flu-like
illness. The elderly are at the greatest risk of serious illness, such
as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis
(inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord)," Dr.
Peterson said. No human cases have ever been reported in Virginia.
