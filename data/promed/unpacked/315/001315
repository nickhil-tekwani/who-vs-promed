Taiwan culls 18 000 chickens
----------------------------
Taiwanese agricultural authorities on Sunday [21 Dec 2008] confirmed
that they had slaughtered 18 000 chickens after an outbreak of bird
flu. The authorities said when a farm in Luchu, southern Kaohsiung
county, reported some of their chickens had died of an unknown
disease on 21 Oct 2008, they immediately banned movement of the birds
from the farm.

An inspection report released Saturday [20 Dec 2008] showed that the
chickens had contracted the H5N2 strain of the disease, a less
virulent strain than H5N1, which can be transmitted to humans.
However, the findings of the report came too late for the 18 000
chickens on the farm that were slaughtered on 14 Nov 2008.

"We took the most stringent measures in dealing with the episode as
according to the rules of the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE), there was no need to slaughter those chickens," Mr. Huang
Kwo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine, told AFP. "The OIE was informed of the
outbreak yesterday," he said, adding that the origin of the outbreak
remains unclear.

Since the outbreak 76 chicken farms within 3 km [1.86 miles] of the
epicentre have been monitored to ensure the disease does not spread,
he added. Taiwan has suspended its poultry exports, but will be
allowed to resume them if no fresh outbreak of H5N2 is reported
within the next 3 months, Huang said.

There have been no recorded cases of the deadly H5N1 strain in
Taiwan, although in 2005 authorities here said 8 pet birds smuggled
from China had tested positive for the strain and had been destroyed.
The virus has killed about 250 people worldwide since late 2003.

A wider restricted zone set up in Friesoythe
--------------------------------------------
The number of poultry holdings [in the Cloppenburg County] infected
by the low-pathogenic avian influenza virus [H5N3] has risen to 20,
as of Sat [20 Dec 2008] afternoon. 2 suspected cases of the last few
days have, according to County Cloppenburg, been confirmed by the
official investigation. This relates to a holding in
Friesoythe-Schwaneburg, where 10 800 turkeys had already been
precautionarily culled at the beginning of the week, as well as a
suspected outbreak reported on Thursday [18 Dec 2008] from the
municipality of Garrel where nearly 15 000 turkeys have been killed.

Since the outbreak in Friesoythe-Schwaneburg has now been officialy
confirmed, a 1000 meters [1093 yards] radius zone has been declared
as an exclusion zone around the farm. No additional poultry farms are
located within the said zone, leading to a limited impact of the
declaration.

A new suspected case was reported on Saturday [20 Dec 2008] from the
municipality Bosel, where 17 500 turkeys have been killed a
precaution, according to the district. The official investigation's
result is not yet available. So far, approximately 300 000 birds have
been culled and destroyed.

Germany reported an H5N3 outbreak of "low pathogenic avian influenza"
to the OIE on a timely manner, namely 17 Oct 2008, 8 days after the
laboratory confirmation of the event. It was reported as "1st
occurrence of a listed disease." A follow-up report was submitted on
12 Dec 2008. See the reports, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7439>.

The Taiwanese "immediate notification," similarly on a LPNAI
(low-pathogenic notifiable avian influenza) outbreak, namely H5N2,
was submitted 4 weeks after the laboratory confirmation of the
outbreak which had already resolved 10 days earlier, as stated in the
OIE notification of 20 Dec 2008 (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7625>.
