CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (15)
=============================
This consists of a very long but useful document
"Institute of Food Science & Technology Position Statement"
on BSE scientific and regulatory activities in the UK.
To obtain it, one should contact majordomo@usa.healthnet.org
with the following message:
get promed-files BSE
and nothing more. It will be delivered unto you forthwith.
I just tried and it worked.
