Bluetongue in Italy: Circulation of virus serotype 4 in Sardinia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 19 Sep 2003 from Dr Romano
Marabelli, Director General of Veterinary Services, Ministry of
Public Health, Rome:
Report date: 18 Sep 2003.
Circulation of bluetongue virus serotype 4 was confirmed in Cagliari
province of Sardinia by virus neutralisation test carried out at the
National Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases (CESME(1)), Teramo. In
the previous years, outbreaks of bluetongue in Sardinia were due to
virus serotype 2 and vaccination was performed.
The event is limited to various farms of Cagliari province, where
clinical signs of bluetongue and a low mortality level were observed.
To prevent disease spread, there is a ban on the movement of
susceptible animals out of the districts concerned.

As correctly reported in the previous postings, it is likely that
Italian, French, and Spanish BTV 2 came from North Africa. As
apparent from the map at <http://www.izs.it/bluetongue/mappab1.gif>,
there are 2 main directions of BT spread: from south to north (BTV 2)
and from east to west (mainly BTV 4, 9, 16).
Winds are thought to be the main carriers of infected vectors. There
is a wide circulation of various winds in Mediterranean basin. If
vectors' passive transport occurs during the suitable season, i.e.,
late winter or early spring, the virus can initially spread among
cattle, and with the subsequent amplifications of culicoides it will
pass to sheep (late summer).
We have to consider also the natural geographic barriers and climate
variations that may significantly limit culicoides movements and
multiplication. In Sardinia, the years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003
were very warm, while 2002 was cooler, particularly July, August, and
September. One can see climate variations at the site of S.A.R.
(Servizio Agrometeorologico Regionale)
<http://www.sar.sardegna.it/mainpubblicazioni.html> (go to riepiloghi
mensili). For instance, in August 2003, maximum and minimum
temperatures were respectively 5 and 2 degrees centigrade higher than
the average during the previous 40 years. The use of vaccination and
natural immunity may also modulate virus diffusion in cattle, goats,
and sheep.
