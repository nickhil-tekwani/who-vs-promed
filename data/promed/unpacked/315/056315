Kyrgyzstan: Anthrax outbreak could have been avoided
---------------------------------------------------
8 people in the southern Kyrgyz provinces of Osh and Batken have been
hospitalised under suspicion of having contracted anthrax. "Their health
condition is satisfactory, the patients are recovering," medical personnel
told IRIN at the Kyzyl-Kiya and Nookat hospitals in the south.
According to the epidemiological department at the Kyrgyz health ministry,
all those suspected of contracting anthrax took part in slaughtering a cow
with the disease. Part of the meat was divided among themselves, while the
remaining 120 kg was sold to the residents of Toolos village in the Nookat
district of Osh province.
Some 65 people, who consumed the infected meat, were put under observation.
The skin and the head of the slaughtered cow had been given to some local
people and had not been located.
Meanwhile, preventive measures are being taken in districts on the border
of Osh and Batken provinces. "8 teams consisting of epidemiologists,
infectious diseases specialists, and vets are working in Nookat and Aravan
districts, checking every household," local health officials told IRIN.
Last year, 10 cases of anthrax were registered in the Kara-Kulja district
of Osh province. Some 600 people who had come into contact with infected
meat had [undergone] preventive treatment. Kyrgyz specialists blame the
anthrax incidents on weak veterinary and sanitary surveillance and control,
coupled with consumers' carelessness and ignorance.
"Nobody can sell meat if he didn't have a veterinary certificate before,"
Sartbay Aaliev, a resident of Nookat district, told IRIN in Nookat. "Now
they sell meat without any certificate -- God knows its quality -- on every
corner, but nobody cares."
"It is very important that people should be watchful, buy good-quality
meat, and don't look for cheap, low-quality meat," Inna Chernova, a senior
epidemiologist at the Kyrgyz epidemiological department told IRIN from the
capital Bishkek.
Chernova also said that in Osh province alone there were 247 "pestholes" --
places where anthrax had occurred in the past. Nearly 200 of them were
detected, registered, fenced, and covered with concrete. But now these
spaces are not protected. "The majority of the pestholes are left
unattended, metal fences are taken away, there are no warning signs, and
there is a real threat of new outbreaks," Kamil Atahanov, a retired
prominent health specialist in Kyrgyzstan, told IRIN.
Some representatives of health institutions urge authorities to ensure the
safe covering of places where infected animals have been buried. However,
local authorities say they have no resources to tackle the problem.
"International organisations are not extending their hand to help -- they
say that the country can cope with the problem itself," health officials at
the epidemiological department said. Sites of anthrax outbreaks and burial
grounds of infected animals can pose a health threat for hundreds of years,
they added.

[Kyrgystan has modest numbers of livestock cases but a constant ratio of
about 10:1 human to livestock cases -- much like the situation in Central
Africa -- with official numbers prior to 2000 of some 30 to 70 human cases
a year; only 4 human cases were officially reported in 2001, vide supra.
This is not a new problem in Osh; see 1999 report, when there were 32 human
cases and 73 in 1997. While the public health people ask for old cattle
gravesites to be concreted over, they would be better employed pressuring
their veterinary colleagues to implement regular vaccination of livestock
and the effective inspection of animals before and after slaughter and
butchering. This is not a problem that is controlled by sitting in an
office; and the Sterne livestock vaccine is one of the cheapest and most
effective in the world. - Mod.MHJ]
