I am reliably informed -- 3 dead birds downstairs in necropsy
with characteristic signs & lesions -- that EEE has been diagnosed
in a 300 emu flock near Kaplan, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana.
As of this morning 5 birds were reported dead, but as the flock
was unvaccinated we can confidently assume that a significant
number will die.

[Although EEE has the word "equine" in its name, its reservoir is
passerine birds in North America, where it does not seem to kill
more than perhaps a few nestlings. But adult exotic birds such as
pheasants & emus are very susceptible - Mod.JW
