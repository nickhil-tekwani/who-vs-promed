A resident of Wonogiri, Central Java, was suspected of having anthrax when he checked himself in Gunungkidul, DI Yogyakarta, last December 2022.

Head of the Gunungkidul Regency Health Service (Dinkes), Dewi Irawaty, said that anthrax was suspected at the Karangmojo II Health Center, when a resident from Eromoko, Wonogiri, visited his relative at the end of December 2022. At that time, the patient complained of injuries or abnormalities in the skin. "The patient visits family in Karangmojo at the end of every year," said Dewi when contacted by reporters by phone on Tuesday (10 Jan 2023).

He explained that the test results were positive for anthrax and medical treatment was carried out.

Anthrax drug [treatment] stock is still available, so the patient was immediately treated and has returned to Wonogiri. His party [services] together with the Gunungkidul Regency Animal Husbandry and Health Service have conducted surveillance and examination of the patient's family in Karangmojo. The result is that the family is not infected.

"Anthrax spreads from animals to humans, not humans to humans," said Dewi. Head of Animal Health Division, Gunungkidul Animal Husbandry and Animal Health Service, Retno Widiastuti, said that there were no reports of animals suddenly dying from surveillance in Karangmojo. "It is suspected that the transmission occurred due to spores in the region of origin," said Retno.

[Years ago I read reports of field workers in Soviet Russian explaining their cutaneous anthrax lessons from infected soil. This was made up to cover that they had been buying and eating meat from unreported dead cattle. The Indonesian official explanation indicates that they have not left their offices to determine what had really happened. Plus there will have been more than one case of cutaneous lesions from among the butchering crew. We have had many reports of livestock anthrax in Yogyakarta in previous years, so there should have been ample opportunities for recent cases such as this.

Yogyakarta is in the middle of the southern coast of Java, Indonesia; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta. For a map of the province, see https://whereismap.net/where-is-yogyakarta-located-what-country-is-yogyakarta-in-yogyakarta-map/. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
