Spain: Increase in viral meningitis cases reported in the Autonomous
Region of Madrid, 2006
----------------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan and 16 Sep 2006, the Epidemiological Surveillance
Network of the Autonomous Region of Madrid detected 446 cases of
viral meningitis, an increase of 260 compared with the same period in
2005. Viral and bacterial meningitis have been mandatorily notifiable
diseases in the Autonomous Region of Madrid since 1997. Clinical and
epidemiological data are collected through a structured questionnaire
for every case. No changes in the reporting pattern have been
observed in recent years.
The cumulative incidence detected for the period was 7 cases per 100
000 inhabitants (compared with 3/100 000 for the same period in
2005). Three quarters of the cases were in children under 15 years of
age, and 58 percent of all cases were male. The patients' ages ranged
from 1 month to 73 years (median age = 5 years). The age group with
the highest incidence is 1-4 years (55 cases per 100 000), in
children younger than 1 year (53 cases per 100 000) and in children
aged 5-9 years (46 cases per 100 000) (Figure. 1). Eleven per cent of
cases were linked to other cases, particularly through household and
school contact. [These data are presented as a histogram in the text
of the original report].
No sequelae have been reported in any of the patients, but 2 deaths
have been recorded. Both the patients who died had
meningoencephalitis, the cause of which was not identified.
Enterovirus has so far been confirmed by serological or polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) in samples from 49 patients (11 percent).
Strains identified were mainly echovirus 30 (62 percent) and
echovirus 6 (19 percent). Both of these serotypes are frequently
reported in Spain.
This increase has also been observed in other regions of Spain. The
number of cases of viral meningitis notified in 2006 in the
Autonomous Region of Madrid has been greater than that observed
annually from 2001 to 2005, but not as great as the outbreak due to
echovirus 13 in 2000 [1]. Incidence in 2006 peaked in weeks 21-25
(late spring), which is the usual pattern observed in this region. In
the original text these data are presented in the form of a figure
plotting number of cases per week in 2006 against the minimum, median
and maximum case numbers for the period 2001-2005.
Many different viruses can cause aseptic meningitis, but
enteroviruses are responsible for more than 80 percent of cases in
which the cause is identified [2]. Enteroviruses are typically
transmitted through the faecal-oral or oral-oral routes and through
respiratory droplets and fomites. Outbreaks of enteroviruses have
occurred frequently in a wide variety of places and years and
continue to do so [3-14]. No specific prevention or control measures
are available. Good hygiene is recommended: frequent and thorough
hand washing (especially after changing babies' nappies),
disinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaners (such
as diluted bleach solution), and avoidance of sharing utensils and
drinking containers [15].
Control measures
----------------
Measures implemented as a result of this detected increase have been
enhanced surveillance (spreading of weekly epidemiological reports to
the Epidemiological Surveillance Network of the Region of Madrid),
improvement of diagnosis confirmation (recommendation of specimen
collection and transport to the Enteroviruses Reference Laboratory)
and distribution of information leaflets on the main control measures
recommended to the schools affected.

[These data show that the outbreak peaked between weeks 20 and 25 and
declined to pre-outbreak levels by week 33. The outbreak in the
Madrid region now appears to be over. Of the total cases, 81 percent
were confirmed as viral infections (echovirus 30 and echovirus 6).
The same serotypes were associated also with viral meningitis
outbreaks in Latvia later in the summer -- see ProMED-mail post:
