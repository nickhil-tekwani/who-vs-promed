The director of the San Juan de Dios Hospital of Cotagaita, Marcelo Mariscal, announced on Fri 12 Oct 2012, that 5 cases of brucellosis were reported in this municipality, raising fears that the cattle in the region are infected with the bacterium.

"The hospital has cared for 4-5 cases of human brucellosis. This disease is a zoonosis which is transmitted through the consumption of meat or milk products from goats or cattle," explained the doctor.

Brucellosis, also called Malta fever or undulant fever, is a bacterial disease that attacks several mammalian species including man. It also infects other mammalians among which are those which have a high economic impact such as bovines, equines, porcines, ovines, caprines, and other wildlife.

Mariscal said that the disease [brucellosis] is characterized by muscle pains, fever, and general malaise, and its complexity is due to the fact that the treatment is quite prolonged, hence the emphasis on a prevention campaign.

[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was first described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is vital. - Mod.LL
