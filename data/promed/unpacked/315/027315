It seemed straightforward enough at first: A 19-month-old boy being
treated at Children's Hospital Boston had classic symptoms of
whooping cough, and a laboratory test confirmed he had the disease.
Then, from late September through early November 2006, 3 dozen
hospital employees in wards where the child had been treated also
developed coughs and other symptoms suggesting that they too were
stricken with the disease. And, just as for the toddler, initial
testing confirmed they carried the bacterium.
But now, more than 3 months after the child fell ill, disease
investigators are no longer certain that the respiratory illnesses
that struck workers and another patient at Children's Hospital were
caused by whooping cough, also known as pertussis. Additional
testing, using approaches different from the 1st round, could find
little evidence of the highly contagious germ.
Still, no one can say for sure what made the workers sick -- they all
recovered -- and disease specialists can't definitively rule out
pertussis as the cause.
The cluster of illnesses is proving so intriguing that federal
disease sleuths and even a lab in Canada have joined specialists from
Boston and the state who are trying to crack the mystery.
The episode at Children's Hospital is a cautionary tale about the
limits of science, particularly the ability of laboratories to
produce absolute, unimpeachable results when disease strikes.
"People think laboratory tests are 100 percent accurate: If they're
positive, they're positive; if they're negative, they're negative,"
said David Warshauer, a top official at the Wisconsin State
Laboratory of Hygiene, which oversaw testing during a pertussis
outbreak in 2003 and 2004 that spawned more than 5000 cases. "But
that's not the case with any laboratory test. And when you're looking
for an infectious agent like pertussis, there's a lot of variables."
The mystery began 18 Sep 2006, when a toddler came down with symptoms
of whooping cough, typically heralded by a runny nose, sneezing,
slight fever, and mild cough. The disease can develop far more severe
manifestations, most notably spasmodic coughing that can last for
months, and be ferocious enough to shatter ribs.
While symptoms can provide strong clues about whether a patient has
the disease, laboratory tests provide far more robust proof,
especially for pertussis, with early symptoms similar to the common
cold. To collect a specimen for testing, a cotton swab-like probe is
threaded through the nose and into the back of the throat
[nasopharyngeal culture. - Mod.LL]. "People generally don't like it
much when you do that," said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, director of
communicable disease control for the state. "But you can't get to
that area through the mouth."
The sample is then used 2 ways. One is a laboratory classic called
culturing: Material from the patient is placed in a dish with a
growth medium that will allow the bacterium to reproduce if it's
present. The other approach is more modern: polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR, involves looking for the genetic fingerprint of the
disease. PCR has emerged in the past decade as a favorite testing
technology in state labs across the nation, including the
Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute in Jamaica Plain, in large
part because it's easier and faster than culturing. It was that lab
that tested most of the samples collected from Children's Hospital,
initially using PCR. There were hundreds of tests performed, and 38
-- 2 patients and 36 healthcare workers -- came back positive for pertussis.
"Children's [Hospital], much like the local health department, really
relies on laboratory tests to guide us on what the diagnosis is,
especially illnesses that can look like a lot of different things,"
said Dr. Anita Barry, top disease tracker at the Boston Public Health
Commission. "Having accurate test results early on, particularly when
they're consistent with the clinical symptoms, really launches us
into control steps." And that is what happened at Children's
Hospital, with measures designed to hem in the bacterium and prevent
it from colonizing more victims.
"You think you know what's going on," said Dr. Manisha Patel, a
disease investigator at the CDC, "and you want to make sure it
doesn't spread to the most vulnerable patients in the hospital." But
even as those steps appeared to be reining in the outbreak, something
curious began happening at the state lab.
Specialists rarely rely on a single testing method to confirm a
diagnosis if multiple methods exist. So state lab workers, in
addition to performing PCR testing, proceeded with the laborious task
of culturing samples. They also tested blood samples from the
hospital workers. The results of those additional tests: They were
almost uniformly negative for pertussis, DeMaria said.
"What was going through my head at the time was what might explain
this?" Barry said. "Is there some type of problem with one of the
tests? Could it be something closely related to pertussis?"
Samples were sent to the CDC in the quest for answers. Researchers in
Atlanta performed a more elaborate, 2-tier PCR test. "The results
were inconclusive," said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a medical epidemiologist
for the federal agency.
It turned out that one part of the PCR test suggested the presence of
the pertussis bacterium, while the other part didn't. The state lab,
which initially performed just one phase of the PCR test, decided to
conduct the 2nd phase and, like the federal lab, came back with
negative results on that 2nd phase.
"One of our group's highest priorities at [CDC] is working out better
laboratory diagnostics for pertussis," Cohn said. "The laboratory
diagnostics for pertussis are difficult. It's a priority for us to
find reliable, rapid, standardized testing for pertussis."
The federal agency and Massachusetts health authorities continue to
work with Children's Hospital to ascertain what made the 36 adults
and 2 children ill. There are competing theories, ranging from a cold
virus to a bacterial relative of pertussis to the virus that causes
the condition commonly known as walking pneumonia. It's unlikely that
the causes of all the respiratory illnesses will ever be fully known.
"What I can say is that whatever it was, it went away," Barry said.
"And that's the good news."

[Polymerase chain reaction relies on amplification of a specific DNA
segment analogous to a primer used to anneal it to. If the particular
strain involved here was not analogous to one of the primers used,
then the PCR may not be positive. It is unclear, indeed, whether the
cluster was or was not pertussis.
Despite this, clusters of pertussis do occur in adults, and
vaccination of hospital employees, especially those with pediatric
patient contact, does occur, and vaccination of such cohorts with the
acellular pertussis vaccine seems more than reasonable. The following
is from the initial posting of this thread:
"The most recent CDC statement regarding adult immunization (CDC:
Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule --- United States, October
2006 - September 2007 MMWR 2006;55; Q1-Q4
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540-Immunizationa1.htm>)
states this about the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine in adults:
"Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary vaccination
series with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines should
begin or complete a primary vaccination series. A primary series for
adults is 3 doses; administer the 1st 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart
and the 3rd dose 6-12 months after the 2nd.
"Administer a booster dose to adults who have completed a primary
series and if the last vaccination was received more than 10 years
previously. Tdap or tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine may be used;
Tdap should replace a single dose of Td for adults aged less than 65
years who have not previously received a dose of Tdap (either in the
primary series, as a booster, or for wound management).
"Only one of 2 Tdap products (Adacel [Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater,
Pennsylvania]) is licensed for use in adults. If the person is
pregnant and received the last Td vaccination greater than 10 years
previously, administer Td during the 2nd or 3rd trimester; if the
person received the last Td vaccination in less than 10 years,
administer Tdap during the immediate postpartum period. A onetime
administration of one dose of Tdap with an interval as short as 2
years from a previous Td vaccination is recommended for postpartum
women, close contacts of infants aged <12 months, and all health-care
workers with direct patient contact. In certain situations, Td can be
deferred during pregnancy and Tdap substituted in the immediate
postpartum period, or Tdap can be given instead of Td to a pregnant
woman after an informed discussion with the woman."
"Immunization of adolescents and adults with an acellular pertussis
vaccine booster as part of an adult tetanus/diphtheria vaccination
has been recommended for more than a year. It is unclear how much
adherence to this recommendation is occurring. With an increased risk
of both acquiring pertussis and spreading it to susceptible infants,
would it not be reasonable to require a Tdap booster for each
hospital employee to assure immunity? Similar requirements are in
place for other childhood diseases, such as measles and rubella."
