Comment on congenital trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) in Bolivia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear colleagues:

It would be useful to know how infant (and mother) diagnosis of
Chagas disease is made in Bolivia, since in the case of infants,
passive transmission of antibodies is expected.

The only way to ascertain the diagnosis of the infection is to find
the parasite itself in peripheral blood. This is only accomplished by
visualization under microscopy of thick blood smear or through blood
culture specific for _T. cruzi_.

Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where I have my practice, is endemic for
Chagas disease, and we screen all HIV infected pregnant women for
Chagas serology.

Although we haven't seen yet any case of vertical transmission, blood
culture proved, of _T. cruzi_, we order the test in the mother during
ante-natal care to the local public health lab, which is the only
facility performing such test in our state. In case ofÂ´presence of
viable _T. cruzi_ in the mother, follow up of the infant is also made
with blood culture.

With best regards,

[ProMED thanks Dr Breno Riegel Santos for his comment. We agree that
diagnosis of any congenital infection is difficult due to passively
transferred IgG-antibodies from the mother. Infections rely on finding
of the parasite -- as stated here -- by culture or microscopy (or
PCR). Alternatively, the specific IgG-antibody titer in the child can
be followed and will usually disappear between the age of 6 and 12
months, if the antibodies were passively, transferred maternal
antibodies alone. - Mod.EP]
