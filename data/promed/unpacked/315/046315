BOTULISM, SMOKED FISH - FINLAND EX CANADA

On 29 Jun 2006, a 65-year-old woman fell ill with vomiting and
diarrhea in southern Finland. The next day she developed muscular
weakness of her upper and lower limbs, and was admitted to hospital.
She developed difficulty in breathing and required mechanical
ventilation in an intensive care unit for a week.
The patient is now recovering, but still has some difficulties in
swallowing, and is not yet able to walk. The patient did not receive
botulinum antitoxin, since the symptoms had already begun to resolve
upon diagnosis. The patient's husband also had diarrhea on 29 Jun
2006 and later had some difficulties in swallowing, but no other
neurological symptoms were observed. He was admitted to hospital for
one night (1-2 Jul 2006) because of diarrhea.
Serum samples from the female patient taken on 30 Jun and 1 Jul 2006
were positive for botulinum neurotoxin by mouse bioassay, and the
neutralization test suggested that the patient's illness was caused
by botulinum toxin type E. Gastric fluid and serum samples taken on 4
Jul 2006 did not yield neurotoxin or _Clostridium botulinum_. No
specimens were available from the husband, as botulism was not
diagnosed during his hospital stay, and he was not called back to
hospital for specimens.
An interview with the husband revealed that the couple had eaten
smoked vacuum-packed whitefish on 28 Jun 2006. The wife had eaten
most of the fish, and the husband ate only a small portion. The
whitefish had been imported from Canada, but smoked and packed in
Finland. There was no leftover fish for microbiological examination.
Flush samples were taken from the fish's plastic packaging, but they
were negative for _C. botulinum_ by PCR (1) and culture.
The suspected fish product was recalled by the manufacturer, and
production of the product was suspended. The national and local food
control authorities inspected the production plant and the
distribution center. The entire manufacturing process and storage
temperatures throughout the cold chain, including the retail outlet,
were investigated. The inspections did not reveal any factors that
could have created an increased risk of botulinum neurotoxin
production. Microbiological analysis of 10 vacuum-packed fish made
from the same raw fish batch that was used to make the product eaten
by the patient, and from fish from earlier and later batches, were
all negative for _C. botulinum_.
The investigators have therefore hypothesized that there may have
been storage temperature abuse at a later stage, such as in the
retail outlet or the home. After inspection of the facility and
microbiological examination of fish samples, production of the
product has started again.
_C. botulinum_ type E is naturally highly prevalent in aquatic
environments and fish (2,3), leading to a high risk of contamination.
The hot-smoking processes are usually too low to eliminate botulinum
spores (4). Growth and toxin production from spores in vacuum-packed
smoked fish products with anaerobic atmosphere and limited
preservative factors is likely during extended storage at
temperatures above 3 degrees C. Therefore the most important factors
controlling _C. botulinum_ growth and toxin production are efficient
heat treatments, restricted shelf life and continuous storage below 3
degrees C.
Human botulism is a very rare disease; the most recent case to be
reported in Finland before the one mentioned here occurred in 1999
(5). A similar outbreak that affected 2 people in Germany in 1997 is
described in the literature (1). However, it is of utmost importance
that physicians remain aware of the disease as a possible diagnosis.
Botulism should be considered whenever a patient develops
neurological symptoms that include blurred vision, difficulties in
swallowing or speech and symptoms of descending flaccid paralysis.
This should be followed by appropriate epidemiological and laboratory
analyses to confirm the diagnosis and to improve the epidemiological
understanding of the disease (6).

[This report points out that storage temperature issues may also
contribute to botulism.
Prodromal symptoms of food-borne botulism often include nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which are absent from cases
of wound botulism. It is not clear that these symptoms are related
to botulism per se or other contaminants of the ingested food. A USA
paper (1) reported vomiting in 59 percent of foodborne cases and
diarrhea in 19 percent; and one from the Republic of Georgia (2)
reported vomiting in 56 percent and diarrhea in 25 percent.
