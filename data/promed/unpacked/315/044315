YELLOW FEVER - AFRICA (25): ANGOLA COMMENT

The report that 3 months after the beginning of an outbreak of yellow fever in the municipality of Caluquembe in southern Huila province, Angola the vector has been identified as _Aedes aegypti_ needs additional information.

Caluquembe is some 900 km by road south of Luanda, the Angolan capital in which yellow fever, presumably urban yellow fever, has been occurring since December 2015. Accordingly, the onsets of the 2 events are at approximately the same time. The precise timing is important since it would help in distinguishing whether the outbreak in Luanda, presumably an urban outbreak, spread to cause a secondary urban outbreak in Caluquembe or whether the original focus was a sylvatic outbreak starting in or near Caluquembe. These factors have implications for vector control.

Caluquembe has an altitude of 5501 ft [1700 m], a wet season that begins in October, and a mean daily temperature in their wet season varying from 65-67 F [18-19 C] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caluquembe). Although these temperatures are on the cooler side of the evaluation, climate is rated "subtropical highland variety." Are these conditions conducive to _Ae. Aegypti_? Are there areas with lower altitudes in the vicinity that have warmer temperatures? It might be helpful to have input from people with experience in Angola to comment on these possibilities.

The recent reports in ProMED indicate that yellow fever cases originating in Angola have traveled to Kenya and China, amply documenting concerns about possibilities for spread of the disease. For Angola, in addition to vaccination, appropriate vector controls are indicated.

[Dr. Seligman touches on an important point: the vectors in this yellow fever (YF) outbreak. As noted in comments on recent ProMED-mail posts, no mention has been made of vector status or control in either of the 2 areas where the YF outbreaks are occurring. Information about the geographic presence and abundance of vector mosquitoes within and outside the areas of current YF virus transmission would be useful in assessing the risk of further spread of YF virus in the country. The impression given from the previous reports is that the YF control and prevention effort has been focused on immunization. If vector control has been part of that effort as well, it has not been mentioned in the reports we have received.

Dr. Seligman is thanked for his comments.
