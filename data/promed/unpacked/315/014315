West Nile Death in Connecticut; 2nd in USA in 2001
--------------------------------------------------
HARTFORD: It was reported on Thu 1 Nov 2001 that an elderly Connecticut
woman has become the second person in the nation to die this year from the
West Nile virus. Health officials said the woman, who was in her 90s, died
in mid-October. The death of a 71-year-old Georgia woman in August also was
attributed to the mosquito-borne virus.
The virus, which has caused illnesses in some 50 people this year, appeared
in the Western Hemisphere in 1999 in New York City, where an outbreak
killed 7 people and made 61 others ill. It has since spread to 25 states.
The latest victim, who lived in East Haven, Conn., developed severe
neurological symptoms in late September, the Hartford Courant reported on
Thursday. Dr. Matthew Cartter, who coordinates the epidemiology program for
the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said state laboratories did
not confirm the cause as West Nile virus until Monday, weeks after the
woman's death. He said he doctors would have naturally suspected other
causes of death in an elderly woman so late in the mosquito season before
considering West Nile virus.
Mosquitoes infected with the virus were not found in East Haven until 12
Sep 2001, within a mile of the woman's home. Because the risk of infection
decreases as mosquito populations decline in late September, with the
arrival of colder weather, officials decided against using pesticides to
kill the insects. "Fortunately, we have had several frosts since late
September and this year's West Nile virus season is now over," Dr. James
Hadler, chief of infectious diseases division of the state Health
Department, told the New Haven Register. The victim was one of 6
Connecticut residents believed infected with the virus this year, compared
to one last year and none in 1999. Of the other 5 people infected, a West
Haven woman in her 70s, who became ill in late August, remains
hospitalized. The others, ranging in age from their 30s to their 70s, have
recovered.
While the virus most often causes encephalitis, or swelling of the brain,
state health officials said the cause of death of the latest victim was
respiratory failure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta is conducting additional tests to confirm the woman's cause of death.
