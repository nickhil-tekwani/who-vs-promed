Now, those [Indians] travelling to Africa and South America can now submit their applications for yellow fever vaccination online on the NDMC website. The online initiative will be launched on 8 Jul [2015]. Currently, travellers have to visit the New Delhi Municipal  Council Headquarters to submit copies of applications for yellow fever vaccination. Following this, the council allots them an available slot.

"Once travellers plan their trip, they can submit their application online. There will be no need to come to the office physically. The earliest vaccination slot will be shown online while the person is submitting the application. This new process will allow residents from any part of the country to apply for yellow fever vaccination through the NDMC website. There will be 50 vaccination slots available weekly," said a senior NDMC official.

Travellers can get vaccinated at the International Inoculation Centre on Mandir Marg in the council jurisdiction. The user will be provided with the application number and designated slot once the enrolment is complete.

Applicants can get vaccinated from 2 pm to 4 pm every Wednesday and Friday. Around 5000 people come to the NDMC centre for vaccination annually.

Travellers can also submit their applications to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. However, the MCD has no plan yet to go online for applications for vaccination. "There is no procedure in place to invite applications online. Applicants can get vaccinated at the centre located in Civil Lines," said a senior official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.

Though yellow fever is not prevalent [does not exist] in India, it can lead to an epidemic in case the virus is transmitted through humans from the affected countries to India. Yellow fever is a hemorrhagic disease which affects both monkeys and humans.

This is caused by a virus and transmitted to humans through bites of infected mosquitoes. So it is mandatory for Indians travelling to tropical and sub-tropical places in Africa and South America to be vaccinated.

[Availability of YF vaccine and ability to make appointments to receive the vaccine on line in India is good news. Anything to facilitate vaccination will lead to compliance. In the recent past, availability of the vaccine has been a problem in India, as have been the sale of fake YF vaccination certificates. YF vaccination in India in 2014 was fraught with difficulties. The vaccine was in short supply and fake YF vaccination cards were being sold illegally. Apparently, the vaccine shortage was overcome and the system streamlined.

The report above emphasizes the requirement for vaccination status to be recorded on official cards. Easy availability of vaccination centers to the traveling public will be essential to insure that individuals traveling to YF-endemic countries are, in fact, vaccinated.

The arrival of an individual returning home to India from a YF-endemic country viremic with YF virus could initiate an ongoing urban outbreak that could quickly become a very serious public health problem in India and beyond, since the vector mosquito is present in most of India and Southeast Asia, where YF virus is absent currently. Even so, India needs to have a contingency plan that can be swiftly initiated should a YF case appear in its national territory.
