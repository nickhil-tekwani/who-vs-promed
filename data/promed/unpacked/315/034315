Of 17 cases of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] infection in Snohomish County, 13
have been linked to a Lake Stevens restaurant, according to the
Snohomish Health District. The 13 people ate at Ixtapa Restaurant
between 2 and 13 Oct 2008, said Suzanne Pate, a health district
spokeswoman. People began feeling the onset of the illness between 7
and 17 Oct 2008.

The Mexican restaurant was closed Tuesday [21 Oct 2008] and is
cooperating with health inspectors, who will oversee its sanitizing
and disposal of opened food products, Pate said. The restaurant staff
declined to comment.

The cases were first reported last week [week of 13 Oct 2008]; 2
people were hospitalized briefly, but both are now recovering at
home. The 13 people who became ill after eating at the restaurant
range in age from 9 to 75. Health inspectors continue to interview
those who became ill to determine what sickened them.

Of the 4 others believed to have the infection, 3 have no connection
to the restaurant. The other has not yet been interviewed, Pate said.
Where they may have contacted in infection is unknown.

No new cases have been reported in Snohomish County since Mon 20 Oct 2008.
