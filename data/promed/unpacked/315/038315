[2] Diagnostic test

Alexander L. Greninger, Samia N. Naccache, Scot Federman, Guixia Yu, Placide Mbala, Vanessa Bres, Doug Stryke, Jerome Bouquet, Sneha Somasekar, Jeffrey M. Linnen, Roger Dodd, Prime Mulembakan, Bradley S. Schneider Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, Susan L. Stramer and Charles Y. Chiu. Rapid metagenomic identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples by real-time nanopore sequencing analysis.

Abstract
We report unbiased metagenomic detection of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from 4 human blood samples by MinION nanopore sequencing coupled to a newly developed, web-based pipeline for real-time bioinformatics analysis on a computational server or laptop (MetaPORE). At titers ranging from 7 log 10-8 log 10 copies per milliliter; reads to EBOV from 2 patients with acute hemorrhagic fever and CHIKV from an asymptomatic blood donor were detected within 4 to 10 min of data acquisition, while lower titer HCV virus 5 log 10 copies per milliliter) was detected within 40 min. Analysis of mapped nanopore reads alone, despite an average individual error rate of 24 [percent (range 8-49 percent), permitted identification of the correct viral strain in all 4 isolates, and 90 percent of the genome of CHIKV was recovered with 97-99 percent accuracy. Using nanopore sequencing, metagenomic detection of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples was performed within an unprecedented under-6 hour sample-to-answer turnaround time and in a timeframe amenable to actionable clinical and public health diagnostics.

[The rapid turnaround time is remarkable. It will be interesting to see whether the cost of mounting this detection technology and the level of technical expertise required to operate it is within the capability of the countries in which large numbers of CHIKV infections occur. - Mod.TY]
