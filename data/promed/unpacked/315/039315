A horse on a property near Lismore [New South Wales (NSW)] has died and the cause has been confirmed as Hendra virus.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries' [DPI] chief veterinary officer, Ian Roth, said the dead horse had been buried and the property will be placed in quarantine.

"The 8-year-old gelding was observed to be unwell on Wednesday [2 Sep 2015] and was off its food, before it collapsed," he said.

"A private vet collected samples for formal analysis, and the horse was euthanised yesterday [3 Sep 2015].

"Laboratory tests at Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Unit have confirmed the Hendra virus in the horse.

"Staff from Local Land Services are working closely with the property owners and closely monitoring a 2nd horse on the property.

"DPI can confirm there have been no movements off the property in the last 10 days."

NSW Health has been informed and will be following up with the attending vet and owner.

The horse had not been vaccinated for Hendra virus.

It is the 2nd Hendra case in NSW this year [2015], following another one at Murwillumbah in June.

"The colder months are usually the time of year when horses have become infected with Hendra in NSW in the past, however, it's important to note that Hendra virus can be seen at any time of year," Mr Roth said.

"Vaccination is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses.

"Horses should be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats.

"Do not place feed and water under trees, and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above.

"People should avoid touching sick horses, but if they need to come into direct contact ensure they are wearing gloves and a protective mask and avoid any contact with secretions from the animal."

Horse owners and vets are encouraged to download the latest information on Hendra virus from the DPI website (http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au), and if a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their vet immediately.

[This article clearly states that vaccine is the best protection. And it is. But according to the previous ProMED-mail post 20150807.3563450, there may be concerns about the frequency of administration of the vaccine.

This virus is aggressive in horses, has killed humans and has resulted in the death of some pets (they were euthanized, due to exposure to the virus and risk to the humans). So this virus requires extreme caution.

The article provides advice on keeping horses and their feed/water out from under trees and putting a cover over these as well.

Hopefully the 2nd horse will remain well. - Mod.TG
