The number of leptospirosis cases and deaths in the Philippines has increased, the Department of Health (DOH) disclosed [Thu 31 Aug 2017]. According to the latest disease surveillance report of the DOH, 910 leptospirosis cases were recorded from [1 Jan to 5 Aug 2017]. "This is 71.1 percent higher compared to [what was recorded in] the same period as last year [2016], which was 532," said the DOH report.

Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the _Leptospira interrogans_ bacteria. The leptospira bacteria [are] transmitted through wounds when in contact with floodwaters, vegetation, and moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, muscle pain, reddish-yellowish body discoloration, dark-colored urine, light stools, low urine output, and severe headache.

There [was] also a higher number of deaths; with 96 or a 10.55 [percent case] fatality rate. In the same period last year [2016], there were only 50 deaths or 9.40 [percent case] fatality rate.

The majority of the leptospirosis cases were recorded in the National Capital Region with 172 cases; Davao Region with 112 cases; Western Visayas with 98; Central Luzon with 80; and Eastern Visayas with 72. Regions with the highest increase in cases were Eastern Visayas with 620 percent increase; Davao Region with 558 percent increase; Central Visayas with 390 percent increase; Caraga with 240 percent increase; and Cagayan Valley with 103 percent increase.

[Currently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_the_Philippines. A map showing the regions of the Philippines can be found at: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Labelled_map_of_the_Philippines_-_Provinces_and_Regions.png.

Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.
