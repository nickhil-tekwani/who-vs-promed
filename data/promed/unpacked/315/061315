APPENDICITIS OUTBREAK - THAILAND (CAMBODIAN REFUGEES)

We are faced with a mysterious outbreak of appendicitis in a Cambodian
refugee camp in Trat province, Thailand.
This camp has a population of about 11700. From December 1997 - March 16,
1998, 85
Cambodian refugees were diagnosed with appendicitis and had appendectomies.
The most common symptom was acute abdominal pain at right lower quadrant
(100%) with mild to moderate degree of tenderness on physical examination.
The proportion of fever was low, approximately less than 20% and
temperature usually not higher than 38 degree Celsius. The history of onset
ranged from 2 days to 2 weeks before admission. Most
occurred among adults or older children. The median age was 31 years
(range: 12-49 years), and 80% were female.
The physicians in a community hospital adjacent to the camp tried to give
supportive treatment at the beginning but it did not work well, and some
went back to the hospital with appendiceal abscess. After appendectomy all
patients improved. The pathological finding from appendix specimens was
mild to moderate appendicitis with some gangrene. We have followed the
outbreak for 1 month with several blood, stool and intestinal lumen
cultures but all were no growth. The most likely diagnosis is bacterial
enteritis infection.
This group of refugees has eaten rice and canned fish as their main meal
since October until now, with a very low component of fiber in the diet.
All the canned fish is past its "consume by" date, some from October 1997
but mainly from January or February 1998. Together with the peak of
appendicitis cases in February and March, there is also a history of food
poisoning or even bloody diarrhea after ingestion of this canned fish.
>From a literature review we found some reports of _Yersinia
enterocolitica_ outbreaks which can mimic acute appendicitis, but it seems
to me that organism prefers the temperate zone, especially in the cooler
season. It has never been found in Thailand even though someone was
looking for it. In this outbreak we have also sent our specimens for the
28-day cold enrichment culture for _Y.enterocolitica_ and we are waiting
for the results.
We would like to share this experience with all of you who are interested,
and especially we are looking forward to any suggestions [about its
etiology].
