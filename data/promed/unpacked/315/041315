In early March 2002 public health authorities notified the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) of a case of human brucellosis. Blood cultures
performed by Counties Manukau District Health Board and reviewed by the
Institute of Environmental Science and Research confirmed the infection, and
biochemical profiling by MAF National Centre for Disease Investigation
suggests the isolate is _Brucella suis_. The isolate has been sent to
Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), Weybridge UK, for typing. VLA report it
is likely to be _Brucella suis_ biovar 3 (confirmation pending).
Counties Manukau District Health Board clinicians and Auckland Regional
Public Health Service believe on clinical and epidemiological grounds that
the case most likely acquired the infection in December 2001 in New Zealand.
At that time the case purchased 2 pigs that were killed and butchered in a
home-kill situation for consumption at 2 family feasts. The case had not
travelled outside New Zealand for 10 years. The case 10 years ago did visit a
country where _Brucella suis_ is endemic.
_Brucella suis_ has not been recorded in New Zealand livestock previously. At
the present time this remains the situation, as the results reported below
indicate.
A previous human case of _Brucella suis_ in New Zealand has been attributed
to infection acquired in the Pacific Islands (1), where the disease is known
to be present in some countries (2). Imported human brucellosis cases caused
by other species are also occasionally diagnosed.
Animal surveillance performed by MAF since notification of the human case
includes trace back of the 2 pigs to the point of purchase, from there to a
sale-yard, and to likely farms of origin. Imperfect information has required
classification of farms that supplied pigs to the sale-yard on probable sale
dates for the 2 pigs as either high, medium, or low likelihood of being the
farm of origin. So far 7 high, 3 medium, and 1 low-likelihood farms have been
visited, and all pigs over 6 months of age bled (n=97). Testing using the
competitive ELISA (sensitivity 90.8 percent, specificity of 96.6 percent) has
produced all negative results to date. Further activities planned for the
next week include testing pigs on the remaining 7 low-likelihood farms,
conducting farmer interviews to trace back suppliers for the high likelihood
farms, and trace-forward of likely sale-yard pen-mates of the 2 pigs.
All farms so far encountered in the tracing exercise have low numbers of
pigs, and pig farming is not the primary farm enterprise. These farms rear
small numbers of pigs, with numbers peaking in the pre-Christmas period. The
level of contact between pigs on farm now and last December must be
established.
Public health authorities in conjunction with clinicians are following up
people associated with the confirmed case, with the putative exposure event,
or possible farms of origin. The index case remains the only confirmed case.
If _Brucella suis_ is confirmed in livestock in New Zealand, MAF will notify
the Office International des Epizooties immediately.

[Brucellosis is also known as undulant fever in human beings because of the
waxing and waning of the fever. It has also been called Malta, or
Mediterranean, fever. Its insidious onset and nonspecific clinical features
make the disease difficult for physicians to recognize. The commonest
complications are osteoarticular (20 to 60 percent of cases) and genito-
urinary (2 to 20 percent). Untreated, the case fatality rate is up to 2
percent, usually from endocarditis, but specific antimicrobial chemotherapy
is available.
There are several _Brucella_ species, which are often associated with a
particular reservoir species, although the bacterium is not confined to those
species. _B. abortus_ is usually associated with cattle, _B. suis_ with pigs,
and _B. melitensis_ with goats.
Brucellosis can also be acquired from consumption of unpasteurized milk.
Brucellosis is caused by bacteria of the genus _Brucella_ and in animals is
characterized by abortion, retained placenta, and occasionally orchitis and
infection of the accessory reproductive glands in males. The disease is
present in many countries in the world. It primarily affects cattle, buffalo,
bison, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, elk, and sometimes horses. The disease in
humans is a serious public health concern.
Raw materials such as milk may transmit the disease to humans. When infected
droplets of the fluids involved in the birthing process splash into the eyes,
the mouth, or open cuts, people assisting those animals may develop
brucellosis.
The organism infecting goats presents the most serious disease in people. -
