Parasite estimated to have infected 1,300
Tests confirm 32 Brushy Creek residents have infection; outbreak linked to
four wells
************
An estimated 1,300 people in the Brushy Creek area have been infected with
_Cryptosporidium_, according to a survey conducted by the Texas Department
of Health.
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 32 residents of the Brushy Creek
Municipal Utility District have _Cryptosporidium_, the highly infectious
parasite that reproduces in animals' intestines, the Health Department said
Wednesday. The MUD has a population of about 10,000.
Since the outbreak began, about 500 residents have called the Williamson
County and Cities Health District reporting symptoms of the illness:
diarrhea, stomach cramping, vomiting and nausea.
After studying all the other known ways people catch the disease -- through
exposure to diapers, animals or swimming pools -- the Health Department was
able to attribute the spread of the parasite to one source: drinking water
from four Brushy Creek MUD wells that officials believe were contaminated
by a July 14 raw sewage spill.
The spill occurred when a City of Austin pumping station lost power during
a thunderstorm July 13. About 170,000 gallons of raw sewage backed up and
erupted out of a manhole just yards away from the edge of Brushy Creek.
Since the spill, 25 private wells have been found to be contaminated. On
July 21, four of the five Brushy Creek MUD wells were shut down, when the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission realized the wells showed
traces of _E. coli_ bacteria.
The presence of _E. coli_ was an indicator that contaminants such as
Cryptosporidium could have made their way into the drinking water supply,
said Tony Bennett of the conservation commission's water utility division.
He ordered the wells shut down, but that was a week after the spill. It was
during that time -- July 14 to 21 -- that residents of the MUD were exposed
to the parasite in their drinking water, health officials said.
Bergmire-Sweat said the outbreak's peak was July 21 and 22;
_Cryptosporidium_ has an incubation period of a week to 10 days. His office
interviewed residents from 189 households in the Brushy Creek MUD between
July 29 and 31. Based on those interviews, the department estimated that
about 1,300 people were infected by the parasite, which can be lethal for
elderly people and those whose immune systems are compromised [such as
cancer patients and people with HIV/AIDS.
Since the outbreak began, health officials have urged residents who have
had diarrhea to stay out of pools and water parks for at least two weeks
after the symptoms subside. Officials also are recommending that residents
wash their hands thoroughly and often to prevent the spread of the disease.
