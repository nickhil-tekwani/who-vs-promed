------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV), _Cacao swollen shoot CD virus_ (CSSCDV), and _Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus_ (CSSTAV) cause cacao swollen shoot disease (CSSD) in West Africa. During 2000-2003, leaf and shoot-swelling symptoms and rapid tree death were observed in cacao in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Molecular tests showed positive infection in only 50 to 60 per cent of symptomatic trees, suggesting the possible emergence of an unknown badnavirus.

The DNA virome was determined using Illumina-Hi Seq and Sanger sequencing. The viral coding and non-coding sequences, genome organization, and predicted conserved protein domains (CPDs) were characterized at the species level. The 21 CSSD-badnaviral genomes and RT-RNase H sequences shared 70 to 100 per cent and 72 to 100 per cent identity, respectively.

Three previously recognized West African cacao-infecting badnaviral species were identified, and a fourth, previously unidentified Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) proposed species, is described for the first time. The CRVV is a suspect causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype, however Koch's Postulates [proof of pathogenicity - Mod.DHA] have not been proven. To reconcile viral evolutionary with epidemiology considerations, more detailed information about CSSD-genomic variability is essential.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSD) caused by species of genus _Badnavirus_ can lead to severe crop losses. The viruses are thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains, from severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree, to no symptoms at all. The viruses are spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSD in Ghana led to a serious outbreak with more severe symptoms in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416). The possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain was considered and the new virus reported above may have been involved in the increase of virulence of CSSD. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire have signed an agreement to tackle the disease (see also news story below).
