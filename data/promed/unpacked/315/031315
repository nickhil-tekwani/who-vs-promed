Tens of new meningitis cases registered daily in Russian region
-----------------------------------------------
About 20 new serous viral meningitis cases have been registered daily
in the Khabarovsk Territory this week.
The regional government's press service told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday
[13 Sep 2006] that the number of affected people had increased to
1490 since the beginning of the disease outbreak. About 400 have been
hospitalized with enterovirus meningitis. Specialists of the
territorial Health Department described the situation as tense. New
cases have been registered in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and 3 adjacent areas.
Causes of the virus spread are bathing in the Amur river and open
reservoirs, contact and aerial infection transmission. Tests revealed
enterovirus ECHO-6, hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses in water
samples from the Amur and in sewage.
Sanitarians say the viral meningitis rate had been declining as a
result of anti-epidemic measures.
There have been no cluster cases in children's day stay centers.
Long-term observation has shown that outbreaks of serous viral
meningitis continue for 14 weeks. The morbidity situation is expected
to return to normal in late September 2006. The school year has not
begun for 1st to 8th graders so far. Children under 14 years are
forbidden to attend all mass functions to avoid exposure to crowds.

[This appears to be a continuation of a previously reported viral
meningitis outbreak. In the previous post, Mod.CP indicated that
human echovirus 30 was also involved. See the copy of his previous
comments below. - Mod.TY]
[Historically, echoviruses 6, 9, 11, 19, and 30 have been associated
with outbreaks of aseptic (serous) meningitis, accompanied by a rash
in the case of echoviruses 6 and 9. Fortunately, recovery is usually
complete within a few weeks, with risk of neurological complications
only in the very young.
In the current ICTV classification of viruses, ECHO-6 and ECHO-30 are
designated Human echovirus 6 and Human echovirus 30 and ranked as
serologically distinct members of the virus species _Human
enterovirus B_. - Mod.CP]
[Comment from PRO/RUS posting of article [2]: It is necessary to note
again that persons in affected areas should maintain preventive
measures, including good hygiene, disinfection and cleaning of areas,
water boiling, avoidance of cinemas and play gardens, extended school
vacations, quarantines etc. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for
enteroviral infection. - Corr.VM]
