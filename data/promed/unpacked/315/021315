U.S. CDC to Conduct Avian Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment Experiments
--------------------------------------------------
The alarm now sounds with increasing frequency and urgency: the world
could be on the brink of an influenza pandemic sparked by the highly
virulent avian flu strain ravaging poultry stocks in Southeast Asia,
experts fear. But can that virus -- known as avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus -- actually acquire the ability to spread easily to and among
people? And if it can, how likely is that dreaded event to occur?
Early in the new year [2005], U.S. scientists will begin experiments
that should provide some answers to those questions. The work won't
indicate how soon a pandemic might start. And the findings can't be
taken as a guarantee the virus will evolve as the science predicts.
"Like a lot of science, it's an imitation of nature," explains Dr.
Frank Plummer, scientific director of Canada's National Microbiology
Laboratory. "It doesn't replicate exactly what happens. But I think
it gives you an idea of the propensity of the H5N1 virus to do this
thing."
The researchers, from the Influenza Branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, will [hybridise] avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus and human influenza viruses in a process known as
[sub-unit] reassortment. Viable offspring will be tested in animals
thought to be good surrogates for humans, to see whether the viruses
can infect, can be transmitted easily from infected animals to
healthy ones, and to note the severity of disease each provokes. In
other words, the CDC researchers will be deliberately engineering
viruses of pandemic potential. It's high-risk but crucial work, the
influenza community insists. "It's a dangerous experiment," admits
Dr. Robert Webster, a world-renowned expert on influenza based at St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Still, Webster
has no doubt the work needs doing. "Science must gain a better
understanding of the menacing H5N1 virus."
The World Health Organization has been pleading for months for
qualified research facilities -- of which there are few -- to
undertake this work. WHO would like to be able to put some kind of
odds on how likely the avian H5N1 virus is to become a pandemic
strain and how deadly -- or not -- avian H5N1 reassortment viruses
might be in humans. If none of the hybrids cause severe disease, the
organization might feel comfortable with stepping down its current
high level of alert, explains Dr. Klaus Stohr, director of the WHO's
global influenza program. On the other hand, if CDC researchers
easily produce highly transmissible and lethal hybrids, "that would
certainly add to our concern. It's about quantifying risk. Currently
we do risk-speculation, but we want to do risk-assessment. And that
will give us scientific evidence on the possible outcome on the
emergence of a pandemic virus," Stohr says. "It will give us an
opportunity to predict the probability, because we will have an
understanding on the number of reassortment viruses which are viable,
the percentage of those that are viable which are then transmissible,
and also on the percentage of those which are viable, transmissible
and pathogenic. And how pathogenic they are."
The CDC researchers will work in high containment level 3-enhanced
labs, says Dr. Nancy Cox, the leading influenza authority, who heads
the agency's Influenza Branch. The labs have special features
designed to protect both the health of the workers and the world
against a viral escape. "It's not typical level 3," Cox says, adding
the lab workers are "extremely cognizant of the danger of the H5
viruses."
Still, lab accidents happen. Since SARS was contained in mid-2003, 4
lab workers in Asia have infected themselves with the potentially
deadly disease, and one spread it beyond the walls of the laboratory.
Earlier in 2004, a Russian lab worker died after accidentally
infecting herself with Ebola virus. Given that reality, some groups
have raised concern that work like this should not be done. "If it's
being done by CDC, then the good thing about that is that safety
measures will properly be in place," said Dr. Albert Osterhaus, of
the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam.
The CDC researchers will mix genes from the avian H5N1 virus with
genes from circulating strains of human influenza virus to see which
combinations produce viruses that grow and infect. Cox says influenza
A (H3N2) virus, the strain that has been responsible for most human
influenza in recent years, will be the 1st priority. However,
Southeast Asia has recently seen activity with influenza A (H1N1)
virus, a mild modern descendant of the strain that caused the Spanish
flu of 1918. So the CDC has been sequencing H1N1 viruses recently
isolated in Thailand to be able to work with it as well.
Reassortment studies can be performed 2 ways, she explains.
Scientists can use reverse genetics, a procedure that allows them to
custom-tailor a virus with a predetermined constellation of genes
from each parent virus. The other alternative is what Cox describes
as the classical way -- simultaneously infecting tissue culture with
H5N1 and H3N2 viruses and seeing what results. That approach is more
time-consuming and laborious, but more closely mimics evolution of
influenza viruses in nature. "We will probably be using a combination
of the 2 different methods. I think there are advantages and
disadvantages to each," says Cox, who believes her team may have some
preliminary results within a couple of months of beginning the work.
CDC researchers have already made hybrid viruses with H5N1, using
strains of the virus isolated after it 1st caused human infections in
1997 in Hong Kong. "Some gene combinations could be produced and
others could not," is all Cox will reveal of that as-yet unpublished
work.

[These projected experiments are to be welcomed for 2 reasons; if
negative, they may allay some of the hysteria associated with recent
predictions of the imminence of a new influenza pandemic, and if
positive, they might facilitate prediction of the likely antigenicity
of avian-human virus hybrids and accelerate rational vaccine design.
