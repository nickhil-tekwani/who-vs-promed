As of [Mon 29 Oct 2018], the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) has received reports of 432 suspected cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in white-tailed deer so far in 2018.

EHD appears to be at low-to-moderate levels in counties on or near the Illinois River, extending from Schuyler County to the southwest through Bureau County to the northeast. Peoria County has had the worst of it, with 77 cases, followed closely by Fulton County with 71 cases.

Scattered suspected cases of EHD have also been reported across central and southern Illinois, with slightly higher levels reported in the southeastern Illinois counties of Lawrence (35 cases), Crawford (15 cases), Jasper (13 cases), and Richland (10 cases). In all, reports have come from 49 counties (see map attached).

EHD virus has been confirmed in tissue samples submitted for testing from Cass, Edwards, Macon, Peoria, Putnam, Rock Island, and Sangamon counties (serotyping is still pending).

The worst year for EHD in Illinois was 2012, when 2968 cases were reported from 87 counties. In 2013, the IDNR received reports of 1224 cases from 64 counties. EHD was virtually absent in 2014 and at low levels in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

The IDNR continues to ask landowners, hunters, and concerned citizens to be on the lookout for dead or dying deer and to report suspected EHD cases to their local IDNR field office, or to the Wildlife Disease and Invasive Species Program (WDIS). IDNR is especially interested in sick or recently dead animals, as staff may attempt to collect tissue samples in order to confirm the presence of the EHD virus.

Contact information for local IDNR biologists is available online at http://web.extension.illinois.edu/wildlife/professionals.cfm.

Contact the WDIS Program at 815-369-2414 or by email at <doug.dufford@illinois.gov>. Please provide your name and contact information, as well as the county, number of dead/sick deer, sex of the deer (if known), age (fawn or adult), and the specific location of the deer (distance/direction from the nearest town or intersection of 2 roads).

EHD is a viral disease of white-tailed deer causing localized die-offs when conditions are favorable for transmission. Infected animals develop a high fever, and dead animals often are found near water sources. Hunters may encounter deer killed by EHD when they go into the woods during the fall deer hunting seasons. EHD outbreaks typically end when freezing weather kills the insects that spread the virus. While often fatal to deer, EHD is not hazardous to humans or pets. EHD has been shown to affect livestock, so producers are encouraged to be vigilant.

The virus is transmitted between deer by a midge that hatches from muddy areas along lakes/ponds and streams/rivers. Although EHD is observed somewhere in Illinois every year, cases are more numerous during hot and dry summer weather conditions, presumably because receding water levels create these muddy areas, providing breeding sites for the midges. Limited water resources also congregate deer at remaining watering sites, creating conditions favorable for disease transmission.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is not the same as bluetongue virus (BTV). While these diseases are similar, there is a difference in the serotype.

Many cervids can be infected with EHDV, and clinical cases have been reported in some species. White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) are highly susceptible and are known to become ill after infection with serotypes 1, 2, 6, and 7. They are probably susceptible to all 7 serotypes. Clinical cases have also been reported occasionally in other species, including mule deer (_O. hemionus_), pronghorn (_Antilocapra americana_), North American elk (_Cervus elaphus nelson_), and pygmy brocket deer (_Mazama nana_).

Outbreaks and sporadic cases caused by various serotypes, including EHDV-1, EHDV-2, EHDV-6, and EHDV-7, have been reported in cattle, although subclinical infections seem to be much more common.

EHDV is transmitted by biting midges in the genus _Culicoides spp_, which act as biological vectors. These midges can fly short distances of 1-2 km [about 0.6-1.2 mi], but they can be blown much farther by wind. Relatively little is known about which species of _Culicoides_ are the primary vectors in each area, although some (e.g., the North American species _C. sonorensis_) are proven to be competent vectors in the laboratory. While mosquitoes or other blood-sucking insects might theoretically be able to transmit this virus mechanically, and there is one report of virus isolation (EHDV-4) from 2 _Anopheles_ mosquitoes in Asia, such insects are thought to have little or no role in the epidemiology of this disease. Iatrogenic transmission has not been reported, but it is also theoretically possible.

Clinical cases in white-tailed deer range from peracute illness, with death often occurring within 36 hours, to a more chronic course with animals remaining ill for several weeks. Some deer are found dead with few or no clinical signs. In other cases, there may be fever, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, stiffness/lameness, respiratory distress, and severe and rapid edema of the head and neck. Swelling of the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, and swelling and hyperemia of the conjunctiva, are common. Ulcers and erosions in the oral cavity can result in excessive salivation and nasal discharge, which may both be blood-tinged. Diarrhea and dehydration have also been seen. Some animals develop progressive abnormalities in blood clotting, with extensive hemorrhages in many tissues including the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Deaths are common during the acute stage of the disease. Surviving animals may have ulcers, erosions, scars, and other damage to the lining of the rumen and omasum, resulting in prolonged lethargy and inappetence, and some animals become emaciated. There may also be breaks or rings in the hooves caused by growth interruptions, resulting in lameness. In severe cases, animals slough the hoof wall or toe; some of these deer may be found crawling on their knees or chest.

It is the time of year, frequently near the beginning of deer hunting season in many areas, when we start to see this disease. In some years it has started earlier. However, a hard-killing frost tends to stop the disease from further spread, as the vectors die in the freezing weather.

While the northern states may groan at the thought of cold weather, some in the south may be glad to get a little cool weather. Either way, all will appreciate being rid of the vector transmitting this disease.
