Information on the 1st case of Zika fever virus in Sao Paulo state
------------------------------------------------------------------
On 19 May [2015] the Instituto Adolfo Lutz announced the results of an RT-PCR test positive for Zika [virus]. The patient is a 52 year old male resident of Sumare [Sao Paulo state] without a travel history [outside of the area] during the 15 days before the onset of symptoms on 10 Mar 2015.

To date, the Ministry of Health has confirmed, based on laboratory criteria, 16 cases of Zika [virus infection] in the country -- 8 cases in Bahia and 8 in Rio Grande do Norte.

Zika fever is a disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKAV), an arbovirus of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family); phylogenetically related to the viruses: dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), St Louis encephalitis (SLEV), and West Nile virus (WNV). This virus [Zika] was isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda (hence the reason for naming the virus).

The principal means of transmission is via vectors, through bite of mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_. In urban areas the main vector is _Ae. aegypti.

Currently, Sao Paulo state has DENV circulating and imported cases of chikungunya, both [viruses] transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. Therefore, it is important that health services remain aware and attentive to cases of suspected dengue, carrying out recommended clinical management. Until there is decentralization of laboratory diagnosis at the state level, the Epidemiological Surveillance Center will carry out monitoring suspected cases of Zika based on the existing system of surveillance for dengue and chikungunya.

[The case reported here is the 1st locally acquired one to be confirmed in Sao Paulo state. Surprised? Anyway, in this context in that the introduction of the virus [Zika] now is confirmed (see below), and given the high rates of vector infestation in Brazil as well as the high degree of mobility of people, it was just a matter of time -- [only] a little time. But very, very probably this is not the only, much less the 1st, case [of Zika virus infection].

In a dengue epidemic of current proportions, where 10s of thousands of cases have been reported (as dengue) and confirmed by clinical and epidemiological criteria (such as dengue), it is impossible to estimate how many cases of Zika virus [infections] there are and where they would be taking place [in the absence of laboratory confirmation. - Mod.TY]. Given current knowledge, Zika virus infections [like dengue and chikungunya virus infections] present as an acute febrile syndrome with rash, in general, self-limited and possibly with rare complications. It is difficult to clinically differentiate suspected cases of Zika [virus infections] among the thousands of suspected dengue cases. It is the same with chikungunya, which has not occurred in most states of Brazil (or perhaps the cases that may exist have not been identified ...) during the current epidemic of dengue, even when exhibiting clinical elements that allow suspicion of the less complicated [chikungunya virus infection] (with the presence of articular manifestations in a significant proportion of cases) that can perfectly well have already landed in states that are not [currently] on the list of states with locally acquired cases.

The recent identification of Zika virus [in Brazil] makes the current epidemiological scenario of arbovirus diseases become even more complex, and brings numerous questions and challenges about which is the best model, the best surveillance strategy [to use]. As for control there are no innovations, even with the ever closer prospect of one or more vaccines against dengue, so a more efficient control of _Aedes_ is mandatory -- is the "backbone", not only for control of dengue, but for chikungunya and now for the "debutante" Zika [viruses]. - Mod.RNA]

[The arrival of Zika virus in Brazil, in areas of active transmission of dengue and chikungunya, complicates surveillance and the need for adequate laboratory support to make differential diagnoses, as Mod.RNA notes. I suppose that one might argue that the cost of decentralization of diagnostic laboratory capability to the state or municipal level is not justified, since treatment of patients is supportive and essentially the same. This argument changes as soon as an effective dengue virus vaccine becomes available and is applied broadly in the population. Epidemiologists will contend that it is essential to know which viruses are being transmitted in the field.
