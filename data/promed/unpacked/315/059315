A total of 6 cases of meningococcal disease in as many weeks around the
MidCentral health district [of the North Island] have prompted a warning
from medical officer of health Jill McKenzie to take symptoms seriously.

While the MenzB vaccination blitz that reached more than 1 million children
and young people in 2005 helped stop New Zealand's epidemic of the disease,
the cases presenting now have been caused by other strains of the bacteria.
All of those affected were aged under 20, and all of them were recovering
as a result of being diagnosed and receiving antibiotics in time. Dr
McKenzie said it was the time of year when meningococcal cases were most
likely to occur, but in the district's best year in the past 5 years, 2007,
there was only one case during the whole year. In 2005, there were 15.

This season's spike in numbers means that people should be alert to the
symptoms and get help without delay. At first the symptoms can be confused
with flu, but are more severe, and a tell-tale bruise-like rash that will
not fade when pressed develops. "Anyone with these symptoms should be taken
to a doctor immediately," she said. "Early recognition of the symptoms, and
treatment with antibiotics, is the key to stopping the potentially serious
outcomes from blood poisoning (septicaemia) or meningitis (inflammation of
the spinal cord and brain lining)."

The bugs that cause the disease can live quite harmlessly in the back of
the nose or throat of well people, and are passed on to others through
spit. The key to prevention is not sharing spit. People should not share
lip balms, drinks or drink bottles or toothbrushes. People most at risk are
those under 20, including the very young, and people who live closely
together. Maori and Pacific communities are more frequently affected.

Around New Zealand there were 25 cases of meningococcal disease in August
[2009], including just one in MidCentral.

[Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_,
which is carried in the nasopharynx. The peak incidence of invasive
meningococcal disease is between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, and
ranges from mild disease to fulminant septicemia that can lead to death
within a few hours of onset. Immunosuppressed individuals, those with
complement deficiency or hyposplenism and those living in crowded
conditions (for example, barracks and dormitories) are at increased risk of
developing meningococcal disease.

There are at least 13 serogroups of _N. meningitidis_ based on the
antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease due to
serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common. There are significant
differences in the geographic distribution of serogroups. For instance,
meningococci of serogroups B and C cause most disease episodes in Europe,
while serogroup A is commoner in China and among Haj pilgrims. In the
"meningitis belt" of Africa, group A and C meningococci cause most of the
outbreaks. Group W135 meningococci have caused several recent epidemics in
sub-Saharan Africa and during the Haj.

For about 10 years, beginning in 1991, meningococcal disease activity that
was due primarily to a particular strain of serogroup B increased in New
Zealand (<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). During the
outbreak, the number of cases grew to about 400 cases each year, with 80 of
every 100 cases caused by the epidemic strain. However, the news release
above states that the current cases in the MidCentral district of New
Zealand are caused by other "strains" of _N. meningitidis_.

Meningococcal vaccines that use serogroup-specific meningococcal capsular
polysaccharide as the immunogen exist for serogroups A, C, W135, and Y.
Development of a vaccine against group B meningococci has proven difficult,
because its capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic and antibodies
elicited may cross-react with neural tissue
(<http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/160/10/5028>).

Some countries (for example, New Zealand, Cuba, Norway, and Chile)
developed vaccines against local strains of serogroup B meningococci that
use strain-specific outer membrane vesicle protein rather than capsular
polysaccharide. One such vaccine, the New Zealand MeNZB vaccine only
protects against the specific outbreak New Zealand B strain, and will not
protect against meningococcal A, C, Y, or W135 or other strains of B
(<http://www.moh.govt.nz/meningococcal>). From 2004-2006, a 3-dose MeNZB
vaccination campaign in New Zealand reached about one million people, from
infants to age 20, and was associated with an end to the outbreak
(<http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/49142.php>), which some have
specifically attributed to use of the MeNZB vaccine. Novartis is also
developing a polyvalent serogroup B vaccine that contains multiple
bacterial surface proteins believed to be found in most meningococcal B
strains responsible for the disease globally
(<http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2008/1218899.shtml>).

District health boards (DHBs) in New Zealand are organisations responsible
for ensuring health and disability services to populations within a defined
geographical area. MidCentral DHB's district stretches across the North
Island of New Zealand from the west to the east coast with a population of
165 000
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Health_Board_(New_Zealand)>). An
outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or more
confirmed or probable cases during a period of 3 months or less, resulting
in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons,
which is about 10 times greater than the usual occurrence (about 1 per 100
000) (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). The attack
rate of 6 cases of meningococcal disease in MidCentral in 6 weeks in a
population of 165 000 is less than what is recognized as an outbreak of
meningococcal disease.
