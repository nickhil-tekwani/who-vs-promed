China arrests 6 in latest melamine milk powder scare
----------------------------------------------------
Executives at another Chinese dairy company have been arrested for
allegedly producing milk powder tainted with the industrial
contaminant melamine.

According to media reports, 7 people have been arrested in connection
with the discovery of 26 tonnes of tainted powder at the Jinfulia
Dairy Company, based in Yangquan city, Shanxi province. Among the
arrested was the general manager at the plant.

State media reports indicate that the milk powder in question was
from the same batch that should have been destroyed following the
2008 scandal, which resulted in 300 000 cases of illness and 6 deaths.

Melamine, which is an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of
plastics, was added to thousands of tonnes of watered-down milk
products in 2008 to artificially boost protein levels in one of the
most high profile contamination cases in recent years.

China has since struggled to improve its food safety record, but
despite high profile arrests and tougher laws, safety scares have
continued to emerge.

In the case of melamine, the Ministry of Commerce had ordered the
destruction of all contaminated product after the 2008 scare.
However, some of the tainted material has made it out onto the market.

In August [2010], police made 6 arrests at 2 locations related to the
resale of the contaminated product. 3 people were arrested at a
factory in the Qinghai Province, accused of shipping tainted powder
to the neighbouring Gansu province. The other 3 were apprehended
under suspicion of hiding tainted milk powder that should have been
destroyed in 2008 and then selling it to the Qinghai plant.

Earlier in the month [September 2010], the Chinese government
threatened harsher treatment for those found guilty of food safety
violations. A notice jointly issued by the Supreme Court, the
Ministry of Justice, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate said the
death penalty should be imposed in severe cases of wrongdoing.

[The July 2010 ProMED-mail posting 20100709.2306 indicated:

"In June 2010, authorities found 64 tons of raw materials for making
milk powder and 12 tons of finished powder tainted with melamine at a
factory in the far western province of Qinghai, the official Xinhua
News Agency said. In a separate case, they said they seized about
1000 packets of tainted milk powder in the northeastern province of
Jilin. Xinhua said the owner and a production manager from Dongyuan
Dairy Factory in Qinghai have been detained after tests showed some
of their products had 500 times the legal limit for melamine. The
contamination was initially discovered because Dongyuan sent samples
of the powder, which they had purchased from Hebei province, to a lab
for testing so they could figure out how much to dilute it before
selling it, Xinhua said, citing police.

The report said some of the material was believed to be old powder
that should have been destroyed in 2008 amid a crackdown on tainted milk."

This particular article has a similar feel to what was previously
posted. One is left to potentially conclude that there is more
tainted product not as yet destroyed than authorities were led to
believe at the time. - Mod.TG]
