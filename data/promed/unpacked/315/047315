I hope that chlorine is not generally used in treatment plants for the
sterilisation of particulate loaded waste water. In general the community
seems to be keen to reduce chlorinated compounds in the environment as far
as possible, and certainly not discharge them directly into watercourses.

The presence of salmonella in treated sludge would not in itself be a
problem unless the levels were high enough to cause concern. I use about 2MG
[2 million gallons] of treated sewage sludge on my farm and have been
assured that levels are several orders of magnitude below the level that
might cause problems.
I would have some concern in case there was a HUMAN endemic EC that affected
cattle in the same way that cattle EC O157 affects humans. A case of the
biter bit.
