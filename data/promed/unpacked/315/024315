Suspected Acute Hemorrhagic Fever in the Republic of the Congo -- update
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood samples taken from one of the suspected cases in Sangha Region,
Republic of Congo, tested negative for several viral haemorrhagic
fevers (Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Arenavirus).
Additional laboratory investigations are ongoing. The tests were
carried out by the Centre International de Recherches Medicales de
Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon. Samples from the other 3 suspected fatal
cases could not be obtained .

The negative laboratory findings from this suspected case do not
exclude that an acute haemorrhagic fever outbreak has occurred, or is
still ongoing. The Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners continue
to strengthen surveillance activities in humans and the wildlife
sector, and to implement control measures including active case
search, infection control, and social mobilization.

More than 40 people who have had direct contact with the suspected
cases will continue to be monitored for a period of 21 days from the
last date of their exposure (19 Jun 2010).

[Previously the WHO reported 5 suspected cases, including 3 deaths, of
an acute haemorrhagic fever from Mokouangonda, an isolated forest
village of about 100 inhabitants in Mokoke district, Region of Sangha,
in northern Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville). So far some possible
hemorrhagic fevers have been excluded, but no positive diagnosis has
been made. Further information is awaited.
