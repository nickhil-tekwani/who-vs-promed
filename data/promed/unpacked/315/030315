The illness chikungunya has become an epidemic in Padang City. The
illness was found in 77 cases in 3 outbreak areas. As prevention
efforts, the Health Service did fogging (fumigation) and provided
medical treatment to the sufferers.

The cases were found in the Jati Koto Tinggi District, Padang East
Subdistrict (34 cases), in the Rawang District (6 cases), and 37
cases in the Ranah District, Padang South Subdistrict.

This illness was caused by chikungunya virus spread by _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito bites. Prevention efforts were carried out with
insecticide fogging in the 3 outbreak regions.

"Fogging is not the solution to resolve the problem of this illness.
This is because of the characteristics of fogging. Only prevention
efforts [are effective long-term], so [fogging] must be followed by
increasing the cleanliness of the residence environment to interrupt
the breeding cycle of these mosquitoes," said Efrida Aziz, the Health
Service head of Padang City.

Dozens of residents in the Krasak Village, Kecamatan Brebes,
Kabupaten Brebes, were attacked by chikungunya [virus]. They
experienced high fever and painful joints. Moreover, some residents
could not walk.

This illness has been spreading very quickly. At this time, more than
20 residents have been attacked by the illness.

The residents have asked the government to do fogging in order to
eradicate mosquitoes, the vector of this illness.

Around the last 2 months, dozens of Krasak villagers were also
attacked by a similar illness. Nevertheless up to this time, the
residents have not yet gotten help with fogging from the government.

The Section Head Kesehatan of the Brebes Regency, Laode Budiono, said
this is not the 1st time that there have been cases of chikungunya in
the Krasak Village.

Chikungunya also had been found in the other areas, such as the
Siasem Village, Kecamatan Wanasari, as well as the Siwuluh Village
and Petunjungan in the Bulakamba Subdistrict.

Chikungunya illness in Pekalongan City is now regarded as an
extraordinary [emergency] incident. More than 100 residents in 5
districts have been attacked by the illness spread by _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes.

The 5 [affected] areas include the Tirto District, Tegalrejo, Krapyak
Lor (Slamaran), Jenggot, and Panjang Wetan.

To prevent [chikungunya] from becoming an epidemic, the Head of the
Health Section of Pekalongan City, Dr Dwi Heri Wibawa, did fogging or
fumigation at several locations that were pointed out by residents
who often suffered the illness resulting from chikungunya virus.

Besides this, the Health Service has made an effort to inform and
appeal to the residents so that cleanliness will be maintained,
especially for the eradication of mosquito breeding sites.

[The Jawa Pos
<http://www.jawapos.co.id/index.php?act=detail_radar&id=184175&c=111>
of Fri 7 Dec 2007 reported that after becoming an epidemic in the
Pekalongan City, chikungunya illness also attacked the residents of
Batang Regency. At least 97 residents were found to suffer from the
illness that was spread by _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito bites. Interestingly, this is the 1st explicit implication
of _Ae albopictus_ as a chikungunya virus vector in this outbreak in
Java. - Mod.TY]

Four cases of chikungunya were detected in Salt Lake on Thursday [6
Dec 2007], taking the number of people affected by the virus in the
township to 38.

Officials fear thousands are affected by the virus in Salt Lake and
its adjoining areas.

The patients diagnosed with chikungunya on Thursday [6 Dec 2007] were
from Nazrul Pally and Baro Kapat, in ward 14 of Bidhannagar Municipality.

In Calcutta, 7 people have been affected by the virus since March
[2007], but no fresh cases were reported on Thursday [6 Dec 2007].

"Thousands may have been affected by chikungunya in North
24-Parganas, though only a handful have been admitted to hospital,"
said a health department official. "More than 2.5 lakh people [250
000] in the district have suffered from chikungunya and other viral
infections over the past 6 months."

Health officials visited the affected areas in Salt Lake. "We are
asking people to prevent water accumulation in their neighbourhoods,"
an official said. "Anti-larvae repellents [larvacides?] are being sprayed."

Similar measures are also being taken the city, said a Calcutta
Municipal Corporation official.

Chikungunya is a relatively rare form of viral fever caused by an
alphavirus spread through _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. In October
2006, the disease was detected in 15-odd villages in Baduria and
Swarupnagar, in North 24-Parganas.

Chikungunya was 1st reported in the state [West Bengal] 44 years ago.
According to the May 1980 issue of the journal of the Indian Council
for Medical Research, around 200 people died of the disease in
Calcutta in 1963. Lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of people suffered
from the infection.

"Chikungunya is usually not fatal, though patients may die if there
is a coexistence of other viral infections, like dengue," said an expert.

[It is not clear from this last statement whether there is a
contention that concomitant infection of an individual by both dengue
and chikungunya viruses, which seems an unlikely event, can be fatal.
Perhaps the statement means fatalities may occur with dengue virus
infections in areas where both viruses happen to be circulating concurrently.

India. An interactive map showing the location of the city of Salt
