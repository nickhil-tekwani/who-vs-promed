Russia: Number of Hepatitis A Patients Rises to 547 in Tver Region
-----------------------------------------------
The number of people suffering from hepatitis A in southwestern parts of
Russia's Tver region has reached 547 people, including 142 children,
sources from a special center to look into the hepatitis outbreak told
Itar-Tass here on Mon 13 Jun 2005.
34 people, including 13 children, have fallen ill over the past 24 hours.
31 people have been hospitalized in the Rzhev district, and another 3
people have been hospitalized in the Zubtsov district. However, no new
hepatitis cases have been registered in the Olenino district.
"We are seeing a tendency towards a decline in the number of patients, but
it is a weekend now and it is difficult to say that exactly," the sources
said. "Let us wait for another couple of days," they added.
Hepatitis A is a dangerous infectious disease, which can affect people of
any age. It is transmitted through food or water and is often spread due to
poor sanitary or personal hygiene.

[The number of cases of hepatitis A infection continues to rise, with the
proportion of children affected continuing to be in the region of 25
percent. The role of contaminated beer as the source of the outbreak
remains circumstantial and has yet to be confirmed by isolation of
infectious virus from that source. - Mod.CP]
