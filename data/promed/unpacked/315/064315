One of France's leading scientific advisers on BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, mad cow disease) has admitted her country has thousands of
undiagnosed cases, and infected animals could have entered the food chain.
Professor Jeanne Brugere-Picoux, of the Agence Francaise pour la Securite
Sanitaire et Alimentaire (AFSSA) - the authority advising the French
government British beef is still dangerous - said although France has
officially registered 75 cases of BSE in the past 10 years, she believed
the real figure to be "far higher than that".
BSE-infected carcasses could have entered Britain. More than 12 000 tons
were exported to Britain in 1996 and 8000 in 1997, the last year for which
figures are available. More than 3000 live French cattle have been imported
since 1996.
Brugere-Picoux's admission comes as legal wrangles continue over France's
continued refusal to lift its ban on British beef. The French government is
expected to launch a counter suit against the European commission in the
European Court of Justice tomorrow.
Although Brugere-Picoux backs the decision to exclude British beef, she is
increasingly alarmed by events at home. France's 3rd case of variant CJD
(nvCJD) - the type linked to eating BSE-infected beef, which has killed 48
people in Britain - was recently confirmed in a 36-year-old Parisian woman.
Although the victim had never been to Britain, the French health ministry
has insisted she caught the disease by eating infected British beef or
French animals fed eaten British feed. It refused to consider France may
have its own BSE problem.
A court case last month, however, suggested otherwise. Hubert Andre, a
farmer from St Die in eastern France, was given a 2-month suspended prison
sentence and BPS 4000 fine for illegally killing a cow diagnosed by a local
veterinarian as having BSE. Under French regulations, the entire herd
should have been destroyed immediately. Andre's animals survive, despite
his conviction.
Brugere-Picoux believes the policy of destroying herds is scaring off
French farmers from declaring cases. "The first inkling they have that
something is not right, off goes the animal to the abattoir. It then enters
the food chain,"she said.
Another government adviser dismissed French agriculture ministry claims
they "take no risks whatsoever". Professor Noelle Pons told a seminar
organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO): "In France people are
still eating beef brain and bone marrow on bread." Both experts are calling
for a new European agency to carry out random BSE testing.

I am very surprised by the article of THE SUNDAY TIMES
[According to the article:..One of France's leading scientific advisers on
BSE has admitted that her country has thousands of undiagnosed cases, and
infected animals could have entered the food chain.
I HAVE NEVER SAID THIS!
[According to the article: Professor Jeanne Brugere-Picoux, of the Agence
Francaise pour la Securite Sanitaire et Alimentaire (AFFSA)... - I am a
professor in the national veterinary school of Alfort and not of AFSSA,
[the authority that has advised the French government that British beef is
still dangerous - said that although France has officially registered 75
cases of BSE in the past 10 years, she believed the real figure to be "far
higher than that".
I have given the example of Switzerland:
In Switzerland, they changed, last year, the system of detection of BSE,
with the application of the prionics test on different cows, such as those
at slaughter in emergency situations, animals found dead and controls in
slaughterhouses. They began last March and found nearly 50 cases (half of
them without clinical signs and only with the test) (in 1998 the number of
cases of BSE was 14). Now in Switzerland, the butchers who sell the beef
certified as BSE negative with this test get an increased number of customers.
Now that very sensitive tests are available, especially [the French test,
the application of these tests cannot be avoided in all countries of EC.
Switzerland is given [as an example of the interest in the tests, because
epidemiological survey is not based only on clinical signs.
[The article states: Although Brugere-Picoux backs the decision to exclude
British beef, she is increasingly alarmed by events at home.
No I was not alarmed because BSE is very sporadic in France and not
enzootic, like in the UK. [According to the article: France's 3rd case of
variant CJD ... There are only 2 cases of nvCJD in France
[The Sunday Times continued: Although the victim had never been to Britain,
the French health ministry has insisted that she caught the disease by
eating infected British beef or French animals fed British feed. It refused
to consider that France may have its own BSE problem.
I know that BSE is a political problem but I am very surprised by the
journalist who changed so dramatically my purpose. Is it because I am a
French scientist who said that it is too early to lift the ban on British
beef (we must wait to 2001)? (I remember that the interview was for the
Sunday Times of the 19 of December and not for the 2 of January!).
[The article stated: A court case last month, however, suggested otherwise.
Hubert Andre, a farmer from St Die in eastern France, was given a two-month
suspended prison sentence and a BPS 4,000 fine for illegally killing a cow
diagnosed by a local veterinarian as having BSE.
It was not a "diagnosis" but only a suspicion (without possibility of
confirmation). Under French regulations, the entire herd should have been
destroyed immediately.
[From the article: Andre's animals survive, despite his conviction.
Brugere-Picoux believes the policy of destroying herds is scaring off
French farmers from declaring cases. "The first inkling they have that
something is not right, off goes the animal to the abattoir. It then enters
the food chain," she said.
Yes, perhaps it is possible but only for [a few cases (like in other
countries). The problem is not only linked to the destruction of all the
herd. The possibility of under-declaration is also suspected in UK. And the
new system of survey in Switzerland is a good demonstration of possibility
of under-declaration but essentially underline the difficulty of the
clinical diagnosis of BSE.
[According to the article: Another government adviser dismissed French
agriculture ministry claims that they "take no risks whatsoever". Professor
Noelle Pons told a seminar organised by the World Health Organisation: "In
France people are still eating beef brain and bone marrow on bread."
In France, only the brain of calfs aged under 6 months can be eaten, like
in UK. We do not eat bone marrow but FAT MARROW (without dangerous cells).
[From the article: Both experts are calling for a new European agency to
carry out random BSE testing.
Perhaps, like in Switzerland, an increased number of positive animals will
be found in France if we apply the tests but it will be the same in other
countries, particularly in UK where the disease involved nearly 2000
animals (and where no traceability of epidemiology existed before 1996).
It was difficult to control the publication of an interview with
journalists (problem of time) but the text of the SUNDAY TIMES is really
very far from my opinion. I hope that I will obtain a "droit de reponse" in
this newspaper.

This news story is news only in that it is the first time top French
scientists have gone public in the matter, but the substance of what
Professor Jeanne Brugere-Picoux of AFSSA is quoted as saying has long been
self-evident.
For example 14 Feb 1998:
"Over 55 000 breeding cattle were exported from the UK (United Kingdom) to
other EU (European Union) countries between 1985 and 1989. It has been
calculated (Schreuder, Straub and Wilesmith, Veterinary Record, 23 Jul
1997) that this alone should have given rise to 1642 BSE cases. If you also
take into consideration the British cattle exported _prior to_ 1985, some
of which must have been incubating BSE, and the many thousands of tons of
British MBM (meat and bone meal) exported to other EU countries in the
1980s, there is something "very odd" about the less that 350 cases total
reported for all the other EU countries......".
I do not have country-by-country import figures to hand but my recollection
is that France imported the lion's share.
