--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A survey of fruit crops in 13 regions of Kazakhstan was carried out to identify foci of fire blight, the extent of its spread, the range of affected crops, and the identification of infection reserves. It was established that the disease was mainly concentrated in the south and southeast of Kazakhstan, in the main fruit growing zone. Symptoms were characteristic of 2 bacterial diseases: namely, necrosis with _Pseudomonas syringae_ as the causative agent and fire blight as such, caused by _Erwinia amylovora_.

A study of the seasonal dynamics of the disease for 6 years showed that the optimal conditions for the multiplication and accumulation of infection were during flowering and growth of young shoots, when humidity was above 60% and the temperature within 16-20 deg C [60.8-68 deg F]. However, if spring was cold and lasted longer than usual (with temperature below 16 deg C), despite high humidity the disease would not develop. Throughout the years of research, the development of the disease stopped [during] the dry and hot period in July and August. The development of the disease was significantly affected by the microclimate. With thick plantings and [dense] foliage, moisture was retained and condensation formed, which provokes the development of the disease.

Analyses [were performed] to isolate and identify the causative agent from various fruit and wild cultures of the Rosaceae family, using classical bacteriological and molecular genetic methods. 2 types of bacteria were isolated, namely _E. amylovora_ and _P. syringae_.

[Fireblight
----------
Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the Rosaceae are affected, mainly the sub-family Maloideae (synonym Pomoideae), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and wild species (such as hawthorns) serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections. The pathogen is included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers) and with plant material (including budwood).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is fraught with risks (see also ProMED posts 20200629.7519826 & 20190320.6377319).

Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

Pseudomonas diseases
--------------------
Diseases of fruit trees caused by members of the _Pseudomonas syringae_ (Ps) species complex are of major concern worldwide. The pathogens can cause a range of different diseases on leaves, shoot tips, fruits and can also lead to cankers that girdle and kill branches. For example, Ps pathovars _syringae_ and _papulans_ affect apple; _morsprunorum_ and _syringae_ cause diseases of stone fruit; _castanea_ affects sweet chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.).

Other pathovars can affect a wide variety of plants, including crops such as kiwi fruit, tomato, bean, maize, mango, soybean, and citrus. New diseases are emerging frequently and symptoms may include leaf specks, blights, and cankers. (For more information on the diseases see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

The pathogens are spread by water, wind, mechanical means (including animal and human activities) and infected planting material. Disease management usually includes cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread (for example, disinfection of pruning tools), and use of clean planting material. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) may be effective, but resistant strains have emerged for some pathovars. Varieties with different levels of resistance are available for some crops.

In Kazakhstan, fireblight had been reported from the early 2000s onwards and a national survey programme was initiated (ProMED post 20130712.1821414]. Ps pathogens also having been detected in plants with perceived "fireblight" symptoms, the report above confirms again that symptoms alone are not sufficient for reliable identification of any disease.
