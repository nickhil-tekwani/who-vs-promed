Outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in tourists visiting the
Dominican Republic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A large outbreak of more than 600 cases of gastrointestinal illness
has been reported in the Dominican Republic, originating at the Bahia
Principe San Juan resort in Puerto Plata. The illness experienced has
generally been self-limiting of 12 to 24 hours duration. Vomiting and
diarrhoea are the most commonly reported symptoms, with abdominal
discomfort and fever reported much less frequently.
Two flights containing symptomatic and asymptomatic travellers
returned to the United Kingdom on Thu 9 Aug 2007: to Glasgow (35
symptomatic) and to Gatwick (40 symptomatic). The planes were
disinfected and then returned to service.
Passengers have been asked to see their GP if they develop symptoms,
or, in those already affected, if their symptoms persist. General
practitioners, infectious diseases doctors or other healthcare
workers who may see patients recently returned from the Dominican
Republic, are asked to request stool samples for microbiological and
viral analysis, providing a full travel history.
The illness has features suggestive of a viral aetiology, and 2
specimens from cases in England and Wales have been confirmed as
being positive for norovirus (one genotype G1 and one type G2).
Several cases have had _Entamoeba histolytica_ identified by local
laboratories in the Dominican Republic but for the majority of cases
the symptoms are not consistent with this being the cause of illness.
The Bahia Principe hotel is currently closed to new guests.

[This report provides laboratory confirmation that the outbreak of
gastroenteritis affecting tourists at the Bahia Principe hotel in
Puerto Plata was caused by norovirus infection. The report
establishes also that 2 quarantined aircraft were disinfected before
being returned to service. The association of 2 genotypes of
norovirus and possibly some cases of _Entamoeba histolytica_ with
this outbreak suggests lapses in hygiene at the hotel. - Mod.CP]
