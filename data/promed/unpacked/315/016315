Federal officials ordered a complete recall of the Las Vegas-based bottled water brand Real Water and ordered the company to provide records regarding at least one death and multiple liver disease investigations of those who reported drinking it.

Brent Jones of Affinity Lifestyles, the company's president, and bottler's lawyer did not immediately respond to an email message issued Wednesday [19 May 2021] regarding a US District Court order on Friday [21 May 2021]. The order stopped production and distribution of products sold primarily in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and California.

Jones and the company did not challenge an order, called a consent decision, or admit to wrongdoing until further hearings are held. Jones and company phone numbers are no longer in use.

This product is sold as premium alkaline drinking water in a unique box-shaped blue bottle promoting "E2 Electron Energized Technology." The label says it is "injected with negative ions," and has a healthy detoxifying effect.

The federal complaints call the product brand "Real Water Drinking Water." They refer to the product being "potentially harmful to health" and allege the "manufacture and distribution of adult and/or misbranded bottled water and chemical concentrates."

The consent decision requires the company to collect and destroy all products manufactured before Wed 19 May 2021 and to hand over records on processing, bottling, and distribution to the FDA, and to submit to unannounced inspections of company facilities in Las Vegas, suburbs of Henderson, Nevada, and Mesa, Arizona.

The company has promised to pay at least USD 100 per hour for FDA activity and must notify the FDA before any change of ownership, reorganization, or bankruptcy.

According to the document, the water is drawn from the municipal water supply in the Las Vegas region, filtered and treated with potassium hydroxide, commonly referred to as lye, potassium bicarbonate, and the mineral salt magnesium chloride.

"Defendants allege they use their own "ionizer" device to pass an electric current through the mixture to produce a positively charged solution and a negatively charged solution," a federal civil lawsuit said.

The negatively charged solution is sold as an "E2 concentrate" taste enhancer for coffee, tea, and wine and is diluted in tanks and packaged as "alkaline" real water for home delivery and commercial sale.

The Las Vegas-based Southern Nevada Health District reported 5 more cases of liver disease that appear to be related to the Real Water product on Thu 20 May 2021, including the death of a woman in Clark County in her 60s who had an underlying condition. The report referred to 16 cases of acute non-viral hepatitis in the district linked to the product.

Several negligent and deceptive trading practice proceedings in state court allege even more injuries. They accuse Jones, Real Water and Affinity Lifestyles of causing death in women, liver damage to children, and visceral damage to adults, causing hospitalization and at least one liver transplant.

A proceeding pending in the US District Court in Las Vegas seeks class action status on behalf of an injured person in the United States after purchasing Real Water.

In a court filing, the company acknowledged the FDA's investigation, but did not admit Real Water caused the illness.

Former Nevada Republican Congressman Jones apologized on the company's website (https://drinkrealwater.com/) in mid-March 2021, announcing a guarantee that "lessons learned will help the brand go even further."

In April 2021, the FDA issued a statement warning the public not to drink, cook, or serve Real Water products.

[This article is confusing, but my understanding is that there has been at least one death, and some illnesses, including a liver transplant possibly linked to consumption of this water.

If the label has the word lye on it, I would be concerned about ingesting the product. Lye can be caustic to tissues, but it is likely to have been extremely diluted.

The company's web site (https://drinkrealwater.com/) states that it is down for maintenance and currently has only the recall notice, 2 other documents, and a video from the company president on it.

The recall letter follows:
"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Real Water, Inc., Issues Precautionary Recall of All Sizes of Real Water Brand Drinking Water Due to a Possible Health Risk.

"Real Water, Inc. of Mesa, AZ and Henderson, NV, has issued a voluntary recall of all sizes of its Real Water brand drinking water because it may be linked to certain instances of non-viral hepatitis, which were reported in or about November 2020 in the Las Vegas, NV area.

"Symptoms of all types of hepatitis, including non-viral hepatitis, are similar and can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay or gray-colored bowel movements, joint pain, yellow eyes, and jaundice. Those experiencing these symptoms should contact their doctor.

"Recalled products include 1.5 liters, 1 liter, 500 ml and one gallon ready-to-drink bottles that were distributed throughout the United States by UNFI and KEHE to the natural channel of stores, as well as through direct distribution to various retail stores on a regional basis in the greater Las Vegas, NV area, Northern Arizona, Southern California, Tennessee, Georgia, Chicago, New York, Mississippi, and New Mexico. Real Water is also sold on Amazon.com. In addition, 5-gallon home and office delivery bottles were distributed through direct delivery to homes and offices in the greater Las Vegas, NV area, central California coastal region (North of Los Angeles, CA and South from Santa Barbara, CA), and Phoenix, AZ. Also included in the recall are the 4 oz bottles of Real Water Concentrate, sold on the Firm's website.

"The ready-to-drink bottles sold in retail stores have a blue rectangular bottle with "Real Alkalized Water" printed on the label. Five-gallon home and office delivery bottles are blue with white labels.

"Distributors have been notified of the recall and instructed to immediately remove recalled products from all store shelves, distribution, and other inventories to ensure they are no longer available for sale or consumption. Home and office delivery customers have also been instructed how to have products picked up.

"The recall is the result of an investigation by the Southern Nevada Health District and the FDA after reported cases of non-viral hepatitis in or about November 2020 were suspected to be potentially linked to Real Water's 5-gallon Home and Office Delivery. Real Water takes customer safety seriously and promptly issued this recall on 17 Mar 2021 after being notified of the investigation. The company has ceased production and distribution of the product as the FDA and the company continue their investigations into the potential cause of the problem.

"Consumers who may have recalled products should discard them immediately and not drink them. Customers of Real Water's 5-gallon Home and Office Delivery should contact Real Water at the number or email below to have any remaining product picked up. Consumers who have purchased Real Water ready-to-drink bottles may return them to the place of purchase for refund. Consumers with questions or who are seeking a refund may contact the company at 1-702-310-5437 on Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time or by email at <customerservice@drinkrealwater.com>." - Mod.TG]
