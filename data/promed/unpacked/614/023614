[The geographic distribution of 'sheep & goat pox' (S&GP), an OIE-notifiable epizootic, includes central and north Africa, central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the Indian subcontinent. Its causative agents are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the family _Poxviridae_. Most isolates cause disease mainly in sheep or mainly in goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both species. The causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other with current techniques. Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species. The disease does not affect humans.

Earlier outbreaks of S&GP in Mongolia started -- according to the official report to the OIE -- in January 2007 (only sheep reportedly affected) and in October 2008, when 2 flocks of goats were reportedly affected and culled; mass vaccination of goats was applied. The epizootic was declared as resolved in October 2009.

Mongolia's last outbreak of S&GP occurred in January 2013 in the province Dornogovi, affecting a sheep flock of 308 head, of which 221 were reportedly clinical cases, without mortality; the 221 cases were destroyed (see posting 20130119.1505939). This outbreak was followed by the vaccination of 59 135 sheep in the affected province during 2013 which seems to be ring vaccination around the focus.

It seems that both sheep and goat strains are present in or invade Mongolia occasionally.

Mongolia's sheep population (2013 figures) is nearly 21 million, of which 1 216 623 in the affected province Sukhbaatar (density 12.70 per sq km, rather similar to the national density). According to the 2013 annual report, sheep pox vaccination is not included among the routinely applied preventive measures in Mongolia. Information on the vaccine strains used (for post-outbreak vaccinations?) is requested.

Mongolia's semi-annual and annual OIE reports for 2014 are not yet available.
