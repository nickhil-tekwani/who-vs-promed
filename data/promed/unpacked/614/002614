New Hendra case north of Brisbane
---------------------------------
Another case of Hendra virus [infection] has been detected in
south-east Queensland. A horse from a Beachmere property north of
Brisbane tested positive on Monday night [10 Oct 2011] and was put
down Tuesday morning.

"This is the 12th horse infected with the virus this year in
Queensland," Premier Anna Bligh said. "There is no doubt that 2011 has
been a very difficult year for this terrible virus."

Biosecurity Queensland will assess other animals on the property at
the centre of the outbreak. Another horse which died there a week ago
is now suspected of having Hendra.

Chief vet Rick Symons says there are 2 remaining horses, 2 cats, and a
dog on the property. "We don't know the level of contact they've
potentially had with the infected horses," he said.

"As part of our protocol now, we do test the dogs -- it has to be
though that the dog's had some close contact with the horses. If the
dog was a house dog and had no contact with horses, there's no reason
to test the dog."

Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says the extent of human
exposure has not been determined. "At this point, I believe there's
only been a small number of people who have come into contact with
these 2 horses, but I don't even definitively know that," she said.

"If they've had any degree of contact, then yes, we'll go through our
immediate protocol which is immediate testing."

[Indeed, this has been a tough year for equine owners and for the
regulatory authorities. It has been a frightening season for people
wondering if they were exposed or if their pets were exposed.

I am sure everyone is ready for this ordeal to come to an end and yet
vigilance for this disease must not decrease.
