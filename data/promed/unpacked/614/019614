The Ohio outbreak of pulmonary hemorrhage/hemosiderosis was described in a
note from the MMWR of CDC last year. [ProMED - MMWR Contents, Jan 17, 1997
970122165114] The suspected organism is Stachybotrys, a fungus which grows
on wet cellulose. The houses involved all had leakage into the walls and
Stachybotrys present. A recent paper describing Stachybotrys contamination
of buildings is in Applied and Environmental Microbiology 63:387-393, 1997
(Feb).

There is a Web page on the fungus that causes this. I got the URL from the
Public Relations Dept. at University Hospitals, but didn't keep it around.
The Univ. Hospitals' phone number is 216-844-1000.
