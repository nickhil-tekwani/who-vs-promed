Azerbaijani authorities have confirmed a bird flu outbreak in western
regions of the country where poultry farms have already reported
numerous deaths from the disease.

Deputy Health Minister Elsever Aghayev said that the state veterinary
service confirmed that the bird flu virus was found in one of the
blood samples sent from the west Azerbaijani region of Samukh [map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Azerbaijan-Samukh.png>].

The country's environment ministry imposed a month-long ban on bird
hunting after the outbreak was confirmed, according to reports
reaching here Saturday [4 Dec 2010].

Health officials are advising people to take precautions against the
possible spread of the virus, which migrating birds can spread from
other countries.

[From the above newswires, it is not clear which birds (domestic/wild
species) are involved. Official information, including the final
identity of the causative agent, would be anticipated.

Azerbaijan underwent an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 between 2 Feb and 18
Mar 2006. The virus affected, reportedly, wild birds, domestic
poultry and dogs. Eight humans were infected, of which 5 died (see
