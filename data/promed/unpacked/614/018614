Mexico will slaughter 486 000 chickens after an outbreak of bird flu was detected in the central state of Guanajuato, officials said Friday [15 Feb 2013].

Poultry producer Bachoco reported a possible case of H7N3 [avian] influenza in 5 breeder farms late Wednesday [13 Feb 2013], which agriculture ministry officials confirmed on Friday.

Authorities launched preventive measures, testing nearby farms to check if the outbreak had spread elsewhere.

Last year [2012], a bird flu outbreak in the western state of Jalisco forced farmers to slaughter 22 million hens, sparking an egg crisis in Mexico, the world's top consumer of eggs per capita.

[The authorities are sensitive about this disease. They have faced an egg crisis, slaughtered millions of birds, had the eyes of the world watching them, so it is expected they would be sensitive and act on a suspect case.
