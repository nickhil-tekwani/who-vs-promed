News
Operations of the response
------------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, chaired, on Fri 28 Jun 2019, the meeting of consensus and consensus on vaccination in the context of the 10th epidemic of the Ebola virus disease that has been raging since 1 Aug 2018 in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.
- The 2-day meeting aimed to create a consultative framework to transparently share the latest scientific and technical information on existing experimental Ebola vaccines to facilitate the Ministry of Health's decision-making on their use in the framework of the current epidemic or possible clinical trials in the margins of the current response. At the 72th World Health Assembly, the Minister of Health made a commitment to hold a meeting on vaccination against Ebola to Kinshasa to discuss the latest SAGE recommendations.
- The Ministry of Health invited its partners and producers of these different experimental vaccines, including Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Cansino Biologics Inc. and Rospotrebnadzor, to submit to the national regulatory authorities the relevant technical data concerning their product.
- Several bodies of the Ministry of Health also made presentations at the meeting, in particular the Directorate General for Disease Control (DGLM), the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), and the National Program for Communication and Promotion of Health (PNCPS).
- Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga solicited the contributions of all national and international participants during these meetings, so that together they could make relevant recommendations to the national regulatory authorities empowered to make the final decision. These authorities are the Directorate of Pharmacy and Medicine (DPM) and the National Ethics Committee.
- It should be noted that the vaccination against Ebola in this 10th epidemic was launched on 8 Aug 2018, fewer than 8 days after the declaration of the epidemic.
- More than 8000 teachers from Butembo and Katwa have been briefed on their role in fighting Ebola.
- The aim of this training was to make these teachers ambassadors for the fight against EVD in the community during the school holidays in order to get rid of this epidemic at the beginning of the school year.
- It is done before the end of the school year in order to encourage teachers, as well as students and their parents, to adopt measures to prevent and combat EVD during school holidays.

Figures of the response
---------------------
- 144 549 vaccinated persons
- 69 851 742 people under control
- 125 contaminated health workers (including 40 deaths)

- 27 Jun 2019. Disease outbreak news: update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/27-june-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces continues at a stable pace this week. Although response operations were temporarily interrupted in Beni following 2 days of insecurity in the surrounding areas, operations have largely resumed. However, in the town of Musienene, violent threats persist against healthcare workers (HCWs) and local security forces providing assistance to the response efforts. Furthermore, response activities in Kambau health area, Manguredjipa health zone were also suspended following security incidents.

Of growing concern this week are the current hotspots of Mabalako, particularly the Aloya health area, and Mandima (see Figure 1 at the source URL), which were the 1st health zones to report EVD cases in August/September 2018. Sporadic reintroduction events in areas such as Vuhovi, which had not reported any new cases in the past 24 days, further compound the evolving situation. Other areas experiencing a similar resurgence in EVD cases after a period of prolonged absence include Komanda and Masereka.

In the 21 days between 5 and 25 Jun 2019, 67 health areas within 19 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (see Figure 2 at the source URL). During this period, a total of 252 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (35%, n = 88), Beni (17%, n = 43), Mandima (12%, n = 30), Butembo (5%, n = 13) , Musienene (5%, n = 13) , Kalunguta (5%, n = 12), and Katwa (5%, n = 12). As of 25 Jun 2019, a total of 2277 EVD cases, including 2183 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (see Table 1 at the source URL). A total of 1531 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1437 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2277 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1287) were female, and 29% (663) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 129 (6% of total cases).

In Mabalako, a total of 88 confirmed cases, with 61 concentrated in the Aloya health area, have been reported from 5 to 25 Jun [2019]. Multiple transmission chains have been identified to be related to family connections, and 15 infections were associated with healthcare facility-related infections.

Currently, the main challenges present in Mabalako revolve around follow up of registered cases and the low number of alerts reported relative to the number of new EVD cases detected.

In Mandima, as of 25 Jun [2019], a total of 30 cases have been reported in the past 21 days, with the majority of the cases (22) originating from Biakato Mines, Biakato Mayi, and Alima health areas. A total of 6 chains of transmission have been identified over that time period, with new cases being primarily attributed to individuals having contact with an infected family member or other patients in healthcare facilities. Timely investigation of alerts in Mandima to date have been suboptimal due to lack of access and insecurity, with only 73% of alerts being investigated thoroughly within the first 24 hours.

No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 Jun 2019. As of 26 Jun [2019], 108 potentially exposed contacts have been identified and are under surveillance, including 13 who have completed followed up. Contacts will be visited daily for 21 days until the last contact completes follow-up on 3 Jul [2019]. All contacts remain asymptomatic to date. All 14 suspected cases reported to date have tested negative for EVD. On 26 Jun [2019], ring vaccination of potential contacts was completed, with a total of 1063 individuals having consented and been successfully vaccinated, including 74 contacts (34 were not eligible for vaccination), 740 contacts of contacts, and 249 healthcare workers.

3. A few weeks ago, there were cases in only 11 health zones, out of 22 that have had cases at some point in this #Ebola outbreak. Now it's back up to 19. Worth noting: there were 252 cases in the past 3 weeks. If that were a distinct outbreak it would be the 8th largest ever.
2. One feature of this #Ebola outbreak is the way it moves around. Butembo & Katwa flared, then subsided. The geographic footprint seemed to be shrinking, but it has expanded again. Nothing stays OUT. Now the hotspots are the places where the outbreak first began.]

- Thu 27 Jun 2019. Cases near 2300
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-cases-near-2300-virus-returns-earlier-hot-spots
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday [26 Jun 2019] in its weekly profile of Ebola activity aired growing concern about case spikes in 2 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) areas -- Mabalako and Mandima -- that were hit hard when the outbreak began last August [2019]. Meanwhile, the DRC health ministry yesterday [26 Jun 2019] reported 7 new cases, and the WHO's online Ebola dashboard says there will likely be 13 more today [27 Jun 2019], which would lift the overall outbreak total to 2297 cases.

The WHO said new infections over the past week continued at a stable pace, as security incidents continued to plague the response. Operations in Beni have resumed after 2 days of disruptions, but violent threats against health workers continue in Musienene, and security problems in one area of Manguredjipa health zone suspended activities there.

Though the WHO is worried about disease reintroduction in Mabalako, especially in the Aloya health area, and Mandima, it said it is seeing the virus return to other areas, as well. Examples include Vuhovi, which had not reported any new cases in the past 24 days before reintroduction, with similar patterns in Komanda and Masereka.

In Mabalako, 61 of 88 confirmed cases were reported from Aloya in June [2019], with multiple transmission chains related to families and 15 linked to healthcare facilities.

Meanwhile, Mandima has reported 30 cases in the past 3 weeks, most of them in 4 health areas where 6 transmission chains have been identified, mainly involving family members and patients in healthcare settings. The WHO said security problems in Mandima are hampering access and investigation of cases.

At a media briefing in Geneva today [27 Jun 2019], Ibrahima Soce Fall, MD, PhD, WHO assistant director-general for emergency response, said a resurgence in cases in Beni, where 4 of the city's health areas have transmission chains, is concerning, because it is not far from Mabalako and Mandima, the latest hot spots. "It is important to break the vicious cycle," he said.

On a positive note, he said health officials have made good progress cutting transmission levels in Butembo and Katwa, hot spots that were rocked by serious disruptions a few months ago. Fall said the key to getting cases down to what is now just sporadic cases is decentralizing the response to target all 33 health areas in that region, focusing on interventions such as safe and dignified burials and household decontamination.

In other response developments, he said health officials are working on the next phase of a United Nations Ebola response scale-up that covers the next 6 months, and details on the plan are expected to be released 8 Jul [2019].

The 7 new cases reported by the DRC yesterday [26 Jun 2019] are from 3 different locations: Beni (5), Mabalako (1), and Rawmpara (1). Health officials are still investigating 328 suspected cases.

Also, 9 more people died from their Ebola infections, 2 in community settings in Beni and 7 in Ebola treatment centers, boosting the outbreak's fatality count to 1540.

Yesterday [26 Jun 2019] health officials from the health ministry and its outbreak response partners met for a 2nd time with community members in an area of Beni where 2 response teams were attacked on 23 Jun [2019]. The talks were geared toward better understanding the community's concerns and toward engaging their support for Ebola response steps.

- 14 Jun 2019. Open-source initiative re: Ebola
[Medium, abridged, edited]
From: Samuel S. Malloy <malloy.65@osu.edu>
https://medium.com/the-battelle-center-for-science-engineering-and/an-open-source-geospatial-application-to-support-the-ebola-response-d53b81fad9a4

"I am writing to share an effort we have been driving related to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC. Our goal is to remove barriers to entry in the organization, visualization and analysis of geospatial data related to this outbreak. To do this we have created an open-source platform that can be utilized and improved by research and response teams from around the world.

"This new site might be useful in understanding the complex data environment of this outbreak. The goal is to catalyze a broad open source effort that can provide an actionable, integrated source of information for those groups on the ground that currently need it."

23 May 2019. An open-source geospatial application to support the Ebola response. A dynamic and complex crisis

The ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents a clear threat to global public health security. Contact tracing, deployment of medical resources, and adoption of preventive social practices have been hampered by surging violent conflict in the region, widespread misinformation about the response efforts, and a fragmented data environment.

Our engagement with the response coalition, which spans the humanitarian, national security and civil service sectors, uncovered a common pain point: the complex variables associated with the North Kivu outbreak are simply not visible in a shared common environment, let alone ready for real-time analysis. Epidemiological case data are officially published in mapping products that exist independently of data related to conflict, population change and local infrastructure.

Moreover, what products do exist are produced with licensed software through a closed-source environment that can be neither replicated and improved by research groups nor supplemented with local data for local use.

This prohibits nongovernmental organizations, universities, government agencies and local users from customizing geospatial products for their own interests and needs, including adding data that could be critical for the response community. In addition, users of the official publications cannot readily conduct analyses of the officially published data and are not able to directly download the input information.

The result of this fragmented data environment is a lack of situational awareness which heightens the risk that decisions are made with incomplete information or faulty assumptions. In addition, these conditions make it difficult to prioritize increasingly limited resources. The response coalition must focus on the highest-priority daily emergencies, which, understandably, do not typically include technology development.

To meet this need, we have created an open-source, fully integrated geospatial visualization and analysis tool that can be utilized and improved by the global community. The application prototype, built using the Mapbox GL JS API, is now available to view, and the source code is publicly available in Github. We also created a data wiki with a dedicated page for each of the key layers in the application with links to sources and local copies of each dataset.

[See source URL for figure showing prototype design featuring interactivity and built-in analytical capabilities.]

Key data features
- The platform integrates all relevant geospatial data sources in a single field of view. This includes one of the 1st applications of the Facebook/Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network high-resolution population density datasets.
- Users can clone the project and create a private version that incorporates additional data sources. These additional data can be either private or publicly released, at the discretion of the data provider.
- All data sources are fully documented and available for download.

Key design features
- Users can inspect the code responsible for the integration, manipulation and visualization of all datasets.
- Research teams from around the world can improve the design and functionality of the published application.
- Viewing, analyzing and editing the application can all be done using open-source tools, eliminating the need to purchase proprietary software.

Beyond the development of the UI, many of the challenges our team faced were related to data formats and compatibility. As a result, we were able to add value by automating processes and conducting more complex conversions with the resources of a world-class research university. However, data providers can eliminate these barriers for contributors with limited resources by adopting geospatial data standards and best practices. Simple adjustments upstream can then make considerable impact on downstream workflow.

Greater visibility of complex crises can fundamentally change the way that organizations prioritize their resources and efforts, which in turn can save lives and increase social stability. This project aims to increase situational awareness for the Ebola response coalition, and to create a mechanism for easy replication to different humanitarian contexts in the process. You can help by contributing data, by directly improving the application using the source code, or simply by sharing feedback with our team at <battellecenter@osu.edu>.

https://allafrica.com/stories/201906280517.html
[Byline: Vittoria Elliott]

Local responders are at the forefront of efforts to contain the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But with this reality comes greater risks -- from the virus itself, but also from attacks by armed groups and distrustful local communities.

Doctors and vaccination teams have been targeted. Families of health workers have been harassed. A hygienist was beaten to death by fellow villagers who turned against him. This week, 2 response teams were also attacked by a group of boys who lost a friend to Ebola in Beni, a town in the outbreak's epicentre.

Since January [2019], response teams or Ebola centres have been attacked more than 174 times, with the majority of incidents against local responders in their own communities, according to Jessica Illunga, a Congolese Ministry of Health spokeswoman.

Rumours that the virus isn't real, or that it is being used against people, have fanned tensions. There has also been anger over the fact that some people have benefited financially while the region as a whole has remained poor.

For one local responder working for the international non-governmental organisation Mercy Corps, the risk of catching the disease and facing physical threats has been a daily concern. "To protect ourselves, we live in anonymity," said the responder, who spoke to The New Humanitarian over email and on condition of anonymity for fear of security threats. "All family members know that (they) should not talk about what 'dad' is doing."

All but 100 of the Ministry of Health's approximately 1500 Ebola personnel are from the outbreak area and working as doctors, nurses, de-contaminators, and drivers. More than half of the World Health Organisation's 630 Ebola response staff are also categorised as "local", meaning they are from somewhere in Congo.

Another local responder from Mercy Corps who provides wash kits to households, schools, and other places in the outbreak zone said that threats sometimes stand in the way of getting the job done.

The complex set of challenges that allowed for the disease to spread quickly since August [2018] has led to several strategy shifts in the response. Vaccination doses are being split so that more people can be vaccinated. Contact "rings" around potential cases have been extended. And a special UN envoy -- David Gressly -- has been appointed to help strengthen the response and security for Ebola responders, the majority of whom are local.

Most international and national non-governmental organisations say the best protection for local responders is building trust within communities. Locals have generally shouldered much of the risk and responsibilities during Ebola outbreaks simply because of geography.

There are numerous definitions of what makes a "local" responder. For WHO, local means Congolese. For other organisations, it might mean being from the outbreak's epicentre or being from a specific community or neighbourhood.

Vaccinations, burying the dead, and de-contaminations are all carried out by local actors, according to Stephanie Tam with Mercy Corps. Local responders who speak the language and understand specific communities are most effective in combating the disease, but they also face greater resistance and risks.

"There's almost this blind trust given to local actors that they can manage the risk because they're local," said Veronique Barbelet, a senior research fellow with the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Initiative (ODI) who has studied local attitudes towards humanitarian aid in Congo.

In practice, local actors often have less say than their international counterparts about the policy and strategy informing the response plan, said Stoddard.

The jobs are often paid less than those of international staff, whose food, housing, and transport are also covered. Though local responders receive hazard pay on top of their salaries, many local responders have complained that they have received their hazard pay late or not at all. Ilunga, the Ministry of Health spokeswoman, said a non-computerised system had led to delays in verifying payments.
