The seriousness of the 1997 outbreak was apparently downplayed when it
began in spite of the fact that the pig industry is a key component of the
country's agriculture and involves some 14.4 million pigs; there are 15.3
people in The Netherlands. Because the country is small, pigs are
maintained in high densities. This greatly facilitates spread between
animals and farms.
When the first cases were reported there were a mere 22 farms affected in
the southern province of Brabant, in a provincial population of 6.3 million
pigs. However ... illegal transport of pigs, the contamination of sperm at
an artificial insemination center, and a severe under-estimation of the
virulence of the disease confused early attempts to contain the epidemic.
By May at least 220 farms were affected and by late autumn some 420 farms
throughout the country. Further spread was achieved by a massive culling of
millions of pigs and a ban on breeding.
The authors of a European Commission report strongly criticized the
Netherland's Minister of Agriculture for his handling of the crisis, though
EU regulations prohibited the farmers from protecting their herds by
vaccination. Recent estimates put the economic cost at f 12.6 billion or
some US$ 6 million, with the farmers suffering losses of about US$ 1.5
million. Thanks to EU subsidies the farmers will bear only a fraction of
the overall financial damage.
The Dutch Minister facing external EU criticism and internal criticism that
he was slow to act on their recommendations has responded by introducing
radical reforms to the pig industry. One suggested measure is to reduce the
pig population by 25%. While this has popular support, the farmers are
unimpressed.
