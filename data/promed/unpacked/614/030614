Since October 2008, an intense increase in the circulation of the
jungle yellow fever [YF] virus has been observed in the Americas,
affecting Argentina and Brazil in the southern part of the continent,
Colombia and Venezuela in the Andean region, and Trinidad and Tobago
in the Caribbean.

The objective of this communication is to alert the countries of the
region so that they can strengthen their surveillance, prevention,
and control activities for yellow fever within their territories and
for persons traveling towards affected or risk areas.

Yellow Fever Situation in the Region:

Argentina and Brazil
Since October 2008, monkey deaths (epizootics) have been observed in
southern Brazil and, starting in November of that same year, in
northeastern Argentina. The affected area includes municipalities in
the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and localities in the
provinces of Misiones and Corrientes in Argentina, adjacent to Rio
Grande do Sul.

In Brazil, up to 15 Jan 2009, the state of Rio Grande do Sul has
reported 228 monkey deaths in 62 municipalities. Of these, 23
municipalities had probable or laboratory-confirmed epizootics. Some
of these epizootics were registered in municipalities located outside
the area previously considered at risk [Since PAHO published this
report, there have been a total of 4 human YF cases in Rio Grande do
Sul state (see proMED archive no. 20090211.0618). - Mod.TY].

Argentina has presented 3 epizootic events in different localities in
the Province of Misiones and in 7 localities of the Province of
Corrientes, confirming yellow fever in one of them.

With regard to human cases, [there have been] 2 in Argentina, with
the probable infection site in the area of Fachinal, Province of
Misiones. The last outbreaks of jungle yellow fever recorded in both
Rio Grande do Sul and in Corrientes were in 1966.

Trinidad and Tobago
Two epizootics have been reported of laboratory-confirmed yellow
fever, in the districts of Mayaro and Nariva, respectively located in
southern and southeastern Trinidad. Epizootics in Trinidad and Tobago
have not been reported since 1998.

Venezuela
A monkey death in the State of Guarico is under investigation. The
last human case reported in the country was in 2005 [Since this PAHO
report, there have been 8 dead monkeys suspected of YF virus
infection found in the municipality of Zamora, Aragua state (see
ProMED archive no. 20090129.0407). - Mod.TY].

Colombia
Between Epidemiological Week (EW) 51 in 2008 and EW 1 in 2009, 2
(fatal) human yellow fever cases have been reported in the Department
of Meta, both falling within the pattern of sporadic cases expected
in the country.

Response to the Situation
The countries have taken action to prevent the occurrence of more
human cases, strengthening epidemiological surveillance, which
includes active case-finding of febrile, jaundiced (icteric), and
ictero-hemorrhagic cases. Investigation of any rumors of monkey
deaths has also been intensified. At the same time, in the affected
areas, vaccination coverage is being increased among the resident
population. Furthermore, the indication to vaccinate has been
strengthened for travelers to these areas. In addition, for the
purpose of preventing urban transmission by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, vector control activities have been strengthened.

Recommendations:

Yellow Fever Vaccination
One of the most important mechanisms for preventing yellow fever is
vaccination. However, the priority of its use, its indications, and
counter-indications should all be considered when applying it. PAHO
recommends a rational use of vaccines, prioritizing the population
residing in a risk area as well as travelers going to or through
these areas. Special attention should be paid to vaccinating people
who live in risk areas (where epizootics or cases have been
identified) and those who, though residing in low-risk areas (where
vaccination coverage is generally low), work or participate in
recreational activities inside risk areas. The yellow fever vaccine
should not be administered to people with acute febrile diseases, to
those with hypersensitivity to eggs and their derivatives, or to
those who have diseases or who receive treatments that suppress the
immune system.

Epidemiological Surveillance
Timely detection of outbreaks allows for the effective implementation
of control measures. To this end, it is important to use all yellow
fever surveillance mechanisms in both humans and primates: monitoring
of compatible clinical cases; surveillance of febrile icteric
syndromes; epizootic surveillance; intensified monitoring of _A.
aegypti_ infestation indices in urban areas close to the disease
focus; monitoring of vaccination coverage; and monitoring of
post-vaccination events presumably attributable to vaccination
against yellow fever in affected and bordering areas.

Vector Control
Yellow fever transmission in the Americas continues to be of the
jungle cycle. However, in order to avoid the re-urbanization of this
disease -- of which there already was an outbreak confirmed at the
beginning of 2008 and successfully controlled -- _A. aegypti_ control
measures are critical, mainly in cities and in localities bordering
affected areas. These measures also allow for the prevention of
dengue outbreaks.

Risk Communication
In light of the intense circulation of the yellow fever virus
observed in the region, countries should include in their
communication activities clear educational directives on the rational
use of the vaccine, on the population to be vaccinated, on personal
protection measures (such as avoiding activities taking place in
forests), and on vector control measures.

activities, see PAHO's practical handbook (in Spanish) at

[ProMED thanks Ms. Eberwine-Villagran for calling this comprehensive
PAHO report to our attention. Although most of the YF occurrences
mentioned in this PAHO report have been reported by ProMED before,
the Colombian cases have not been. This interesting PAHO report
underscores the fact that sylvan (jungle) YF virus transmission
cycles occur in various locations in tropical South America, and both
residents of and visitors to forested areas there should be
vaccinated for their own good health and to prevent sylvan YF virus
from becoming established in an urban transmission cycle involving
human-to-human transmission of the virus by _Aedes aegypti_, which is
well established throughout the region. Such an event occurred in
Paraguay last year (2008) (see ProMED archive no. 20080308.0949).
There is a risk of spread of YF virus not only into settlements and
towns adjacent to forested areas but also into densely populated
urban areas in South America by rapid movement of viremic individuals.
