5 members of the same family died of cholera on 3 consecutive days in
Nazimoja village, Montepuez district, in the northern Mozambican
province of Cabo Delgado, reports Tuesday [6 Oct 2009]'s issue of the
independent daily "O Pais."

According to a resident of that village, many people have been
suffering from the disease, which was initially shrugged off as
simple bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. However, the health
authorities have confirmed that this is cholera. The disease was also
reported in Napai, and Nacate, suburbs of the Montepuez town, where
it has killed at least 4 people.

By 28 Sep 2009, the Montepuez District Hospital had recorded 106
cases of cholera, and 3 of them were still under medical care in a
serious condition. The Cabo Delgado chief doctor Cesario Sauegi
confirmed these facts, adding that the disease has also been reported
in the districts of Mocimboa da Praia, and Ancuabe.

A cholera outbreak in northern Cameroon has killed 15 people, state
media reported on Tuesday [6 Oct 2009]. Cameroonian authorities are
taking measures to contain the epidemic, which was brought in from
neighboring Nigeria, state radio and the official Cameroon Tribune said.

"The disease was imported from neighboring Nigeria by a lady who
visited the country recently," the Tribune said. "She died after
suffering from diarrhea and vomiting and her dresses were washed in a
stream used by local inhabitants, thereby contaminating everybody."

9 people died and several others were hospitalized this week
following a cholera outbreak in Nigeria's northern Taraba State,
bringing the death toll in the region to 97, an official said on
Thursday [1 Oct 2009].

"We have recorded cases of cholera here in Jalingo (the capital) in
the past 2 days in which 9 people have died and several others
hospitalized at the State Specialist Hospital," the state health
commissioner, Muhammad Bose, said. "I can't give exact figures of
those hospitalized because we are still collating the number of cases
but we have sent health personnel and drugs to the 3 affected
neighborhoods in the metropolis," Bose said by telephone from Jalingo.

On Wednesday [31 Sep 2009] health officials in Jigawa State, also in
the region, announced the death of 11 people following an outbreak of
cholera in Bashuri village where 400 cases emerged in under a
fortnight [less than two weeks]. Health officials were still
investigating the cause of the outbreak, Bose said.

Cholera has claimed 77 lives in recent weeks in Adamawa State,
leaving nearly 1000 people hospitalized. "At the moment we have
recorded 77 deaths and 934 cases in the cholera outbreak," said
Adamawa information commissioner Musa Bubakari by telephone from
Yola, the state capital, which shares border with Taraba state.

23 of the 600 people who recently contracted cholera in the Biu Local
Government area of Borno State are dead, the director of disease
control in the Borno State ministry of health, Abdullah Sadiq, has
said. Mr. Sadiq, who was at the cholera isolation camp situated in
Biu, last Sunday [4 Oct 2009] when NEXT visited, said some of the
patients were already treated and discharged. About 60 patients are
currently on admission, where oral therapy is being administered on them.

The Borno health official, who blamed the outbreak on the poor
sanitary habits of some residents of the area, also revealed that
specimen analysis at the Maiduguri Teaching hospital confirmed that
the disease is indeed cholera.

A source at the ministry of health said the disease has spread to 6
out of the 9 local government areas of southern Borno. The state has
also recorded a total of 32 death from it.

A team from Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) has camped in Marsabit
South district to avert the spread of cholera, which has left 15
people dead. MSF, also known as Doctors without Borders, had
disbanded its 1st camp on 24 Sep 2009 at Moite village in
Loiyangalani division where 11 people died from the disease. The same
disease started to spread in El-Molo Bay location. In 3 days, 3
people had succumbed to cholera. At the same time, a pregnant woman
succumbed to the disease in Moite village.

"Those who have died in El-Molo Bay are children under 15 years. We
also have others who are admitted and the disease is spreading fast
to other areas," local public health officer Lemaiyon Lenamira told
the Nation by telephone. He said a doctor from MSF and a medical
staff from the office of the local Medical Officer of Health (MOH)
have been sent to Moite to assess the situation following the death
of the pregnant woman. He added that their report will determine
whether they will return to the place.

Cholera had been reported in Marsabit South district earlier in 2009
when 18 people died after contracting it.
