After the attack on the Pusuk village, Kecamatan Kelapa, outbreaks of
chikungunya [virus] again attacked residents of several villages.
Around 41 residents in the Village District Pangkalberas developed
symptoms such as sudden paralysis, and fell ill with fever due to
chikungunya [virus infection], during the last 3 days.

The survey results that have been done in the last 2 days have found
that there are 41 people who have clinically exhibited symptoms
indicating that they were infected by chikungunya [virus]. The
estimated number of chikungunya cases has not increased since then.
Spraying (fogging) of mosquito breeding sites has been conducted, and
health personnel have counselled the residents in the area of the
occurrence of chikungunya cases.

[The "sudden paralysis" mentioned in the above report is doubtless
due to the acute and very painful arthralgia that characterizes
chikungunya virus infections, making infected people unwilling to
move. However, there is no indication that these cases were
laboratory confirmed chikungunya virus infections.
