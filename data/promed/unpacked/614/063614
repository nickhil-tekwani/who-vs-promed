LEISHMANIASIS, VISCERAL - CHINA (FUJIAN, HUBEI EX XINJIANG): CORRECTION
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

The original posting had 2 reports on leishmaniasis. One report was
on an imported case, with infection occurring in Xinjiang, but was
diagnosed on return to Hubei province. The other report was in an
individual from Fujian province without a stated travel history to a
known endemic region in China.
The moderator's comment stated:
"If this case was infected in Eastern China (Xianjian), it seems that
leishmaniasis is more widespread in the country than previously thought."
This editor erroneously inserted (Xianjiang) in the moderator's
comment above where it should have read:
"If this case was infected in Eastern China (Fujian) it seems that
leishmaniasis is more widespread in the country than previously thought."
Xianjiang is in far Western China, whereas Fujian province is on the
Eastern Coast of China.
This editor would like to thank Dan Silver for pointing out this
error, and would like to apologize for any confusion this error may
have caused.
