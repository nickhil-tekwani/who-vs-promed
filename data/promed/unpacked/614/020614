Update on Recommendations for the Use of Rotavirus Vaccines
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating its
recommendations on both Rotarix and RotaTeq, vaccines for the
prevention of rotavirus disease in infants. Based on careful
evaluation of a variety of scientific information, the FDA has
determined it is appropriate for clinicians and health care
professionals to resume the use of Rotarix and to continue the use of RotaTeq.

Background: On 22 Mar 2010, the FDA provided an early communication
regarding Rotarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK).
At that time, the FDA recommended that clinicians and public health
professionals in the United States temporarily suspend the use of
Rotarix while the agency and manufacturer investigated the finding of
DNA from porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) in the vaccine. Since that
time, both FDA and GSK have confirmed the presence of PCV1 in the vaccine.

On 6 May 2010, the FDA provided information about RotaTeq,
manufactured by Merck & Co, Inc. The FDA indicated that preliminary
studies conducted by Merck identified fragments of DNA from PCV1 and
from a related porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in RotaTeq. The FDA
noted that it would seek input from its Vaccines and Related
Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and provide updates
in the near future.

Updated Recommendations: The FDA has evaluated laboratory results
from the manufacturers and its own laboratories. In addition, the
FDA's VRBPAC was convened on 7 May 2010 to discuss the findings of
PCV and PCV DNA in rotavirus vaccines. Based on a careful evaluation
of this information, a thorough review of the scientific literature,
and input from scientific and public health experts, the Agency is
revising its recommendation to temporarily suspend use of the Rotarix
vaccine. The FDA has determined it is appropriate for clinicians and
health care professionals to resume the use of Rotarix and to
continue the use of RotaTeq.

The FDA considered the following information in its decision:

- Both vaccines have strong safety records, including clinical trials
involving tens of thousands of patients as well as clinical
experience with millions of recipients. The FDA has no evidence that
either PCV1 or PCV2 poses a safety risk in humans, and notes that
neither is known to cause infection or illness in humans.

- The benefits of the vaccines are substantial, and include
prevention of hospitalization for severe rotavirus disease in the
U.S. and of death in other parts of the world. The benefits of the
vaccines, which are known, outweigh the risk, which is theoretical.

The FDA is working with each of the manufacturers (GSK and Merck) to
update the labeling for both Rotarix and RotaTeq vaccines to include
information about the presence of PCV1 (Rotarix) and DNA from PCV1
and PCV2 (RotaTeq) in the vaccines. The FDA is working with each of
the manufacturers to plan the appropriate follow up studies, taking
into account the input received from members of the VRBPAC on 7 May
2010. The FDA and the manufacturers will continue to investigate the
findings of PCV in rotavirus vaccines, and will evaluate information
from ongoing testing by the FDA and the manufacturers. As noted by
the firm during the 7 May 2010 VRBPAC meeting, GSK plans to rederive
its vaccine, in consultation with the FDA. Merck is in the early
stages of its investigation, and has not yet determined next steps in
this regard.

[Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe diarrhea and dehydration
in young infants worldwide. These viruses are estimated to be
responsible for the deaths of more than 500 000 infants worldwide
each year, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. Before the
introduction of rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus resulted in an estimated
55 000-70 000 hospitalizations and dozens of deaths in the U.S. each year.

Rotavirus infects the intestines. The disease usually starts with
fever, an upset stomach, and vomiting, followed by diarrhea. The
disease generally lasts 3-8 days. There is no specific treatment for
the rotavirus infection. The most serious problem caused by the
disease is dehydration, so symptoms are treated by rehydration.
Severe cases require administration of intravenous fluids in a hospital.

It has been concluded that the presence of porcine circovirus type 1
(Rotarix) and DNA from porcine circovirus types 1 and 2 (RotaTeq) in
the vaccines will have no deleterious consequences. Consequently this
thread is cut, and hopefully it will remain cut. - Mod.CP]
