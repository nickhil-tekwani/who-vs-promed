The Netherlands: Third Imported Case of West Nile Virus Infection
----------------------------------------------------
[Peter Vermij, a science reporter covering (mostly) the US for Dutch
newspapers, has forwarded to ProMD-mail this account of a previously
unreported case of West Nile virus infection imported into the Netherlands
from the US. - Mod.CP]
A distant family member came down with fever and flaccid paralysis while
visiting Kansas this summer. I alerted her physician in the Netherlands to
the possibility of West Nile virus infection. (She did not consult a
physician in the U.S. but flew right back.) On return to the Netherlands
she was quickly diagnosed as a case of West Nile virus infection. She is
currently in a rehabilitation center, still suffering from West Nile
virus-associated flaccid paralysis. I understand that she is the 3rd
imported case of West Nile virus infection in the Netherlands.

[This case does not appear to have been recorded on the Kansas state
web-site nor included in CDC-ArboNET surveillance data. ProMED-mail
appreciates Peter Vermij's initiative in drawing attention to this
case. As far as I am aware, indigenous human cases of West Nile virus
infection have not been recorded in the Netherlands. Additional information
from the Netherlands would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
