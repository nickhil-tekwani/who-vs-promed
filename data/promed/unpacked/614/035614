Vanuatu's Agricultural Research and Technical Centre is hiring a yam expert to help combat a disease affecting the country's crop. Dr Ambraham Kuthomathatadil has been hired to breed yam varieties resistant to the common anthracnose disease.

The centre's director, Roger Malapa, says breeding hybrid yams will also be an important step in helping farmers overcome climate change factors affecting yam crops. Dr Kuthomathatadil will also teach students how to breed yams.

[Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the West Indies and parts of Asia and southern America. Anthracnose is one of the most serious diseases of the crop, especially _D. alata_ and _D. rotundata_, and is a limiting factor for production of these crops worldwide. It is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_). _C. truncatum_ may also be present in infected tissue, but its role in anthracnose etiology remains unclear. The disease affects leaves, vines and tubers. Symptoms include rapidly expanding brown/black leaf lesions, necrosis, defoliation and dieback of the entire plant, orange-brown tuber rots, and small blisters on the tuber surface. Reduced photosynthesis leads to undersized yams.

The fungus is spread mainly by infected plant material, seed tubers, mechanical means and splashing rain. It has a long saprophytic survival ability on crop residues. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, cultural techniques (including crop rotation or fallow periods between yam crops), phytosanitation and resistant varieties. Fungicides can delay the onset of epidemics but usually cannot prevent their development during the rainy season.

_C. gloeosporioides_ and related species have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.
