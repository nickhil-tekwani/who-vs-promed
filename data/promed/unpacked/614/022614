Since methemoglobin is generated physiologically and is normally found in
the body, albeit at low levels, it is inaccurate to call it an abnormal
hemoglobin. What is abnormal is the quantity found in the blood.

Re: Comments on nitrites and infants (Toxic ingestion, sodium nitrite - USA
(New York) (02) 20020523.4301): "Preserved meats such as ham, lunch meats,
bacon, and hot dogs are high in nitrates and nitrites and should never be
pureed and added to baby food for young infants. Further, foods containing
these products should not be saved in the refrigerator for older infants."
1. Processed meats, with the exception of dry sausage (salami, pepperoni,
etc.) and dry-cured hams, use only sodium nitrite and not nitrates. The
usage level of sodium nitrite is limited in the United States in all meat
products to 156 parts per million (ppm) sodium nitrite based on meat
weight. In meat, the nitrite is bound to the myoglobin in the meat and
would therefore not be an issue in methemoglobinemia.
2. Since some catastrophes occurred in the early part of the 20th century
when sodium nitrite was substituted for sodium chloride in sausage
manufacturing, most meat companies in the world don't use pure sodium
nitrite any more. They typically use a 6--6.25 per cent sodium
nitrite/sodium chloride mixture, which is then dyed pink to distinguish it
from common salt.
3. The presumed LD50 for nitrite in infants is 1 g. It is physically
impossible to ingest enough processed meats to get anywhere close to this
dose. Also, as mentioned in 1) above, the nitrite in meat is bound, so is
not available for toxic effects with hemoglobin.
4. If bacteria were to break down the nitrosohemochrome into free sodium
nitrite, then you would notice that the characteristic pink color would
also have faded from the food. So long as the meat still looks like cured
meat, the nitrite is still bound.

[Thank you Drs Frankel and LaBudde for your comments and corrections.
Unless there is further information related to this outbreak of accidental
poisoning in New York due to sodium nitrite having been mislabeled as table
salt and used in cooking, it seems prudent to cut this thread at this
point. - Mod.MPP]
