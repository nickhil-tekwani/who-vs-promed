Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; introduction of new live animals; legal movement of animals; illegal movement of animals; swill feeding; fomites (human, vehicles, feed, etc.)
Epidemiological comments: in March [2014], following an unusual acute diarrhea in pigs (diarrhea and death in piglets), the Colombian Agricultural Institute [ICA] implemented the following measures in order to identify the disease and control it: health emergency status, quarantine on suspected premises, cleaning and disinfection, movement control, enhanced biosecurity measures, ban on animal gathering, active surveillance, inclusion in the information system as a notifiable disease and epidemiological surveillance, among others. There have been 45 outbreaks affecting commercial and backyard farms mainly in the Departments of Cundinamarca and Huila (42 outbreaks) as well as one sporadic outbreak each in the Departments of Tolima, Boyaca, and Santander. Low morbidity and mortality rates are observed, very different from those observed in other countries as United States of America, Canada, and Mexico, and farms recover their production levels in less than 2 weeks. As it is a disease never observed in the country, samples were sent to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in the United States of America in order to confirm the causal agent by RRT-PCR, virus isolation and sequencing. On 6 Jun 2014, the USDA confirmed in a preliminary report by RRT-PCR and sequencing that samples submitted were similar to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus reported in the United States of America but different to the virus observed in Asia.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; treatment of affected animals (symptomatic)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Plum Island Animal Disease Center (USA) (foreign laboratory) / swine / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 8 May 2014 / Positive
Plum Island Animal Disease Center (USA) (foreign laboratory) / swine / virus sequencing / 6 Jun 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[With this report Colombia officially confirms the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in its territory. See TG's commentaries in ProMED-mail archive no 20140319.2341300.

Colombia becomes the 1st country in South America to report PEDv to the OIE as an "emerging disease". - Mod.CRD
