The Ministry of Health and Social Services today [Wed 4 Apr 2018] confirmed that the 37-year-old Keetmanshoop man who last week tested positive for Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever, known more as Congo fever, died on [Tue 3 Apr 2018] morning.

According to a statement signed by Dr Bernard Haufiku, the Minister of Health and Social Services, the man contracted the virus while assisting a neighbour with slaughtering a cow that was reportedly infested with ticks on Independence Day.

Up to 6 days later, he sought medical attention for symptoms related to the virus.
"He was later transferred to Windhoek Central Hospital's isolation unit on [Fri 30 Mar 2018] after he tested positive for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever for further management," said Haufiku. Unfortunately, the man died at around 0500 hrs on [Tue 3 Apr 2018] morning, Haufiku added. "The ministry wishes to convey its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family and friends," he said.

[The exact location where this patient got infected is not clear from the report. The probable source of exposure, i.e. blood from an infected cow is however mentioned in the report. Domestic livestock are regarded as the main hosts of the disease and can transfer the disease during their viremic stage to humans. High-risk behaviors, such as slaughtering, animal handling and/or examining livestock without wearing masks or gloves, and unauthorized slaughtering of animals, facilitate the transmission of the disease [DOI: 10.1309/LMN1P2FRZ7BKZSCO]

Windhoek is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Namibia. It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area, at around 1700 metres (5600 ft) above sea level.
