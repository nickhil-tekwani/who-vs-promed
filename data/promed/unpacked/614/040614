UN body says H5N1 bird flu found on Lao farm
-----------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been found on a poultry farm in Laos, the
country's 1st major outbreak since 2004, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Friday [28 Jul 2006].
The outbreak occurred on a commercial farm 25 km (15 miles) south of
Vientiane, where about 2500 chickens died last week, according to
state media reports.
The same farm experienced an outbreak in early 2004, when the virus
swept through parts of Asia, including Communist-led Laos, where most
of its 5.6 million people live in remote rural areas.
Since then, the only previous discovery of the H5N1 virus in Laos had
been in a single duck in May this year [2006].
"The government of Laos has taken immediate action to control the
spread of the virus by culling all chickens in the farm, disinfecting
the farm and imposed movement restrictions within the 5-km
surveillance zone," said Wantanee Kalpravidh, FAO regional
coordinator for Avian Influenza Projects.
FAO and Lao investigators were scouring the area for the source of
the outbreak.
"We have not had anything like this since 2004, so now we have to
find where it comes from and make sure it doesn't continue," FAO
technical adviser Ricarda Mondry told Reuters by telephone from Vientiane.
State media reported the H5 subtype was 1st detected on the Dongbang
poultry farm in Xaythany district on 18 Jul 2006. A Thai lab
confirmed later the virus was H5N1.
Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh has ordered officials to step up
surveillance, tighten border inspection of imported poultry and warn
the public "about the grave danger posed by the disease," the
Vientiane Times newspaper said.
Laos has reported no human cases of bird flu, but earlier this week,
the virus killed a teenager in neighboring Thailand, where H5N1
recurred after an 8-month lull.
Health experts consider impoverished Laos a weak link in the global
fight against the virus, which has killed at least 133 people worldwide.
With help from foreign donors, including a USD 3.4 million grant from
the United States last year [2005], Laos drew up a national bird flu
strategy that was approved by the government in January 2006.
But Laos still lacked an active avian influenza surveillance system,
said the FAO, which is working with other international agencies to
strengthen the country's capacity to fight bird flu.
Experts fear that a human outbreak in poor countries such as Laos and
Cambodia -- where basic health care barely exists outside urban areas
-- would not be detected until it's too late.

Close inspection for bird flu in Thai North
-----------------------------------------------
Following confirmation of the latest bird flu case in Thailand,
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan Thursday [27
Jul 2006] ordered agencies responsible for bird flu control to
intensify their examination for the avian influenza virus in the
country's lower North, especially areas having previous experiences
of bird flu outbreaks.
The Public Health Ministry confirmed on Wednesday [26 Jul 2006] that
a young man, aged 17, who died in Phichit Province recently had been
infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus after having direct contact
with a dead chicken and not notifying the authorities.
The victim was the 1st human bird flu patient in the kingdom during
the past one and a half years, since February 2005.
Khunying Sudarat, who Thursday [27 Jul 2006] traveled to Phitsunulok,
where she chaired a meeting of heads of livestock and public health
offices from 7 provinces in the lower North, said she had ordered a
thorough examination and monitoring for bird flu in all vulnerable
areas previously affected by bird flu outbreaks.
In areas where poultry die from unknown causes, the living fowl
remaining within a one-km radius must be culled, and samples must be
sent for lab tests.
Implementations in each location must be complete within 5 days from
Thursday [27 Jul 2006], as in the next 2 months, there will be
another risk factor of bird flu outbreak in the region, that is an
annual influx of immigrant birds, the minister said.
However, due to the nature of migrating wild birds, areas which are
avian-influenza-free on one day can be contaminated the following day.
Meanwhile, the minister said that she had assigned the Agriculture
and Cooperatives vice minister and Livestock Department head to
remain in Phitsanulok to follow up the bird flu situation and give
advice to livestock officials in bird flu-prone areas.
