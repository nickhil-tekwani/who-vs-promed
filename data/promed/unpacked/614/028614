[In Svalbard, there have been several cases reported among the Svalbard reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus plathyrynchus_), and also there are reported cases among reindeer from Russia. The arctic fox is the main host of the virus in the region. Reindeer might have become infected after being bitten by rabid foxes. - Mod.PMB]

[Svalbard, formerly Spitsbergen and still the name of its largest island, is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, located north of mainland Europe, about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard). - Mod.ML
