Russia and Kazakhstan have reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks in poultry, Russia's involving H5N8 and Kazakhstan's due to an H5 virus, according to the latest notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

In Russia, animal health officials have reported 4 more H5N8 outbreaks, all in backyard birds in earlier affected oblasts in the south western part of the country: Kurgan, Tyumen, and Omsk. The outbreaks began from 23 to 25 Sep 2020, killing 234 of 5222 susceptible birds. The survivors were slated for culling.

In neighboring Kazakhstan, veterinary officials have reported 3 more H5 outbreaks, all in backyard poultry in 3 different regions: Kostanay, Akmola, and Pavlodar. All are in the north-central part of the country. The outbreaks started from 17 to 25 Sep 2020, killing 108 of 191 susceptible birds. The rest were destroyed as part of the outbreak response.

The events are part of a small but steady stream of outbreaks that began in Russia over the summer [2020], and European agriculture officials have urged poultry owners to be on the alert because of the risk of the virus spreading by migratory waterfowl.

[Each of the 2 mentioned new follow-up reports, one from Russia and the other one from Kazakhstan, includes an interactive map indicating the locations of the new HPAI outbreaks. Most likely, the outbreaks in Kazakhstan are caused by the same virus strain identified in Russia (territories bordering north Kazakhstan), namely HPAI H5N8.

Following the recent reporting of HPAI H5 from Kazakhstan, the country's self-declared freedom of HPAI, published by the OIE on 9 Dec 2018, has been inactivated as of 11 Sep 2020; see "Kazakhstan" in OIE's table of self-declarations, available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Self-declarations/Archives/ENG_archive_2000_September_2020.pdf.
