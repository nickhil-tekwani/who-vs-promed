Another foot and mouth outbreak reported in Russia
-----------------------------------------------
Russian health officials were checking on Friday [26 Aug 2005] on reports
of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in another region in the
country's far east.
Last week [3rd week August 2005], FMD was found in 2 settlements in
Russia's Khabarovsk region, where farmers were due to slaughter dozens of
cows to stop the disease from spreading.
Itar-Tass news agency reported that FMD may have spread to the neighboring
Primorsk region on the Pacific coast, where 15 cows in the village of
Krasny Kut had shown symptoms similar to those of foot and mouth disease.
The Emergencies Ministry's office in the region was unavailable for comment.
Foot and mouth disease does not harm humans, but it is highly contagious
among cattle, affecting reproduction and reducing meat output.
Russia is already busy trying to contain an outbreak of the deadly bird flu
disease, which has swept 6 Siberian regions since mid-July 2005.

Foot and mouth disease: Khabarovsk and Primorskiy regions, far east Russia
-----------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has spread from the Khabarovsk to the
Primorski region. 15 cows with symptoms similar to those of FMD have been
found in the village Krasniy Kut of the Spasskiy district, Primorskiy
region, the press-service of the regional management of the Ministry of
extreme situations reported on Friday [26 Aug 2005].
In territory of the Spasskiy district, an extreme situation has been
declared, while in the village of Krasniy, a quarantine has been
implemented. The village is located 2 km from the Vladivostok-Khabarovsk
highway on an access road. A disinfection barrier has been placed around
the village, according to a statement made at a press conference today [26
Aug 2005] in Vladivostok by representatives of the regional commission on
extreme situations.
Initial word of the 15 sick cows in village Krasniy was received on the
morning of Friday [26 Aug 2005]. Experts who arrived on the scene
determined, after visual inspection, that the animals had fallen ill with
FMD. They found 18 sick animals out of 140 cows. Final lab results will not
be available until Sat 27 Aug 2005, following analysis by the Moscow
veterinary laboratory, where the tests are being done.
Presently in Krasniy village, all animals have been transferred to a
maintenance stall. In the opinion of experts, the disease seems to be
locally restricted and does not represent a danger to other territories in
the region. At present, the experts do not see a need to slaughter cattle.
As Victor Volkov, deputy of the main veterinary inspector of the Primorskiy
region, stated, cattle in the Primorskiy region were not vaccinated against
the FMD type Asia-1 virus. A request for about 100 000 doses of vaccine was
sent at the beginning of this week [4th week August 2005]. After it has
been received, it will be possible to vaccinate all of the cattle in the
Primorskiy region within 2 weeks.
2 more foci of FMD have been found in the Khabarovsk region. 10 cows with
typical symptoms of FMD have been found in the village of Lonchakovo, in
the Vjazemskiy district. Some sick animals appeared also on a frontier post
near the village of Venjukovo. Cattle struck with the FMD type Asia-1 virus
have been found also in the villages of Vidnooe and Sheremetyevo of this
district.
In all villages put under quarantine, it is forbidden to export livestock
products. Disinfecting barriers have been established.
Vaccination of cattle on farms and in private enterprises has been carried
out. According to sanitary-veterinary specifications, all infected cattle
should be destroyed. The damage in the farm of Lermontovskoye alone is
estimated at not less than 500 000 rubles [USD 17 600], according to
Nikolay Kologrov, the Minister of Agriculture of the region. Consequences
of an infection are especially heavy for inhabitants of small villages
where there are no enterprises and where people are dependent upon their
own farm's milk production.
The Khabarovsk region, where there was a outbreak of FMD in 4 villages, has
an acute deficiency of vaccine against viruses such as Asia-1, which was
revealed in the current outbreak. "We are in need of 100 000 cattle doses
and 100 000 pig doses of the vaccine," Svetlana Samojlenko, the head of the
department of veterinary science of the regional Ministry of Agriculture,
said on Friday [26 Aug 2005]. She said also that the Federal service on
veterinary and phytosanitary control is expected to supply the vaccine to
the region.
The chief of the regional management of veterinary science has stated that
the decision to kill 106 sick cows at Lermontovskoye, in the Bikinskiy
district, has been approved.
"...the virus [has been] found in the next villages: 17 cows in private
farmsteads in [the] village of Vidnoye, 19 heads in [the] village of
Sheremetyevo, and 9 in the village of Lonchakovo in the Vjazemskiy
district," Samojlenko said. Destruction of animals in the private
farmsteads has yet not begun, as they are near the border, a zone closed to
visitors, Samojlenko added.

[Primorski Krai (region) is in far east Russia along the Sea of Japan. It
borders China on the south, southwest, the west and northwest. In the
north, it borders the Khabarovsk region and in the extreme south, the
Democratic Republic of Korea. The total area of the region is 165 900
square km., and the population is 2 071 200. - Mod.NP]
[It may be assumed that the eradication of this outbreak requires special
efforts, particularly in view of the distance from laboratories and
centers, and the complex border situation. An official update from the
Russian veterinary services is long overdue. - Mod.AS]
