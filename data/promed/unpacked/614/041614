This time, health authorities will not mince words. The risk of a
chikungunya epidemic is "extreme". The virus is there and the
population is not immune. "There's a choice, either everyone pushes
the envelope and avoids the epidemic," or "it can burn," warned Dr
Jean-Paul Grangeon, head of public health in the Dass-NC (Direction
des affaires sanitaires et sociales de Nouvelle- Caledonie;
Directorate of Health and Social Affairs of New Caledonia).

The 1st case of "autochthonous" [locally acquired] chikungunya was
diagnosed yesterday [3 Mar 2011] evening: the patient lives in Noumea
and was infected without leaving the Territory. This was the 3rd
person affected overall. The routing of the virus was direct and
quick. "The 1st person who returned from Indonesia infected with the
chikungunya visited Farino. There, a relative was bitten by a mosquito
that had bitten the patient. This person came to the area of Noumea,
carrying the virus, and was bitten by a mosquito, which went to infect
a 3rd person." This person was seen by a doctor yesterday, the
bioassay of chikungunya was immediately performed, and the result was
positive last night.

"We have already carried out anti-mosquito spraying in Farino and in
the neighborhood of Valleedes-Settlers in Noumea," said Dr Grangeon.
"But it is important that tomorrow (today) everyone cleans his garden
and his house, as there is more than one breeding site" in the area.

From this morning, repellents will be distributed to all physicians
in Noumea. "If a patient has fever, he must immediately apply insect
repellant to himself and his family," said Dr Grangeon. The repellent
will, of course, not the bring the fever down, but will prevent the
rapid spread of chikungunya by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. The virus
can be present in the blood for 5 to 7 days.

"Patients with a fever should be seen immediately," said Dr Grangeon.
Sudden fever and joint pain in the extremities (wrists, ankles,
knuckles) are the 1st symptoms. They strongly resemble those of
dengue, but the consequences can be far more serious because we have
no immunity to chikungunya [virus].

In 2006, the island of Reunion faced a massive outbreak of
chikungunya, for which it was unprepared. There was a small wave in
late 2005, then a flood in February 2006, with 42 000 estimated new
cases per week, the worst of the epidemic. According to data from the
National Institute of Health Surveillance (INVS), 266 000 people were
infected, more than a 3rd of the population. 246 patients were under
hospital treatment in intensive care. Between January 2006 and
December of that year, the French lâInstitut de veille sanitaire
[Institute for Public Health Surveillance] reported that chikungunya
had been cited as the cause of death on 252 death certificates.
Three-quarters of the deaths were among people aged over 70 years.

[The concern about imported chikungunya cases (from Indonesia in this
instance) has turned out to be justified. One hopes that this 1st
locally acquired chikungunya virus infection is not the harbinger of
other cases yet to come.
