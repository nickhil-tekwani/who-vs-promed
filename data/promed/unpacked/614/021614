[Sheep pox and goat pox are OIE-listed serious viral diseases of sheep and goats, found in parts of Africa and Asia, the Middle East, most of the Indian subcontinent and parts of China.

The diseases are characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, which can infect sheep and goats, but the clinical manifestations in the 2 animal species can differ significantly. There are virus strains that clinically affect sheep only; others may affect sheep and goats similarly; and there are capripoxvirus strains that affect only goats. The current outbreak in Greece seems to be restricted to sheep.

The diagnosis is generally based upon clinical observations. For pictures, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/disease-images.php?name=sheep-pox-and-goat-pox&lang=en. When laboratory confirmation is required, the methods applied are electron microscopy, virus isolation, antigen detection, histology, and animal inoculations. Details are available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf.

The current outbreak, in north-east Greece, is situated very close to the border with Turkey's Thrace region (see map at the source URL).

Sheep pox is endemic in Turkey; during 2012, 74 new outbreaks were reported; more than 3 million animals were vaccinated. - Mod.AS
