1st report of Papaya ringspot virus-W in bottlegourd (_Lagenaria
siceraria_) from India
-----------------------------------------------
N.L. Mantri, Division of Molecular Virology, Mahyco Research Center,
Dawalwadi, Jalna - 431203. Maharashtra State, India; A.S. Kitkatu (as
for Mantri); M.B. Misal, Deparment of Genetics and Plant Breeding,
Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani - 431401, India; and
K.S. Ravi <Ravi.Kankanallu@mahyco.com>. Accepted for publication 22
Dec 2004.
Bottlegourd (_Lagenaria siceraria_) is an important vegetable crop of
the _Cucurbitaceae_. In recent years, mosaic disease has been one of
the major constraints to the cultivation of this crop in Maharashtra
State. Surveys indicate that bottlegourd mosaic disease is endemic in
the Nasik, Ahmednagar and Pune regions of the state, where the
incidence varies from 10 to 100 percent.
A representative bottlegourd mosaic isolate -- (BgM-NW-3) collected
from Wadner, Nasik -- was studied. It produced characteristic
symptoms of mosaic: mottling, interveinal chlorotic bands, leaf
distortion, fruit malformation and reduction in fruit size. In severe
infections, surface blisters on fruit are a common occurrence.
The virus was transmitted by mechanical inoculation and also by the
aphid vector _Aphis gossypii_. It produced systemic mosaic mottling
symptoms in 11 cucurbitaceous and 3 solanaceous hosts but failed to
infect leguminous ones.
ELISA testing using 16 antisera from 5 distinct virus groups (poty-,
cucumo-, tobomo-, tospo- and ilarviruses) revealed that the virus
isolate reacted strongly to Papaya ringspot virus (P and W strains)
in addition to weaker reactions with 3 other potyvirus antisera:
Tobacco etch virus, Chilli veinal mottle virus and Potato virus Y. It
failed to react to Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) antiserum.
Electron microscopy of purified preparations of BgM-NW-3 revealed
typical potyvirus-like flexuous particles of 750-780 nm long and
11-13 nm wide. The same preparations were decorated with PRSV-W
antiserum after immunosorbent electron microscopy. Representative
field isolates collected from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka
and Chattisgarh tested positive for PRSV but negative for ZYMV by
DAS-ELISA.
Cross-inoculation studies showed that a PRSV-P isolate from papaya
infected bottlegourd but failed to infect Papaya, indicating that the
virus isolate is a cucurbit isolate (W) and not a papaya isolate (P).
In addition, _Beta vulgaris_, a non-host for PRSV-W, failed to infect
that plant species.
These results indicate that the bottlegourd mosaic virus isolated
from Nasik and other regions is a potyvirus closely related to PRSV-W
and distinct from the virus previously reported by Verma et al.
(2004).

[Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV-W) infects only hosts in the
_Cucurbitaceae_. PRSV-W is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent
manner, following acquisition of virus particles from a host
reservoir, and are capable of transmitting it for 10-15 minutes in
most cases. PRSV-W has been reported from Hawaii, Taiwan, Brazil,
Thailand, the Caribbean islands and the Philippines. It is the major
limiting factor in production of the crop. Disease management
includes (1) the application of quarantine measures (prevention of
the introduction of infected plants into a clean area; (2) preventing
movement of papaya plants from areas known to be infected with the
virus; (3) roguing of infected plants; and (4) use of tolerant and
resistant cultivars which do not produce severe symptoms.
