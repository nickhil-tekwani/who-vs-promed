Hospitalisation associated with the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, 2005-2010: (Yang L, Wang XL, Chan KP, Cao PH, Lau HY, Peiris JS, Wong CM. Hospitalisation associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, 2005 to 2010. Euro Surveill. 2012;17(45):pii=20309.)
-----------------------------------------------
Abbreviated Summary:
Reliable estimates of the morbidity burden caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) are important for assessing the severity of the pandemic. Poisson regression models were fitted to weekly numbers of cause-specific hospitalisation in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2010. Excess hospitalisation associated with the 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza outbreaks was derived from the model by incorporating the proxy variables of weekly proportions of specimens positive for the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), seasonal influenza A (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1) and influenza B viruses. Compared with seasonal influenza, pH1N1 influenza was associated with higher hospitalisation rates for acute respiratory disease (ARD) among children younger than 18 years and adults aged between 18 and 64 years, but among the elderly aged 65 years and older, the hospitalisation rates were lower for pH1N1 than for seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza. Hospitalisation rates for chronic diseases associated with pH1N1 influenza were generally higher than those associated with seasonal influenza. The reported hospitalised cases with laboratory-confirmed pandemic infections accounted for only 16 percent of pH1N1 influenza-associated hospitalisations for ARD [acute respiratory disease] in the age group 75 years and older, and 5-66 percent of hospitalisations for chronic diseases in those older than 40 years. Given the potential underreporting of pandemic cases, the authors have compared excess hospitalisation associated with seasonal and pandemic influenza in order to assess the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. They have employed Poisson models to obtain reliable estimates for the true morbidity burden of seasonal influenza.

The authors have estimated that during the pandemic period of May 2009 to February 2010, 7856 admissions for ARD in children and adults younger than 65 years were attributable to pH1N1 infections. This estimate was close to the total number of 6657 laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases hospitalised for ARD in Hong Kong. The close match between model-derived and laboratory-confirmed cases in young age groups is not surprising, as they were immediately identified as high risk groups at the beginning and underwent intensive laboratory screening for pH1N1 infections throughout the pandemic period.

The authors found that in the estimated old population groups, excess hospitalisations associated with pH1N1 were dramatically higher than the numbers of confirmed hospitalised cases, for both acute and chronic diseases. This was in agreement with previous findings that the mortality burden of pH1N1 in children and young adults was fully captured by intensive screening but seriously underreported in the elderly. It was speculated that this might be due to their low antibody and viral titres after infection or the time lag between primary infection and hospital admission for exacerbated underlying conditions. To capture these cases, it may be necessary to enhance surveillance at the community level so as not to miss the time when the symptoms of primary infection are evident.

The authors report that a shift in the age of severe and fatal cases towards younger age groups has been observed in historical influenza pandemics. Consistent with many other studies, the authors report that their estimates demonstrated that for ARD, the influenza A(pH1N1)pdm09 virus was associated with dramatically elevated excess hospitalisation in children and young adults compared with the seasonal viruses, whereas its impact on the elderly was less than that of influenza A(H3N2), although comparable to sH1N1 and influenza B. A study in Denmark also found significantly higher hospitalisation rates for pH1N1 among persons younger than 65 years, but the rates among the elderly were similar for the pandemic and seasonal viruses. That elderly are less affected by pH1N1 infection could be explained by their preexisting immunity against pH1N1. Despite a low attack rate of pH1N1 in elderly people in Hong Kong living in the community, a large proportion of the hospitalised and fatal cases still occurred in old people, who had markedly higher case-intensive care unit and case-fatality rates.

H3N2 viruses were believed to have more frequent antigenic drift than sH1N1 and influenza B. Previous studies have demonstrated that influenza was associated with markedly more morbidity and mortality during the H3N2-dominated years than during the years dominated by sH1N1 or influenza B. By simultaneously adding the different virus proxies, regression models allow the separate assessment of the disease burden caused by different influenza types or subtypes.

An increased morbidity burden in recent years may not be solely due to more virulent virus strains, as the authors did not observe any obvious increase in excess mortality associated with influenza in Hong Kong since 1998, except in 2007, when a novel H3N2 strain A/Brisbane/59/2007-like emerged. Instead, this increase is more likely the result of expanding health service capacities and lowering admission criteria due to the aging population of Hong Kong.

The authors' conclude, among other things, that compared with seasonal influenza viruses, the pH1N1 virus was associated with dramatically increased hospitalisation risk among children and young adults. Although the attack rate of the pandemic was relatively low in the elderly, their risk of hospitalisation was comparable to the inter-pandemic years and seriously underreported by the clinical surveillance. This highlights the need to enhance community surveillance on pandemic outbreaks among the elderly. Our study provides an approach for reliable assessment of pandemic severity and also a piece of critical evidence for proper evaluation of control measures implemented during the pandemic.

[The authors report that, compared with seasonal influenza, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza was associated with higher hospitalisation rates for acute respiratory disease among children younger than 18 years and adults aged between 18 and 64 years, but among the elderly aged 65 years and older, the hospitalisation rates were lower for pH1N1 than for seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza. In Hong Kong, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was associated with a dramatically increased risk of hospitalisation among children and young adults. The morbidity burden of the pandemic was underreported in old people and in those with chronic conditions.
