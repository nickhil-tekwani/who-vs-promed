Germany recorded the highest number of syphilis cases in 2014 that the country has seen in the past decade. Germany had 5722 new cases of syphilis in 2014 -- an increase of 14 percent over 2013, according to a new report by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).

The number of syphilis cases in Germany has been increasing each year since 2010, after spread of the infection started to stagnate and even slightly decline in the mid-2000s. The first half of 2015 also seemed to show a continued increase in cases, the report said.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is contracted through sexual contact, as well as from mother to child at birth. The infection has various stages, the 1st of which is characterized by sores, the 2nd by a skin rash and sometimes fever. Untreated cases can lead to death.

The institute said in the report published on Monday [7 Dec 2015] that most of the spread of the STI was between men, or 84 percent of new cases. The vast majority of patients with syphilis were men, with women making up just 6.3 percent of new cases, a slight decrease from 2013 to 2014.

The influence of party drugs could be a cause for the increase in cases, said Professor Norbert Brockmeyer, president of the German Society for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (DSTIG). Such drugs may reduce the user's awareness of possible risks, he argues.

The report also showed a great geographical variance across the country in terms of which regions had the most cases. Berlin [this city is among the 16 states of Germany] had by far the highest proportion of syphilis cases across the 16 states, with 31 diagnoses for every 100 000 residents. In comparison, the country average was 7.1 cases for every 100 000 residents. Meanwhile, the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, had one of the lowest rates at about half the national average, along with Thuringia and Schleswig-Holstein. Hamburg had the 2nd-highest rate at 19.7 cases per 100,000. All other states had rates of 7.2 per 100 000 or less. Big cities across the country had higher than average rates of syphilis, with Cologne (31.9 cases per 100 000) and Munich (27.2) also recording high incidences. But a 3rd of the cases nationwide happened in towns with fewer than 100 000 citizens.

[ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increased incidence of syphilis in many countries, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and is characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. The increased syphilis incidence has been attributed to a variety of causes that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", multiple anonymous sex partners, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous "hookups", etc. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

As for Germany, ProMED-mail previously reported that after a period of low syphilis incidence during the 1990s, the incidence of syphilis began to increase nationwide in 2001 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=2759). At the time of that report (2005), the increase had continued after the introduction of the new reporting system from physician- to laboratory-based reporting in 2001, with only a very slight increase in the number of participating laboratories, reflecting an true rise in the number of syphilis cases. In 2004, the incidence in men was 10 times higher than in women; an estimated 75 percent of syphilis cases were diagnosed among MSM and a high proportion (according to sentinel data, up to 50 percent) of MSM diagnosed with syphilis were HIV-positive (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=494). Also, the increased incidence was occurring mainly in major urban centers at the time.

The news report above now says that number of syphilis cases in Germany started to stagnate and even slightly decline in the mid-2000s, but then began to increase each year since 2010 to reach record high numbers in 2014; also 84 percent of new cases are believed to be among MSM. The increased incidence again is mainly occurring in major urban centers, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne. This steep increase in syphilis incidence rates in MSM in large cities is in line with the trend seen in other European countries, Australia, and in North America (see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below).

Berlin is among Germany's 16 states and, with a population of about 3.5 million people, is also Germany's most populous city. Hamburg, with a population of almost 1.8 million is the 2nd; Munich, with a population of 1.4 million, is the 3rd; and Cologne, with a population of about 1 million, is the 4th most populous city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). - Mod.ML
