Two children have tested positive for the killer Japanese encephalitis
(JE) [virus infection], taking the number of cases of this deadly
mosquito-borne disease [virus] to 7 in the city. According to the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi [MCD], one of the 2 new cases is
'indigenous', indicating that "virus is multiplying in the city".

The blood sample of an 11-year-old child, a resident of Kanti Nagar,
and a 4-year-old child, who lives in Trilokpuri, tested positive for
JE virus. While the former is undergoing treatment at Chacha Nehru Bal
Chikitsalya, the other is admitted with Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital,
VK Monga, chairman of the MCD health committee said today [25 Oct
2011].

"JE virus is multiplying in the city. The 4 year-old is an example of
that. She is an indigenous case. All these days we could not trace the
source of the JE cases that have been reported till date. Her blood
sample was one of the 10 samples collected from Lal Bahadur Shastri
hospital as part of the routine random checking for JE cases in the
city," he said. "With these 2 new cases the total count of JE cases in
Delhi now stands at 7," he said.

Japanese encephalitis [virus], which cripples the brain and is more
common in Uttar Pradesh, was reported in the city the 1st time this
year on 21 Sep [2011]. "We have to increase surveillance, check for
more cases, and put them on immediate treatment and take all vector
control measures," a health ministry official said. "No deaths have
been reported till now as all are mild cases and not
life-threatening," Monga said.

[Curiously, no mention is made of vaccination against JE virus
infection as a control measure, in addition to vector control. Perhaps
there are not enough cases in Delhi to justify a vaccination campaign
there.

With the encephalitis toll in eastern Uttar Pradesh [UP] mounting to
474 this year, the Centre today [21 Oct 2011] announced setting up of
a coordination committee of different Union ministries and said it was
mulling short, middle, and long-term plans to control the epidemic. "A
coordination committee comprising union ministries of Health, Water
Resources and Irrigation, Social Justice, and Women and Child Welfare
would be formed after discussion with the Prime Minister. The
committee will make a coordinated effort to tackle the problem," Union
Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said. He was talking to reporters
after visiting some of the affected areas. Azad was accompanied by
Union Minister of State for Petroleum RPN Singh, Congress General
Secretary Digvijay Singh and scientists from Indian Council of Medical
Research. Official sources said Azad's visit came in the wake of a
request by Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi. Azad said the
short, middle, and long-term plans to control the epidemic will be
worked out soon.

Terming the deaths in Gorakhpur Medical College Hospital as
unfortunate, he said, "It seems that vaccination drives are not
carried out in a transparent manner from time to time or else the
situation would have been better." He said cooperation from all
quarters was necessary to check spread of the epidemic and expressed
concern over the shortage of para-medical staff.

The Union minister said the central government has also sanctioned 44
nursing schools in the state to overcome the problem.

"Japanese encephalitis cases in eastern UP have come down from 36 per
cent in 2005 to 10 per cent this year [2011], due to repeated
vaccination drives but the cases of water-borne encephalitis are
mounting," he said.

Earlier, the minister reviewed the situation with the doctors and
administrative staff of the district hospital [in Gorakhpur].

[The occurrence of water-related cases is mentioned in passing in this
report, and is frequently mentioned in previous ones. A more
comprehensive JE virus vaccination campaign should help to reduce
cases due to infection with that virus. Preventing water-associated
cases, presumably due to enteroviruses, will be more difficult, as it
will require an ongoing surveillance effort, timely laboratory support
for diagnosis, a public education campaign and costly improvement in
infrastructure to provide safe drinking water and sanitary disposal of
human wastes. - Mod.TY]
