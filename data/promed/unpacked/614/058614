I agree with Brian Hjelle regarding the dual nature of evolution
(adaptation) of RNA viruses. We have recently found an H5 avian influenza
virus lineage which clearly appears to have been stably retained in
migratory waterfowl over a period of 8 years (based on HA gene sequences)
and at the same time having given rise to a branch in which the HA is
clearly evolving at a significant measurable rate (perhaps as a result of
having passed back and forth among various waterfowl species).
When these viruses enter another species such as a stationary poultry
population, the measurable mutation rate jumps significantly (or at least
that's what happend in the AI outbreak in Mexico).

While the engine for driving the "potential" for genetic variability is
primarily the error-proness of RNA polymerases (and reverse transcriptases
in the case of HIV), the fact is that other considerations play an equal or
more important role in whether that potential is expressed. Measles virus
exists as a single phenotype. Picornaviruses breed true as well. Yet their
polymerases/transcriptases are just as error-prone as the RT of HIV.
Therefore, one can presuppose that these other viruses generate mutants but
the infectivity of the virus is so tightly constrained, for example, the
measles virus surface proteins or the picornavirus capsid proteins do not
tolerate much change without rendering the virus non-infectious, that the
potential genetic variability is not manifested. In contrast, the gp120
protein seems to tolerate an extraordinary degree of alteration while
maintaining its function thus allowing the variants produced by the HIV
reverse transcriptase to survive AND escape antibody-mediated neutralization.
We seem so pre-focused on the polymerases that we sometimes overlook the
equally important influence of protein structure versus function.

I think you make a very good point although to be honest I'm not sure that I
know enough about the Ebola pol gene to comment personally. I have wondered
why the Ebola virus has been so adept at eluding the virus hunters attempts
at unlocking its life cycle. One of the possibilities that I have come up
with thus far is the possibility of reading frame shift. In other words, the
virus may exist in a more natural less virulent stage in nature which makes
it appear as an unlikely canidate for causing the lethal hemorrhagic disease
that it is now so famously known for. Are you familiar with any such
examples in natural systems if so would like to hear from you!!
