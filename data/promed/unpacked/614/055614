West Nile virus found in Jefferson County, Alabama
--------------------------------------------------
Jefferson County health officials said on Mon 27 Aug 2001 that 2 dead birds
found in the county carried West Nile virus. They suspect [that the virus,
which can kill humans, caused the death of 2 other birds, and are awaiting
tests that might prove it. There have been no reported cases of the virus
in people in Alabama, they said. "This report is not unexpected,
considering the reports we already have received from birds found in
Georgia and Florida. It was simply a matter of time before we saw them in
Alabama," said Dr Carole Samuelson, Jefferson County Department of Health
director, in a prepared statement. The report coincides with the Jefferson
County Commission's plans to hold town hall meetings on mosquito control,
to teach people ways to protect themselves from the disease-carrying [vector.
Mike Fleenor, deputy health officer at the county Health Department, said
officials suspected that the virus killed 2 blue jays, a black crow, and a
red-tail hawk found recently in the county. He said tests confirmed its
presence in 2 of the birds, but he could not say which birds. He said he
expects tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to confirm
it in the other 2 birds. "Birds are a herald for the disease in humans," he
said. "We will heighten our surveillance program in the mosquito and bird
populations. We will also begin additional surveillance in the human
population as well. But the risk is small."
County, state, and federal officials began looking for the virus in April.
Ashley Rossi, a US Department of Agriculture wildlife biologist helping
[to coordinate the virus monitoring, said she was surprised to find West
Nile [virus in Jefferson County first. It [is likely [to have spread
undetected to other parts of Alabama, she said. She noted that 487 dead
birds in Alabama have been tested for the virus this year, 36 from
Jefferson County. "Some counties have just sent in 3 birds." This year, the
virus has been found in birds in much of the south, including the bordering
states of Florida and Georgia. In addition, there have been reports of
detections in the midwest.
County Commissioner Steve Small announced [on Monday that the county would
hold educational meetings on mosquito control. At the meetings, the county
will also distribute 80 000 larvicide tablets, said Bill Peters, the
county's director of environmental protection. People can put them in
standing water where mosquitoes are likely to breed. Small said the county
will spray for bugs if health officials say it is warranted. Officials said
spraying would be a last option, because it kills only mosquitoes that
venture into the mist, and leaves their prolific breeding cycle intact. The
spray also would kill beneficial bugs and small animals.
