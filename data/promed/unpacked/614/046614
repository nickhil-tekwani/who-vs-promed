SYPHILIS (6)
============
[In reply to the questions about my report of patients with syphilis who
were apparently seronegative:]
Individuals with negative RPRs and FTA tests had clinical signs of secondary
syphilis and contact history consistent with clinical signs.
We are retesting stored sera at another laboratory and are also running Ig-M
antibody tests.
