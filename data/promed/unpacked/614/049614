[1] South Carolina (Beaufort): human exposure, coyote

A wildlife expert is warning people to be careful around wild animals after a [South Carolina] Lowcountry man was bitten by a coyote with rabies last week [week of 23 Sep 2014].

So far, 4 animals in Beaufort County have tested positive for rabies this year [2014], compared to only one in 2013.

Cliff Boatwright, owner of Tracks Wildlife Control in Beaufort, has been working in Beaufort for years and he hasn't come across any animals infected with rabies, but since there's been an increase in the number of cases in the county, he said people should be extra cautious.

Number one on his to do list is to keep your pets vaccinated, first, because it's the law, but secondly because if a pet is exposed to rabies, it's easy to pass with just a bite or a scratch.

Boatwright warns people to be on high alert in wooded areas, and try to avoid wild animals as much as possible.

He added that people should also be particularly suspicious of pets that are unusually aggressive and wild animals that are passive and friendly. Those are some signs that they may be infected.

"People think, 'oh, well it's hurt, I'll go up and see it and see if I can help it', but that's the worst thing you could do," Boatwright said. "If there is any animal like that, like raccoons, foxes, coyotes, anything like that, or cats, especially feral cats, you want to avoid them and call a professional."

[2] Virginia (Warren): human exposure, feline, raccoon, canine, caprine

On 15 Oct 2014, the cat, described as a domestic short hair, yellow and white in color, attacked 3 people in the vicinity of Va. 649 or Browntown Road and Va. 622 Buck Mountain Road/Liberty Hall Road, according to a news release from the Warren County Health Department.

This is the 5th cat that has tested positive for rabies in Warren County this year [2014]. Though not a comparatively high number, Dr Charles Devine III, health director of the Lord Fairfax Health District, said the number is reflective only of animals determined to have had exposure to rabies.

Since the start of summer [2014], there were 2 other attacks -- one on 20 Sep 2014 on Fletcher Street in Front Royal near the biking trail, and the other on 24 Jun 2014 near Andrick's Front Royal Flea Market at the intersection of Main Street and Commerce Avenue.

Other confirmed cases involved 6 skunks, 2 raccoons, a fox, and a goat.

As always, following a confirmed rabies case, the health district and Warren County Sheriff's Office have reminded residents of the importance of vaccinating domestic pets and farm animals against rabies.

"I would say it's very important because ... any wild mammal has the potential to have rabies" and can give it to a domestic animal, Devine said, adding that animals can pass the virus on to humans.

Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus that lives in saliva and tissue in the brain and nerves of an infected animal. Once symptoms begin, Devine said, "It's too late to prevent it, they already have it, and there is no successful treatment for rabies."

The people attacked by the cat this month [October 2014] were successfully treated to prevent rabies, he said. [Administration of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) - Mod.TG]

By state law, all dogs, cats, and ferrets must have a current vaccination against the virus as soon as a veterinarian determines the animal is old enough. Dogs and cats 4 months or older must be vaccinated, Devine said. Rabies vaccines can be given as early as 3 months and one product is approved for kittens at 8 weeks.

Other ways of preventing the spread of rabies:
- Avoid contact with wild animals or stray cats and dogs.
- Do not feed stray or wild animals.
- Report strays to a local animal control agency.
- Eliminate outdoor food sources around the home.
- Keep pets confined to one's property or walk them on a leash.
- Ensure all animal bites are reported to the health department or animal control.

"Most stray and most wild animals don't have rabies, so we don't want everyone inordinately afraid," Devine said. However, "the probability is that any stray or any wild animal may have rabies."

He said it's not enough to keep pets leashed without vaccinating them. "We've had instances where rabid raccoons have run out of the woods and attacked a dog on a leash," he said.

The Warren County cats confirmed with rabies this year [2014] were not claimed by anyone, though Devine said all but 2 were being fed by people -- a dangerous practice he discouraged since doing so can attract other animals that might carry rabies.

In addition to having pets vaccinated, he encourages the public to call for help when dealing with a possible rabies exposure. Unfortunately, he said, some pet owners prematurely fear losing their animal after an attack.

Vaccinated pets usually can remain at home and monitored for signs of distress before being cleared as healthy.

Fewer cases result in having to condemn the animal, and that's only if the pet isn't up to date on vaccinations. [If your pet is not already vaccinated against rabies, now is a great time to get that done. - Mod.TG]

"We had that situation," he said. "We hate having to make those decisions, and those decisions are not necessary. If the animal is vaccinated, it's not necessary to do that. But it breaks my heart every time I have to order that."

For more information, contact the Warren County Sheriff's Office animal control department at 540-635-4128 or the health district's Warren County department at 540-635-3159.

These 2 areas have had reports of rabies. It is very important for owners to get their animals, (dogs, cats, horses, cows, goats, etc.) vaccinated against rabies. Having your pets vaccinated may insure their life and yours. Vaccinated animals are a barrier between the disease and you. Yes, vaccinate your farm animals -- they can get this disease. So protect yourself and your family by vaccinating all your animals. - Mod.TG]
