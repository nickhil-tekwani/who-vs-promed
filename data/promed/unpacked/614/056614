MERS, for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus, a relative of the virus that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which originated in China and caused an international outbreak in 2003 that infected at least 8000 people and killed nearly 800.

Saudi Arabia has had the most patients so far (62), but cases have also originated in Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Travelers from the Arabian peninsula have taken the disease to Britain, France, Italy and Tunisia, and have infected a few people in those countries. Health experts are also worried about the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage that will draw millions of visitors to Saudi Arabia in October [2013].

The disease almost certainly originated with one or more people contracting the virus from animals -- probably bats -- but scientists do not know how many times that kind of spillover to humans has occurred, or how likely it is to keep happening.

There is urgency to the hunt for answers. Half the known cases have been fatal, though the real death rate is probably lower, because there almost certainly have been mild cases that have gone undetected. But the virus still worries health experts, because it can cause such severe disease and has shown an alarming ability to spread among patients in a hospital. It causes flulike symptoms that can progress to severe pneumonia.

Finding out where in the environment the disease is coming from might make it possible to tell people how to avoid it. Bats are the leading suspect, because they are a reservoir of SARS and carry other coronaviruses with genetic similarities to the MERS virus. Bats could be transmitting the disease directly to people, or they might be spreading it to some other animal that then infects humans. But what kind of bat? There are 1200 species; 20 to 30 have been identified in Saudi Arabia.

Last October [2012], to test the theory, a team of scientists from the Saudi Ministry of Health, Columbia University and EcoHealth Alliance began scouring Saudi towns near where cases of MERS had been reported, showing people pictures of bats and asking if they had seen any. They struck pay dirt when one man led them to an abandoned village in the southwest, said to be hundreds of years old. It was there, in the inky darkness, that they found a small room that had become the roost of about 500 bats.

The scientists set up nets to catch them when they flew out at dusk to hunt insects, then spent the night testing them for the MERS virus. The bats were let go after the testing.

The animals can weigh as little as 4 grams (1/7 of an ounce), and a bat that size may have an 8-inch wingspan.

"They're mostly wing," said Kevin J. Olival, a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance. "They're little flying fur balls."

It takes about 15 minutes to process a bat -- to weigh and measure it, swab it for saliva and feces samples, and collect some blood and a tiny plug of skin from a wing for DNA testing to confirm its species. The specimens were then frozen and sent to the laboratory of Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a leading expert on viruses at Columbia.

Bats do not much appreciate all this medical attention. They bite, and in addition to potentially carrying MERS, they may harbor rabies and other viruses.

"You're wearing coveralls that cover everything -- hoods, gloves, respirators, booties," Dr. Lipkin said. "You're all dressed, so you don't have any contact with the animals. It's night, but still very hot."

Hundreds of bats have been tested, he said, but it is too soon to disclose the results.

The team has also tested camels, goats, sheep and cats, which might act as intermediate hosts, picking up the virus from bats and then infecting people. One reason for suspecting camels is that a MERS patient from the United Arab Emirates had been around a sick camel shortly before falling ill. But that animal was not tested.

"If animals are acting as a reservoir, getting people sick, how would this happen?" asked Dr. Jonathan H. Epstein, a veterinary epidemiologist with EcoHealth Alliance.

If animals harbor the virus, does it make them ill? Do they infect people by coughing? Or do they pass the virus in urine or feces, and infect people who clean their stalls? The answers do not come easily.

"Camels are tough, let me tell you," said Dr. Epstein. "They're ornery. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to wrangle a camel. They're strong, they're fast, they bite really hard."

The trick, he said, is to get the camel into a position that veterinarians call "ventral recumbency," or lying on its belly. A very feisty camel may also have its legs tied together so it cannot run away or kick anybody. Then someone steadies its head, maybe with a harness, and holds its jaws open so a vet can reach in and out quickly with a cotton swab.

"They have a pretty big mouth," Dr. Epstein said. "You try not to get bitten."

So far, he said, "none of the animals we looked at were overtly sick."

But Dr. Lipkin noted that the virus tests on livestock samples were not complete. Any specimens from such animals from other countries are considered a threat to agriculture in the United States because they could carry foot-and-mouth disease or other pathogens, and have to be screened 1st by the Agriculture Department before being released to research labs.

Testing may identify animal species that carry the virus, but that will not immediately explain why it has emerged now.

"The most common reason that wildlife viruses make the jump into people is that we do things that bring us and our livestock into closer contact with wildlife, such as the wildlife trade or agricultural intensification," Dr. Epstein said.

And, said his colleague Dr. Olival, finding the animals that carry the disease is "not just an academic exercise."

"It's a way to inform public health measures," he said, "to try to stop zoonotic diseases before they emerge into humans."

[The information from the US that "virus tests on livestock samples were not complete" was explained by the indicated need to screen the said exotic samples 1st for FMD and other foreign epizootic diseases by the USDA before being released to research labs. Hopefully, the screening will be completed soon to allow the tests for MERS-CoV (coronavirus) to be performed.

Human infection from bat source (in case bats are indeed the primary reservoir) may be direct or indirect. If infection is indirect, in addition to animals as the potential intermediate factor(s), bat-contaminated food (such as fruit) will deserve consideration as well. - Mod.AS]
