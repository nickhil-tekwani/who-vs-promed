San Diego Hepatitis A Outbreak, 2017
------------------------------------
For the past several months, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The outbreak investigation is ongoing; it has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified.

Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by County staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.

The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Following this update is information about hepatitis A to educate the community and help prevent the continual spread of this viral infection.

Hepatitis A Cases and Deaths in San Diego County as of 8 May 2017

A total of 80 acute HAV infections have been reported in San Diego County residents with symptom onset between [24 Nov 2016] and [26 Apr 2017]. Of the cases, 66 (83 percent) have been hospitalized and 3 patients (4 percent) have died. The age range of confirmed HAV cases was from 26 to 72 years (median of 42 years) and 46 (58 percent) were male, with none self identifying as men who have sex with men. As many as 49 (61 percent) of the cases were homeless and 46 (58 percent) reported injection or non-injection illicit drug use; some cases have both risk factors. Only 5 (6 percent) patients reported travel outside of the county. None of the cases were known to have been immunized against HAV. Of the 51 cases with complete liver virus tests available, 12 (24 percent) had evidence of hepatitis C infection.

Genotype and viral sequence analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of a selected cohort of cases indicate that 2 unique, closely related strains of HAV genotype 1b are involved in the San Diego County outbreak. Different strains of this genotype are associated with the ongoing HAV outbreak in Southeastern Michigan and the outbreaks associated with frozen strawberries in 2016 and pomegranate arils in 2013.

Several small clusters of epidemiologically linked cases have been identified. A total of 15 cases (all clients) reported receiving services from a single homeless provider in downtown San Diego, although no common point source has been identified. Another 6 cases (4 clients, 2 volunteers) are associated with a homeless services provider in El Cajon, although no common point source has been identified. Of the cases, 5, are individuals who became symptomatic while incarcerated in jail facilities, but most likely were exposed to the virus while homeless in the community. Finally, 2 secondary cases in jails have occurred, though each had been offered post-exposure prophylaxis and declined. No specific common food, beverage, or drug sources have yet been identified. Investigations of these cases are ongoing.

[As many as 10 more cases since the last report. It is likely that the large number of hospitalizations relates to the fact that those infected are homeless and/or incarcerated and/or are co-infected with HBV or HCV as a great majority of hepatitis A infections do not require inpatient care. It appears that most of the cases have a history of substance abuse although it is not stated if it was injecting drug use. Hepatitis A can also be transmitted by the bloodborne route as there is a silent period of viremia that occurs during the incubation period.

Deaths related to HAV infection are associated with acute fulminant infection which occurs in perhaps 1 per 1000 cases. For 3 deaths to be recorded are there other co-morbidities such as chronic liver disease or co-infection with HBV or HCV. Given that public health officials are reporting this, this is likely to be that the cases of acute HAV documented by the presence of IgM anti-HAV antibodies. Even in adults, many of cases of HAV infection are subclinical (without symptoms) or anicteric (without jaundice) so that extent of the outbreak is likely much higher.

The second part of the posting provides some information regarding the outbreak which does not appear to be fired by MSM behavior.

An epidemic curve plotting cases over time would assist in analyzing the outbreak. - Mod.LL
