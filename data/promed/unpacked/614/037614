Livestock officials in Mpulungu have launched investigations into the
possible presence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the district.

Mpulungu District fisheries officer Lloyd Hambiya said in an
interview that 2 cattle recently died, and after being examined, they
were found with symptoms suggesting the presence of FMD in the area.

Mr. Hambiya said samples from the dead animals had since been sent to
Bamora Laboratory in Lusaka for further examination. "There is also
need for resource mobilisation, because if investigations prove that
we have this disease, stringent measures have to be put in place to
fight it," he said.

Mr Hambiya said the department of livestock had stopped the movement
of animals and meat products from the district to other areas to stop
the possible spread of the suspected disease.

The other animals at risk of attack from FMD, apart from cattle, are
goats and sheep.

[FMD serotype O in Zambian cattle was recorded in November 2010 in
the same area as Mpulungu, namely in Chizombwe, Mbala Central, Mbala,
Northern Province, adjacent to Zambia's border with Tanzania and to
the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika. This outbreak was notified to
the OIE on 24 Nov 2010 (see archived 20101125.4245). The immediate
notification included the standard note, indicating that "the event
is continuing, weekly follow-up reports will be submitted."
Unfortunately, no such follow-up reports from Zambia have become
available in WAHID as of 22 Dec 2010. - Mod.AS]
