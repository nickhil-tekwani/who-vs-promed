An investigation has been opened to determine the cause of death of a 46-year-old woman, who became ill after eating at a one-star Michelin restaurant called RiFF in Valencia. A total of 23 other patrons, including the victim's husband and 12-year-old son, also fell sick after the meal but their symptoms were mild and they have reportedly all recovered.

The case was confirmed by regional health chief Ana Barceló, who expressed her condolences to the family and said that an investigation was already underway. "We've conducted a primary inspection of the establishment and everything appears to be normal," she said. "Analytical tests will now be carried out on the food products." Barceló explained that the regional public health department will be in charge of the investigation and for determining the causes behind the woman's death.

According to sources from the regional health department, the food poisoning outbreak was reported on [Sun 17 Feb 2019], after the 3 family members fell ill. They began to show symptoms of food poisoning - vomiting and diarrhea - on [Sat 16 Feb 2019]. According to Europa Press, the father and son recovered but the woman's symptoms were more severe, and she died in her home early on the following morning.

The investigation into the death revealed that a total of 9 patrons had experienced illness, mainly vomiting, after eating at the same restaurant. Subsequently, it emerged that a further 14 people had also suffered light symptoms. "17 people have been interviewed, of whom 14 stated that they had some kind of mild symptoms," explained regional health chief Ana Barceló today, [Wed 20 Feb 2019]. "The samples that have been collected over the last few days have been sent to the National Toxicology Institute to be analyzed."

Public health officials inspected the restaurant on [Mon 18 Feb 2019], but did not find any problems that could have contributed to the food poisoning. Investigators also collected samples of ingredients and raw food products that were part of the menu, and are currently analyzing them. Barceló added that at this point she could not confirm whether the sickness had been caused by morel mushrooms that were on the restaurant's menu. "We will have to wait for the autopsy to be carried out on the woman before we can determine whether it was the ingestion of a food that directly caused her death, or whether it prompted a state that led to this fatal outcome, or if she had an existing condition," she explained on [Wed 20 Feb 2019]. Forensic teams are working to determine whether she could have been poisoned by something she ate, or whether she may have choked on her own vomit.

In a statement, the owner of RiFF, Bernd H. Knöller, announced that the restaurant will remain closed until the cause of the food poisoning outbreak is determined and "activities can resume with full assurances for the staff and the patrons." The owner said he has been cooperating with the regional health department on the investigation and pointed out that the inspection "showed that the restaurant complies with all sanitary regulations." He added: "Regardless of what caused the situation, I want to convey my deep regret for what happened, and I hope all of the facts will be clarified shortly."

[It is unclear what the etiology of the foodborne illness was in this restaurant cluster that led to a fatality and if the fatality is directly related to the food. The posting implies that morel mushrooms may have been involved. The following is a new publication proposing a revised clinical classification of mushroom poisoning:

Abstract
--------
"Mushroom poisoning is a significant and increasing form of toxin-induced-disease. Existing classifications of mushroom poisoning do not include more recently described new syndromes of mushroom poisoning and this can impede the diagnostic process. We reviewed the literature on mushroom poisoning, concentrating on the period since the current major classification published in 1994, to identify all new syndromes of poisoning and organise them into a new integrated classification, supported by a new diagnostic algorithm. New syndromes were eligible for inclusion if there was sufficient detail about both causation and clinical descriptions. Criteria included: identity of mushrooms, clinical profile, epidemiology, and the distinctive features of poisoning in comparison with previously documented syndromes. We propose 6 major groups based on key clinical features relevant in distinguishing between poisoning syndromes. Some clinical features, notably gastrointestinal symptoms, are common to many mushroom poisoning syndromes.

"Group 1 - Cytotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with specific major internal organ pathology: (Subgroup 1.1; Primary hepatotoxicity); 1A, primary hepatotoxicity (amatoxins); (Subgroup 1.2; Primary nephrotoxicity); 1B, early primary nephrotoxicity (amino hexadienoic acid; AHDA); 1C, delayed primary nephrotoxicity (orellanines).
Group 2 - Neurotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with primary neurotoxicity: 2A, hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybins and related toxins); 2B, autonomic-toxicity mushrooms (muscarines); 2C, CNS-toxicity mushrooms (ibotenic acid/muscimol); 2D, morel neurologic syndrome (_Morchella spp._).
Group 3 - Myotoxic mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with rhabdomyolysis as the primary feature: 3A, rapid onset (_Russula spp._); 3B, delayed onset (_Tricholoma spp._).
Group 4 - Metabolic, endocrine and related toxicity mushroom poisoning. Syndromes with a variety of clinical presentations affecting metabolic and/or endocrine processes: 4A, GABA-blocking mushroom poisoning (gyromitrins); 4B, disulfiram-like (coprines); 4C, polyporic mushroom poisoning (polyporic acid); 4D, trichothecene mushroom poisoning (_Podostroma spp._); 4E, hypoglycemic mushroom poisoning (_Trogia venenata_); 4F, hyperprocalcitoninemia mushroom poisoning (_Boletus satanas_); 4G, pancytopenic mushroom poisoning (_Ganoderma neojaponicum_).
Group 5 - Gastrointestinal irritant mushroom poisoning. This group includes a wide variety of mushrooms that cause gastrointestinal effects without causing other clinically significant effects.
Group 6 - Miscellaneous adverse reactions to mushrooms. Syndromes which do not fit within the previous 5 groups: 6A, Shiitake mushroom dermatitis; 6B, erythromelagic mushrooms (_Clitocybe acromelagia_); 6C, Paxillus syndrome (_Paxillus involutus_); 6D, encephalopathy syndrome (_Pleurocybella porrigens_)."

Both morels and false morels can cause illness:
