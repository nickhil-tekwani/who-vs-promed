On behalf of the Belgian horticultural industry, we would like to ask for a correction on [the post referenced above]. This quote [in the source https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/sterling-suffolk-tomato-operation-imposes-restrictions-1-5926015 - Mod.DHA] lead to questions about the presence of the virus in Belgium from different organisations, including the phytosanitary services. To date we have no knowledge of the presence of the virus in Belgium.

We have contacted the person who is cited in this article, Richard Lewis. See below an email from him that the quote, that the virus ToBRFV would have been present in Belgium, is not correct. Richard confirms that he was misquoted. Thanks in advance for publishing a correction.

I can confirm that I was "misquoted" by the newspaper, I do not know about nor heard of any cases of this virus in Belgium.

[We are glad to help clarify the current distribution data of ToBRFV by passing on this correction of a mistake in the media source.

_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ in Jordan and has since been identified in Israel, the Americas, and Europe. It was shown to affect also capsicum crops and may pose a risk to other solanaceous crops as well. It has recently been added to the alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar. The virus is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade. For more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
