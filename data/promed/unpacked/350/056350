The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 26 Aug 2018:
- A total of 111 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 83 confirmed and 28 probable.
- Of the 83 confirmed cases, 18 are cured, 18 are hospitalized, and 47 have died.
- 10 suspected cases are under investigation.
- No new cases confirmed.
- 4 new people healed, including 3 care providers.
- 3 confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 2 in Mabalako.
- 2445 contacts to follow

News of the response
Social mobilization
-------------------
- Following the community's latest protests against the Ebola response, the coordination organized a meeting with the mayor, notables, customary chiefs, district leaders, cell leaders, youth movements, and civil society from the city of Beni [North Kivu]. More than 350 people attended an exclusive information session on Ebola with the coordinators of the response. During this session that lasted nearly 4.5 hours, those present were able to ask all the questions and share their concerns. This exchange helped to ease tensions within the community. At the end of the session, the authorities committed themselves to preparing an action plan to support the different components of the response, in particular the signaling of alerts, the follow-up of contacts, and dignified and secure burials.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 4130 people have been vaccinated, including 1992 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1000 in Beni [North Kivu], 1017 in Mandima [Ituri province], and 121 in Oicha [North Kivu].

- Mon 27 Aug 2018. As Ebola cases hit 111, DRC responders address local concerns.
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/ebola-cases-hit-111-drc-responders-address-local-concerns
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry reported 8 more lab-confirmed Ebola cases over the past 4 days, along with another probable infection, all from areas that have already reported illnesses.

[...]

The newly confirmed cases are from Mabalako, the health zone that includes the hot spot city of Mangina, as well as Beni and Oicha [North Kivu], where an illness was confirmed in a physician last week [week of 20 Aug 2018] and where at least 2 more suspected cases were reported.

The new developments push the overall outbreak total to 111 cases, including 83 confirmed and 28 probable cases. 9 more deaths were reported, raising that total to 72. Health officials are investigating 10 suspected cases, according to the ministry's update today [27 Aug 2018].

The World Health Organization (WHO) in a 24 Aug 2018 update provided some epidemiologic details about the patients sickened in the outbreak so far.

Of 88 confirmed and probable cases reported as of 19 Aug 2018, the median age is 32 years old, with an age range of 0-74 years. Adults ages 30-39 account for 28 percent (25) of the cases. Of all cases, 58 percent (51) are female. Earlier in the outbreak, WHO officials had said responders were seeing a higher-than-expected number of illnesses in women and children.

Illness onsets range from late April to 13 Aug 2018, according to the WHO.

[...]

Last week [week of 20 Aug 2018], media outlets reported that angry youth burned a health center in the village of Manbangu [North Kivu] where Ebola vaccine was given. A health ministry spokeswoman told Reuters that an incident took place at the clinic, but that it hadn't been burned.

The DRC's health ministry said health teams have closed and disinfected a clinic in Beni after it reported 3 Ebola cases, 2 confirmed and 1 probable, according to its 25 Aug 2018 update. It said the steps are geared toward curbing transmission to other people and health workers.

Several health workers have been infected in the outbreak in Mangina and Beni, many of whom were thought to have been exposed to sick patients before the outbreak was declared.

Health workers are known to amplify the spread of the disease, and outbreak response teams have removed staff from at least 2 facilities so that potentially exposed health workers can be quarantined and monitored for any symptoms.

[...]

In its recent update, the WHO said 7160 more vaccine doses arrived in Kinshasa on 20 Aug 2018 and were immediately sent to Beni. It added that it expected that an additional 2160 doses would be shipped by the end of the week.

Push for vaccinating pregnant women
-----------------------------------
[See [3] below re- commentary in STAT Morning Rounds newsletter, 27 Aug 2018.]

[...]

The group also noted that at least 20 pregnant women were unintentionally vaccinated in a previous trial, with no evidence of harm. They urged health leaders to apply the recent WHO rationale for using yellow fever vaccine -- which also contains live vaccine virus -- for pregnant women.

[2] Response
- Sat 25 Aug 2018. Mangina Ebola treatment center: profile.
[Radio France Internationale (RFI)-Afrique; in French, machine trans., edited]
http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180825-rdc-ebola-centre-traitement-ebola-mangina-epicentre-epidemie-msf-deces

[...]

In Mangina, the epicenter of the epidemic, the Ebola treatment center (ETC), set up by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and operational for 10 days, currently hosts around 30 patients, with a capacity of 70 beds. Radio France Internationale went there.

[...]

After the extreme urgency of the 1st days, MSF works to improve the lives of patients who often suffer, in forced silence, the isolation constraints imposed by the Ebola virus. We can see them in the distance, suspect cases on one side, confirmed cases on the other, and, here and there, some silhouettes, gentle gestures and masked faces of the caregivers in their imposing protective suits.

At the entrance on the left, teams deployed by the Ministry of Health receive training on hygiene and safety rules from MSF. Their faces are focused. They are aware that they are on the front line. 15 caregivers have already been infected since the beginning of this epidemic, most often for having taken emergency care of the 1st patients, who had never been confronted with this epidemic.

Since that morning, despite treatment, 2 new patients have just lost their lives, and then suddenly, there resound cries of joy ... Caregivers come running, smiling to the exit, and join their applause to those villagers who came to welcome and congratulate the 11th Ebola cure, "the 11th victorious one", as we say here.

[...]

How to overcome the mistrust of a part of the population vis-à-vis the response to Ebola? The problem arises with each new epidemic. North Kivu is not spared. Between reluctance and misunderstanding, several violent incidents were reported this week. Many families do not understand why their loved ones are dead. To fight against this resistance, MSF is working to involve families. A visitor trail now exists and, above all, the morgue has been built to allow families to see the deceased, safely.

"For several days now, we have been ready to welcome people here, at the ETC level, to discuss precisely what has happened and especially what we have put in place. At the morgue, there is a window and hygienists enter the high-risk areas, open the body bag, and open the window. So, the family, on the other side of the fence, can see the face of the deceased. The family and relatives, in fact, are not allowed to open the coffin as soon as the deceased leaves with the Red Cross. It is really important to have this link with the family so that they are part of this process and feel involved in the funeral," says Léa Feldmann, medical officer for MSF in the center.

- Mon 27 Aug 2018. Danger requires creative strategies to reach those in need.
[National Public Radio (NPR), excerpted, edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/08/27/641536981/a-dangerous-twist-to-the-latest-ebola-outbreak
[Byline: Nurith Aizenman]

It was the news they'd been dreading. Last week [week of 201 Aug 2018], world health officials learned that a doctor's wife had contracted Ebola. She is from Oicha, a town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo that is surrounded by a violent insurgent militia called the Allied Democratic Forces.

Her case is one of many in an outbreak that's been ongoing since the start of August [2018]. But it was the 1st to be confirmed in a location that is extremely dangerous for health workers to reach because of the conflict raging in that part of the country.

So far, the number of confirmed cases -- more than 80 since the start of this month [August 2018] -- has been in line with previous flare-ups in that country that were controlled in a matter of months. But the dangerous twist to this outbreak is requiring health workers to come up with creative strategies to reach those in need.

[...]

It's likely that the doctor's wife wasn't the only person there who had gotten infected. According to [Dr Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response], sometime earlier the doctor himself had been ill with what health officials now suspect was Ebola -- although he had already recovered and is now testing negative. And a 3rd person who had died in Oicha is considered a probable Ebola case.

A WHO team was able to travel to Oicha -- and identify and start vaccinating nearly 100 people who had contact with the infected person. But to get there they needed an armed escort of UN peacekeepers. That's not ideal says, Salama: "There certainly is risk with being too closely associated with any fighting force." Health workers need to be perceived as impartial in order to operate in areas where multiple sides are battling each other.

And Salama says WHO has already decided they'll have to suspend ring vaccination if a case surfaces in a village or town that's too dangerous to visit long enough to meticulously trace the sick person's contacts. Instead they'll move to a less effective strategy: basically making a much briefer visit to vaccinate anyone and everyone they come across before it's time to leave.

"Because we may only have access for a couple of hours with armed vehicles and armed escorts," says Salama. In such places, the longer you stay, the greater the risk.

Another group that's having to tweak its usual Ebola-fighting approach is Doctors Without Borders, which has opened a treatment facility in a town called Mangina, not far from Oicha.

A critical concern in stemming this outbreak involves the homes of patients. Karin Huster, an emergency coordinator with the group, says that, if this were a typical Ebola outbreak, for every patient that comes in, Doctors Without Borders would be sending a team back to their house to decontaminate it -- a specially-trained group wearing protective suits who would spray every single surface with chlorine.

"To make sure that then that it's safe for the family to live in this place," Huster explains.

Many of these families live in areas that are too dangerous for Doctors Without Borders to travel to -- especially since it's against the group's policy to go in with armed guards.

One idea under consideration is to build a model of a typical house so Doctors Without Borders could use it to teach families how to decontaminate their homes safely with a take-home kit.

"It might not be professionally done the way we would do it," says Huster. "But it would be much better than having nothing done to the house."

Doctors without Borders is also considering training patients who recover from the virus to become ambassadors of a sort -- educating their communities about the disease when they go home. Again, says Huster, it's not a perfect solution. Among other reasons, calling attention to Ebola survivors could stigmatize them.

"You always have to do this in a careful way," she says.

But when it comes to responding to an Ebola outbreak in a conflict zone, she says, "If we don't find creative ways to deal with it, we'll never control it."

[It could be hazardous for patients to disinfect their own houses without being certain they understand exactly how to do it safely, so they do not inadvertently infect themselves. Having recovered patients contributing to education of their community on disinfection of houses and safe practices is an excellent idea. They could also assist in the treatment centers where unskilled assistance is needed. - Mod.LK]

[3] Vaccination and antivirals
- Mon 27 Aug 2018. Pregnant women should be eligible for experimental Ebola vaccine, experts argue.
[STAT Morning Rounds newsletter; summary provided by Greg Folkers]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/08/27/ebola-vaccine-pregnant-lactating-women/

The decision to exclude pregnant and lactating women from an effort to vaccinate people exposed to Ebola in the current outbreak is wrong and should be reversed, 3 public health experts write in a new opinion piece for STAT. Here's what you need to know:

The context: There's an experimental vaccine available that's been shown the be effective against the strain of Ebola in the outbreak. Health officials have launched a vaccination program to try to stem the spread of the virus, but pregnant and lactating women aren't allowed to receive the vaccine.

The decision: Health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo made that decision based on the advice of 2 expert panels that offer guidance on the use of experimental Ebola therapies.

The counterargument: The experts say it's indefensible to deny pregnant and lactating women the experimental vaccine, given that the fatality rate is 80 percent or higher for pregnant women who contract Ebola and nearly all survivors miscarry. "There's no question that evidence about the safety of the Ebola vaccine in pregnancy is limited. But what we don't know is dwarfed by what we do know," Ruth Faden, Ruth Karron, and Carleigh Krubiner write.

[It really is a risk-benefit question in the middle of an outbreak. The vaccine is not likely to cause greater harm that what already exists, as it is known that pregnant women and babies suffer severe outcomes following infection. As stated above, the fatality rate is 80 percent or higher for pregnant women who contract Ebola and nearly all survivors miscarry. See report above in [1]. Pregnant women were vaccinated inadvertently in the West African outbreak without complications being reported. Therefore, the decision not to vaccinate them should be reconsidered. Giving birth or a miscarriage while infected presents a tremendous hazard to the healthcare workers attending the birth and the families. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 27 Aug 2018. Recovery from Ebola.
[Digital Congo; in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/5b83fed1218124000402f4f9/

According to the epidemiological situation presented by the Ministry of Health, a total of 14 people were cured of Ebola in the territory of Beni, in the province of North Kivu where the 10th epidemic of this virus was declared.

In its latest newsletter released Sat night, the Congolese Ministry of Health announced the healing of 14 people who contracted Ebola in the Beni region

[...]

"Congratulations to these survivors and the DRC Ministry of Health for making large-scale experimental Ebola treatments available during an epidemic -- a world first and a beacon of hope for people with the disease. We are proudly your partners," reacted on his Twitter account Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organization, WHO.

Returning to the hygiene and sanitation pillar, one of the measures on which the Ministry of Health relies to eradicate this epidemic, the press release announces that a hygiene team has proceeded to the disinfection and closing of a dispensary in the Beni health zone after the latter reported 3 cases, 2 confirmed and 1 probable. "The Committee on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Biosafety is the commission responsible for measures to stop the transmission of infectious diseases to other people and health workers," writes the document, adding that the structure deals in particular with the distribution of personal protective equipment to health workers, the installation of chlorinated water points, and the disinfection of households and health facilities.

[It is not clear whether these individuals were cured through the use of mAb114. If so, it would be helpful to know what proportion of trials of this antibody have been successful; however it may be premature to evaluate its success because of different timing of the treatment, severity of the symptoms, age of the patient, and more. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 10 Aug 2018. Key considerations: Burial, funeral, and mourning practices in North Kivu Province, DRC.
[Social Science in Humanitarian Action; summary provided by Greg Folkers]
http://www.socialscienceinaction.org/resources/key-considerations-context-north-kivu-province-drc/

This brief summarises key socio-cultural considerations of events related to death, burial, funerals (rites or ceremonies), and mourning in the context of the outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC, August 2018. Beliefs and practices related to death, burial, funeral rites and mourning can (i) directly impact the transmission of Ebola and (ii) influence trust between communities and responders.

Further participatory inquiry should be undertaken, but given ongoing transmission, conveying key considerations and immediate recommendations for safe and dignified burial practices and related community engagement have been prioritised.

This brief is based on the input of expert advisers in close communication with networks of contacts in North Kivu (community leaders, religious leaders, local authorities, clinicians, NGO staff, community members, etc.). It builds on a rapid review of existing published and grey literature, experience of previous Ebola outbreaks in the DRC and elsewhere and informal discussions with colleagues from UNICEF, WHO, IFRC, Oxfam, GOARN Social Science Group, and others.

- Mon 27 Aug 2018. Sierra Leone: Bombali virus, a new ebolavirus found in bats.
[University of California, Davis, press release, edited]
https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/ebola-species-found-bats-ahead-any-potential-outbreak
[Byline: Kat Kerlin]

For the 1st time, scientists discovered a new ebolavirus species in a host prior to detection in an infected human or sick animal.

The discovery of the Bombali virus in bats in Sierra Leone and the sequencing of the complete genome was officially published today[27 Aug 2018] in the journal Nature Microbiology. The Sierra Leone government announced preliminary findings in late July [2018].

[...]

The discovery illustrates the mission of USAID's PREDICT project, which aims to find viruses before they spill over into humans. The Bombali virus has the potential to infect human cells, but it is unknown if the virus has already caused human infections or if it is harmful to humans.

"Identifying new viruses like Bombali ebolavirus in wildlife and testing their capacity for human infection can enhance our understanding of the pre-emergent viral diversity circulating in animals," said co-lead author Simon Anthony, a virologist and assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. "We want to discover viruses that have the genetic prerequisites for human infection and then prioritize them for further study and intervention."

Prior to the discovery of Bombali virus, 5 ebolavirus species had been described. For instance, Bombali virus is different from the Zaire ebolavirus, which killed thousands of people between 2013 and 2016. Despite more than 40 years of research, the reservoir hosts for these viruses is still unknown. But the discovery of Bombali virus adds to growing evidence that bats are the likely hosts of these viruses.

"If you want to prevent Ebola outbreaks, it's important to know which species are hosts and can shed the virus," said co-lead author Tracey Goldstein, an associate director of the One Health Institute at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. "Then we can help target changes in behavior so we can protect people, which is the overarching goal of our work."

The PREDICT team sampled more than 6000 animals in Sierra Leone and performed laboratory tests to look for both known and unknown ebolaviruses. Bombali virus was found in five individual bats belonging to two different species of insectivorous bats that were found roosting inside people's houses.

Abstract
--------
"Here we describe the complete genome of a new ebolavirus, Bombali virus (BOMV) detected in free-tailed bats in Sierra Leone (little free-tailed (_Chaerephon pumilus_) and Angolan free-tailed (_Mops condylurus_)). The bats were found roosting inside houses, indicating the potential for human transmission. We show that the viral glycoprotein can mediate entry into human cells. However, further studies are required to investigate whether exposure has actually occurred or if BOMV is pathogenic in humans."
