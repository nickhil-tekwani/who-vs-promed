Routine testing by the Minnesota Board of Animal Health has found H5 low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Kandiyohi County, which has been confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. Officials say it does not pose a risk to the public, and there is no food safety concern for consumers. This is not the same virus causing the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the Midwest in 2015.

"Testing birds before they go to market is standard protocol for our poultry flocks in Minnesota because it verifies healthy birds are sent to market, and if disease is detected, we can hold the flock and work quickly with producers to address the disease," said state veterinarian Dr Beth Thompson. The board quarantined the flock on Mon 22 Nov [2021] and continues to monitor and test the flock as well as commercial poultry operations and individuals with backyard flocks within 10 km [6.2 mi] for signs of the disease.

Avian influenza is not a food safety issue. The board is working with federal, state, and industry partners in its response.

["Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment.

"When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks. Because LPAI does not typically kill poultry the way that HPAI does, there may be additional control options beyond depopulation. Federal and state officials will work with producers to determine what option(s) are available."
