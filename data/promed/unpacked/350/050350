Deer Affected by Disease
------------------------
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) officials say they have
found more deer dead from adenovirus hemorrhagic disease than in the
past.

ODFW spokesman Steven George says once a deer is exposed, there is
nothing that can save it. "What they're dying from is a disease
called adenovirus hemorrhagic disease. It's a disease specific to
just deer. Pets, livestock do not get it, it kills most of the
animals that are exposed to it. We had a major outbreak about 6-7
years ago at Crooked River Ranch."

George says they encourage you not to feed the deer because the
disease is passed to deer through nose to nose and saliva contact and
so it will wipe out a congregating herd. He says a couple of months
ago, they were finding about one to 2 dead deer every day in the Cove
Palisades Park and Crooked River Ranch area, but the numbers are
going down now.
