Rabies event no 6, 2015
On Sat 9 May 2015, 7 persons were attacked by a wolf while visiting in the Northern Golan. Initial attempt to find the she-wolf, or trap her, failed. Eventually, the corpse of the animal was found on Thu 14 May 2015, in a field near the village of Ein Kinya, northern Golan. The head was submitted to the rabies laboratory of the Veterinary Institute at Beit Dagan where yesterday (Sat 16 May 2015) rabies was confirmed.

[We are informed that the diagnosis was attained by PCR (the brain was decomposed).

Ein Kinya is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Nimrod fortress national park; see map at http://tinyurl.com/nonb89c.

This case has become the 6th rabies case in northern Israel since the start of 2015, involving 3 dogs, 2 wolves, and 1 cat. 4 of them were located in the Golan Heights (adjacent to the Syrian border) and 2 in northern Galilee, adjacent to the border with Lebanon.

All persons attacked by the wolf on 9 May 2015 were duly treated immediately after their exposure. The last human rabies case in Israel occurred in 2003.
