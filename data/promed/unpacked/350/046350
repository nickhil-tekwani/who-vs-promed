----------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been a fabricated news report that a diplomat with Ebola [virus disease] has been admitted to Saint Yared General Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I am the medical director of this hospital and I can assure you that the information is false and we have never had any patient with Ebola. I am actually disgusted by the people who fabricated this false information.

Please note that up-to-date information can also be found at http://www.ephi.gov.et. The Federal Ministry of Health has also created an 8335 hotline number, which can be used when needed.

1st Dallas nurse will be transferred to NIH facility in Bethesda, Maryland
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st Dallas [Texas] nurse who contracted Ebola while taking care of the 1st patient to die from the deadly virus in the U.S., released a statement Tuesday [14 Oct 2014] saying that she's doing well. She will be transferred to a National Institutes of Health clinical center in Bethesda [Maryland], officials and the NIH said Thursday [16 Oct 2014]. The nurse's transfer to the facility, one of 4 in the United States with a special biocontainment unit, will occur Thursday evening [16 Oct 2014], according to Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was testifying at a Capitol Hill hearing Thursday afternoon. He said she would receive "state of the art care" there. Fauci said that he has been told that she is "stable" and "doing reasonably well," but added that he hasn't seen her himself yet. The facility has only 2 beds, he said.... -- more

[3] USA: 2nd nurse infected with Ebola, may have felt ill earlier

2nd nurse infected with Ebola may have felt ill as early as Friday
------------------------------------------------------------------
[The 2nd nurse] to be infected with Ebola after caring for patient Thomas Eric Duncan, may actually have had symptoms as early as last Friday [10 Oct 2014], health officials said. The nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where Duncan was being treated and later died, flew to Cleveland [Ohio] on Friday to help plan her wedding. She returned to Dallas on Monday [13 Oct 2014]. She called health officials before her flight on Monday, reporting a minor fever. But the Center for Disease Control and Prevention told her it was okay to get on the plane. Because she may have been sick earlier than officials believed, the CDC is expanding their investigation to people the 29-year-old nurse may have come into contact with over the weekend. Included are passengers who were on her flight to Cleveland, Fox 8 Cleveland reported.

Frontier has reached out to passengers on 5 flights that used the same airplane [the nurse] flew on, the Denver Post reported. Anyone who flew with her is encouraged to call 1-800-CDC-INFO. A CDC spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday [16 Oct 2014] that it was possible that passengers on [the nurse's] Friday [10 Oct 2014] flight may have contracted the virus. Earlier this week, CDC Director Tom Frieden said that because her fever was low on Monday, it is unlikely that she was contagious. Still, he said it was mistake for her to fly.

7 people have placed themselves under self-quarantine in Northeast Ohio after coming into contact with [the nurse] during her trip to Ohio. According to Fox News 8, people who were at the Coming Attractions bridal shop in Akron [Ohio] on 11 Oct 2014 from 12 to 3:30 p.m. have been asked to call the health department. Some schools in Texas and Ohio have also canceled classes because students or staff flew on the same airplane as [the nurse].
