Monkey Tests Positive For Plague At Denver Zoo
-----------------------------------------------
Tissue samples from a deceased monkey at the Denver Zoo tested
positive for bubonic plague, zoo officials announced Monday [21 May
2007]. The zoo learned late Friday [18 May 2007] from the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) that the hooded
capuchin monkey had the plague.
The monkey seemed lethargic last Tuesday [15 May 2007] and was found
dead Wednesday morning [16 May 2007] by a zookeeper, zoo officials
said. It's unclear if the monkey contracted the disease from infected
fleas, or if the monkey ingested the remains of an infected squirrel.
The zoo suspects it's from ingestion. None of the other monkeys in
the troop have displayed signs of illness, but antibiotics have been
administered as a precaution.
"Denver Zoo remains in regular contact with CDPHE," Senior
Veterinarian Dave Kenny said in a prepared statement. "And although
the risk of contracting plague to people and animals in the area is
extremely low, we are continuing to emphasize communication with
visitors to prevent exposure to squirrels and rabbits."
John Pape, an epidemiologist with CDPHE, said the death was
unfortunate, but not unexpected. "There are some animal species in
the zoo collection, including monkeys, that could be susceptible to
plague," Pape said. "Infected squirrels and a rabbit have been
reported in the area and can have contact with the zoo animals."
Hooded capuchin monkeys are a small primate native to South America.

plague contain more information on the situation in Colorado. Monkeys
groom each other so if one has acquired plague from fleas, the
antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate. - Mod.TG]
