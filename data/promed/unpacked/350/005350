Texas: 2nd Hantavirus Case in Amarillo This Year
-------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus infection claimed the life of a Randall County resident last
week. The disease prompted health officials to alert the public on Fri 15
Aug 2003 to preventive measures. Dr. J. Rush Pierce, Amarillo's health
authority, said the hantavirus case was the 2nd one in Amarillo in 2003.
The latest victim was a middle-aged person, he said. "2 cases in Amarillo
in one year, at this time of the year, and 4 in the region, is more than we
usually see," he said.
Hantavirus is present in the feces and urine of infected deer mice, and
exposure usually occurs when people clean buildings occupied by infected
mice. There is no cure for the disease, which has an overall 40 percent
death rate, he said. Preventing mouse access to buildings by sealing any
openings and using respirators when homeowners find an infestation is the
best defense, said Duree Duke, city director of environmental health. The
cases usually disappear by the end of summer, Pierce said.

prevalent throughout the southwestern states and whose reservoir host is
the deermouse. - Mod.CP]
