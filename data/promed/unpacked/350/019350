[1] H7N9 lull
Date: Tue 14 May 2013

The H7N9 avian flu epidemic has spread to 3 more Chinese provinces, but no new cases have been reported since 7 May 2013. An update to Nature's exclusive map of H7N9 avian influenza shows how the virus expanded its geographical range in mainland China in late April 2013 [The Nature map accompanying this article can be accessed via the source URL. - Mod.CP]. Since then, however, the epidemic has gone into a lull, with just one person falling ill with H7N9 since the start of May 2013. The drop might reflect that the authorities' control measures, such as the closure of live bird markets, are working, but it is also possible that the epidemic will rear its head again later.

The cases that occurred after 14 Apr 2013 show how H7N9 has spread compared to cases that occurred between 1 Feb and 13 Apr 2013. Most cases have appeared in areas designated as at higher risk for the earlier H5N1 avian flu rather than in areas at lower risk. This seems to be consistent with the current thinking that birds -- particularly poultry -- and live-bird markets may be the main sources of human infection. Comparing the 2 epidemics may help researchers to target efforts to track and control H7N9.

In late April 2013, the 1st 5 cases of H7N9 were reported in Fujian province, far south of the main outbreak area around Shanghai and neighbouring regions on the eastern seaboard of China. Two cases were also reported in Hunan province and 6 in Jiangxi province, both southwest of Shanghai. Human cases of the virus had already been reported in Beijing to the north and in Henan province in the centre of the country. The total area where human cases have been reported now spans some 1700 km north to south and 1000 km east to west.

One case of H7N9 was reported in Taiwan on 24 Apr 2013. However, the 53-year-old man is thought to have caught the disease in Suzhou in Jiangsu province in mainland China, so that is where his case is shown on the map.

As of 8 May 2013, China has reported to the World Health Organization a total of 131 lab-confirmed cases, including 32 deaths and newspaper and other reports suggest that those numbers had not changed as of 13 May 2013. What's striking is that daily reports of new cases, which flooded in during April 2013, slowed near the end of the month, and just 4 new cases have been reported since the start of May 2013. No new cases have been reported from Shanghai province, the epicentre of the epidemic, since 20 Apr 2013.

It is unknown whether and to what extent the drop-off may have been caused by the closing of live-bird markets and other control measures. Another possibility is seasonality. Past avian flu virus outbreaks have often tended to show seasonal patterns of occurrence, with most outbreaks occurring during the colder months of the years and fewer in the warmer months. But after just a week-long lull is too soon to speculate on what turn the epidemic of H7N9 flu will take next.

[2] 36th death

As of 15 May 2013, H7N9 bird flu has killed one person in central China's Hunan Province, local health authorities said Wednesday [15 May 2013]. A 64-year-old woman died Tuesday [14 May 2013] morning at a hospital in the city of Shaoyang some 20 days after her infection was confirmed, the Hunan Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission said. She was the 1st person in Hunan diagnosed with the virus. Another 3 patients were confirmed afterward. One of the 3 died earlier this month [May 2013], one has recovered, and the other is still in critical condition, according to the commission.

The 1st human infection was reported in China in late March 2013. Authorities have recorded [at least] 130 confirmed cases thus far. Previously, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said the virus had killed 35 people on the mainland, while 57 of those infected had recovered as of 13 May 2013.
