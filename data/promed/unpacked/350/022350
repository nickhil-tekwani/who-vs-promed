In the Russian Federation, as well as in the European region generally, measles continues to be a serious problem. According to the World Health Organization, in 2013 in 37 European countries, there were more than 26 000 cases of measles infection. By the end of the year, a worsening situation in Turkey and Indonesia -- countries which traditionally have been visited by Russian tourists -- had repercussions in the Russian Federation. Cases of measles were also imported from Thailand to Russia and China.

In the Russian Federation during 2013, cases of measles were reported in 58 regions. About 45 percent of the cases were children, mostly unvaccinated individuals. Group outbreaks of measles were recorded in a number of educational institutions, including a medical institution in the Astrakhan Region. In the Republic of Dagestan, measles outbreaks have been reported among unvaccinated migrant Roma communities in the Ryazan, Yaroslavl, Tula, Kaluga, Orenburg, Saratov, and Nizhny Novgorod regions, and also in the Republics of Bashkortostan and Adygea in the Stavropol Territory. Currently, a large outbreak of measles with over 90 victims has been recorded in the Kursk Region among members of a community who refuse preventive vaccinations on religious grounds.

Measles is one of the most contagious viral infections that is spread from person to person. Transmission is carried by droplets. Dangerous potential complications may follow infection, affecting the central nervous system, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract. Measles can be a cause of death and disability, especially among young children.

Persons who have not experienced measles virus infection and who have not been vaccinated against it are highly susceptible to the disease throughout life and can contract measles at any age. The most effective measure to prevent measles is immunisation. The CPS recommends vaccination for all children and adults with no record of prior immunisation against this disease according to the National Calendar of Preventive Vaccinations. This is especially true for those who regularly travel to medically underdeveloped countries. Parents who refuse vaccination endanger the health and lives of their children.

Public Health England (PHE) confirmed it was working with Torbay Council following a confirmed case of measles in a child in the area.

The affected child has now fully recovered and returned to school. Letters with information provided by PHE have been sent to parents advising them to ensure that their children are adequately immunised. To confer protection, children should have had 2 doses of MMR, the immunisation that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella as part of the National Childhood Immunisation Programme.

The rest of the school have also been given advice on signs and symptoms of measles, which include fever, cough, red and painful eyes, cold-like symptoms, loss of appetite, and rash which tends to follow 3 to 4 days after the onset of the other symptoms.

Mike Wade, consultant in public health at the regional PHE Centre, said: "Measles is a very infectious virus, and can spread rapidly in close-knit communities such as schools if people have not been immunised. While most people who catch measles will recover completely within a couple of weeks, it's important to remember measles can be a very serious illness that can leave permanent disability, and occasionally even kill."

Caroline Dimond, director of public health for Torbay, said: "Although the incidence of measles across Torbay is low, in order to prevent a measles outbreak, it is really important that parents of children, particularly between the ages of 10 and 16, who have not been immunised or had the 2nd MMR jab contact their GP surgery to arrange a vaccination."

Parents are being urged to make sure their children are fully vaccinated against measles following a rise in the number of cases of the virus [disease] in South West Wales. Public Health Wales said that, as at the end of December 2013, there had been 44 cases in the outbreak, 1st reported as being linked to 4 schools in the Neath and Swansea area. Another 5 new cases have been reported locally in the last 11 days, although Public Health Wales says these cannot be directly linked to the outbreak.

The new cases are mainly around the Swansea and Neath area, but there have been cases in Carmarthenshire, with one person requiring hospital treatment. Public Health Wales said that children between 10-18 have mainly been affected by the outbreak, but a number of adults, who are more likely to suffer complications of the infection, have also been diagnosed with the potentially fatal virus.

Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "It is really disappointing to see more cases of measles in the Swansea and Neath area, and we continue to remind everyone of the importance of MMR vaccination. It is very concerning that this outbreak is continuing to spread. This is a potentially nasty infection that can easily be prevented with a safe, effective vaccine, and we would not see measles in Wales if enough children and young people were vaccinated. Uptake of the MMR vaccine in small children is the highest it has ever been in Wales, but we still have a large number of children and teenagers aged 10 to 18 who are not vaccinated. We are also seeing adult cases and would urge anyone born after 1970 to check whether they have either had measles or 2 doses of the MMR vaccination and speak to their GP urgently if they have not. This age group is most vulnerable to the complications of measles. It simply is not worth the risk for anyone of any age to remain unvaccinated."

The current outbreak follows the largest ever outbreak of measles in Wales since the introduction of the MMR vaccination, with more than 1200 cases of measles in the same area between November 2012 and July 2013. In that outbreak, 88 people were hospitalised and one adult died.

Although more than 70 000 catch up doses of MMR were given across Wales during the last outbreak, around 30 000 children and young people in the 10 to 18 age group remain unprotected.

Dr Hoffmann said: "To try to bring the outbreak linked to 4 schools in the Neath and Swansea area under control, schools were advised to ask unvaccinated children who were close contacts of measles cases to stay away from school. We know that many of these children went on to develop measles and that keeping them away from school helped stop the outbreak from spreading further. We would advise parents that if their children are not vaccinated and come into contact with people with measles, they may not be able to attend school until the risk has passed, so it makes best sense to vaccinate them as soon as possible."

UNICEF and its partners have begun to organise a campaign to vaccinate over 1.6 million children to stop a measles outbreak in Guinea amid growing numbers of cases among children, especially in the capital Conakry. Since November last year [2013], 37 cases have been confirmed in the capital, all children under 10 years old. Over the past few weeks, the numbers of cases of measles have been increasing sharply and have led to the death of one child.

This recent spike has prompted the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene of Guinea to officially declare an outbreak in the Conakry municipalities of Matam, Matoto, and Ratoma. The disease has also been reported in other parts of the country, namely the prefectures of Boke, Coyah, Dubreka, Kissidougou, and Mandiana.

"We are very concerned about this outbreak. Measles is highly contagious and extremely dangerous, especially for young, malnourished children. As we've already seen, it can be fatal. In a densely populated city like Conakry, disease spreads quickly," said UNICEF Representative in Guinea Dr. Mohamed Ayoya.

The Government of Guinea, UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are joining forces to set up coordinated mechanisms to contain the outbreak. For the initial response, UNICEF will provide vaccines, refrigerators, needles, and other medical supplies and logistical support to the government for the vaccination of children in the Kaloum and Dixinn neighbourhoods of Conakry as well as in the affected areas outside the capital. MSF and WHO will support vaccination efforts in the outbreak-declared areas of Conakry, namely Matam, Matoto, and Ratoma. The vaccination phase of the national campaign will begin in the coming weeks as soon as vaccines, supplies, and funding to ensure a continuous rollout are available.

Additionally, UNICEF and its partners will supply the government with medicine to treat those who have already been infected by measles. "There is no time to waste," said Felix Ackebo, UNICEF Deputy Representative. "We need to move faster than the disease. Because measles takes up to 12 days to reveal its symptoms, it is possible that the disease has spread further into the country. All children who are still not immunized are at risk. Therefore, an outbreak immunization campaign is required as soon as possible."

UNICEF and its partners are urgently seeking funding to replenish the stocks of vaccines needed to rollout the outbreak campaign across the country to vaccinate all children between 9 months and 14 years. Additional medicines to treat those already infected are also required.

Measles is among the world's most contagious diseases and can cause severe complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and encephalitis, among others, and death.

Six new measles cases have been detected at Lopiding sub-district hospital in Turkana County.

A source at the institution said new cases of measles infection were detected in Sudanese refugees fleeing fighting in South Sudan. The officer said they are currently treating 21 patients suffering from the highly infectious disease.

"We have detected 6 new cases of measles among Sudanese who are arriving in the country, and this brings the number of patients to 21," said one of the nurses, who requested anonymity.

Turkana County Women Representative Joyce Emanikor urged the government and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to strengthen screening of Sudanese refugees. Emanikol said there is need for the government and UNHCR to conduct proper screening to detect communicable diseases and guns among those seeking refuge at Kakuma refugee camp. "We are calling for proper and strengthened screening at the border to check on spread of communicable diseases and guns. We are aware that one person has died of measles, and the situation is worrying."

The Olongapo City government declared a measles outbreak after recording 80 cases for the 1st 2 weeks of 2014, according to an ABS-CBN report on Saturday [18 Jan 2014].

According to the report: "We unanimously approved the resolution declaring the measles outbreak to facilitate holistic and swift responsive actions to protect the health, welfare, and well-being of the people of Olongapo as well our neighbor communities," City Councilor Noel Atienza told The STAR News Agency.

"80 patients with suspected measles cases (are being) treated at our hospital, with one confirmed death since 1 Jan 2014, and more patients with suspected viral infectious diseases are continuously arriving," Jessie Manuel, administrator of James L. Gordon Hospital, told The STAR. "We are giving patients strong dozes of antibiotics to address complications such as pneumonia, and patients have been placed in an isolated area to prevent the spread of the viral infectious disease," he added.

The vast majority of cases were seen in children under 5 years of age. The Philippines Department of Health also released the total measles count for 2013 last week. According to a tweet from Dr. Eric Tayag, Assistant Health Secretary: "1 Jan-31 Dec 2013: Total of 2232 confirmed cases w/55 deaths."

There were 7 notified cases of measles reported from 29 Dec 2013 to 11 Jan 2014. Four of the cases were locally-acquired, and 3 were imported. The patients were aged between 7 months and 28 years.

A Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson said all of these were single, sporadic cases and that imported cases occur every year in Singapore but have not resulted in community outbreaks locally. MOH added that Singaporeans are at low risk for measles outbreaks due to the country's high rates of measles vaccination and level of immunity.

Measles is a common disease that is endemic in almost every country in the world, including Singapore. It typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, followed by a rash a few days later. Members of the public should seek early medical attention if they are unwell with symptoms of measles. MOH strongly encourages parents to ensure that their young children receive 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination on schedule, with the 1st dose at 12 months and a 2nd at 15-18 months.

The Children Hospital No. 1 reported 24 infants admitted for measles on 20 Jan 2014. This is the highest reported case number in 5 years. Before December 2012, the hospital had received no cases for the disease in 5 years, said Head of Infection and Brain section Dr. Truong Huu Khanh. Over 100 children have been hospitalized for treatment since then. Patients suffer high fever, rash, and pneumonia. Up to 80 percent of children infected live in Ho Chi Minh City.

Medical workers are worried about the spread of the disease and increased hospitalisation. Almost 65 children were admitted to the Tropical Disease Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City for the disease since December 2013. The average number children infected at Children Hospital No. 2 are 5-10 a day. The disease is transmitted through the respiratory system, said Dr. Khanh. Most patients affected by the disease have never been vaccinated.

The doctor urges parents to vaccinate their children at 9-months-old while it is most effective.

So far, 5 people are in quarantine after contracting the red measles [as opposed to German] virus, and the Ministry of Health has been busy tracing their steps to keep it from spreading.

The virus is well known across the globe, but according to chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab, it's not seen in Canada very often. Usually, he said, it is transferred here through travel. In this case, 2 people brought the virus into Regina from overseas.

"In one particular instance, there was no further [transmission] of measles. In the 2nd instance, after the initial case, which presented in the 1st week of January 2014, there have been a further 3 cases that are linked to that initial case," said Shahab. He said none of those additional 3 people were family members of the initial carrier, but he said they were in the same room as that person at some point.

"Even one or 2 (cases) for us would be a concern, because those people could expose others," he said. "The concern, obviously, is that if half of the people in a room weren't vaccinated, then you know you could see several dozen cases. I think the good news in Saskatchewan is that our overall immunization rates are high. In Saskatchewan, 90 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated."

According to Shahab, anyone born prior to 1970 is considered to be immune. Anyone born after that who has had 2 MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) shots would also be considered to be immune. Those left would only be at risk if they had been in a small room with an individual who was infected.

This is why the Ministry of Health has been tracking where those 5 people went before being put into quarantine. A list of the places and times that people may have come into contact with the virus is listed below:

- Hotel Saskatchewan Radisson Plaza (19 Jan 2014 between 9:30 and 1:30 p.m.)
- Superstore, Rochdale area (17 Jan 2014 between 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.)
- Wal-Mart, Rochdale area (17 Jan 2014 between 11:15 a.m. and 1:45 p.m.)
- Uplands Pizza (17 Jan 2014 between 11:45 a.m. and 3 p.m.)
- Co-Operators Centre at Evraz Place (18 Jan 2014 between 1:30 p.m. and 5:45 p.m.)
- Soma Salon and Spa (20 Jan 2014 between 3:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.)
- Security Building Supplies (13-17 Jan 2014)
- Chapters/Starbucks (13 Jan 2014 between 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and 22 Jan 2014 between 9:30 and 1:15 a.m.)
- Sobeys, south Albert St. (13 Jan 2014 between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.)
- Lawson Aquatic Centre (14 Jan 2014 between 12:30 and 5:30 p.m.)
- Safeway, Cathedral area (14 Jan 2014 between 3:30 and 6:30 p.m.)
- Menchie's Frozen Yogurt, east end (14 Jan 2014 between 8 and 11 p.m.)
- Argyle Park Community Centre (14 Jan 2014 between 6:30 and 9 p.m. and 15 Jan 2014 between 6:30 and 9 p.m.)
- Uplands Community Centre (14 Jan 2014 between 6:30 and 9 p.m.)

Shahab said measles symptoms typically are red eyes, fever, cough, and a runny nose followed by a rash. He said it can take up to 3 weeks for those symptoms to develop after the onset of the infection.

Marion County health officials issued a health warning after a child with measles was treated in a Silverton Hospital and transferred to a Portland hospital, according to a newspaper report.

The Statesman-Journal reported that an adult in a Marion County home traveled outside the U.S. and upon return was the 1st in the family to show symptoms. The rest of the family soon experienced rashes and fevers, with one child being treated on 12 Jan 2014.

The newspaper reported that a child visiting from Ukraine a year ago was diagnosed with measles, and that was the 1st case in Marion County since 2000.

There is no reason to believe that the public is at risk, according to a health department statement referenced in the report.

Recent travellers between the Philippines and Sydney and Sydney to Brisbane have been urged to be on alert for measles symptoms.

A man from Brisbane's south side has been diagnosed with the highly contagious disease, and Queensland Health officials have warned that he was likely to have been contagious when he flew on Qantas from the Philippines to Sydney and then continued on a domestic leg back to Brisbane on 21 Jan 2014.

Anyone who may have visited the IGA at Carina on 22 Jan 2014 could also be at risk of contracting measles.

Metro South Hospital and Health Service staff will be contacting people known to have interacted with the man, but public health physician Brad McCall said that given the large number of people potentially at risk, the public also needed to be vigilant. "If people are adequately vaccinated with 2 recorded doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are very unlikely to get the disease," Dr McCall said. "Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases and is spread by tiny droplets through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms usually start around 10 days after infection, but sometimes longer, so anyone who develops measles-like symptoms within the next week should contact their GP for advice. It is very important to call the medical practice 1st to say you could have measles so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others." Dr McCall said about 30 per cent of adult measles cases require hospitalisation.

Western Australians have been warned to check their measles vaccination status after 2 adults with the disease were hospitalised last week. A woman in her 30s and a man in his 40s were hospitalised after being infected with measles during a trip to Asia.

14 cases of measles have been confirmed since October 2013, compared with an average of just 3 cases during the same period over the previous 5 years.

Health Department acting director of communicable disease control Paul Effler said it was possible more measles cases would occur in WA in the coming weeks. "Measles is highly infectious and is spread through coughing and sneezing," he said. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, a runny nose, cough, and sore, red eyes, which usually last for days before a red, blotchy rash appears. Complications can range from an ear infection and diarrhoea to pneumonia or swelling of the brain. Anyone who develops measles symptoms should seek medical attention, but it is important that they phone ahead 1st to ensure they don't share the waiting area with other patients and risk infecting them," Dr Effler said.

Measles can be prevented through vaccination, but people born in 1965 or earlier are usually immune, because they are likely to have had the disease during childhood. "Measles is still common in many parts of the world, and Australians who travel abroad need to check their immunisation status," Dr Effler said.

Health authorities say they suspect increased foreign tourism to regional destinations to be behind a spike in measles cases in Western Australia.

There have been 14 cases of measles reported in the state since October 2013, significantly up on previous years. Doctors say there is a risk the disease could spread, especially because Western Australia's vaccination rate is so low.
