An 8-year-old girl died in Bolivia because of rabies. She acquired the disease after being bitten by a pup 3 months ago, reported health authorities in Santa Cruz region, where this occurrence took place.

The Departmental Health Service [SEDES, according to its Spanish initials. -Mod.JG] from Santa Cruz region indicated that the death occurred 22 Jun 2015, and the girl was from Portachuelo municipality.

According to SEDES, the mother of the girl did not report the accident to any health center, and it was only 1 week ago when she took her to a healthcare facility when symptoms of the disease occurred and her condition deteriorated. This is the 1st case of human rabies occurring in Santa Cruz in the last 2.5 years.

This occurrence is the 3rd fatal case of rabies reported in Bolivia in 2015: March a 20-year-old woman died, and in May, a 63-year-old man also died. Both cases were caused by dog bites and they occurred in Cochabamba central region.

There are more than 300 000 abandoned dogs living in Bolivian streets, a country with 10 million inhabitants, according to official figures from the Ministry of Health.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) have issued an Epidemiologial Alert on rabies in the Americas. [See: http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=46&Itemid=40766&lang=en]

Although progress has been made towards the eradication of canine rabies virus transmission to humans, some countries in the region continue to report human cases of rabies infection. Since the beginning of 2014, to date, human cases of rabies following canine exposure have been reported from: Bolivia (6 cases), Haiti (3 cases), Guatemala (2 cases), Brazil (1 case) and Dominican Republic (1 case).

Of concern, canine rabies has been identified in areas of some countries where previously rabies was not reported: Jujuy and Salta in northern Argentina, Mato Grosso do Sul in central-western Brazil and Loma Plata city in the department of Boquerón, western Paraguay.

Canine rabies was reported in the Arequipa region of south-western Peru; an area declared free of rabies more than 10 years ago.

Advice for Travellers: Rabies pre-exposure vaccination is sometimes advised for high-rabies-risk countries of the Americas; see individual country records for further information. Travellers are advised to avoid animal contact and report any bites sustained as soon as possible for medical assessment.

[The PAHO Alert is brief but with very useful references. It also had the following very relevant recommendations:

Recommendations
Through this alert, PAHO/WHO reinforces its recommendation to the countries of the Americas to continue immunizing dogs and to have post-exposure prophylaxis (WHO pre-qualified rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin) available to respond to potential suspected cases. PAHO/WHO also emphasizes that health care workers should be trained in identifying suspected cases and to promptly administrate prophylaxis.

PAHO/WHO recommends:
- Carry out mass vaccination campaign of canines until appropriate and sustainable immunity levels are achieved (above 80 percent of the estimated canine population). This is the most efficient and cost-effective method for the control and elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs. Vaccination of domestic animals (mainly dogs) has been demonstrated as decreasing the occurrence of human disease up to its elimination.
- Raise public awareness to ensure persons seek immediate medical attention for suspected exposure to the rabies virus.
- Use effective and safe WHO pre-qualified vaccines for humans for the pre and post- exposure prophylaxis for persons exposed to the rabies virus. The rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins used for prophylaxis should comply with the WHO 2010 position paper. Administration of these vaccines should be guided by the updated WHO guidelines on rabies pre and post-prophylaxis for humans.
- There is no contraindication for post-exposure prophylaxis for pregnant women, infants, the elderly or immunocompromised individuals, including children with HIV/AIDS. The number of people attacked by dogs who fall within the WHO categories of exposure I, II, and III2, for whom prophylaxis was not recommended, is an indicator of the implementation of universal health care access in areas where anti-rabies prophylaxis is indicated because of a persistent risk.
- Inform the public and health care workers that cleaning wounds and getting post- exposure vaccinations as soon as possible after contact with an animal suspected of having rabies, can prevent the onset of rabies in 100 percent of exposures.
- Remind health care workers to begin immediate post-exposure treatment for exposed persons; the treatment should only be stopped if the attacking animal shows no signs of rabies while under observation. If the animal is dead, by slaughter or otherwise, it must be tested for the rabies virus; the results should be sent to the veterinary and public health services responsible for planning and implementation of control activities in the area where the exposure occurred.
- Raise awareness of health care workers to consider rabies as a possible diagnosis in patients that show acute or progressive encephalitis, and train them to provide timely and appropriate prophylaxis to those exposed.
• Acquire human immunobiologicals (WHO pre-qualified vaccines and immunoglobulin) and canine anti-rabies vaccine in order to respond to a possible human rabies case.

In addition, PAHO/WHO reiterates the recommendations made in the 2010, 2011 and 2014 Epidemiological Alerts on rabies regarding the need to develop strategies to ensure access to pre-exposure prophylaxis for persons, based on the risk characterization of areas, considered most at risk of exposure to rabies, for example people who live in or visit rainforests due to the risk of exposure through bat-bites or by other wild animal suspected of rabies. - Mod.MHJ
