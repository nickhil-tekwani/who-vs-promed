[In recent weeks, Europe has reported multiple HPAI outbreaks in both wild and domestic birds involving the serotypes H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1.

In Denmark, HPAI H5N8 was reported on 6 and 10 Nov 2020, affecting wild birds. See reports at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=36457 and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=36520.

On 17 Nov 2020, the French Minister of Agriculture and Food placed the country on high-risk alert. The alert requires all poultry farms to keep animals indoors or install protective netting to prevent contact with wild birds.
