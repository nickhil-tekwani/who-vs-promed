IRRADIATION OF FOODSTUFFS: A SUGGESTION (04)

I am studying the organism _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, which has been cited in
recent articles and news stories about the benefits of food irradiation.
While I am somewhat pro-irradiation, that is I am not strongly opposed to the
technology, I do feel that there are certain concerns that need to be
addressed as well as certain misconceptions about the technology.
1. Food that has been irradiated is not sterile. While at the radiation
levels called for many microorganisms are indeed killed (1-3kGy), a number
of spore-forming species are not. For instance, _Clostridium botulinum_
spores are not completely [inactivated], then again, other post-harvest
treatments do not completely kill all microorganisms either (Tritsch, 1993
and DuPont, 1993). I feel that it is a mistake to suggest that irradiated
food is sterile unless the following is used:
>From Monk et al, 1995:
(a) Radapperization - the treatment of food with high doses (10-kGy)
of ionizing radiation to produce commercially sterile food
(b) Radicidation - treatment of food with large (<10 kGy) doses of
ionizing radiation to reduce the number of nonsporulating pathogenic
microorganisms
(c) Radurization - treatment of food with ionizing radiation (<10
kGy) to reduce the viable population of specific microorganisms in order to
extend the shelf-life of certain foods
Most irradiation of foods is (and suggested) along the lines of 1-5kGy.
2. Public opinion. While there is still hesitation in many peoples' minds
about the dangers of food irradation, with the apparent increasing incidence
of foodborne illnesses this reluctance seems to be fading. As was the case
with pasturization, it is most likely that it's just a matter of time before
the public demands this technology. One serious problem with this (and with
much of the publicity surrounding this technology) is [the impression] that
food irradiation is a panacea. This is not the case and [such ideas] should
be discouraged. While many instances of microbial contamination will be
prevented, not all will. Food irradition will more than likely be
interpreted as an adequate replacement for safe food handling techniques. A
chicken may be "safe" in its wrapper but the moment it is unwrapped and
placed on the countertop it is no longer "clean."
How many of us wash our fruit and vegetables before eating them? How many of
us clean our cutting boards sufficiently? How many of us leave the
Thanksgiving turkey on the table for hours - or on the counter in the
kitchen while we pick at it through the day? Many foodborne illnesses
can be traced to poor food handling and storage practices both in and out
of the home. While food irradiation will certainly help with contamination
that occurs pre-packaging (assuming that all foods will be irradiated AFTER
packaging and that proper packaging practices will be observed), it will do
nothing for contamination that occurs AFTER the package is opened and the
food is being prepared. Even if irradation did sterilize food it would no
longer be sterile once the packaging is opened. I may be wrong here but I've
yet to see a sterile kitchen.
That food irradiation will be viewed as a panacea is what worries me the most.
Our food handling and storage practices aren't great to begin with. I fear
that the false sense of security food irradiation may bring will do nothing
but worsen this.
There is no free lunch in the microbial world - there is no absolute solution
or "answer." If irradiation is to be of any real use it must be viewed in a
stark and realistic light and it must be remember that it is simply another
tool - not the answer.
