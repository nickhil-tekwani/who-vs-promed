Alert! Bad lot of compounded toltrazuril/pyrimethamine from Wickliffe
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I am sharing this e-mail regarding adverse reactions (including 2 fatalities) to the compounded drug toltrazuril/pyrimethamine from Wickliffe Pharmacy, based in Kentucky. It was sent from the University of Florida Large Animal Hospital, where several of the affected horses were being treated. See below:

8 horses that were given a single dose of an EPM [equine protozoal myeloencephalitis] drug at a training stable in Ocala, Florida had neurologic disturbances within 36 hours of administration. 4 had repeated severe generalized seizures, one became recumbent and couldn't stand, and 3 had single or repeated partial seizures but remained standing. One horse died during a seizure at the farm and I euthanized the down horse after managing it for 2 days at our clinic. All the other horses have survived with intensive management but are now severely leukopenic. The drug is compounded toltrazuril/pyrimethamine from Wickliffe pharmacy. I suspect there is a serious overdose of pyrimethamine due to accidental misformulation and all the surviving horses are now being given large doses of folic acid. Various drug analyses are in process.

If you know anyone who uses this drug (toltrazuril/pyrimethamine from Wickliffe) please warn them of the above. I don't have lot number information but I'm sure it is available from Wickliffe.

[Toltrazuril (trade name Baycox) is a coccidiostat; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltrazuril. Pyrimethamine (trade name Daraprim) is a medication used for protozoal infections. It is commonly used as an antimalarial drug (for both treatment and prevention of malaria), and is also used (combined with the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfadiazine) in the treatment of _Toxoplasma gondii_ infections in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-positive individuals. It is also currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a treatment for ALS [Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]. In 2011, researchers discovered that pyrimethamine can increase beta-hexosaminidase activity, thus potentially slowing down the progression of Late-Onset Tay-Sachs disease. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is primarily active against _Plasmodium falciparum_, but it also has activity against _P. vivax_. Due to the emergence of pyrimethamine-resistant strains of _P. falciparum_, pyrimethamine alone is seldom used nowadays, but in combination with a long-acting sulfonamide like sulfadiazine it is still widely used, even though resistance to this combination is on the up. It has also been used in the treatment of actinomycetoma, isosporiasis, and for the treatment and prevention of _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia. Pyrimethamine can cause a rash and if higher doses are used (like for toxoplasmosis) it can cause GI symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, dry mouth, weight loss, and diarrhoea, CNS effects like headache, ataxia, and rarely seizures, and haematologic side effects like leucopenia and anaemia [see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimethamine]

So it would appear that these horses may have been overdosed with pyrimethamine, possibly as a result of a faulty formulation or instruction sheet. Members with equine clients should be aware of this risk. - Mod.MHJ
