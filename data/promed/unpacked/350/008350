Scientists have found a new virus that can be transmitted by blood transfusions and other blood-based products.

It looks a little like the hepatitis C virus, which can cause permanent liver damage, and a little like the human pegivirus, which appears to be harmless, the team reports in the journal mBio.

They've named it human hepegivirus-1 (HHpgV-1).

"We have been able to find a new virus. It's clearly transmitted as a result of human (blood) transfusion," said infectious disease expert Dr Ian Lipkin, who oversaw the study team at Columbia University [in New York].

"It is the 1st transfusion-associated virus that's been described in a long time. We don't know if it is going to be a significant cause of human hepatitis," Lipkin told NBC News. "But probably not, the researchers said.

"So far there is no need to be concerned," said Amit Kapoor, an assistant professor at Columbia University who led the study. "We really don't know if there is ongoing transmission of this virus. It may be good for you." Lipkin agreed. "I'm not really worried about this particular virus," he said. "This is not SARS. This is not MERS. This is not HIV."

To find it, the team sampled blood banked at the National Institutes of Health from 46 volunteers between 1974 and 1980. They found it in 2 samples. Both patients appear to have "cleared" the virus and there is no evidence it caused any disease.

All the volunteers got blood products to treat hemophilia. The virus only showed up after they got transfusions.

Then they looked at samples from 106 people in another study, and found the virus in 2 more people. One appears to have been infected for as long as 5 years but both cleared the virus, too.

"We just don't know how many viruses are transmitted through the blood supply. There are so many viruses out there, and they need to be characterized in order to ensure that transfusions are safe," Kapoor said.

Hemophilia was once only treated with blood products taken from people. Now it's often treated with genetically engineered products, which do not carry infectious agents.

Now that the genetic sequence of this new virus is published, Lipkin said, other scientists can start looking for it.

"More than 30 million blood components are transfused annually in the United States alone. Surveillance for infectious agents in the blood supply is key to ensuring the safety of this critical resource for medicine and public health," the researchers wrote.

In the same issue of mBio, another team led by Lipkin reports they found a new virus related to hepatitis A virus in seals. It doesn't seem to make the seals sick but it's a possible ancestor of hepatitis A, they wrote.

"This finding suggests that the diversity and evolutionary history of these viruses might be far greater than previously thought and may provide insight into the origin and pathogenicity of hepatitis A virus," they wrote.

They've named it phopivirus.

[This report documents the characterisation of an infectious agent from human serum that has been characterised as a hepatitis C, which is not associated with human disease. Another such infectious agent has been detected in the serum of seals, but is not associated with any known virus in seals. Such agent was detected by its sequence characteristics. Sequence analysis alone has not so far proved to be an efficient approach to the identification of potential infectious agents.

Abstract
--------
To investigate the transmission of novel infectious agents by blood transfusion, we studied changes in the virome composition of blood transfusion recipients pre- and post-transfusion. Using this approach, we detected and genetically characterized a novel human virus, human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1), that shares features with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly called GB virus C or hepatitis G virus). HCV and HPgV belong to the genera _Hepacivirus_ and _Pegivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_. HHpgV-1 was found in serum samples from 2 blood transfusion recipients and 2 hemophilia patients who had received plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates. In the former, the virus was detected only in the post-transfusion samples, indicating blood-borne transmission. Both hemophiliacs were persistently viremic over periods of at least 201 and 1,981 days. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of HHpgV-1 contained a type IV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), structurally similar to although highly divergent in sequence from that of HCV and other hepaciviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural genes (NS3 and NS5B) showed that HHpgV-1 forms a branch within the pegivirus clade distinct from HPgV and homologs infecting other mammalian species. In common with some pegivirus variants infecting rodents and bats, the HHpgV-1 genome encodes a short, highly basic protein upstream of E1, potentially possessing a core-like function in packaging RNA during assembly. Identification of this new human virus, HHpgV-1, expands our knowledge of the range of genome configurations of these viruses and may lead to a reevaluation of the original criteria by which the genera _Hepacivirus_ and _Pegivirus_ are defined.

Importance
----------
More than 30 million blood components are transfused annually in the United States alone. Surveillance for infectious agents in the blood supply is key to ensuring the safety of this critical resource for medicine and public health. Here, we report the identification of a new and highly diverse HCV/GB virus (GBV)-like virus from human serum samples. This new virus, human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1), was found in serum samples from blood transfusion recipients, indicating its potential for transmission via transfusion products. We also found persistent long-term HHpgV-1 viremia in two hemophilia patients. HHpgV-1 is unique because it shares genetic similarity with both highly pathogenic HCV and the apparently nonpathogenic HPgV (GBV-C). Our results add to the list of human viruses and provide data to develop reagents to study virus transmission and disease association and for interrupting virus transmission and new human infections. - Mod.CP]
