In Yellowstone, cougars are facing an epidemic of their own: Bubonic plague.

The flea-borne disease, most famous for killing half of Europe during the medieval ages, is showing up in the cougar population inhabiting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [GYE], according to a recent study.

Findings suggest it could be widespread. Of the 28 big cats researchers tested, 12 were infected or had been infected, according to the study published in Environmental Conservation.

"This suggests that: (bubonic plague) may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed," it said, also adding that plague may be a "significant" cause of death for the animals.

Researchers carried out the study over the course of 9 years, following the discovery of 2 dead cougars, a mother and her cub, in Wyoming, the Smithsonian Magazine said.

The deaths weren't in and of themselves surprising, lead researcher Mark Elbroch told Livescience.

It was the winter, and so starvation was the presumed culprit, but when the true cause of death was discovered, it "was a shocker," he told the outlet.

Researchers said it's very unlikely the average person would ever catch plague from a mountain lion, but given that the disease is capable of animal-to-human transmission, they recommended warnings for some.

"We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure," the study said.

Cougar behavior makes them a poor means of transferring diseases to people, but as Elbroch's team points out, their high rate of infection means the Yellowstone ecosystem itself could be a hotbed of plague.

A Boy Scout came down with plague in 2008 following a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported.

"Plague is very much a part of the landscape in the western U.S., and wild animals are frequently exposed to it," a USDA researcher Sarah Bevins told National Geographic. "Human plague infections are still relatively rare ... but untreated plague infections are still just as deadly as they were 500 years ago."

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels, chipmunks and prairie dogs are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.

Carnivores (like cougars) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears (another carnivore) in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15% to 36%.

The study referred to can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892920000065. The abstract reads: "We tested for plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in a puma population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 9 years, overlapping a case when a boy in the area became infected with plague. Antibodies to _Y. pestis_ were detected in 8 of 17 (47%) pumas tested by complementenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the organism itself was detected in 4 of 11 (36%) pumas tested after necropsy. Neither puma sex nor age was significantly associated with _Y. pestis_ exposure or mortality, although our sample size was small. The overall prevalence of exposure we recorded was similar to that found along the western slope of Colorado, which is adjacent to the Four Corners region, a known plague hotspot in the USA. This suggests that: (1) _Y. pestis_ may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed; (2) plague is a significant source of mortality for local pumas (6.6% of sub-adult and adult mortality); and (3) pumas may be a useful sentinel for potential risk of plague exposure to humans throughout the West. We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure." - Mod.PMB
