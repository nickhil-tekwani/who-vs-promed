Five public research institutions in France have imposed a 3-month moratorium on the study of prions -- a class of misfolding, infectious proteins causing fatal brain diseases -- after a retired lab worker who handled prions in the past was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common prion disease in humans. An investigation is underway to find out whether the patient, who worked at a lab run by the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE), contracted the disease on the job.

If so, it would be the 2nd such case in France in the past few years. In June 2019, [EJ], an INRAE lab worker died at age 33, 10 years after pricking her thumb during an experiment with prion-infected mice [see Prion disease update: 2019, France, lab worker 20210110.8090489]. Her illness had already led to tightened safety measures at French prion labs.

The aim of the moratorium, which affects 9 labs, is to "study the possibility of a link with the [new patient's] former professional activity and if necessary to adapt the preventative measures in force in research laboratories," according to a joint press release issued by the 5 institutions yesterday [27 Jul 2021; https://www.inrae.fr/actualites/suspension-provisoire-travaux-prions-laboratoires-recherche-publics-francais; in French].

"This is the right way to go in the circumstances," says Ronald Melki, a structural biologist at a prion lab jointly operated by the French national research agency CNRS and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). "It is always wise to ask questions about the whole working process when something goes wrong. The occurrence of these harsh diseases in 2 of our scientific colleagues clearly affects the whole prion community, which is a small 'familial' community of less than 1000 people worldwide," Emmanuel Comoy, deputy director of CEA's Unit of Prion Disorders and Related Infectious Agents, writes in an email to Science. Although prion research already has strict safety protocols, "it necessarily reinforces the awareness of the risk linked to these infectious agents," he says.

In EJ's case, there is little doubt she was infected on the job, according to a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 2020 (1). She had variant CJD (vCJD), a form typically caused by eating beef contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. But Europe's BSE outbreak ended after 2000 and vCJD virtually disappeared; the chance someone of EJ's age in France would contract food-borne vCJD is "negligible or non-existent," according to the paper.

A scientist with inside knowledge says the new patient, a woman who worked at INRAE's Host-Pathogen Interactions and Immunity group in Toulouse, is still alive [this case has not been firmly linked to the worksite, yet. - Mod.TG]. French authorities were apparently alerted to her diagnosis late last week [week of 19 Jul 2021]. The press release suggests it's not yet clear whether the new case is vCJD or "classic" CJD, which is not known to be caused by prions from animals. Classic CJD strikes an estimated one person per million. Some 80% of cases are sporadic, meaning they have no known cause, but others are genetic or contracted from infected human tissues during transplantations. The 2 types of CJD can only be distinguished through a postmortem examination of brain tissue.

Lab infections are known to occur with many pathogens, but exposure to CJD-causing prions is unusually risky because there are no vaccines or treatments and the condition is universally fatal. And whereas most infections reveal themselves within days or weeks, CJD's average incubation period is about 10 years.

[A description of EJ's lab accident and subsequent illness can be found in ProMED-mail archive 20210110.8090489]

INRAE only recently admitted the likely link between EJ's illness and the accident. "We recognize, without ambiguity, the hypothesis of a correlation between EJ's accident ... and her infection with vCJD," INRAE chair and CEO Philippe Mauguin wrote in a [24 Jun 2021] letter to an association created by friends and colleagues to publicize EJ's case and lobby for improvements in lab safety.

EJ's family has filed both criminal charges and an administrative suit against INRAE, alleging a range of problems at the lab where she worked. She had not been trained in handling dangerous prions or responding to accidents and did not wear both metal mesh and surgical gloves, as she was supposed to, says the family's lawyer. The thumb should have been soaked in a bleach solution immediately, which did not happen, [the lawyer] adds.

Independent reports by a company specializing in occupational safety and by government inspectors have found no safety violations at the lab; one of them said there was a "strong culture" of risk management.

The government inspectors' report concluded EJ's accident was not unique, however. There had been at least 17 accidents among the 100 or so scientists and technicians in France working with prions in the previous decade, 5 of whom stabbed or cut themselves with contaminated syringes or blades. Another technician at the same lab had a fingerprick accident with prions in 2005, but has not developed vCJD symptoms so far, the lawyer says. "It is shocking no precautionary measures were taken then to ensure such an accident never happened again," he says.

In Italy, too, the last person to die of vCJD, in 2016, was a lab worker with exposure to prion-infected brain tissue, according to last year's [2020] NEJM paper, although an investigation did not find evidence of a lab accident. That patient and the lab they worked at have not been identified.

After EJ's diagnosis, "We contacted all the research prion labs in France to suggest they check their safety procedures and remind staff about the importance of respecting them," says Stephane Haik, a neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital who helped diagnose EJ and is the corresponding author on the paper. Many labs tightened procedures, according to the government inspectors' report, for instance by introducing plastic scissors and scalpels, which are disposable and less sharp, and bite and cut-resistant gloves. A team of experts from the 5 research agencies is due to submit proposals for a guide to good practice in prion research to the French government at the end of this year [2021].

The scientific community has long recognized handling prions is dangerous and an occupational risk for neuropathologists, says neuropathologist Adriano Aguzzi of the University of Zurich. Aguzzi declined to comment on the French CJD cases but told Science his lab never handles human or bovine prions for research purposes, only for diagnostics. "We conduct research only on mouse-adapted sheep prions, which have never been shown to be infectious to humans," Aguzzi says. In a 2011 paper (2), his team reported prions can spread through aerosols, at least in mice, which "may warrant re-thinking on prion biosafety guidelines in research and diagnostic laboratories," they wrote. Aguzzi says he was "totally shocked" by the finding and introduced safety measures to prevent aerosol spread at his own lab, but the paper drew little attention elsewhere.

The moratorium will "obviously" cause delays in research, but given the very long incubation periods in prion diseases, the impact of a 3-month hiatus will be limited, Comoy says. His research team at CEA also works on other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and will shift some of its efforts to those.

Although EJ's diagnosis upset many in the field, it hasn't led to an exodus among researchers in France, Haik says: "I know of only one person who resigned because they were so worried."

While the latest case has not been definitively proven, there appears to be a link with research exposure in the case of the lab worker who died in 2019. The prion diseases are nasty; we are saddened for the family of the lab worker who died and wish the new patient good health.

Hopefully, all laboratory facilities will view this issue as a means to increase their own safety protocols for the sake of every worker. - Mod.TG
