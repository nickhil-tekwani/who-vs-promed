The Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes regional health agency and the Ain prefecture alerted on Thursday [28 May 2020] to the outbreak of confirmed or probable tick-borne encephalitis in 26 inhabitants of the department.

The food origin of the transmission of the virus is privileged, and a "recall-recall" was carried out on raw milk cheeses of goat and cow of an agricultural exploitation of the basin of Oyonnax. These products would have been consumed by at least 50% of sick people, specified the ARS and the prefecture.

The 1st cases appeared in mid-April [2020] for patients who may have had "flu-like symptoms that have subsided" before "progressing to severe headaches and more or less severe dizziness."

"In order to rule out the hypothesis of an infection with the new coronavirus, a majority of patients have undergone a virological test, some associated with a serological control," which turned out to be negative, according to the same source.

In contrast, the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis was confirmed for 10 of the 26 patients, 24 of whom were hospitalized in May [2020]. A person with significant co-morbidities and similar symptoms has died, without possible confirmation of the exact cause of death.

As of 27 May [2020], 22 people with favorable development have returned to their homes; 2 others remain hospitalized, but their state of health no longer causes concern.

Unlike Lyme disease, which is caused by bacteria, also transmitted by ticks, tick-borne encephalitis is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick, mostly from spring to fall. Very exceptionally, infection can be through consumption of raw milk or raw milk cheese from an animal bitten by a tick carrying the virus [and becomes infected].

[The focus of suspicion of the source of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is on consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk cheeses of goat and cow origin. No evidence of TBE virus infection in cows and goats of the region is presented, nor if ticks are active in the area and are infected and can be ruled out as vectors there. _Ixodes_ ticks are the major source of TBE virus infections across the broad geographic area where the virus is endemic.

The TBE-infected individuals in the above report were from eastern France, a province adjacent to Switzerland, a country in which TBE is endemic and many human cases occur. According to the WHO, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of TBE are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total." In addition, "Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (see https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-02-2020-immunization-is-the-best-protection-against-tick-borne-encephalitis).

Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
