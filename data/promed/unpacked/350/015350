[The statistics from the MB CVO have been folded into the above posting.
Terry added the following comments. - Mod.MHJ]
Something to think about:
We have about 96 000 cattle in the municipalities currently affected with
anthrax and have 109 confirmed deaths. With dead cattle generously valued
at USD 1000 each, producers have collectively lost USD 100 000. The federal
indemnity pays USD 500 to help cover costs of burial, so no additional
carcass costs.
To annually vaccinate 100 000 cattle (the whole regional population) would
cost USD 200K for vaccine, and at conservative estimates, USD 800K (USD
8.00/cow) for materials and time to assemble cattle for vaccination. My
guess is at least a million dollars or USD 10.00 a cow for a compulsory
regional vaccination program, and we don't know for sure which population
of cattle may be affected next year [2005] if any in the absence of
vaccination.
Is it good food animal veterinary medicine (definition: always pay a dollar
to save 2 dollars) to recommend blanket vaccination for cattle in Manitoba?
Farmers don't generally vaccinate for anthrax in Manitoba, perhaps because
we have never had an outbreak yet where population based vaccination would
have been cost effective, even if vaccine were 100 per cent protective.
I believe it is prudent to encourage risk based vaccination, that is
multi-year vaccination on high risk farms where there have been known cases
of Anthrax in the recent past. The vaccine is cheap at about USD 2.00 a
dose, efficacious and cost effective on a high risk herd basis, especially
for producers already vaccinating for BVD in the spring.

[Terry makes a number of good and valid points. If it were possible, which
it should be, to accurately predict the farms at risk of future outbreaks
because of present or past outbreaks or through having an affected
neighbor, it would be certainly possible to encourage them to annually
vaccinate their stock, both to protect themselves and the other herds in
the community. If a farmer failed to vaccinate and then suffered an animal
dying of anthrax, his or her community would see that this had put everyone
in, say, a 10 km radius at risk. And this would subject our slack farmer to
negative comments and public embarrassment. Such community manipulation and
social recruitment has a healthy and successful tradition in animal disease
control, for example the successful brucellosis control program in Denmark.
If there was a self-imposed tax by the community, say at so much a head at
sale, this could form a vaccination subsidy for the selected herds being
vaccinated. This would ensure community oversight.
This could be backed up by the community insisting that any unexpected
livestock death during the summer, inside or outside the vaccination area,
must be promptly reported because of the real risk that it may be from
anthrax. This edict invokes the successful anthrax eradication program in
Cyprus by Kyriakus Polydoru; he manipulated the system so that failure to
report automatically resulted in a 21 day jail sentence, and a reward to
any reporting neighbor, but that was Cyprus, not Manitoba. This immediate
reporting brings with it the opportunity for veterinary clinical inspection
and if anthrax is diagnosed, proper site management, carcass disposal, and
herd treatment and vaccination. And under Canadian law, such a diagnosis
carries a USD 500 federal indemnity, a significant carrot. It is very
important to check all unexpected deaths in such areas to prevent soil
recontamination and hopefully head off any future epidemics.
Properly orchestrated, this would result in successful control, and in due
course, eradication. In spite of those who claim that this disease is a
constant threat, it can be eradicated. It just takes a bit longer.
