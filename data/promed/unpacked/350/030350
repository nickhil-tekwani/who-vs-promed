Fatal case of human rabies (Duvenhage virus) from a bat in Kenya
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 19 Nov 2007, a 34-year-old woman was admitted to the Academic
Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands with
dysarthria, hypesthesia of both cheeks and unsteady gait, all of
which started the day before. She had also experienced dizziness,
nausea and general malaise since 16 Nov 2007.
On 24 Oct 2007, at the start of a 2-week holiday trip through Kenya,
a small bat had flown against her face. While she was hitting away
the animal, it made 2 bleeding scratches on the right side of her
nose. The incident took place in a camping site between Nairobi and
Mombasa, at dusk, while she was brushing her teeth. The wound was
washed with soap and cleaned with an alcohol solution. The warden of
the campsite and medical personnel of the neighbouring health centre
were not aware of the existence of rabies in bats in the area and no
further action was recommended. The woman and her husband then
continued the holiday trip.
Treatment
-------------
On admission, passive and active post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for
rabies was initiated. The patient's neurological clinical picture
deteriorated quickly. As rabies was very likely, on day 7 of
admission, the "Wisconsin rabies treatment protocol" was initiated,
an experimental treatment protocol that has resulted in the survival
of the only patient who recovered from rabies infection without prior
vaccination [1]. As this treatment is experimental, clinical evidence
is still lacking, and patients subsequently treated in a similar or
modified way in Thailand [2], United States [3], and Germany [4] did
not survive. The treatment was only started after consultation of the
family and with their agreement. The diagnosis of infection with
lyssavirus, genotype 4 - Duvenhage virus (DUVV) was confirmed in a
nuchal biopsy taken on the 2 day of admission. This confirmation by
cloning and sequencing of the PCR products was obtained 3 days after
the treatment had begun, when the patient was still alive. Despite
all efforts, the patient died on 8 Dec 2007, 23 days after the onset
of illness.
Preventive measures for contacts
------------------------------------------
There are no laboratory-confirmed cases documenting the transmission
of rabies from rabies-infected patients to healthcare providers or
household contacts, either by direct contact or by fomites or
environmental surfaces, possibly due to extensive prophylactic
treatment of these contacts [5,6,7]. In the case described here, the
patient had been in close contact with several family members during
the 1st days of illness. On admission, protective measures were taken
but it was regarded as prudent to advise all close family contacts (n
= 11) and attending hospital employees (n = 30) to receive passive
and active post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Five days before the
onset of illness, the patient had spent a weekend with friends, with
possible exposure to saliva. Chances of infection at that stage were
practically nil, but for various reasons it was decided to offer this
group of 6 people the vaccine series of 5 injections without HRIG
(human anti-rabies immunoglobulin). Literature shows that
approximately 50 contacts per case required PEP, and in one case the
number exceeded 200 [8].
Conclusion
--------------
Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease in humans, preventable if adequate
measures are applied shortly after a suspected infection. The main
reservoir of rabies (lyssavirus, genotype 1) are dogs and other
animals belonging to the Canidae family, but all mammalian animals in
endemic areas are capable of contracting and transmitting the disease
[9]. The Duvenhage virus is associated with insectivorous bats and
has so far been isolated from 2 human cases bitten by bats in South
Africa
(in 1970 and 2006), and 2 insectivorous bats in South Africa (1981)
and Zimbabwe (1986) [10]. To date, no cases of rabies infection from
a bat have been described in Kenya. This fatal incident shows that in
a rabies endemic area PEP has to be applied in case of every, however
minor, bite or scratch exposure to a mammalian animal, including bats
[10].
A clinical case report and a report on the virological, immunological
and histopathological results will be presented as soon as ongoing
investigations are finished.

[_Duvenhage virus_ is classified in the "8th Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses" as one of 7 virus
species in the genus _Lyssavirus_ of the _Rhabdoviridae_ family of
negative-stranded RNA viruses. Rabies virus is the type species of
the genus _Lyssavirus_. Chiroptera (bats) are known to be vectors for
6 of the 7 species of _Lyssavirus_, and bats are the exclusive
vectors for 5 of these 6 species. Rabies virus is perhaps exceptional
in that it has in addition many terrestrial vectors, principally
carnivores.
Duvenhage virus was discovered initially in 1970 in South Africa when
a man developed fatal rabies-like disease after being bitten indoors
at night by an unidentified insectivorous bat. A 2nd human case was
reported in February 2006 as a result of another encounter with a
bat some 60 km from the previous case [see ProMED- mail post:
Duvenhage virus, bat, human - South Africa (NW) 20060419.1153].
Subsequently Duvengage virus was isolated from insectivorous bats in
southern Atica, but only infrequently. The case described in the
present reort extends the known range of Duvenhage virus and suggests
that the virus may be prevalent in bats throughout Africa. - Mod.CP]
