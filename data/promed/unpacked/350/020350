[Unfortunately, we do not have a report of the previous outbreak on this farm on 1 Nov 2016, nor the earlier outbreak in 2013. If the French authorities had archived the cultures from these previous cases, it would be possible to genomically compare them and see whether they provide evidence for an on-farm repetition of risk.

Fodder contamination is usually associated with wet weather during harvesting. For a dozen animals to be affected over 48 hours suggests a high level of fodder contamination. Glad to see that an immediate prophylactic treatment with antibiotics stopped the outbreak fast. We look forward to reading the results of the ongoing investigation. - Mod.MHJ
