A Santa Fe County woman was in critical condition on Friday [8 May 2009] at
an Albuquerque hospital with this year's 1st case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, the New Mexico Department of Health announced. State health
officials are conducting an environmental investigation to look for places
where the woman may have been exposed to the virus. The 25 year old woman
was being treated at University of New Mexico Hospital.

State public health veterinarian Dr Paul Ettestad said most people are
exposed to hantaviruses in or around their homes, especially when cleaning
out enclosed areas that have mouse droppings. "The best defense against a
hantavirus [infection] is to avoid disturbing areas of rodent infestation,
including nests and droppings" he said. "As warmer weather occurs, people
need to air out their cabins and sheds before entering them for the 1st time."

Hantaviruses, often a cause of a deadly disease, are transmitted through
the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. People contract the
disease [virus] by breathing in the dried particles infected with
[containing] virus. Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly
with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
cough. Symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after exposure. There is no
specific treatment for a hantavirus [infection], but health officials say
the chances for recovery are better with early medical attention.

In 2008, New Mexico had 2 cases of hantavirus [infection], both fatal. A 22
year old Otero County woman died in December and a Taos man died in March.

[A large group of hantaviruses in the western hemisphere can cause
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Although this report does not indicate which
hantavirus is involved, most likely it is Sin Nombre virus, and its rodent
host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mouse, see
