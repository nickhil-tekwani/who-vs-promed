Altogether, 13 persons have died, and 22 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam's Jorhat district during the last 10 days, Joint Director of Health and Family Welfare Dr Mobibur Rahman said here today [21 Jul 2015]. While 7 persons died in Jorhat Medical College and Hospital (JMCH), 6 others passed away at Jorhat Christian Medical Centre (JCMC), Rahman said.

Among those who have tested positive, 18 are admitted in JMCH, 2 at JCMC, while 2 others are undergoing treatment at 2 private nursing homes here, officials said.

Of these 22, 4 were minors, and 5 were women, and all are residents from the district's rural areas.

The Joint Director said they have so far distributed 33 000 [insectice-treated] mosquito nets in the affected areas and in JE-prone areas and organised 205 health awareness camps.

The situation was being closely monitored and blood samples collected to ascertain whether there were more cases of JE in the district.

Spraying of DDT and fogging have been initiated in over 45 villages in and around the Jorhat district.

[This is the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season in northeastern India. The above report indicates that the 22 cases cited above are laboratory confirmed as JEV infections. The numbers of reported JE cases in Assam have been increasing over several years. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of annual cases rose from 154 to 744, with deaths rising from 41-160, according to data from the Assam health department. The disease, which in 2009 was recorded in only half of the state's districts, now is seen in all of them. Doctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appeared largely from May to July but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150128.3126931).

It is curious that no mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination campaign, nor is there mention of campaigns in previous years. No mention is made of the JE virus vaccination status of the cases above or of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
