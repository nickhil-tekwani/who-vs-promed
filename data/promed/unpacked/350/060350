An outbreak of dengue has killed at least 5 people and infected 40 others
in Pakistan's largest city, as the government battles to prevent it from
taking on epidemic proportions.
"5 patients suspected of having contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) are dead, including a lady doctor, while 40 others are infected and
are under observation in hospitals," a spokesman of the health ministry said.
The spokesperson said that hospitals in this southern Pakistan port city
had been put on alert and all patients coming to hospitals were being
"carefully tested" for CCHF.
The vector of the dangerous dengue fever is the _Aedes aegyptii_ mosquito
that usually bites during the day.
Earlier, at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, a
Somalian national was suspected of having the disease and was being kept
under observation until he left for his country on 13 Oct 2005.
The spokesperson said that the government had sent blood samples of 5
patients from Congo to laboratories in South Africa for tests. "We are
awaiting test results of these samples sent to the National Institute of
Virology, South Africa on Sunday [26 Nov 2005]. The report is likely to
arrive in a week's time," said the spokesman.
Health Minister Nisar Khan held meetings with health authorities in Karachi
on how to deal with the situation, with experts warning of a possible epidemic.
According to the health minister, the situation was under control, though
the Sindh health department has been asked to screen livestock to check the
"epidemic." The provincial administration has also been requested to spray
chemicals to destroy all kinds of vector-born diseases.
Khan, in a statement, appealed to the people not to panic at the disease,
as the early warning system was fully operational at the National Institute
of Health in Islamabad, which, in close liaison with the provincial health
department, is monitoring the entire situation.
The minister also gave assurances that there were enough stocks in the
country of oral anti-virals like Ribavirin, which is administered in such
cases, and that supplies of Ribavirin injections were being imported on an
urgent basis.
The staff of the provincial malaria control program has been directed to
immediately carry out spraying in the city to kill mosquitoes.
The National Institute of Health in collaboration with the World Health
Organization is preparing a long-term plan to control similar outbreaks in
future.

Jakarta's City-run hospitals Pasar Rebo and Budi Asih, both in East
Jakarta, have added more beds along their corridors, after dozens of new
dengue patients were admitted to the hospitals on Thursday [24 Nov 2005].
At Pasar Rebo hospital, 21 of 72 dengue patients were treated on additional
beds along the corridors, while in Budi Asih, 22 of 55 patients were
treated along its corridors.
Pasar Rebo hospital spokesman Dedi Suryadi said that they would still
accept new dengue patients as long as they were willing to be put along the
corridors.
"If they don't want to be transferred to other hospitals and are willing to
be put along the corridors, we will treat them professionally," he said.
Despite the increasing number of people treated for dengue, the city
administration has refused to declare the dengue outbreak as an
extraordinary occurrence, which would require the city administration to
pool its resources to fight the outbreak.

[4] Philippines (Pangasinan)

<http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pan/2005/11/24/news/2.strains.of.dengue.discovered.in.pangasinan.html>

A government doctor has confirmed that there are 2 strains of dengue found
in Pangasinan patients, based on the blood cultures analyzed so far.
Dr. Jesus Canto, chief of the Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC), said the
strains were a [non-virulent] type found mostly among patients from western
Pangasinan and the virulent type that appeared to afflict those from
western Pangasinan.
Canto said the [virulent] type of dengue was what attacked 2 patients who
died, one of them from western Pangasinan. These, he said, were the 1st
casualties from dengue.
He added that the boy died a few minutes after arrival, because when he was
admitted at R1MC, his platelet count had dropped to as low as 2 to 4, as he
already had continuous bleeding. The normal platelet count of a person is
from 150 to 300, he said. Dengue patients need fresh platelets to replace
those destroyed by the virus that cause the disease.
Canto said that from 1-27 Aug 2005, a total of 65 dengue patients had
already been admitted to R1MC, compared to 60 patients admitted for the
whole month of July 2005. Dengue cases are expected to rise some more over
those in September 2005, because the rainy season is not yet over.
The R1MC is the usual destination of dengue patients in Pangasinan because
it is the only hospital in the Ilocos Region that has a blood separator
machine, thus assuring them of a ready supply of blood platelets.
Acquired by R1MC 2 years ago, the blood separator machine separates all
ingredients of the blood, like the Packed RBC, frozen plasma and platelet
concentrates.
In the past, Canto said the hospital placed the blood on standby for many
hours till the serum separated.
With the blood separator, platelet concentrates are now available any time
the patient needs them. If not for this machine, the hospital would still
be buying its supply of blood platelets from Manila for use by its dengue
patients, he said.

Fresh dengue cases have been detected in English Bazaar
-----------------------------------------------
A group of doctors today [24 Nov 2005] claimed that 2 women have contracted
the [dengue] disease. According to them, the condition of the 2 women is
serious, and they are being kept under the observation of specialist doctors.
Interestingly, the 2 cases have been detected in the heart of English
Bazaar town, Government Colony and its adjoining location, Rabindra Avenue.
"Dengue has not left yet. [A female] resident of Government Colony is under
the treatment of Dr. Tapan Haldar and others at her residence. She is in a
serious condition," said Swami Divyananda, secretary of the Malda
Ramakrishna Mission.
After visiting the patient and the area, he told this correspondent: "The
area is reeling under a mosquito menace. I have seen big mosquitoes which
sting humans every second."
[The husband of a woman patient], a resident of Rabindra Avenue, said:
"Thank god for saving the life of my wife. I had to admit my wife to a
nursing home in Kolkata and [they] had been able to increase the plasma
count, which had gone down to 16 000, as shown in the blood property
(platelet) test. The woman is now out of danger," he added. He also said:
"The district hospital needs to get such a machine for the patients so that
the doctors here can increase plasma for saving the lives of dengue patients."
Mr. PR Das Munshi, Union minister for parliamentary affairs and information
and broadcasting, was approached for funds to set up such a machine in the
Malda district hospital for better treatment of patients.
The Malda chief medical officer of health, Dr. GC Sarkar, has instructed
health officials to visit the 2 spots and submit a report about the vector
control situation there.
"Vector control is a continual process. As far as I know, the vector
control program is going on in many wards in English Bazaar," said Dr. Sarkar.
He also claimed that indoor and outdoor spraying of mosquito repellents is
going on in impoverished areas like Buraburitala and Kulipara. Besides, DDT
is being sprayed in the block areas of this district and has been for the
past 15 days, he said.
