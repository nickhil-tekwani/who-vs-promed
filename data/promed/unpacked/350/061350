The head of the Zabadani Health District, Dr Muhammad Al-Aloul, revealed the emergence of -- laboratory proven -- diphtheria infections in the city. He pointed to rapid measures implemented including vaccination of all residents of the region with the diphtheria vaccine, regardless of age or previous vaccination status. The measure started today [Mon 20 Jun 2022], through mobile teams from the Health Directorate. Dr Muhammad Al-Aloul highlighted that the vaccine is mandatory, and is the only solution to prevent the spread of the disease and stimulate the immune system.

Dr Al-Aloul considered that the infections occurred as a result of the accumulations, environmental conditions, and the spread of bacteria and aerobic germs in the region during wartime. This led to the emergence of these cases -- 3 confirmed, and 4 suspected.

Diphtheria is an emerging respiratory disease caused by bacteria, which causes acute pharyngitis, and the formation of a grayish-colored membrane around the tonsil area, with a rise in temperature. Through coughing, sneezing, and mouth and nose spray, it is highly contagious.

Dr Al-Aloul indicated that for 30 years, no case has appeared in Syria, thanks to vaccination, and commitment to the national vaccination program established by the Ministry of Health for this regard. The vaccine is the only way to prevent the disease and gives immunity to the body against it. The vaccine used is a bivalent vaccine that consists of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. Children are vaccinated with the diphtheria vaccine (which is registered on their vaccination card by 4 doses) acquiring immunity against the disease.

Dr Al-Aloul pointed out that there are contraindications to giving the vaccine to people who take immunosuppressants, who take cortisone in high doses and continuously for more than 15 days, and for people who have a temperature increase of more than 39 C [about 102 F]. On the other hand, chronic diseases such as blood pressure, asthma, allergies, and diabetes do not prevent the administration of the vaccine. The campaign will start in Zabadani, and will include the entire region and its surroundings.

[Al-Zabadani (population 26 285 residents in 2004) is a city in south western Syria in the Rif Dimashq Governorate, close to the border with Lebanon, located in a mountain valley in the Syrian mountain range near the road between Damascus and Beirut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zabadani). A map showing the location of Zabadani can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Al+Zabadani+الزبداني%E2%80%AD.

Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, or _C. pseudotuberculosis_, aerobic Gram positive bacilli that can cause respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacilli are infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin.

The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (for example, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure), and neuritis (for example, paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). Non-toxin-producing strains may cause mild to moderate pharyngitis. Although either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains can cause cutaneous diphtheria, toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations are uncommon in cutaneous diphtheria, even when caused by toxigenic strains. Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for the acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_. _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ cause zoonotic infection in humans (http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp) and contact with a companion animal is also a risk factor for acquisition of _C. ulcerans_.

Diphtheria can be prevented by a diphtheria toxoid vaccine, which is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength doses combined with a full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full-strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult formulations (Tdap). In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm.

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html. - Mod.ML
