Citrus canker worries growers and may lead to exclusion from exports
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Producers from the region of Salta (Argentina)
declared their concern to phytosanitary
authorities because of the presence of diseases
on fruits. They are particularly worried about
the so-called "cancrosis," a highly contagious
disease caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_
pathovar _citri_ bacteria. This disease is
affecting the production of grapefruits destined
for European markets. On the other side, the
Russian market could be an opportunity as there
is no possibility of contamination in Russia due
to the absence of citrus orchards. The disease
thrives under wet conditions and this growing
season was particularly humid.
The vice-president of the Servicio Nacional de
Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASA),
Carlos Casamiquela, and other SENASA
representatives regarded this situation as a
possibility to interact with producers and to get
to know in situ the problems of the region. A
meeting was organized by the secretary of
production at the province of Salta, Flavio
Aguilera.
Citrus fruits in Salta are grown in the
department of Orï¿½y Anta. The company "La
Moraleja" produces the regional crop on about 12
000 hectares [29 652.5 acres] of which 5 600 ha
[13 837.85 acres] are grapefruit and the
remaining area lemons, oranges and clementines.
The main export destinations are Russia and some
countries of the European Union (EU). However, in
case of over-supply, the remaining production is
sold in the domestic market.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_
(previously _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_).
Symptoms of small, round blister-like formations
(cankers) appear on fruit, leaves and branches
followed by defoliation and premature fruit drop.
CC affects commercial citrus varieties which show
variable susceptibility, and also other members
of the family _Rutaceae_. CC can be transmitted
by mechanical means, water or insects within
groves while long-distance spread is mostly by
infected plant material. The disease occurs
worldwide posing a serious economic threat to
citrus industries.
CC became a major problem in parts of Argentina
in 1974-75. Eradication efforts were made, but by
1978 the disease was so widespread that they were
abandoned. Instead, control methods were employed
including bactericidal sprays, planting of
windbreaks and use of less susceptible varieties.
In 1998, surveys conducted by SENASA led to the
conclusion that the northwestern Argentine states
of Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman were
still free of CC (reported in post no.
19980819.1656). The news story above suggests
that it has spread since then and is now present
at least in Salta.
