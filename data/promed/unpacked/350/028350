Nearly 2000 people in the Seychelles have been infected with an
incurable mosquito-borne disease that has spread to 3 Indian Ocean
islands prompting health alerts, officials said.
Jules Gedeon, the Seychelles director for community health, said the
number of people diagnosed with "chikungunya" was steadily rising
since it was first reported in November 2005 and nearly 1000 cases
had been reported in January 2006 alone.
"We are still counting, but the number is quickly approaching 1000
for this week," Gedeon told AFP, adding the country's security forces
had been drafted for a nationwide mosquito eradication drive to stall
the spread.
In addition, the health ministry announced Thursday [2 Feb] it would
take legal action against people who do not take measures to control
mosquito breeding on their property.
Authorities in Madagascar and the overseas French territory of
Reunion, where some 45 000 new cases have been reported since
mid-December 2005, have reported outbreaks.
Last week, the French government drafted 400 extra troops to help
fight the mosquitoes that have been spreading the disease across
Reunion since March [2005].
On Madagascar, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) west of Reunion, a
health official said Thursday that 2 more people had shown symptoms
of the disease after dozens flocked to a hospital on the eastern side
of the island with similar complaints in the past 2 weeks.
"2 patients admitted today at Toamasina hospital they had joint pains
that strongly point to chikungunya," Mosa Milasoa, an official in
Madagascar's health ministry, told AFP.
"Chikungunya" is Swahili for "that which bends up" and refers to the
stooped posture of those afflicted by the crippling and extremely
painful disease for which there is no known vaccine or cure.
It is characterized by high fever and severe rashes, and while
non-fatal in itself and most people eventually recover, it can
provide opportunities for other diseases to set in.
Health officials in the Seychelles attributed the recent sharp rise
in cases of chikungunya to heavy rains that have been pounding the
island since December 2005.
No deaths have so far been reported, but it has affected several
businesses as infected people have stayed home from work and the
transport sector has been badly hit with bus schedules interrupted as
drivers fall sick, they said.

Seychelles said on Thursday it had mobilized its army to control an
incurable crippling mosquito-borne disease that has affected
thousands of people on the idyllic Indian ocean archipelago.
Over the last 4 weeks, 2000 of the island's 80 000 people have been
afflicted with chikungunya fever, named after a Swahili word meaning
"which bends up" and referring to the stooped posture of those afflicted.
The disease, first recognized in epidemic form in East Africa in
1952, is marked by high fever and severe rashes, and while health
officials say most people eventually recover, it is extremely painful
and there is no known cure or vaccine.
It also leaves immune systems weak, providing opportunities for other
diseases to set in.
"Cases of the disease have been doubling every week, with 200 having
been reported during the 1st week of January, 300 during the 2nd, and
513 in the 3rd week," Dr Jude Gedeon, director for community health,
told Reuters. "We are still counting but the number is quickly
approaching 1000 for this week."
Gedeon blamed the rise in the number of cases on heavier than normal
rainfall over the last 3 months and said a task force has been set up
to help control the spread of the epidemic which can transfer from
person to person [via the insect vector - CopyEd.PG].
The Seychelles military has been called in to provide personnel and
transport and help authorities clear areas prone to mosquito-breeding
such as stagnant pools of water and to spray areas where cases of the
viral infection have been found.
Gedeon said that as people continue to be affected, work output
suffers as thousands people go on sick leave.
The epidemic has affected other islands in the Indian Ocean region,
which relies heavily on tourism for foreign revenue.
France's Reunion island has reported 50 000 cases so far and last
week earmarked $720 000 to fight the outbreak, drafting 400 extra
troops to help fight the mosquitoes that have spread the disease
across the volcanic island for nearly a year.
Neighboring Mauritius has also reported 15 cases since the beginning
of January 2006 and authorities are screening people at the airport
and port, spraying places near hotels and guest houses and warning
the public to take precautions.
Authorities say people should remove stagnant water, use mosquito
repellents and bed nets, and spray bedrooms at night.

The Department of Health will now take legal action against people
who do not take measures to control mosquito breeding within the
premises in which they live. Similar action will be taken against
proprietors of buildings which house a number of families or
businesses. This measure comes in the wake of confirmation that
samples taken overseas for analysis have proved positive for
Chikungunya, and the news that the disease has affected 847 people in
Seychelles so far.
The disease, which is believed to have been brought in by a foreigner
who stayed at Anse aux Pins where victims among Seychellois were
first reported, has now spread throughout Mahe, and also reached
Praslin and La Digue where cases are being reported.
Medical entomologist Simon Julienne announced the intention of the
department to take legal action Tuesday 24 Jan 2005 during a press
conference that was also addressed by the director general for
community health, Dr Jude Gedeon, and the director for environmental
health, Danny Poiret. Dr Gedeon said that the debilitating though
non-fatal viral disease is still in epidemic proportions in Reunion,
where over 7000 cases have been reported [more than 10 000 cumulative
cases to date, see also ProMED archive number <20060121.0202>], as
well as in other Indian Ocean island nations, including Mauritius,
Comoros and Madagascar. Mr Julienne said culprits will be those whose
septic tanks are leaking, residents who allow tall grass or bushes
within their compounds and those who [in]discriminately dispose of
waste, particularly that which has receptacles which can hold water.
The doctor and health officers said that the eastern part of Mahe is
most affected, and that more women than men have fallen victim to
Chikungunya. They attributed the gender bias to the possibility that
women spend more time indoors than men. They said the villain _Culex_
mosquito bites indoors and usually in the evening.
They advised people to use insect repellents and to spray their
houses with knockdown insecticides in the evening, allowing the
aerosols at least 10 minutes to act on the vectors. "There may be no
ready-made nets but the materials to make some are available locally
and people may consider making and using them," Mr Julienne said.
Dr Gedeon reassured the public that infection results in long-lasting
immunity, but expressed regret that affected people suffer headaches
and joint pains which makes it hard for them to work, which in the
end is affecting the country total work output.
He said that the disease, being viral, has no cure but is
self-limiting, and that doctors are currently giving medicine to
relieve the pain and effects of the joint inflammation.
The team said that widespread spraying would have negative effects on
the environment and might cause reactions in people who are sensitive
to pesticides, while the mosquitoes could develop resistance or
immunity to chemicals that would be used.

[Thanks to Dr. Mohammad Igbal Issack for providing the report on
chikungunya outbreak in Seychelles from a local source. Chikungunya
is caused by chikungunya virus, pertaining to genus _Alphavirus_,
family _Togaviridae_; with spherical, enveloped virion 60 nm in
diameter, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. Chikungunya is
transmitted by virus-infected mosquitoes.
Chikungunya is currently rampant in the neighboring island countries,
such as Reunion Island (see also prior ProMED postings below).

history of Seychelles, an independent republic within the British
