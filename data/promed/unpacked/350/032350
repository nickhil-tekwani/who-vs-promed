Four more persons succumbed to chikungunya viral fever in Alappuzha and
Kottayam districts, taking the toll to 50.
Health Department machinery have been pressed into service to tackle the
situation as cases were also reported from Ernakulam and Thrissur
districts, official sources said.
Reports also said the disease had spread to more areas in Alappuzha like
Mavelikkara and Kayamkulam. Another report from Thrissur said 8 persons
were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the viral fever.
State Health Minister, P K Sreemathi, visited Cherthala taluk where
hospitals were swarmed with people suffering from the disease. As many as
950 patients on Saturday [30 Sep 2006] approached the hospitals in the taluk.
After assessing the situation in Cherthala, he said government hospitals
had been directed to ensure that proper treatment facilities and supply of
medicines were maintained.
"Paucity of funds would not come in the way of providing treatment to
patients, he said, adding that all medicines would be provided by the
hospital authorities.
Medical authorities in all districts have also stepped up awareness
campaign against the disease.

Historically, chikungunya has been recognized as a viral disease of high
morbidity but very low to nil mortality. Reports of chikungunya deaths
continue to come out of India. It would be helpful to know the basis on
which chikungunya virus infection has been definitively identified as the
cause of death (COD). Although the case fatality rate attributable to
chikungunya infections has been relatively low in India, if the COD proves
to be chikungunya in the above and previous reports, this virus will have
to be considered a cause of significant mortality during massive
epidemics. Additional information concerning the COD in these reported
chikungunya cases would be appreciated.
