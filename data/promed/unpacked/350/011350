Officials Investigate Outbreak Of Diarrhea, Vomiting
--------------------------------------------
The Turks and Caicos Islands Health Surveillance team is investigating a recent outbreak of diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting on Providenciales among more than 100 people who stayed in or dined at local resorts over the last several weeks.

On 26 May 2012, the Ministry of Health and Education (MOHE) and Environmental Health Department (EHD) confirmed that tests results for one individual confirmed the presence of norovirus [infection], a highly contagious viral illness which is common in outbreaks of gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting) throughout the world. It can be transmitted from person to person, through contact with vomitus or feces of infected individuals, consumption of contaminated food or water, contact with soiled surfaces and bed linens etc. Other than supportive therapy, norovirus [infection] usually requires little by way of medical interventions and usually resolves without incident.

"The MOHE and EHD would like to emphasize that at this time norovirus [infection] cannot be confirmed as the cause of the current outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting based on this single positive result," the statement said. "Investigations of the Public Health Team are ongoing, in collaboration with the Caribbean Epidemiology Center and Pan American Health Organization, the global experts in outbreak investigation."

One foursome staying on Providenciales in a private villa told the fp that they were stricken with the illness -- which hospital officials told them was some kind of virus -- after eating at a restaurant in a hotel on Grace Bay. One woman became so ill she had to be hospitalized and receive intravenous fluids to overcome the symptoms. Grace Bay Club announced 24 may 2012 that it has stopped accepting reservations until 1 Jun 2012 to sanitize the resort. "Currently, Grace Bay Club is providing hand sanitizers throughout the resort to all guests and staff, and all public spaces, kitchens, restaurants, plumbing systems and guest rooms are being thoroughly sanitized with bleach according to the safety standards of the Department of Environmental Health," the resort said. "Additionally, Grace Bay Club is providing medical assistance to affected guests, alerting current and future guests of the situation and offering them the option to adjust existing reservations without penalty. Once all guests depart the resort, a more extensive, full-property sanitization will take place."

Sources tell the fptci agency that Grace Bay Club was not the only resort where guests had the symptoms and that more than 100 people have been treated since April [2012]. The government health team would not say how many have been affected pending the outcome of its investigation. "We have deployed our public health teams to assess, to identify and report on the situation utilizing CAREC and PAHO/World Health Organization guidelines," the Ministry of Health and Education said in a statement May 22. "Our top priority is to protect the public as well as the tourism industry from any further illness by containing this outbreak."

The team asks that anyone who experiences the symptoms to report to any health care facility for evaluation and treatment. Those people may be interviewed in confidence to help pinpoint the source of the outbreak. The ministry encourages the public to practice healthy hygiene such as frequent hand washing, especially when preparing meals, before eating and after using the toilet.

[The single positive diagnostic test result and the description of the illnesses (presumed to be predominantly sudden onset and rapid resolution in most cases) are consistent with an outbreak of norovirus infection. However the report does not exclude possibility of transmission of another food-borne agent from a common source. Further information is awaited.

The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British Overseas Territory consisting of 2 groups of tropical islands in the West Indies, the larger Caicos Islands and the smaller Turks Islands, known for tourism and as an offshore financial centre. The total population is about 45 000, of whom approximately 22 500 live on Providenciales in the Caicos Islands.
