Vigilance against viral hepatitis E infection urged
---------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today (Mon 14 Apr 2008) urged members of the public to be on the
alert against viral hepatitis E infection and to strictly observe
good personal, food, and environmental hygiene. The appeal was made
in view of the higher incidence of viral hepatitis E infection
recently.

The Consultant, Community Medicine, of CHP, Dr S K Chuang, said a
total of 45 cases had been reported to CHP so far this year [2008],
while the figure for the same period in 2007 was 25. The figures for
the whole year of 2005, 2006, and 2007 were 33, 34, and 64
respectively.

The cases were distributed throughout Hong Kong and involved patients
aged between 16 and 84. So far, the food histories provided by the
patients have not shown a single common source outbreak related to
any particular food premises, Dr Chuang said.

Dr Chuang said hepatitis E was acquired by ingestion of contaminated
food or water and therefore it is preventable by observing good
personal and food hygiene. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 64
days before onset of symptoms. Hepatitis E is usually more active
during the winter and spring seasons.

"Clinical features of acute hepatitis E resemble those of other types
of viral hepatitis, including anorexia, malaise, fever, and vomiting,
followed by jaundice, passing tea-coloured urine, and hepatomegaly.
Most of the patients recover in 3 to 6 weeks. However, pregnant
patients carry a higher risk of severe disease from the infection,"
Dr Chuang said.

To prevent hepatitis E infection, the public is advised to take the
following precautions:
- most important, cook food thoroughly before consumption;
- avoid raw food or semi-cooked food;
- purchase fresh food from reliable sources and do not patronise
illegal hawkers;
- handle and store raw and cooked food, especially seafood,
separately (upper compartment of the refrigerator for cooked food and
lower compartment for raw food) to avoid cross contamination;
- store perishable food in the refrigerator, well covered, and keep
the temperature of the refrigerator at or below 4 deg C (39 deg F);
- wash hands properly with soap and water before eating or handling
food, and after going to the toilet.

[A recent paper in the April 2008 issue of the Journal of Medical
Virology (2008; 80(4): 646-58) should be consulted for an up-to-date
account of hepatitis E disease.

From the Abstract: "Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the sole member of the
genus _Hepevirus_ in the family _Hepeviridae_, has been the major
cause of several outbreaks of waterborne hepatitis in tropical and
subtropical countries and of sporadic cases of viral hepatitis in
endemic and industrialized countries. Transmission of HEV occurs
predominantly by the fecal-oral route although parenteral and
perinatal routes have been implicated. The overall death rate among
young adults and pregnant women is 0.5-3 per cent and 15-20 per cent,
respectively.

There are 4 major genotypes of HEV and a single serotype. At present,
there are approximately 1600 sequences of HEV that are already
available at INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration) of both human and animal isolates. Diagnostic and
molecular assays have been described for the accurate differentiation
of ongoing from remote infection of HEV.

Identification and characterization of swine HEV in China, Japan, the
United States, and many other countries and their close relationship
to locally characterized human HEV found in the same geographic areas
prove that HEV is indeed a zoonotic virus and that domestic swine,
wild deer, and boars are reservoirs of HEV in nature. A cell culture
system for the propagation of the virus has been described, and a
very successful phase 2 vaccine trial has been completed." - Mod.CP]
