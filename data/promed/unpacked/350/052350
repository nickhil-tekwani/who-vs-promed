[It was reported in ProMED post Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Asia (13): Pakistan (SD) Karachi 20190808.6612746 that a 29-year-old patient with the same name was brought to the JPMC Emergency Department, the same hospital as this patient, with high-grade fever and bleeding from the gums. The name of the patient and the hospital are the same, but the age differs, as does the number of infected patients. This was the 9th patient of CCHF who had been brought to the JPMC, but the report above says 8th. It is stated in the previous report on the admission of this patient that "2 [other patients] died during treatment; one took Leave Against Medical Advice (LAMA), while 5 of the patients had recovered, and they were discharged from the hospital."

According to the WHO, CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of their epidemic potential, high case fatality ratio (10-40%), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. - Mod.LK
