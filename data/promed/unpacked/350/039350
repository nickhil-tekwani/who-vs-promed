To keep the record straight.....NCSU (North Carolina State University), not
UNC (University of North Carolina), made the diagnosis. The CDC (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention) was contacted after a NCSU small animal
medicine resident, a clinical pathologist, and 2 senior students made the
initial diagnosis in one of the hounds sent from New York.

As a veterinarian and Public Health Officer in the U.S. Air Force, I am
curious to know if data exists to support the following statement:
"The disease occurs in humans and is common in domestic and wild dogs in
the Middle East, Italy and Spain. Some speculate U.S. servicemen may have
brought the disease home in their pets."
Military working dogs and pets owned by service men and women are examined
by Army veterinarians and are subject to the same regulations as all other
dogs requiring health certificates.
Also, as graduate of the North Carolina State University, College of
Veterinary Medicine, I ask that we not be confused with the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "It would be nice to hear from either the
consulting veterinarian or those who made the diagnosis at UNC."

My husband is a returning Gulf War Veteran and has received "service
-connection" to Leishmaniasis: viscerotropic Leishmaniasis and one of the
leading authorities is Katherine Murray Leisure in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.
She has treated over 600 veterans and civilians. She works out of Good
Samaritan Hospital. This is not only being transmitted by dogs,... the
Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Administration have
recognized for sometime sand flies most likely are not the only vectors
and any vertebrate is a potential reservoir. There is even a select
steering committee on the status of _Leishmania tropica_. Look to the WHO
(World Health Organization) for statistics on co-infection with HIV (Human
Immunodeficiency Virus). ProMED-mail even carried information about and
outbreak in Central America this past year.

An ELISA, using K39 as the diagnostic antigen, is available for the
diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis.
