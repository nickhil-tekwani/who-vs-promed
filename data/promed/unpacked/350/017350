Florida -- Derby Lane, the world's oldest continuously operating dog
track, was closed Friday after six greyhounds have died from a mystery
illness and other dogs were ill with a pneumonia-like illness. More
than 100 other dogs, mostly 2- and 3-year-olds, are suffering from
this highly contagious cough. The dogs are coughing up blood and the
pathologist involved is uncertain as to the cause, labeling it a
mystery.
Dr. William Castleman, the University of Florida pathologist who
performed an autopsy on one of the dogs, Gaffer, from the St.
Petersburg race track. "Is it something new?'' Castleman asked. "Is
it a common infection that's just taken a new turn? We don't know.
But the fact [that] this dog became very ill and started bleeding and
died has us thinking there has to be something else going on here.''
Castleman said it will probably take two weeks before scientists can
isolate the pneumonia-like virus.
Trainers reported that dogs suffering the mystery illness were
bleeding through the nose and the mouth, discharging bloody stools.
Some had blood vessels in their skin burst. "Whatever type of
infection this is, it breaks down the clotting mechanisms in the dog.''
The track imposed a quarantine on its greyhounds and set up an
around-the-clock infirmary to combat the illness, which officials say
poses no threat to humans. A necropsy confirmed that one of the dogs
died of a viral respiratory disease and had internal bleeding, said
Sarah Casey, spokeswoman for the University of Florida College of
Veterinary Medicine. [With veterinarians involved, it may not be
_Bordetella_ spp, the common "kennel cough" - Mod.TG]
The dogs at Hollywood Greyhound Track [Florida] have been put under
quarantine after several greyhounds came down with a virus different
than the one in St. Petersburg, Garry Duell, assistant racing
secretary at the track, said Sunday. "It's not the same virus," he
insisted. "It's the normal kennel cough that they get this time of
year.'' Several dogs were scratched from the race card Saturday but
none were taken off Sunday, Duell said.
Dog tracks in Daytona Beach, Jacksonville, Miami, Naples and Orlando
also have quarantined their dogs as a precaution. Races will probably
be scratched at Derby Lane at least through Wednesday, track general
manager Vey Weaver said. Derby Lane is one of the largest taxpaying
pari-mutuels in the state. About 1100 dogs were scheduled to race
there this year. Because of the virus scare, Greyhound Protection
League, a San Francisco-based anti-racing group, has urged owners to
impose a nationwide quarantine at the greyhound tracks.
