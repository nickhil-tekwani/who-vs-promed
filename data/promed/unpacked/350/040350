Army lab cited 8 years ago for failing to properly kill anthrax samples
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Army bioterror defense research facility that has mistakenly sent live anthrax to dozens of labs in the U.S. and abroad faced potential sanctions in 2007 for failing to properly kill specimens of the deadly bacteria -- and ignoring test results that indicated their kill process wasn't effective, USA TODAY has learned.

The lab safety violations identified 8 years ago at the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah were so serious that federal regulators referred the facility for further investigation and possible enforcement action, federal lab regulators said in response to questions from USA TODAY. But no fine was ever issued and records show the incident was never disclosed in the annual reports sent to Congress by the program that oversees labs working with potential bioterror pathogens.

Officials with the Department of Defense and Dugway Proving Ground were not immediately available for comment. USA TODAY has been asking both entities questions about Dugway's inspection history since Wednesday [10 Jun 2015]. Lab regulators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is important to note that the 2007 violations involved a different, chemical method of inactivating anthrax and not the gamma irradiation method that is the focus of the current federal investigation.

A massive international investigation was launched last month [May 2015] after a private biotechnology company in Maryland discovered that what was supposed to be a dead sample of anthrax it received from Dugway as part of a project to develop a new diagnostic test -- was actually alive and capable of growing. The sample had a "death certificate" from Dugway saying it had been killed with radiation, and the Department of Defense now says at least 69 labs in the USA and 5 foreign countries received live anthrax samples. If inhaled, anthrax spores can be lethal even with treatment, sparking a high fever and other flu-like symptoms. So far no illnesses have been reported in association with the Dugway specimens.

The Dugway Proving Ground is a major test facility for the U.S. Army's chemical and biological defense programs. It is located on 800 000 acres about 75 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.

The new information obtained Friday [12 Jun 2015] reveals that in 2007 lab inspectors from the CDC cited Dugway for using an "experimental" chemical method of killing anthrax specimens that was ineffective and resulted in an unauthorized transfer of anthrax bacteria to another facility. The inspectors found that Dugway staff apparently ignored the results of their own kill-confirmation tests that showed growth of bacteria even after the chemical inactivation was done -- yet shipped the sample anyway, according to the agency's written response to questions from USA TODAY.

Because of the serious nature of the violations, the CDC referred Dugway to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General for potential enforcement action. In December 2009, the OIG closed the case, and while it agreed that an unauthorized transfer of anthrax had occurred, the office did not issue any fines, the CDC said. Officials at the inspector general's office were not immediately available for comment.

The CDC on Friday [12 Jun 2015] said: "It should be noted that this incident is not similar to the current investigation where Dugway was using an established irradiation protocol and no growth was observed following the gamma irradiation."

Yet there are similarities. The current anthrax situation involving Dugway shipping dozens of live anthrax samples that were supposed to be dead and, as in 2007, involves failures of the current inactivation process, as well as failures to recognize that it wasn't fully killing the bacteria and its hard-to-kill spores. The military has not answered USA TODAY's repeated questions about Dugway's protocols for killing anthrax and its procedures for conducting verification tests to ensure the process was consistently effective.

A [29 May 2015] CDC email obtained by USA TODAY indicates that the radiation process wasn't 100 percent effective. "We have concern that the inactivation procedures, when followed properly, are inadequate to kill all spores," wrote Daniel Sosin, deputy director of CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response in the email to state officials.

The CDC on Friday said the Dugway lab was currently using "a scientifically validated procedure" to inactivate anthrax bacteria, and provided a copy of a document that references a 1991 scientific paper that was the basis for Dugway's irradiation method. The select agent regulations require labs to develop biosafety plans that are adequate to address the risks posed by the specific pathogens they are authorized to possess -- but leave it up to labs to pick their own methods of achieving safety. "There is no specific regulatory requirement for inactivation verification in the select agent regulations," the CDC said, but added it has issued guidance that notes the need to verify pathogens are killed. Inspectors verified that Dugway was doing sterility testing before issuing death certificates on samples, the CDC said.

[For those interested, read the whole report, which discusses secrecy aspects, and the discretion shown in not revealing the nature of "errors."

I promise I am trying to keep these postings limited but this called to be shared. At the last count, 5 countries outside the United States are now known to have received live anthrax samples: Australia, Canada, South Korea, Britain as well as Japan. 69 labs in 19 states and Washington, D.C., also received live samples. And a live sample was sent to the U.S. military base of Camp Zama about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Tokyo in 2005 and was destroyed in 2009; see: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/us-usa-japan-anthrax-idUSKBN0OS21F20150612. - Mod.MHJ]
