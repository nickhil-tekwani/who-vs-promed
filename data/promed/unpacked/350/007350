Fiji's veterinary service has been struggling to eradicate an outbreak of the cattle disease, brucellosis. But veterinary authorities say after a major effort, they expect to have the disease fully under control within the next 12 months.

Presenter: Geraldine Coutts

Speaker: Dr Stephen Angus, Principal Veterinary Officer from the Department of Agriculture in Fiji

Angus: First of all I'll give you a brief history of brucellosis in Fiji, there was a major campaign to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis in the 80s. Fiji was declared free of brucellosis on or about 1990. But unfortunately TB was never eradicated and brucellosis re-emerged in 2009. It started with an abortion storm in an area called Tailevu, which is one of the major dairying areas not far from Suva.

Coutts: The link between TB and brucellosis? So, is it transmitted between people and cattle?

Angus: The link, they're both zoonotic diseases affecting both animals and humans and they are of public health concern. The 2 diseases are not inextricably linked except through the dairying industry.

Coutts: How contagious is it and, I guess the follow on from that, is it easily spread?

Angus: Brucellosis and tuberculosis are easily spread, they're both bacterial diseases, they're both highly infectious, and if left unchecked you can get quite high morbidities.

Coutts: Where exactly are the flashpoints, the points of most concern in Fiji at the moment?

Angus: The concerns at the moment are that brucellosis is mainly in the dairy industry, the major dairying areas in the central region of Fiji.

Coutts: Can the brucellosis itself in cattle be cured? Or if an animal gets it, does it necessarily mean it needs to be destroyed?

Angus: Unfortunately that is so, there is no effective cure; once an animal is infected it generally is infected for life and unfortunately has to be destroyed.

Coutts: And does that mean that if a cow in a herd gets it, the whole herd is contaminated?

Angus: Absolutely not. We have had major success in the last year in cleaning out a number of herds of cattle of this infection.

Coutts: The problem of not being able to contain it, how can that be explained?

Angus: Hang on a second, I think someone's been misinforming you. Containing it is exactly what we've been doing in the last 12 months. Prior to that it was in an epidemic phase and the prevalence rose to approximately 3 per cent of the dairy herd in the central region. It is currently running at well under one per cent.

Coutts: Well, why can't it be eradicated?

Angus: It certainly can be eradicated and we are putting in major efforts to do so.

Coutts: But it hasn't been because it's been evident in the country for some years now.

Angus: It's been evident since 2009. As I explained there was an abortion storm and that was the re-emergence of brucellosis after an absence of nearly 20 years in Fiji.

Coutts: So what happens from this point on?

Angus: From this point on, we put in a major effort into controlling the infected herds. As I say we're having some considerable degree of success at the moment, and we expect to have the disease fully under control within the next 12 months.

[Bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic bacterial disease, is usually caused by _Brucella abortus, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand are believed to be free from the agent.

Clinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions, or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and all infected tissues, cultures and potentially contaminated materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions. Additional background is available in OIE's terrestrial Manual, at http://tinyurl.com/cvby6ao.

According to Fiji's most recent available annual report to the OIE (2011), during that year 25 new outbreaks of bovine brucellosis (_B, abortus_) were recorded, including 250 "cases" among 6129 susceptible animals of which none were destroyed, while 63 were slaughtered. 116 bovine animals were "routine vaccinated"; 259 were "ring vaccinated".

The cattle population in 2011 was 44 388 head in 792 establishments.

Additional information on the current control policy addressing bovine brucellosis in Fiji will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
