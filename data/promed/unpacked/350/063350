Japanese encephalitis is suspected in an [disease] outbreak among pig
breeders in a town in northern Perak state, Malaysia. There have been 6
deaths, and another 15 persons infected. The Perak health and environment
committee chairman Lee Chee Leong said 20 cases of the disease had been
reported in three areas since October, including the six fatalities. Of the
20, one was a pork wholesaler and the rest were workers in pig farms.
According to a preliminary report, Lee said the victims showed similar
symptoms of high fever and headaches for five to seven days, followed by
drowsiness and coma a day or two later before their sudden deaths.
"The Institute of Medical Research is still investigating and the full
report will be made public soon," Deputy Health Minister Siti Zaharah
Sulaiman was quoted as saying.
The health ministry disease control division's deputy director, Tee Ah
Sian, said the disease, believed to be the Japanese encephalitis, is spread
by mosquitoes.
According to the ministry's data, between nine and 82 similar cases have
been reported each year since 1985, mainly in the states of Perak, Penang
and Sarawak. The fatality rate is between 0.3 and 60%. Some 142 pig farm
workers in Perak had been vaccinated since Monday, with fogging carried out
in the affected areas.
Although data shows that the virus is not transmitted by consumption of
pork, pork sellers and hawkers in the state were quoted as saying they
suffered a "noticeable drop" in business amid fears the fatalities were
linked to the meat. In predominantly Moslem Malaysia, pork is only sold in
certain sections of wet markets and sale is restricted to non-Moslems.
