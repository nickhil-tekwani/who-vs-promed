A 25-month old boy died 2 days ago here, believed to have been due to a diphtheria infection, according to Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah. He said the child was never given any immunisation since birth and had begun to develop fever, cough and swollen tonsils on 16 Feb [2019]. He said the boy was taken to a hospital emergency unit on 18 Feb [2019] in poor condition and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for respiratory assistance and given an antitoxin injection. "Unfortunately, the child could not be saved and on 21 Feb [2019], he succumbed to severe diphtheria with multiorgan failure."

He said a throat swab specimen showed the presence of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ bacteria, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) was waiting for laboratory results to determine the presence of diphtheria toxin.

Dr Noor Hisham said diphtheria is caused by a _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ bacterial infection which affects the mucous membranes of the throat causing the tonsils to swell. This might further lead to bacteremia complications (blood infections) and endocarditis (heart infection) and organ failure, which in turn could be fatal.

"MOH has taken steps to curb the spread of the infection (diphtheria) including actively conducting inspections in the residential area where the case was reported, giving an immunisation and health education briefing," he said.

Dr Noor Hisham said since January this year [2019] to date, there was only one confirmed case of diphtheria in Malaysia.

He said last year [2018], 18 cases with 5 deaths, involving children below 10 [years of age], were reported in the country and in 4 of the 5 fatalities, the victims were not given immunisation. Dr Noor Hisham advised the public to always be aware of infectious diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps and pertussis, which could be prevented with immunisation.

"Immunisation is a safe and effective way of protecting your children from infection and failure to provide immunisation will not only expose them to infections but will also be harmful to others," he said. He called on parents who have yet to vaccinate their children to come forward and to ensure that they were given immunisation according to the schedule set by the Health Ministry.

[A diphtheria vaccine coverage rate of 80-85 percent is thought to be necessary to stop transmission (http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/april/2_Review_Diphtheria_results_April2017_final_clean.pdf). In Malaysia, 99% of the population is said to be vaccinated against diphtheria (in 2015), and diphtheria incidence is low, with less than 0.1 cases per 100 000 persons since 1990. Although vaccination rates may be this high in Malaysia as a whole, rates may be much lower in some communities and sporadic diphtheria cases occur.

Malaysia reported over 100 cases per year before 1978, but less than 50 cases were reported after 1980; 0-4 cases of diphtheria have been reported between 2005 and 2015 (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WHS3_41?lang=en). However, the number of cases spiked to 31 in 2016 and to 32 in 2017 (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.WHS3_41?lang=en and
https://knoema.com/atlas/Malaysia/topics/Health/Communicable-Diseases/Diphtheria-cases). The news report says that 18 cases were reported in 2018 in Malaysia.

In Malaysia, primary diphtheria immunization is given at ages of 2, 3 and 5 months, and booster doses are administered at 18 months and seven years of age (http://www.e-mjm.org/2018/v73n5/adult-diphtheria.pdf). Because immunity conferred by diphtheria vaccination wanes over time, a booster diphtheria vaccine, in combination with anti-tetanus toxoid, is recommended every 10 years. Booster doses are recommended for cases of diphtheria after completing antimicrobial treatment and for close contacts. Close contacts should also receive antibiotics - benzathine penicillin G or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin.

Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis, and focal necrosis of liver and kidneys. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants. However, Corynebacterium diphtheriae infective endocarditis is mostly due to non-toxigenic strains (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971211000920
