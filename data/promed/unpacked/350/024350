Dear Colleagues,

On Saturday, 15 Sep 2012, ProMED-mail posted that, "A new human coronavirus was isolated from a patient with pneumonia by Dr Ali Mohamed Zaki at the Virology Laboratory of Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital Jeddah Saudi Arabia," alerting the world of a new human pathogen. Eight months later, after careful consideration and broad consultation, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses decided to call the new pathogen the "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus." To date, ProMED has published over 470 additional reports on MERS-CoV. The outbreak continues unabated. An eruption of healthcare associated cases in Korea resulted from a single importation, reminding us of its global significance.

The MERS-CoV story is a cautionary tale that touches on many of the areas the international infectious disease community has been warning the world about: the emergence of cross-species diseases, the dangers of disease transmission through rapid global travel, and the risks of nosocomial infection. It has underscored the importance of transparent communication to both public health and the advancement of science.

ProMED serves a vital role by providing a worldwide community of infectious disease practitioners with news, information, and analysis that can help them prevent infections, illness, and fatalities. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, ProMED keeps you well informed on topics you need and want to know about. We maintain an international staff of experts available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to add perspective and analysis and to provide the level and quality of information that makes ProMED a valuable and useful service to a global community. Today, we need your help to ensure that ProMED-mail can continue to publish the information you and your colleagues need. Please support our work; please contribute generously at the link below.
