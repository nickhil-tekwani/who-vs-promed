Strange viral disease kills 20 in Bundibugyo
--------------------------
A strange viral disease with symptoms similar to the Marburg
hemorrhagic fever has hit Bundibugyo District in the west, killing
about 20 people in less than 2 weeks.

The Chief Administrative Officer, Mr Elius Byamungu, said the disease
mainly hit Kikyo village on the foothills of Mt. Rwenzori. He said
the area has since been sealed off.

He said the disease is highly infectious and kills within 3 days.
"It has claimed over 20 people and among them is one of our staff who
has been treating patients at a health centre at Kikyo," Mr Byamungu
said.

"The patients develop high fever, vomit and catch diarrhoea before
they die. It is very deadly and strange." Mr Byamungu said efforts to
contain the disease have proven futile and they have appealed to the
Ministry of Health.

He said blood samples of the victims have already been sent to South Africa.

"We sent out samples to South Africa but we haven't got the results,
you can contact Dr [Sam] Okware and Dr [Sam] Zaramba for more
information," he said.

Dr Okware, the Director of Community Health, said they are yet to
establish the name of the disease. He said someone can catch the
disease through close range contact with a patient.

"Yes, the disease has been reported but we are still investigating.
In September [2007], we took specimen and it was negative on Marburg.
But it seems to be an infectious disease caused by small mammals like
cats," he said.

Dr Okware said the main symptoms are high fever, vomiting, abdominal
pain and skin rashes. He said they suspected the disease to be
Leptospirosis -- a rare disease caused by [bacteria spread from]
small mammals.

The symptoms are similar to the Marburg fever which claimed one life
at Kitaka mines in the western district of Kamwenge in August [2007].
Dr Okware said 13 villages had been affected and 3 health workers at
Kikyo Health Centre IV infected.

[With the history of a recently contained small outbreak of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever in Uganda in the past several months (see
references for 2007 below), it is understandable that the diagnosis
of Marburgvirus for another outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Uganda
is being entertained. In addition, the observation that there have
been 3 cases among health care workers also strengthens the suspicion
that either Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus may be the causative agent as
these hemorrhagic viruses are often associated with nosocomial
enhancement of transmission, especially in remote areas where
observing universal precautions requires protective gear such as
gloves, masks and gowns that are not routinely available due to
severe resource limitations.

The outbreak of Marburgvirus earlier this year was associated with
mine workers in Kitaka mine, located in Kakasi Forest Reserve in
Kamwenge district. (see map of Uganda available at: For a map of
Uganda see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.jpg>.
Kemwenge is located almost due west of Kampala one district removed
from the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
current outbreak is occurring in Bundibugyo district which borders
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is one district removed
from Kemwenge district where the earlier Marburvirus cases were
located.

The comment that specimens sent for testing in September 2007 were
negative may not apply to the above outbreak, but may in fact apply
to specimens of contacts of the affected mine workers in the earlier
outbreak, but may not have included all individuals who had contact
with the implicated mine. Outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers have been
associated with mine workers in the past (see Viral hemorrhagic fever
- Uganda (Kamwenge): Marburg susp., RFI 20070801.2475 for a
discussion and review of this topic, with relevant references on the
identification of hemorrhagic fever viruses in bats).

Ebolavirus has also been the causative agent for hemorrhagic fever
outbreaks in Uganda (see references below). In addition,
Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever are possible. The
curiosity in the above newswire is the mention of small mammals such
as cats as possibly being involved in the transmission cycle of what
is going on in Bundibugyo. This tidbit had this moderator wonder if
plague (caused by _Yersinia pestis_) should also be considered as
Uganda is endemic for plague, and has plague outbreaks periodically
(see below references for plague reports in Uganda during 2007).

Clearly more information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.
