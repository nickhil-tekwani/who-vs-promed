[The Global "Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" monthly report is distributed by the FAO. The current report, covering December 2015, has been compiled by Dr Teresa Scicluna from the EuFMD STP programme. The report has been edited by Professor David Paton from the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Laboratory. He authored the introductory "Guest Editor Comments" from which the following text is presented. For the full document, with maps, tables and graphics, please refer to the source URL. - Mod.AS]

We start 2016 with familiar concerns about FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] virus strains extending their range, and questions about what has triggered this and what may be the consequences. A common pool of serotypes O, A and Asia 1 virus strains are recognised in India and neighbouring countries linked by livestock trading, such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan [1]. If these FMD viruses gain access to Pakistan and Myanmar, the respective flows of ruminants from these countries towards the Middle East and South East Asia provide a conduit for further spread. Indian subcontinent viruses have also turned up further afield without any obvious intermediary spread [2]. In the past, there has often been a considerable lag between the emergence of new strains in the Indian subcontinent and their appearance in the Middle East, South East Asia and beyond [3]. In the case of westward spread, the militarised border between India and Pakistan may act as a significant barrier.

The O India 2001 strain of the Middle East South Asia topotype (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001; [4]) is the most prevalent FMD virus in India and despite being there for 15 years, it has only recently become widely recognised outside of the region. It was detected in the United Arab Emirates in 2009 and 2014 and in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, it entered Tunisia and Algeria and in 2015, it arrived in Morocco and in Laos.

Serotype A in India has become dominated by a region specific strain, G-VII, of the Asia topotype that has been evolving there for many years [5]. A virus of this strain was detected in Myanmar in 2010. In 2015, this virus also appeared for the 1st time in the Middle East, being detected in Saudi Arabia and subsequently in Iran and Turkey.

Whether these viruses have been spread beyond the Indian subcontinent by animal movements, overseas workers or trade in meat or other commodities, they now threaten Europe and Central Asia. Considering their relatively distinct antigenic phenotypes, there is a danger that they may evade the protection offered by immunity whether derived from prior infection with other FMD viruses or due to prophylactic or emergency vaccination with non-Indian vaccine strains. Certainly this appears to be the case for the Indian A, where recent in-vitro matching-matching data from WRLFMD, indicates poor match with the vaccines that are widely used in the Middle East.

Suitable vaccines in India may not be readily available elsewhere pointing to a lack of coordination in managing international vaccine cover. Consequently, undue reliance for FMD control should not be placed on vaccination, and the maintenance of other preventive measures remains vital. Secondly, the suitability of the vaccine strains and vaccination regimens used as well as the strains held in vaccine banks must be kept under continuous review. Vaccine procurers should maintain dialogue with reference laboratories and vaccine manufacturers concerning the need and availability of new vaccine strains.

[The spread of the 2 strains, serotypes O and A, from the Indian subcontinent into the Middle East and North Africa, as briefly described in the above Guest Editor Comments, has been covered in ProMED-mail's postings. In the meantime, Armenia has been added to the list of 3 Middle Eastern countries already reported as infected by the invasive strain FMDV-A Asia VII, against which no commercial vaccine has been found, initially, effective.

The spread of both strains corresponds with the routes presented in a map included in a 2011 paper (Ref 1). See, there, Fig 7 ("mapping cattle density, FMD isolates, livestock movement & intra-/extra regional trade routes in the Middle East").

The following passage, extracted from the said 2011 paper, is conveniently adaptable to the current situation (references omitted):

"Studies on the geographical distribution and density of livestock populations in South Asia and the Middle East have defined areas of continuous livestock density between the Mediterranean Basin and southern Asia, involving Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, and in which Iran takes up a central position, creating a narrow east-west connection just south of the Caspian Sea and acting as a corridor for the spread of pathogens.

"Historically similar epidemiological patterns of virus infections have also been recorded during the rinderpest era.

"In recent years, these epidemiological dynamics of FMDV movement have been exemplified by the emergence of the A-Iran-05 and O-PanAsia-2 FMDV lineages. The A-Iran-05 lineage was 1st detected in Iran in 2003, before it was recognised to the east in Afghanistan (2004) and Pakistan (2006). Westward spread to Saudi Arabia and Turkey occurred in 2005, and to Jordan in late 2006, with generalisation throughout the Middle East region by 2009.

"Unlike the A-Iran-05 strain, the O-PanAsia-2 lineage seems to have originated in India in 2001 but, like the type A strain, moved westwards to Pakistan and Iran in 2005 and then became widespread within the entire Middle East region by 2007, reaching Egypt in late 2007."

Has the recent spread of the described O and A strains from the Indian subcontinent to the Middle East and North Africa followed the same trade route described in the referred paper, namely through Pakistan?

According to the website of the FMD World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright, Iran submitted in December 2015 (35) samples to the World Reference Laboratory. The results of their serotyping and genotyping are anticipated with interest. In case the samples do not include one or both of the said strains, the route(s) of their spread eastwards remain to be unravelled.

[On 30 Jan 2016, the following correction to the above commentary was posted: "The final sentence in the commentary to the above posting included errors. The correct text should read as follows:

"According to the website of the FMD World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright, Pakistan submitted in December 2015 (35) samples to the World Reference Laboratory (batch no. WRLFMD/2015/00037; Date received: 17 Dec 2015; see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/pak.htm). The results of their serotyping and genotyping are anticipated with interest. In case the recent Pakistani samples do not include 1 or both of the said strains, the route(s) of their spread westwards remain to be unraveled. "
