Update: Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome --- Worldwide, 2003
--------------------
CDC continues to support the World Health Organization (WHO) in the
investigation of a multicountry outbreak of unexplained atypical pneumonia
referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1). This report
includes summaries of the epidemiologic investigations and public health
responses in several affected locations where CDC is collaborating with
international and national health authorities. This report also describes
an unusual cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Hong Kong and
identifies the potential etiologic agent of SARS. Epidemiologic and
laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.
As of 26 Mar 2003, a total of 1323 suspected and/or probable SARS cases
have been reported to WHO from 14 locations (2), using the WHO case
definition or country-specific variations* (3). These reported SARS cases
include 49 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 4 percent). The Chinese
authorities have reported 792 suspected/probable cases, including 31
deaths, which occurred in Guangdong province during 16 Nov 2002 - 28 Feb 2003.
CDC is assisting in epidemiologic investigations of cases in Hong Kong,
Vietnam, Taiwan, and Thailand. CDC also is conducting surveillance and
prevention activities in the United States.
Hong Kong: As of 25 Mar 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH)
reported 290 suspected and probable SARS cases. Beginning on 11 Mar 2003,
an increase in acute pneumonia cases among health-care workers (HCWs) at
hospital 1 in Hong Kong was reported to DH. Epidemiologic investigation has
linked these cases to an index patient (Patient J) who visited a friend in
hotel M in late February 2003, became ill a few days later, and was
admitted to hospital 1 on 4 Mar 2003 [see Figure 1 at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5212a1.htm#tab> an excellent
diagrammatic presentation of the outbreak associated with contact at hotel
M - Mod.MPP]. Patient J visited hotel M while patient A, an ill visitor
from Guangdong province, was staying there.
As of 25 Mar 2003, a cluster of 13 persons with suspected/probable SARS are
known to have stayed at hotel M (Figure 1). The index patient (patient A)
had onset of symptoms on 15 Feb 2003. He traveled from Guangdong province
to Hong Kong to visit family and stayed on the ninth floor of the hotel on
21 Feb 2003. He was admitted to hospital 2 on 22 Feb 2003 and died the next
day. 4 HCWs and 2 of his family members subsequently became ill; one family
member died. Of the 12 other patients linked to hotel M, 10 were in the
hotel the same day as the index patient; the other 2 patients (patients L
and M) stayed in the hotel during the time that 3 other symptomatic
patients were guests in the hotel. 9 of the 13 patients, including patient
A, stayed on the ninth floor; one stayed on the 14th floor; one stayed on
the 11th floor; and 2 stayed on both the ninth and 14th floors.
Epidemiologic investigations have identified patients from this cluster as
index patients in subsequent clusters in Hong Kong and other areas. Patient
B is the index patient for the outbreak in Hanoi involving 59 HCWs and
close contacts and also is linked to one case in Thailand. Patients C, D,
and E are associated with 70 cases in Singapore and 3 cases in Germany.
Patient F is linked with a cluster of 16 other cases in Toronto (4).
Patients H and J are linked with outbreaks among HCWs in other hospitals in
Hong Kong. Patient L appears to have become infected during his stay at
hotel M, with subsequent transmission to his wife, patient M.
As of 25 Mar 2003, 6 hospitals and one clinic in Hong Kong have reported
nosocomial transmission to HCWs following admission of persons with SARS.
The suspected index patients of 3 of the 7 nosocomial clusters reported in
Hong Kong have been associated with hotel M (Figure 1).
Hong Kong health authorities have implemented enhanced infection-control
procedures in all hospitals in Hong Kong, including more stringent barrier
and respiratory protection for HCWs, at least daily environmental
disinfection of affected wards, and cohorting of SARS patients. New cases
among HCWs have declined following implementation of these new guidelines.
However, new cases continue to be reported, predominantly among close
contactsÂ† of known patients.
Vietnam: As of 24 Mar 2003, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health in Hanoi has
reported 59 probable SARS cases. The probable index patient (patient B) was
an Asian-American businessman aged 47 years who had visited Hong Kong
before traveling to Hanoi. During his visit to Hong Kong, he had stayed at
hotel M on the same floor, and during the same time, as patient A. Patient
B became ill after arrival in Hanoi on 23 Feb 2003 and was hospitalized
with lower respiratory symptoms on 26 Feb 2003. On 2 Mar 2003, he was
placed on mechanical ventilation. On 5 Mar 2003, he was medically evacuated
to a hospital in Hong Kong and died on 12 Mar 2003. By 5 Mar 2003,
secondary probable SARS cases were identified among HCWs in Hanoi. All
probable SARS cases reported as of 24 Mar 2003 in Hanoi have been linked
through primary or secondary exposure to the same hospital. 2 patients who
were exposed to hospitalized SARS patients traveled subsequently to
Thailand and France and are not included in these numbers.
The government of Vietnam has implemented control activities in Hanoi and
throughout the country, including daily follow-up of contacts of probable
SARS cases and community surveillance for suspected SARS cases.
Infection-control practices to prevent nosocomial transmission have been
implemented at Hanoi hospitals with probable SARS cases. Nosocomial cases
have decreased since the initial peak of cases linked to exposure to the
index patient.
Thailand: As of 23 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has
reported 4 suspected/probable cases. Dates of illness onset ranged from 11
to 18 Mar 2003. Of these 4 ill persons, 3 reported travel to Hong Kong
during the week before illness onset; the other person is a physician who
cared for SARS patients in Hanoi. Thailand has begun to implement hospital
infection control procedures on the presumption of airborne spread. Gowns,
gloves, and N-95 masks are widely available in Thailand. As of 26 Mar 2003,
surveillance has not documented spread of infection to HCWs. However, one
HCW from Thailand became infected while investigating the outbreak in Hanoi.
Taiwan: As of 25 Mar 2003, the Taiwan Department of Health has reported 6
probable cases. Dates of illness onset ranged from 25 Feb 2003 to 17 Mar
2003. Of these 6 ill persons, 4 reported travel to Guangdong province and
Hong Kong during the week before illness onset; none of them had stayed at
hotel M. The other 2 cases occurred in family members of the first patient.
2 patients required mechanical ventilation but have improved clinically.
On the basis of presumed airborne spread of SARS, Taiwan has aggressively
implemented and monitored strict infection-control procedures. Negative
pressure rooms and N-95 respirators are uniformly available for
hospitalized patients. Active surveillance has not identified nosocomial
transmission. Epidemiologic studies are under way to determine specific
risk factors for transmission.
United States: As of 26 Mar 2003, CDC has received 51 reports of suspected
SARS cases from 21 states, identified using the CDC updated interim case
definition. The first suspected case was identified on 15 Mar 2003, in a
man aged 53 years who traveled to Singapore and became ill on 10 Mar 2003.
4 clusters of suspected cases have been identified, 3 of which involved a
traveler who had visited Southeast Asia (including Guangdong province, Hong
Kong, or Vietnam) and a single family contact. One of these clusters
involved suspected cases in patients L and M, who had stayed together at
hotel M during 1-6 Mar 2003, when other hotel guests were symptomatic.
Patient L became sick on 13 Mar 2003 after returning to the United States.
His wife, patient M, became ill several days after the onset of her
husband's symptoms, suggesting secondary transmission. 3 patients in the
United States with suspected SARS (patients I, L, and M) reported staying
at hotel M when other persons staying in the hotel were symptomatic. The
fourth cluster began with a suspected case in a person who traveled in
Guangdong province and Hong Kong. 2 HCWs subsequently became ill at the
U.S. hospital where this patient was admitted.
Laboratory investigations. On 24 Mar 2003, CDC announced that laboratory
analysis had identified a previously unrecognized coronavirus in patients
with suspected or probable SARS. The new coronavirus was isolated in Vero
E6 cells from clinical specimens of 2 patients in Thailand and Hong Kong
with suspected SARS. The isolate was identified initially as a coronavirus
by electron microscopy (EM). The identity was corroborated by results of
immunostaining, indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assays, and
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with sequencing of
a segment of the polymerase gene. IFA testing of sera and RT-PCR analysis
of clinical specimens from 6 other SARS cases were positive for the new
coronavirus. Coronavirus particles also were identified by EM in cells
obtained by bronchial lavage from a patient with SARS. Sequence analysis
suggests that this new agent is distinct from other known coronaviruses.
Other laboratories collaborating in the WHO-led investigation have found
similar results and also have isolated a different virus, human
metapneumovirus, from some patients with suspected SARS. Information is
insufficient to determine what roles these 2 viruses might play in the
etiology of SARS.
Editorial Note:
Cases of SARS continue to be reported from around the world. These cases
are linked primarily to areas with ongoing transmission, with some reports
of secondary local transmission. Transmission has been reported in
Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Hanoi. In Canada,
transmission appears to be limited to a well-defined population of HCWs and
close contacts. In Taiwan, limited transmission has occurred to family
members but not to HCWs. Chinese authorities have updated the number of
cases in Guangdong province and confirmed ongoing disease activity. The
numbers of reported cases in Canada, Singapore, and the United States also
continue to increase (2). Transmission in hospitals and households
continues to occur. In addition, reports have been received of possible
transmission on ships and planes and in offices. On the basis of available
information, country-specific efforts to limit and halt transmission have
included enhancing surveillance, improving infection-control measures in
hospitals and homes, selectively closing hospitals and schools, furloughing
hospital staff, issuing travel advisories, restricting movement of patients
with suspected SARS, and establishing quarantines of exposed persons. In
the United States, CDC has issued travel advisories and developed
infection-control guidelines; efforts have been focused on rapid
identification and early isolation of symptomatic persons whose illnesses
meet the CDC case definition.
The summary of the demographic, clinical, and transmission patterns from
the reported areas documents some disparities in case-fatality proportion
with pneumonia, and ease of transmission. The data also highlight gaps in
knowledge about the epidemiology of this new syndrome. Some differences
probably reflect concomitant differences in case definition and
surveillance methodologies. However, because of the nonspecific case
definition, all reported cases might not represent a single clinical
entity. Confirmation of the etiology and development of a diagnostic test
should help to resolve these discrepancies.
Although the mechanism of SARS transmission remains unclear, on the basis
of the reported exposures for the majority of cases (i.e., household
contacts and HCWs), droplet and contact transmission appear to be the
predominant modes. The cases in the hotel M cluster and certain hospital
clusters involving seriously ill patients suggest airborne or fomite
transmission. Therefore, infection-control recommendations should include
precautions to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission. With
the introduction of these control measures, decreases in the reported
incidence of SARS have been reported in Hong Kong.
Although the etiologic agent has not been confirmed, laboratory data
indicate that a metapneumovirus or a coronavirus are possible agents.
Infection with a metapneumovirus, (i.e., enveloped, single-stranded RNA
virus) has been associated previously with respiratory disease with much
less frequent occurrence of severe disease than SARS. Coronaviruses are
enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect both humans and animals
(5). The known human coronaviruses can cause serious infections of the
lower respiratory tract in children and adults and necrotizing
enterocolitis in newborns (5,6). Coronaviruses are able to survive on
environmental surfaces for up to 3 hours (6). Coronaviruses might be
transmitted person-to-person by droplets, hand contamination, fomites, and
small-particle aerosols (7).
Clinicians evaluating suspected cases should use standard precautions
(e.g., hand hygiene) together with airborne (e.g., N-95 respirator) and
contact (e.g., gowns and gloves) precautions (8). Until the mode of
transmission has been defined more precisely, eye protection also should be
worn for all patient contact. As more clinical and epidemiologic
information becomes available, interim recommendations will be updated.
The international spread of disease underscores the need for strong global
public health systems, robust health service infrastructures, and expertise
that can be mobilized quickly across national boundaries to mirror disease
movements. The Institute of Medicine has recently issued recommendations
for invigorating the response to emerging infectious diseases that reflect
these needs, including the development of a comprehensive system of
surveillance for global infectious diseases, the enhancement of disease
reporting, the development of diagnostic tests, and the formulation and
distribution of guidelines on diagnosis (9).

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update
12 27 Mar 2003
SARS virus close to conclusive identification, new tests for rapid
diagnosis ready soon
-------------------------
On 17 Mar 2003, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to
collaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Early on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the
paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs
earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to
coronaviruses.
"Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the
primary cause of the disease," said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus
Stoehr. "This virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this
virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from
many countries. It has been isolated in cell culture. We are very close to
knowing for sure."
Conclusive identification of a causative [agent] must meet all criteria in
the so-called "KochÂ’s postulate." The additional experiments needed to
fulfill these criteria are currently underway at a laboratory in the
Netherlands.
Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 Mar
2003, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the
causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by
electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.
Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the
agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using
molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in
specimens from patients in various countries.
Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from
SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among
participants in the laboratory.
Hong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10
deaths remains the most severely affected area.
Sequencing of the virus is ongoing in 4 laboratories. Results will help
classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also
guide the development of specific interventions.
At present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been
consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.
Scientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an
entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.
Progress in the development of a diagnostic test:
Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also
moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and
Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO
network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed
SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently
positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy
controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow.
The Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a
diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique.
Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR
primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The
WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available
to labs in other countries throughout the world.
Over the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected
SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing,
the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity
for daily screening of large numbers of samples.
The PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in
the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection
in convalescent sera at about 3 weeks after infection begins. Together, the
2 tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the
world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be
suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home.
Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for
the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on
health care services in several affected areas.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been
reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases
today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with
the previous day.
New data from China
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and
31 deaths, up to 28 Feb 2003, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30
percent of these cases occurred in health workers.
The Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other
parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26
Mar 2003. 2 of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province
of Shanxi, 4 cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 Mar 2003. 2
cases are in health workers.
