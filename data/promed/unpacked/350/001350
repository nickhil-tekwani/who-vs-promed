27 Oct 2015: Ghana: frontline border officials improve Ebola preparedness
http://www.iom.int/news/ghanas-frontline-border-officials-improve-ebola-preparedness
[The IOM (International Order for Migration) Ghana, under its Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness project, has organized a series of training workshops at 8 points of entry in Ghana. These workshops are aimed at building the capacity of frontline officers to detect and manage potential cases of EVD at borders. The training targets officials at Tema and Takoradi ports, Kotoka international airport, and the Elubo, Aflao, Paga, Hamile and Sampa border crossing points. The training will better prepare them to include EVD and other communicable disease surveillance in their daily work. New standard operating procedures for strengthening border health surveillance in Ghana have also been initiated.]

26 Oct 2015 Guinea: Conde faces battle to revive Guinea economy after reelection
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/26/guinea-election-economy-idUSL8N12K4ZD20151026
[Guinean President Alpha Conde's successful reelection seems to have calmed a combative opposition. However, Guinea's persistent Ebola outbreak, along with a decrease in metals prices, are impeding his plan to bring back Guinea's economy. Guinea's constitution limits a president's time in office to 2 terms, and the end of Conde's 2nd term is in 2020. According to experts, during his last term in office, Conde has an opportunity to calm Guinea's adversarial- and ethnic-divided politics. In what may be a signal of outreach, Conde met on Friday [24 Oct 2015] the leader of the opposition Union of Republic Forces, Sidya Toure, who came in 3rd in the presidential election vote.

28 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: After Ebola, Sierra Leone's burial workers fear a bleak future
http://www.irinnews.org/report/102164/photo-feature-after-ebola-sierra-leone-s-burial-workers-fear-a-bleak-future
[Approximately 14 000 people still work on the safe-and-dignified burials for victims of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Part of this job is the stigmatization which is associated with the workers' contact with people who died from EVD. For this service, workers receive a paid job and monthly hazard pay, and aid agencies have provided some of the workers temporary living accommodations. However, once the EVD outbreak is over, the perks of being on the EVD funeral detail will end, and their future employment opportunities may be few.]

26 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola surges back even after "recovery" ... mystery deaths in Africa believed to be Ebola's 3rd wave
http://www.naturalnews.com/051707_Ebola_Africa_pandemic_relapse.html
[Ebola survivors have experienced stigmatization following a full recovery. What is emerging as a new reason for shunning survivors is a percentage of survivors who are now starting to suffer relapse. At the Sierra Leone's National Ebola Response Center, researchers are struggling to understand a new wave of "rogue" Ebola cases and "mysterious deaths" which are being called "anomalies."]

27 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: The Sierra Leone village where every orphan is a victim of the Ebola epidemic
http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/the-sierra-leone-village-where-every-orphan-is-a-victim-of-the-ebola-epidemic-a3100021.html
[In a community called "The Labor Camp," located in a remote area in Sierra Leone's northwest, is one of the communities hardest hit by the Ebola virus disease (EVD). The Labor Camp is a mining town set up by the British in colonial times. In The Labor Camp is an informal graveyard for Ebola victims. The community is known as the village where every child -- 127 of them -- is an orphan. In this community, EVD-linked tragedy has struck every single one of the 32 houses and either wiped out entire families or left orphaned children to care for themselves.]

28 Oct 2015 Uganda: Ebola vaccine trials get underway in Uganda
http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/675007-ebola-vaccine-trials-get-underway-in-uganda.html
[Volunteer recruitment and screening has started for vaccine human trials in Uganda. The testing will be done by the Makerere University Walter Reed project (MUWRP) in Kampala. The vaccine is named Chimp Adenovirus Type 3 and was developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a UK-based drugs manufacturer.]

28 Oct 2015 USA: One year later, reporter explores how Ebola has changed the American health system
http://www.reportingonhealth.org/resources/lessons/one-year-later-reporter-explores-how-ebola-has-changed-american-health-system
[The largest and most official change was the US Department of Health and Human Services spending millions of dollars helping 55 US hospitals prepare for receiving and evaluating a potential EVD patient. Of those 55 hospitals, 9 centers were chosen to be regional centers for the actual treatment of Ebola, as well as other dangerous pathogens such as anthrax, MERS and Marburg virus. The majority of US hospitals did not receive any extra funding or training to prepare for EVD. Prevention didn't visit their facilities to make sure they were prepared for the worst.

Ironically, Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas was a respected hospital but would not have made the short list for joining a federal regional network to prepare for Ebola. However, their facility 1st received patient "D." The state of EVD preparedness for hospitals like Texas Health, one year later, is unknown, as is how these hospitals rate when it comes to exotic disease preparedness.]

28 Oct 2015 USA: The biothreat is real -- and we're not ready, report says
http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/biothreat-real-were-not-ready-report-says-n452906
[According to a publicly-funded report released by the group headed by former US Senator Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge, even though the US government has been warned repeatedly of biological threats, and has spent about USD 6 billion a year (almost USD 80 billion since year 2000) on preparations, it is not doing so in an organized way. In addition, the US has shown it does not handle these disease outbreaks well.

According to Lieberman, "The reaction to the reality of Ebola was that we weren't ready. That's even though experts had predicted just what happened -- an epidemic in Africa, and the spread via travelers -- for years. The same is true of avian flu. We are lucky the version of it last year [2014] didn't cross over to humans."

The report reads: "There is no centralized leader for biodefense. There is no comprehensive national strategic plan for biodefense. There is no all-inclusive dedicated budget for biodefense. At some point, we will likely be attacked with a biological weapon and will certainly be subjected to deadly naturally occurring infectious diseases and accidental exposures, for which our response will likely be insufficient."

The report calls for the vice president to be in charge of biodefense, to give White House authority to the effort, and to coordinate all the other departments and agencies.]

23 Oct 2015 USA: Doctor to patient: An Ebola survivor's odyssey
http://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/news/bedside-patient-ebola-survivors-odyssey
[Dr. Ian Crozier is a walking example of the issues involved with contracting Ebola virus disease (EVD), both during infection and post-infection, and he presents a vivid example of the damaging, long-term consequences of EVD, which are still inadequately understood.

Dr. Crozier was a volunteer physician with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Sierra Leone, where he diligently worked with EVD patients in the fall of 2014. At the outbreak's peak, the team helped care for overwhelming numbers of EVD patients and those suspected of having EVD. Then, on 7 Sep 2014, he developed a fever, headache and extreme fatigue. On 9 Sep 2014, he was airlifted to Emory Hospital (USA, Georgia). He developed multisystem organ failure.

According to Dr. Crozier, he still suffers from an array of disturbing consequences, including eye problems, hearing loss with tinnitus, short-term memory loss, seizures and sleep regulation problems, he said.

Dr. Crozier was one of the sickest patients to survive EVD. However, even months after his apparent recovery, EVD still had a few surprises for him, one of which was the disturbing finding of live replicating EBOV in his vitreous humor (clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina), months after his blood tested negative for EBOV, which turned his naturally blue eyes to green. Yet he continues to have a positive attitude towards his EVD infection.

During an appearance at Stanford University (California), Dr. Crozier recounted his astonishing recovery, during which he rebounded from a tortuous period of being hooked to a ventilator and a kidney dialysis machine, experiencing abnormal heart rhythms, and developing severe encephalopathy that left him delirious and then unconscious for weeks, ultimately suffering several hemorrhagic strokes.

According to Dr. Crozier, "This virus is teaching us in this last 10th of this last mile, as it stutters along, that we have a lot to learn."]

26 Oct 2015 West Africa: Foreign military role in Ebola crucial, questions over future use - experts
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510261724.html
[According to University of Sydney researchers, military assistance was required during the Ebola outbreak because health systems in Liberia and Sierra Leone were not equipped, and many aid agencies withdrew staff and halted operations when the outbreak began.

According to the Saving Lives report, in 2014, more than 5000 troops from Canada, China, France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States were deployed, where they worked primarily in training local health-care workers and building Ebola treatment units. However, to researcher Adam Kamradt-Scott, coordination between governments, aid agencies and the military, and a lack of understanding of their roles, may have hampered the Ebola response. Scott also said the use of foreign troops was well received by most West Africans interviewed, but the troops might not be welcomed in other countries and could worsen future humanitarian crises.
