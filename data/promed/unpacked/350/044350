INFECTIOUS DISEASE LONG-TERM TRENDS (2)
=======================================
In response to the request for data on long-term global trends in
infectious diseasem incidence and mortality, a few suggestions:
1) see WHO World Health Statistics Annual 1988 for trends in all sorts of
diseases, 1950-1985/6, and for smallpox and yellow fever from 1948 - graphs
and tables (in any large medical library).
2) PAHO also has a regional report, Health Conditions in the Americas, with
trend data, and there are reports available from other regions of WHO (AFRO,
EURO, EMRO, SEARO, WPRO) with figures for at least the childhood diseases -
for what they are worth. (All WHO figures are official government figures
and subject to varying degrees of under-reporting. See pp.xv-xxii of the
1988 WHO Annual for a discussion of the validity of the mortality statistics).
3) contact Dr Alan Lopez at PSA/PAP, WHO Geneva by fax (41-22) 791-0746 for
trend data in smoking-related and other causes of death.
4) The EPI unit at WHO Geneva has child immunization data by country and
region going back to the beginning of the program - fax them at same number
as Dr Lopez, addressed to Dr N.A. Ward, Chief EPI.
