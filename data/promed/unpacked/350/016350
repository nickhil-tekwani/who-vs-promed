Periodic Cholera Report
CENTRAL AMERICA
Costa Rica
Date: 6 May 1999

A total of 15 children died this year from diarrhea, the last of these
deaths occurring on 28 April, while the total number of deaths due to this
disease increased to 19, according to a report from the Costarican
Institute of Investigation and Training in Nutrition and Health (Inciensa).
The data come from cases sent to this institution by the Judicial
Investigation Unit in order to rule out cholera as the cause of these
deaths. Inciensa is a cholera reference center, the disease [cholera which
re-appeared in 1991 on the American continent. Two of the deaths were in
adults, others [the article doesn't specify the numbers there were no ages
recorded and the remaining in children less than two years of age, coming
from areas such as Guadalupe de Goicoechea, Tres Rios de la Union,
Siquirres, Liberia and Rio Frio, among others. In April alone there were
there 11 deaths, of which five had received medical attention, three had
not sought help, and two were brought to the hospital already dead. The
condition of the remaining case was not reported. Elena Campos, chief of
the cholera reference center, said that "the people tend to believe that
diarrhea is not a problem, but death due to diarrhea is the second cause of
mortality among those diseases with obligatory reporting." The register
which is brought by Inciensa is recent, so that it is not possible to
determine if the deaths had increased. "The importance of this, is that
there is a lack of education for the families; over the necessity to bring
the young children to the medical center when they have diarrhea and that
they know and detect in a timely manner the symptoms of dehydration" said
Campos. Number surprising Edgar Mohs Villalta, director of the Nationanl
Children's Hospital (HNN), expressed his surprise with the figures reported
from this center which indicated that of the 2,300 cases of diarrhea seen
during last March, only one child died, while in all of 1998 there were
only two deaths. "Diarrhea had been the second cause of death in the
country in the past. And now it is no longer counted as one of the first
twenty causes of death", stated Mohs.

An 24 year old indigenous Honduran became the first fatal case of cholera
in the Mosquitia zone (Eastern), as a result of which, the sanitary
authorities have reinforced preventive measures, the Regional director of
the Ministry of Health, Francisco Medina announced this Wednesday. The
official assured the local radio station that last week the young man was
taken to a health center but "it was impossible to revive him due to his
very severe state of dehydration, and early in the morning (Tuesday) they
confirmed that he had died of cholera". Medina estimated that this case of
cholera is "isolated" from the outbreak of 163 cases, with five deaths,
detected in the Mosquitia [zone of Nicaragua, bordering with Honduras,
which had obligated the Honduran authorities to declare a permanent state
of alert in the zone. This is an isolated case which occurred in Nicaragua
because the site where the case was registered is many kilometers inside of
the border with Nicarague", stated Medina. The information on the death of
this indigenous [person coincided with the announcement of the Honduran
Ministry of Health about the installation of an "epidemiologic circle" on
the borders (with Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador) in order to avoid
outbreaks of cholera. With the young Misquito [name for ethnic group in
this region, there are now four cases of cholera detected in Honduras
since the beginning of 1999, but this is the first which resulted in the
death of the patient.

Honduras declared a sanitary alert in the frontier zones with Nicaragua and
Guatemala, after detecting three cases of cholera caused presumptively by
outbreaks in the neighboring countries, a health official said on
Wednesday. "We are in a sanitary alert and we have sent epidemiology
personnel in order to mount circles which will permit us to impede the
propagation of the disease [cholera", indicated the Vice Minister of
Health, Elliethe Giron. Two cases of cholera were discovered in one
community of nine houses in the remote region of the Mosquitia, bordering
with Nicaragua, and the other in the county of Paso Viejo, near to the
border with Guatemala. These are the first cases of cholera registered in
Honduras since the beginning of 1999. "The three persons are out of
danger, but we are afraid that the outbreaks of this disease [cholera that
have presented in Nicaragua, Guatemala and including El Salvador will
extend to our country", advised Giron. The health official said that
Tegucigalpa will host a meeting of the health authorities of Hondura,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, "in order to take coordinated
measures to combat the disease [cholera and its propagation".

KOTA KINABALU: About 130 cholera cases have been reported in Sabah so far
this year but state Medical and Health Services Department director Dr
Saimy Ismail said this does not indicate that there is an outbreak of the
disease. He said most cases were from the Likas, Inanam and Menggatal
areas near here. "We have found that those affected live in workers
quarters," Dr Saimy said after receiving emergency medical kits from the
Maybank Group here. The kits, costing RM98,050, would be used at the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital here and the Tawau General Hospital. Dr Saimy was
commenting on reports that over 20 cases of the disease had been referred
to health authorities this month. On April 21, six people were struck by
cholera including a 50-year-old man and children between the ages of one
and three years. Four days later, a man in his 60s from Penampang died of
cholera.

The Department of Health (DH) today (Tuesday) urged members of the public
to be on guard against cholera following the confirmation of a cholera case
in Hong Kong. A spokesman for DH said: "The best way to prevent the spread
of cholera and other food-borne diseases is to observe good personal, food
and environmental hygiene at all times." The patient is a 19-year-old woman
from Kwun Tong and she was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital last
Friday (May 21). She is in a stable condition. She has not travelled
outside Hong Kong during the incubation period. Health education had been
given to family members of the patient and disinfection work was carried
out at her home. To date four cholera cases were reported in Hong Kong this
year, including two imported cases and two local cases.

The outbreak of cholera in Madagascar have killed more than 170 people and
infected over 2,000 others. Concerned with the fast spreading disease, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are
increasing its support to contain the epidemic, said a media release from
the International Federation's region delegation in Nairobi Wednesday. The
epidemic on the Indian Ocean Island country is so far confined to
north-western Mahajanga Province and Antananaivo, the island capital, the
release said, adding that the federation believed many cases might be
unreported as Mahajanga is a large province with many remote communities.
"Nowhere in the East African island is now safe from cholera," said David
Dofara, an International Federation health delegate in Madagascar, noting
that "Unless a major regional program is introduced, cholera will continue
to make ground and many lives will be lost." The local Red Cross has opened
two diagnostic centers in Mahajanga town and over 30,000 people have
reached with the health education program in the province. Trained
volunteers are intensifying the awareness campaign, by providing
information on how to prevent the disease, teaching the population how to
chlorinate water and advocating the use of latrines. Dofara noted that
cholera is a disease of poverty, and attributed the outbreak of the
epidemic to the degenerating environment and increasing squalor where the
poor live without drainage, latrines, clean water and health facilities. ***

In addition to the earlier correspondence regarding acute watery diarrhoeal
disease in Kano area, Nigeria, we report that 2 of 10 faecal samples
cultured by the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Amsterdam
& Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam - The Netherlands, contained Vibrio
cholerae O1, serogroup Inaba. The antibiogram showed the following results:
susceptible to doxycycline/tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, amoxycillin, and
erythromycin; resistant to co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol and colistin. In
two other samples vibrio-like bacterial species were found that until now
could not be identified. DNA analysis of 16 S RNA genes is currently done
by the Laboratory for special bacterial determinations of the National
Institute of Public Health & the Environment, Bilthoven The Netherlands.
Several tests suggest that these strains are not pathogenic vibrios, but
the exact nature remains still unknown. Medecins sans Frontieres -

Reported, 12 May 1999

An outbreak of cholera has been reported in Kano Municipal Local Government
Area (LGA), Kano State, which started in late March. The outbreak was
traced to the interruption of the domestic water supply for some days which
forced people to use any water available. A total of 815 cases with 28
deaths has been recorded up to 6 May. The outbreak has now spread to Tofa
LGA where 182 cases with 19 deaths were recorded over two weeks beginning
in late April. Control measures including management and isolation of
affected patients, intensification of health education and chlorination of
all wells in affected communities have been taken. WHO gave technical
support during the investigation and management of the outbreak as well as
emergency health kits. Cholera outbreaks also occurred in Adamawa State (76
cases, 18 deaths) and in Edo State (49 cases, 24 deaths). The outbreak in
Adamawa State is now under control and no new cases have been reported in
May. In Edo State technical assistance and transportation for the
investigative team was given by WHO but basic drugs and supplies for
management of patients were not available which led to the high case
fatality rate. ***

A total of 7 860 cases with 233 deaths has been reported since the
beginning of the current epidemic which started in December 1998. Areas
where cases were still being registered at the end of March and during the
first half of April are Baidoa, Kismayo and Mogadishu. The disease is
still appearing in new areas - Bay, Lower and Upper Juba, Lower Shabelle -
which are difficult to access. No data are available. WHO continues to
support the local health authorities in strengthening cholera preparedness
plans, including the provision f supplies, since more outbreaks are
expected later in the year following the seasonal pattern. Cholera, Sudan.
The outbreak which began in early March is continuing. The areas of Akobo,
Burmat, Lankien, Mading, Padak and Wanding have reported a total of 892
cases with 24 deaths up to 27 April. These figures are for cases admitted
to hospital, and remain provisional. The epidemic mainly affects the
Jonglei region in areas south of the river Sobat. As it is the beginning of
the rainy season people have started moving with their animals from
locations along the river to inland sites where other areas are likely to
be affected. WHO has sent an epidemiologist to assist local health
authorities in assessing the situation in the affected areas.

The Zambian health ministry has declared the northern town of Kaputa a
cholera infected area following an increase in the number of patients
reporting to health centres. Aid workers told IRIN that although the
numbers of cases are not high, there has been a steady stream of patients
being treated in the town's health centres over the past two weeks. "There
have been 122 cholera cases since March with two deaths in the town of
Kaputa," aid workers said. However, there have been no cases reported from
the refugee transit centres [DRC refugees in the town. The aid workers
said people's movement in and out of the town has been restricted in order
to control the spread of the disease. This measure, the aid workers added,
is accompanied by cholera awareness programmes as well as medicines and
medical teams dispatched to monitor the situation. In the meantime, a UNHCR
spokesman told IRIN that so far 9,000 out of the estimated 20,000
registered DRC refugees have been moved from Kaputa to the Mwange camp in
Mporokoso, about 260 km south. "We hope to have moved the rest of the
refugees to Mwang e within the next week or two," Dominik Bartsch said.

Cholera and several other diseases have hit camps for displaced people in
Bundibugyo district, a health ministry official said Friday. Reporting to
the national cholera task force meeting in Mulago hospital, Dr. Charle s
Mugero of the diarrhoeal diseases programme, said over 30 people in
Bundibugyo were getting cholera every week, most of them refugees. Some of
the patients come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Other diseases on
the increase in the refugee camps include malaria, scabies, other
diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, and malnutrition, Dr. Mugero
Said. "Cholera is already on and it is likely to worsen. Other diseases are
on the increase. In some camps they have trained health workers but they
are still very few," Dr Mugero added. He blamed the epidemics on
overcrowding, shortage of clean water, and lack of food. He said the new
refugee camps were in poor hygienic conditions, with up to 40 people
sharing a latrine. Over 138,000 people in Bundibugyo are living in 40
camps, having been displaced by the Allied Democratic Front (ADF)
insurgency. The refugee populat ion is estimated to be over 80% the
district's population. Dr. Mugero however said most of the cholera victims
recovered due to prompt treatment. He said only one in 100 cholera patients
(1%) died. Arua district has also been hit by a fresh cholera epidem ic,
with about 25 new cases every week, the meeting heard. The most affected
area is Metu sub-county. ***

The cholera epidemic has so far claimed 210 lives in Zimbabwe since early
this year, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare said Saturday. The
ministry said in a statement issued here that at least 2,424 cases have
been reported countrywide despite the ministry's efforts to control the
disease. The ministry said it was stepping up its control measures in all
provinces to curb the further spreading of the epidemic. "The control
measures put in place include intensive health education awareness
campaigns and supervision, and food hygiene," said the statement. It warned
the public that
cholera was a deadly diarrhoea disease caused by eating food or drinking water
contaminated by the cholera germ. The ministry also appealed to other
sectors to complete its efforts by creating awareness to prevent the
disease from spreading.

A sudden surge was noticed in acute diarrhoeal cases in the city with some
80 to 120 patients, mostly children, being brought to major public
hospitals every day. Prof Iqbal Memon of the Paediatrics Department, Civil
Hospital, Karachi, and acting clinical coordinator of the Diarrhoea
Training Unit-Sindh, talking to APP said the cases being brought at
different hospitals were mainly from the low-lying areas of the city where
supply of contaminated water had assumed a severe turn. Referring to cases
reported to the Diarrhoea Training Unit (DTU), he said 1,835 cases of the
disease were brought in March and April this year whereas 612 were reported
during the first fortnight of the current month. "Of these case 19 were
culture proven cholera cases," Prof Memon said, adding that the ailment
though seasonal required urgent actions and arrangements for prevention.
This must be mentioned that nine of the 19 cholera incidents were reported
in May alone. The patients were from Lyari, Orangi, Shershah,
Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Aram Bagh, Pakistan Chowk and Jodia Bazar. Although the
situation has not yet assumed alarming proportions as was noticed during
the same period last year, query made from local laboratories also revealed
a certain rise in Karachi-based cholera cases. Dr Memon fears that intense
heat, fast approaching monsoon season and highly questionable water quality
besides hygienic practices of the masses could any time lead to an outbreak
of cholera. Stressing for sensitizing people about measures to prevent the
ailment, Prof Memon advised the people to take advantage of the ongoing
sub-national immunization week in the province and get their children
vaccinated against polio, the crippling disease. A significant rise in
cholera has already been reported from the interior of the province with
children being the major victims.-APP ***

The Bangladeshi government has taken measures to check the outbreak of
diarrhea which has so far killed 162 people in the country's southern
districts. A total of 668 medical teams have been formed and four
temporary treatment centers set up to provide medical care to the patients
of the water-borne disease in the capital city of Dhaka and six coastal
districts, according to a report in Thursday's The New Nation daily
newspaper. There is an adequate stock of oral re-hydration saline,
intravenous fluid and antibiotics in government hospitals in the affected
areas and more drugs are being sent to boost the stock, the report quoted
sources at the Directorate of Health Services as saying. The Dhaka-based
International Center for Diarrhea Disease Research, Bangladesh, popularly
known here as cholera hospital, has set up two temporary tents to
accommodate the rising number of patients and has increased the number of
medical and nursing staff to cope with the situation. Statistics available
at the Health Directorate said 872 people were affected with the disease in
the coastal districts during the last 24 hours ending May 3 and six of them
died. The number of patients in the districts reported at the hospital
during the past seven days was 4,605 and 29 of them died. About 100
persons have died of diarrhea and more than 17,000 people have been
affected in recent months in the six districts under the Barisal division
while in Noakhali and Lakshmipur, two districts under the southeastern
Chittagong division, the disease has killed 62 people and affected 5,000
others in the past one month, reports said. Doctors said consumption of
unwholesome food and contaminated water is the main reason behind the
outbreak of the disease.
