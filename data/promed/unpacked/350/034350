Thank you for your tribute to outbreak information as to EV-71 in Taiwan.
I am a pediatrician for Osaka City General Hospital and my experience about
three deaths linked to HFMD [hand foot and mouth disease and EV-71
[enterovirus 71 was reported on ProMED-mail by Professor Lam. In the Osaka
first case, autopsy restricted to heart and lung was performed. Very mild
myocarditis and pulmonary edema and hemorrhage was noticed. The cause of
the case was interpreted as CNS disease although the permission of autopsy
of the brain could not be obtained. Professor Lam suggested the cause of
death was brain stem encephalitis due to EV-71 infection and pathology was
reported on <http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/2188/histopath.html>
The most important issues as to EV-71 encephalitis is that this type of
brain stem encephalitis is very unique. Usually the symptomatology of brain
stem encephalitis includes such as hemiplegia, facial palsy, abnormal eye
movement, nystagmus, ataxia, et al. and acute death due to brain stem
encephalitis is usually rare. But EV-71 brain stem encephalitis showed
rapid evolution of tachypnea, tachycardia, pulmonary edema and death within
24 hours after exacerbation [?. So I think EV-71 brain stem encephalitis
is a very unique and special syndrome. ProMED-mail suggested multiple
etiology such as Coxsackie or ECHO but considering this special syndrome
has always been linked to EV-71 (deduced from Bulgaria 1975, 40 autopsies,
and Malaysia, 4 autopsies), this virus-symptoms complex is very unique and
other virus isolated should be [considered coincidental. EV-71 is more
difficult to isolate than are other enteroviruses.
I would like to tell one more thing as to HFMD with neurological
complication. Man C. Woo, MD,PhD, Pediatric Neurologist for Otokoyama
Hospital, Kansai Medical College, Kyoto Prefecture nearby Osaka
<woo-man@ga2.so-net.ne.jp> showed that brain stem encephalitis was
associated with HFMD in 1997. His cases showed cerebellar ataxia without
sequelae. MRI displayed high signal lesion in ponto-medullary junction
(tegmentum)(T2weighted Image). This shows clearly EV-71 neurotropism
specific to this area. (However, EV-71 was not isolated in this case)

[These are fascinating observations and might very well explain a great
deal. Sequencing of EV-71 virus isolates will provide additional useful
information regarding differences between the currently circulating
isolates and reference strains. Whether or not EV 71 is eventually
confirmed as the single etiologic agent of the complex cases in these
epidemics, it should be emphasized that clinical symptoms caused by
simultaneously superimposed virus infections are not described in
textbooks. - Mod.CHC
[When considering these results, bear in mind the following:
1) In the first case, a brain stem lesion was suspected but never actually
seen.
2) In the last case, a brain stem lesion was seen, but EV-71 was never
actually isolated.
3) EV-71 is said to be more difficult to isolate than other enteroviruses,
yet more EV-71 isolates have been reported than other viruses. However, we
have reason to believe that more viruses have been isolated than have been
reported, including one or more possibly new coltiviruses. - Mod.JW
