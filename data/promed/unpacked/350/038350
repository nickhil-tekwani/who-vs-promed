KUCHING [Sarawak, Malaysia:
For the first 25 weeks of this year, 665 cases [of dengue were reported
while 668 were received for the whole of last year.
The disease had killed two persons and caused brain damage to another,
Assistant Environment and Public Health Minister Dr Soon Choon Teck
disclosed here yesterday.
The high number of cases were attributed to an outbreak of the disease
especially in the Sibu region during the beginning of this year.
"Efforts are directed at creating public awareness on the dengue menace and
the need to destroy the mosquito breeding grounds," he said. In stressing
that there was still a lot to be done to tackle the dengue problem, Dr Soon
called for cooperation from the
community to create a clean and healthy environment.
