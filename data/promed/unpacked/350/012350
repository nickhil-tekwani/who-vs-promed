A pair of new studies describe long-COVID findings, one from Spain showing that nearly 40% of bilateral pneumonia patients had impaired lung diffusion 1 year after hospitalization, and the other from England demonstrating that double-vaccinated adults were 41% less likely than their unvaccinated peers to report symptoms 3 months or more after infection.

As part of a study of adult patients admitted to 12 hospitals in Spain with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, researchers analyzed lung function and chest computed tomography (CT) findings 2, 5, and 12 months after hospital release, which was from 1 May to 31 Jul 2020. The findings were published yesterday [12 Sep 2022] in Respiratory Research.

Abstract
--------
Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has already affected more than 400 million people, with increasing numbers of survivors. These data indicate that a myriad of people may be affected by pulmonary sequelae of the infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate pulmonary sequelae in patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia according to severity 1 year after hospital discharge.

Methods: COVID-FIBROTIC is a multicenter prospective observational cohort study for admitted patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. Pulmonary functional outcomes and chest computed tomography sequelae were analyzed 12 months after hospital discharge and we classified patients into 3 groups according to severity. A post hoc analysis model was designed to establish how functional test changed between groups and over time. A multivariable logistic regression model was created to study prognostic factors for lung diffusion impairment and radiological fibrotic-like changes at 12 months.

Results: Among 488 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 284 patients had completed the entire evaluation at 12 months. Median age was 60.5 ± 11.9 and 55.3% were men. We found between-group differences in male sex, length of hospital stay, radiological involvement and inflammatory laboratory parameters. The functional evaluation of pulmonary sequelae showed that severe patients had statistically worse levels of lung diffusion at 2 months but no between-group differences were found in subsequent controls. At 12-month follow up, however, we found impaired lung diffusion in 39.8% unrelated to severity. Radiological fibrotic-like changes at 12 months were reported in 22.7% of patients (102/448), only associated with radiological involvement at admission (OR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.06-2.38; p = 0.02) and LDH (OR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99; p = 0.046).

Conclusion: Our data suggest that a significant percentage of individuals would develop pulmonary sequelae after COVID 19 pneumonia, regardless of severity of the acute process.]

"Along with an increasing number of people affected [by COVID-19] over time, survival has improved since the start of the pandemic, but with the consequence that millions of survivors could be affected by pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19, which could lead to a clear deterioration in quality of life," the authors wrote. "These findings confirm the need for follow-up of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia to clarify whether fibrotic changes may progress over time."

In England, Office for National Statistics researchers examined rates of long COVID in adult participants in the UK COVID-19 Infection Survey from April 2020 to November 2021. The research was published yesterday [12 Sep 2022] in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. [Ayoubkhani D, Bosworth ML, King S, et al. Risk of long COVID in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 after two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine: community-based, matched cohort study. Open Forum Infect Dis. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac464]

In the study's pilot phase, from April to August 2020, previous survey respondents and a random selection of people from national address lists were chosen for in-home interviews. All participants had tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period, and 3090 had received at least 2 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines at least 14 days before infection. They were matched with an equal number of unvaccinated controls.

While 99.7% of controls were infected before 17 May 2021, when the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant became dominant in the United Kingdom, 98.9% of vaccinated participants were infected during the delta period. Median follow-up was about 97 days.

Of the 3090 double-vaccinated participants, 294 (9.5%) reported long-COVID symptoms of any severity after at least 3 months, compared with 452 of 3090 controls (14.6%) (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.59). Activity-limiting symptoms were reported by 170 (5.5%) double-vaccinees, compared with 268 (8.7%) controls (aOR, 0.59).

"We found that receiving 2 COVID-19 vaccinations at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a 41% decrease in the odds of developing long COVID symptoms at least 12 weeks later, relative to not being vaccinated when infected," the authors wrote.

The results highlight the need to increase population-level vaccine uptake, they added. "Studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess the impact of booster doses and the omicron variant and to evaluate symptom trajectories beyond a single 12-week follow-up visit, particularly given the relapsing nature of long COVID," the researchers concluded. "Further research into possible biological explanations behind our findings, which may inform therapeutic strategies for long COVID, is also required."

["Discussion: ...We found that receiving 2 COVID-19 vaccinations at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a 41% decrease in the odds of developing Long COVID symptoms at least 12 weeks later, relative to not being vaccinated when infected. Our results extend those already published, whereby the risk of Long COVID was approximately halved in people who were double-vaccinated when infected compared with those who were unvaccinated, but at 4 rather than 12 weeks post-infection [4].

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection after double vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of developing Long COVID symptoms at least 12 weeks later compared with infection before vaccination, emphasising the need for public health initiatives to increase population-level vaccine uptake. Studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess the impact of booster doses and the omicron variant and to evaluate symptom trajectories beyond a single 12-week follow-up visit, particularly given the relapsing nature of Long COVID [14].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), linked to antecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is associated with considerable morbidity. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by vaccination might also decrease MIS-C likelihood.

Methods: In a multicenter case-control public health investigation of children ages 5-18 years hospitalized from [1 Jul 2021 to 7 Apr 2022], we compared the odds of being fully vaccinated (2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine ≥28 days before hospital admission) between MIS-C case-patients and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. These associations were examined by age group, timing of vaccination, and periods of delta and omicron variant predominance using multivariable logistic regression.

Results: We compared 304 MIS-C case-patients (280 [92%] unvaccinated) with 502 controls (346 [69%] unvaccinated). MIS-C was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (aOR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.10-0.26), including among children ages 5-11 years (aOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.52), ages 12-18 years (aOR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.05-0.19), and during the delta (aOR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02-0.15) and omicron (aOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.11-0.42) variant-predominant periods. This association persisted beyond 120 days after the 2nd dose (aOR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03-0.22) in 12-18 year-olds. Among all MIS-C case-patients, 187 (62%) required intensive care unit admission and 280 (92%) vaccine-eligible patients were unvaccinated.

Conclusions: Vaccination with 2 doses of BNT162b2 is associated with reduced likelihood of MIS-C in children ages 5-18 years. Most vaccine eligible hospitalized patients with MIS-C were unvaccinated.

A systematic review and meta-analysis today [12 Sep 2022] in Vaccine finds no link between COVID-19 vaccines and infertility in men or women.

Researchers at a Rome hospital analyzed 29 studies from China, Israel, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Canada, and the United States until 8 Jun 2022. Of the studies, 13.8% were deemed of poor quality, 58.6% were of moderate quality, and 27.6% were of good quality.

Meta-analysis of studies of men before and after COVID-19 vaccination of any type showed similar sperm motility (44% vs 43%; 5 studies of 298 men), sperm concentration (50.6 million per milliliter [mln/mL] vs 55.4 mln/mL; 8 studies of 451 men), and sperm volume (2.6 vs 2.7 mL; 6 studies of 346 men).

Among women, biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates (0.51 vs 0.48; 7 studies and 0.45 vs 0.47; 10 studies, respectively) were comparable among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Biochemical pregnancy is defined as the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can be detected as soon as 2 weeks after conception, while clinical signs of a fetus are detected only later. Levels of estradiol, a hormone that can indicate ovarian function, were also similar in 5 studies.

Fertility markers in men and women were unchanged before and after COVID-19 vaccination of any type (i.e., Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Sputnik V). The latter is not authorized for use in the United States.

The researchers noted that, despite ample evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety, misinformation and anti-vaccine campaigns have prompted unfounded fears over decreased fertility.

"Based on the studies published so far, there is no scientific proof of any association between COVID-19 vaccines and fertility impairment in men or women," the authors wrote. "Considering that COVID-19 infection itself may be associated with impaired fertility, COVID-19 vaccination could act as a tool to preserve reproductive function through the prevention of COVID-19 infection."

The team called for future research with longer follow-up times, systematic investigation, and greater representation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the omicron lineage with large number of substitutions in the spike protein that can evade antibody neutralization has resulted in diminished vaccine efficacy and persistent transmission. One strategy to broaden vaccine-induced immunity is to administer bivalent vaccines that encode for spike proteins from both historical and newly-emerged variant strains. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 2 bivalent vaccines that recently were authorized for use in Europe and the United States and contain 2 mRNAs encoding Wuhan-1 and either BA.1 (mRNA-1273.214) or BA.4/5 (mRNA-1273.222) spike proteins. As a primary immunization series in BALB/c mice, both bivalent vaccines induced broader neutralizing antibody responses than the constituent monovalent vaccines (mRNA-1273 [Wuhan-1], mRNA-1273.529 [BA.1], and mRNA-1273-045 [BA.4/5]). When administered to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice as a booster at 7 months after the primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273, the bivalent vaccines induced greater breadth and magnitude of neutralizing antibodies compared to an mRNA-1273 booster. Moreover, the response in bivalent vaccine-boosted mice was associated with increased protection against BA.5 infection and inflammation in the lung. Thus, boosting with bivalent omicron-based mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273.222 vaccines enhances immunogenicity and protection against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.

["Discussion: ...Our experiments show that 2 bivalent mRNA vaccines including components against 312 BA.1 or BA.4/5 had relatively equivalent protective effects against BA.5 in the lungs. Although there is a trend towards lower levels of BA.5 RNA after boosting with mRNA-1273.222 compared to mRNA-1273.214 vaccines, our studies were not powered sufficiently to establish this increased protection, and larger cohorts would be needed to reach this conclusion.

"All mRNA vaccine boosters conferred protection in the upper respiratory tract, with reductions in viral RNA levels measured in the nasal washes and nasal turbinates at 4 dpi. The bivalent and mRNA-1273 vaccine boosters performed equivalently, with similar reductions in viral burden compared to the control vaccine. It is unclear why the differences in protection in the lung between bivalent and parental monovalent mRNA vaccine boosters did not extend to the nasal washes and turbinates, although it may be because neutralizing IgG poorly penetrates this compartment (35), and immune protection in the upper respiratory is mediated by other components (e.g., T cells or trained innate immunity) not assayed here. Regardless, our data showing that both bivalent vaccine boosters confer increased neutralizing activity as well as protection in the lungs against BA.5 supports the recent decision for roll-out of BA.1 or BA.4/5-based bivalent boosters." - Mod.LK]

[5] Alzheimer's association with COVID

Older COVID-19 survivors may be at a 69% higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease within 1 year of infection, according to a retrospective study of 6 million Americans 65 years and older published yesterday [13 Sep 2022] in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

The study, led by Case Western Reserve University researchers, involved analysis of the medical records of 6 245 282 adults aged 65 years and older who had medical visits but no previous diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from February 2020 to May 2021. A total of 410 748 participants tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period, while 5 834 534 did not.

COVID-19 survivors had a 69% higher risk of a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease within 1 year of infection than their uninfected peers (hazard ratio [HR], 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53 to 1.72). Participants aged 85 years and older and women were at particularly high risk (HRs, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.73 to 2.07] and 1.82 [95% CI, 1.69 to 1.97], respectively).

"Our findings call for research to understand the underlying mechanisms and for continuous surveillance of long-term impacts of COVID-19 on Alzheimer's disease," the authors wrote.

The team said it's not clear whether COVID-19 triggers or accelerates development of Alzheimer's disease, noting that SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with inflammation and central nervous system disorders.

"The factors that play into the development of Alzheimer's disease have been poorly understood, but 2 pieces considered important are prior infections, especially viral infections, and inflammation," coauthor Pamela Davis, MD, PhD, said in a Case Western press release. [https://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-risk-factor-for-developing-alzheimers-disease-increases-by-50-80-in-older-adults-who-caught-covid-19/]

Davis added that any increase in new-onset Alzheimer's disease that translates to a higher number of older patients with an incurable disease could be substantial and may further strain the country's already stressed long-term care resources.

"We thought we had turned some of the tide on it by reducing general risk factors such as hypertension, heart disease, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle," she said. "Now, so many people in the U.S. have had COVID and the long-term consequences of COVID are still emerging. It is important to continue to monitor the impact of this disease on future disability."

In the release, the researchers said they plan to continue studying the potential effects of COVID-19 on Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases and whether certain populations may be especially vulnerable to them. They also plan to assess whether any drugs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration could be repurposed to treat COVID-19's long-term effects.

"Discussion: Older adults with COVID-19 were at significantly increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with highest risk in people age ≥85 and in women. Study limitations include potential biases introduced by the observational and retrospective nature of this study and inaccuracy in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, which should not substantially affect the relative risk analyses since all cohorts were drawn from the same dataset. Next steps include validation from other data resources, longer-term follow-up, mechanism understanding and examining other types of dementia."

[6] New variant: omicron BA 4.6
Date: Tue 13 Sep 2022
Source: Wales Online [edited, abridged]
https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/theres-new-covid-variant-spreading-25010260


BA.4.6, a subvariant of the omicron COVID variant which has been quickly gaining traction in the US, is now confirmed to be spreading in the UK.

The latest briefing document on COVID variants from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) noted that during the week beginning [14 Aug 2022], BA.4.6 accounted for 3.3% of samples in the UK. It has since grown to make up around 9% of sequenced cases.

Similarly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, BA.4.6 now accounts for more than 9% of recent cases across the US. The variant has also been identified in several other countries around the world.

So what do we know about BA.4.6, and should we be worried? Let's take a look at the information we have so far.

BA.4.6 is a descendant of the BA.4 variant of omicron. BA.4 was first detected in January 2022 in South Africa and has since spread around the world alongside the BA.5 variant.

It is not entirely clear how BA.4.6 has emerged, but it's possible it could be a recombinant variant.

While BA.4.6 will be similar to BA.4 in many ways, it carries a mutation to the spike protein, a protein on the surface of the virus which allows it to enter our cells. This mutation, R346T, has been seen in other variants and is associated with immune evasion, meaning it helps the virus to escape antibodies acquired from vaccination and prior infection.

Fortunately, omicron infections generally cause less serious illness, and we've seen fewer deaths with omicron than with earlier variants. We would expect this to apply to BA.4.6 too. Indeed, there have been no reports yet that this variant is causing more severe symptoms.

But we also know that omicron subvariants tend to be more transmissible than previous variants. BA.4.6 appears to be even better at evading the immune system than BA.5, the currently dominant variant. Although this information is based on a preprint (a study that is yet to be peer-reviewed), other emerging data supports this.

According to the UKHSA's briefing, early estimates suggest BA.4.6 has a 6.55% relative fitness advantage over BA.5 in England. This indicates that BA.4.6 replicates more quickly in the early stages of infection and has a higher growth rate than BA.5.

The relative fitness advantage of BA.4.6 is considerably smaller than that of BA.5 over BA.2, which was 45% to 55%.

The University of Oxford has reported that people who had received 3 doses of Pfizer's original COVID vaccine produce fewer antibodies in response to BA.4.6 than to BA.4 or BA.5. This is worrying because it suggests that COVID vaccines might be less effective against BA.4.6.

The capacity of BA.4.6 to evade immunity may however be addressed to a degree by the new bivalent boosters, which target omicron specifically, alongside the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Time will tell.

Meanwhile, one preprint study shows that BA.4.6 evades protection from Evusheld, an antibody therapy designed to protect people who are immunocompromised and don't respond as well to COVID vaccines.

The emergence of BA.4.6 and other new variants is concerning. It shows the virus is still very much with us, and is mutating to find new ways to overcome our immune response from vaccination and previous infections.

"Discussion: ...Overall, the study results suggest that the spread of the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariant BA.4.6 cannot be attributed to the R346T and N658S spike protein mutations increasing its receptor binding affinity. Moreover, the resistance of the BA.4.6 sub-variant to the serum from vaccinated BA.2-infected patients was significantly higher than that of the other sub-variants but not large enough to explain the worldwide expansion of BA.4.6 conclusively.

"The loss of neutralization activity of a widely used combination of monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab [Evusheld; targets spike protein - Mod.LK] is concerning. Currently, bebtelovimab is the only potent therapeutic monoclonal antibody against all the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants. However, the resistance of the new sub-variants to the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use leaves a large population of immunocompromised individuals vulnerable to the rapidly mutating sub-variants of SARS-CoV-2." - Mod.LK]
