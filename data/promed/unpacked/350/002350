A superbug which kills hundreds of patients a
year has been found on 32 farms, it emerged
yesterday [4 Nov 2007]. The discovery raises
fears that the infection is spreading to the
human population through meat and milk.

The bug -- ESBL E. coli [Extended-Spectrum
Beta-Lactamases Escherichia coli] -- causes
around 30 000 cases of blood poisoning and
urinary tract infection each year. It is known to
have killed hundreds of people over the past 5
years, although some experts put the annual death toll as high as 4000.

Experts from the Government's Veterinary
Laboratories Agency are due to reveal details
today of the extent of the infection on farms.

The "super E. coli" is thought to have developed
a high degree of resistance to antibiotics
through their use in intensive livestock
operations. Its spread from farm to farm has
mirrored the rise in the number of infections and
deaths in the human population.

Experts at the Health Protection Agency are
investigating a possible link between the bugs
found in livestock and the sale of meat and milk.

Dr. Georgina Duckworth, who compiled a report for
the agency on the emergence of the E coli,
concluded: "The findings show evidence of people
carrying these bacteria in their gut. If this is
found to be commonplace in the general population
this may point towards the food chain being a potential source."

During slaughter, the bug, which lives in the
gut, can be spread through meat, making it a risk to abattoir workers.

Similarly, bugs from cow dung can get into milk
during milking. E. coli should be killed during
pasteurisation but tests show that some forms of
TB bacteria can survive heat treatment. The Soil
Association said movement restrictions and drugs
controls should be placed on the affected farms.

Richard Young, the organic food group's policy
adviser, said: "All the indications are that
infections caused by this type of E. coli are increasing at an alarming rate."

In February 2005, the Daily Mail revealed the
discovery of the superbug among sick and dying
calves on a farm in Wales. By this March [2007],
Government vets had found similar strains on
farms in Cheshire, Wiltshire and Somerset.

A spokesman for Defra, the food and farming
department, said infected animals might have
caught ESBL E. coli from humans, from contact with sewage or from their food.

More cases of a virulent form of E.coli have been
found on farms in Wales and South West England,
mainly Somerset and Wiltshire, the Soil
Association said. The strain, known as Extended
Spectrum Beta Lactamase E. coli, was first discovered in Wales in 2004.

Richard Young, from the Soil Association, said:
"Since then, it has been found in 32 farms across the UK."

A spokeswoman for DEFRA confirmed the number of
cases and said it was monitoring the situation.
The strain causes urinary infections, of which
there were 30 000 human cases last year [2006], which can ultimately be fatal.

Mr. Young added: "Studies outside the UK show
that it can move [from animals] to humans. But it
is hard to track these things. The worry is that
there is an increasing number of cases in farms."

A spokeswoman for DEFRA said on the farms where
the strain had so far been identified there was no human disease.

The Soil Assocation wants to stop animals being
sold from any infected farm, and for a review
into some antibiotics used in dairy farming which
it believes helps the spread of the strain. DEFRA
said it recognised the 2nd concern.

[The first isolation of an ESBL in _Escherichia
coli_ (_E. coli_) in Great Britain in food
producing animals was made by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA) in autumn 2004. It was
recovered from calves that were being reared on a
dairy farm in Wales. The gene encoding CTX-M-14 was identified in the isolates.

Multiple visits to the farm for sampling and
monitoring the prevalence of CTX-M-14 have been
carried out by VLA staff. The prevalence of
cattle testing positive for CTX-M-14 containing
_E. coli_, among the herd, has continued to rise
at each sampling visit, despite the measures
taken since the initial finding in 2004. The
source of the infection was not determined but
the following possibilities were raised: imported
constituents of animal feed, direct or indirect
transfer from human sources to livestock via
environmental routes, contact with other
livestock or development on the farm itself.

The VLA cooperated closely with the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) from the time that it
became clear that an unusual type of resistance
had been identified. Surveillance in farm animals
was initiated; it has been driven by public
health rather than by animal health considerations.

The surveillance has been continued throughout the subsequent years.

The following Q&A's are selected from Defra's web-site, available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/zoonoses/esbl-qa.htm>:

Q1. What is an ESBL?

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), such
as CTX-M enzymes, are proteins that confer upon
their host organism ­- in this particular case,
_E. coli_ -­ the ability to resist a wide range
of therapeutic beta-lactam antimicrobials (i.e.,
resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins).

Q2. What is antimicrobial resistance?

It is the ability of a microorganism to withstand
an antimicrobial. It is widely agreed that
resistant strains of bacteria found in animals
have largely resulted from the general use of
antimicrobial treatments in veterinary medicine
and agriculture. This is an inherent risk
associated with the use of antimicrobials in any species.

Q3. Have ESBLs of current concern in animals in
the UK arisen from the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine?

The origin(s) of the ESBLs found in livestock is
not known and establishing this information is
one of the objectives of the ongoing investigations in this area.

Q4. Do ESBLs pose a risk to public health?

In view of the gaps in knowledge we do not know
what risk ESBLs in livestock pose to public
health The current evidence is that the majority
of strains and serotypes affecting humans are
different from those identified in animals. It is
hoped that the current investigations into the
newly identified infected farms will enable us to
learn more about this condition, the organism
involved and about possible risks to public health.

Additional Q&A's, and further, comprehensive
information on the issue, are available on Defra's web-site at

[Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are
enzymes elaborated by bacteria that hydrolyze
many of the extended-spectrum penicillins and
cephalosporins. Beta-lactam resistance in these
organisms may also be genetically linked to
resistance to other classes of antibiotics. Only
the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and
ertapenem) have reliable activity against such organisms.


ESBLs, first reported in Europe in 1983, are now
reported worldwide. They are most commonly found
in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia
coli_, but have been also found in other
gram-negative bacilli. ESBLs are constitutively
expressed and encoded by plasmids that can
transfer the antibiotic resistance genes from one
organism to another within or even between
bacterial species. The ESBLs are derived from the
parent enzymes TEM and SHV, and CTX-M. The most
commonly reported ESBLs in U.S. have been TEM-
and SHV-derived. Detection of ESBL-mediated
resistance by routine antimicrobial
susceptibility testing can be problematic;
standard laboratory methodology only allows
detection in _K. pneumoniae_ and _E. coli_.

Infections due to ESBL-producing organisms have
become a common problem for patients in hospitals
and other healthcare facilities worldwide.
Community-onset infections due to ESBL-producers
have recently been described in Spain, the United
Kingdom, Israel, and Canada, although some of
these community-onset infections with
ESBL-producers may actually be
healthcare-associated. Typically, these
infections are urinary tract infections with
CTX-M-producing _E. coli_. Only recently has
community-acquired ESBL-producing _E. coli_
infections been described in the United States,
in which case the ESBL variety was CTX-M-15 (Doi
Y, Adams J, O'Keefe A, Quereshi Z, Ewan L,
Paterson DL. Community-acquired extended-spectrum
b-lactamase producers, United States [letter].
Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2007
Jul [date cited]. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/7/1121.htm>)
The U. K. has seen increasing numbers of
infections due to ESBL-producing bacteria, mainly
_E. coli_- producing the CTX-M-15 type
beta-lactamase. CTX-M-type ß-lactamases confer a
higher level of resistance to cefotaxime and
ceftriaxone than to ceftazidime (Livermore DM,
Hawkey PM. CTX-M: changing the face of ESBLs in
the UK. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2005;56:451-4.
Available from <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgl/content/full/56/3/451>).

Food has been speculated as a source for these
CTX-M infections: CTX-M-15-producing _E. coli_
have been detected in food-producing animals in
Europe (Meunier D, Jouy E, Lazizzera C, Kobisch
M, Madec JY. CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-15 type
beta-lactamases in clinical _Escherichia coli_
isolates recovered from food-producing animals in
France. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2006;28:402-7.),
and CTX-M-15-producing _E. coli_ have been found
in chicken sold at a Pittsburgh area supermarket
( Doi Y, Adams J, O'Keefe A, Quereshi Z, Ewan L,
Paterson DL. Community-acquired extended-spectrum
b-lactamase producers, United States [letter].
