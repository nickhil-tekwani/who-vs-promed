The Health Ministry will expand its meningitis vaccination campaign to
the rest of Windhoek [the capital and largest city of Namibia] early
next month [October 2010], minister Richard Kamwi said yesterday [28
Sep 2010].

The 1st vaccination campaign ended on Friday [?24 Sep 2010] in
Katutura, but there were not enough vaccines. "The 2nd vaccination
phase is planned for the week of 12-15 Oct 2010 targeting the rest of
Windhoek," Kamwi told Parliament. "We will continue to monitor the
situation in Windhoek and the rest of the country, especially at
Engela in north-central Namibia, Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Region,
and the Walvis Bay district where cases of meningitis were reported,"
Kamwi added. He urged the nation to be conscious of hygiene and to
wash hands frequently to prevent infections.

Last week's [week of 20 Sep 2010] vaccinations in Katutura reached 171
843 people. So far 43 suspected cases have been reported in Namibia of
which 21 were confirmed to be meningococcal meningitis. To date 5
people have died during this outbreak.

Meningitis is a serious infection of the lining that surrounds the
brain and the spinal cord. It is spread from person to person through
droplets of the respiratory or throat secretions. Close contact or
living in close contact with an infected person facilitates the spread
of this disease. The symptoms are a stiff neck, high fever, headaches,
vomiting, sensitivity to light, and confusion.

[Namibia is not in the meningitis belt in Africa; see the prior
ProMED-mail post archive number 20100426.1343 for a discussion of
meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt. Although
prior outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in Namibia, reported by
ProMED-mail in 2000 and 2007, occurred in the northern regions of this
country, the current outbreak is occurring in north and central
regions of Namibia, according to the news release above. More specific
information about the serogroup(s) of meningococcus responsible would
be appreciated.

Namibia, located in southwestern Africa, is bordered on the north by
Angola and Zambia, on the south by South Africa, on the east mainly by
Botswana, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Its capital and
largest city is Windhoek, located in central Namibia. The population
of Windhoek is about 350 000 people and more than 200 000 of them live
in the northern area of Windhoek called Katutura
(<http://www.phillipmartin.info/webpage/travel/africa/text_namibia_katutura.htm>). In Katutura unemployment is high and a majority of the population lives in poor conditions. Walvis bay is a port located halfway down the Atlantic coast of Namibia. Caprivi region is a heavily tropical area located in northeastern Namibia and Engela is located in north-central Namibia, near the border with
Angola.
