A rash of summer influenza outbreaks at San Antonio's Lackland Air Force
base has sent 20 members of a
unit at the Defense Language Institute to the hospital. Another 145 have
been confined to quarters. George Kelling at Wilford Hall Hospital at
Lackland, says most of the members of the 'E' Company are from Puerto Rico.
They are studying English at the Institute before undergoing basic
training. Kelling says the rest of Lackland and the city is not at risk,
but Wilford Hall is preparing to receive additional patients if necessary.

[Summer outbreaks of influenza in the continental United States are not
usual, but do occasionally occur. Undoubtedly the concentration of
susceptible persons in close quarters (e.g., military barracks) provides a
fertile field for transmission when the occasional introduction of an
influenza virus occurs. In recent years, the U.S military has attempted to
enforce universal influenza vaccination, with variable success. In any
case, this outbreak has occurred in the summer when immunity from the prior
year's vaccine would have declined substantially. The history of influenza
epidemics in U.S. military barracks has been well documented, especially
during the 1918-1919 pandemic, at the beginning of which the U.S. was
gearing up for the World War, when many young volunteers from the
countryside were herded together in crowded training camps in the Southern
States. - Mod.DM
