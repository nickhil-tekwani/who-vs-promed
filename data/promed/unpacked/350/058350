There have been 2 new confirmed cases of anthrax on 2 additional premises in Logan County. The new cases are located [on 2 ranches] adjacent to the original case announced on 8 Aug 2012. No other livestock on the newly affected properties are showing clinical signs of the disease. Adjacent ranchers have been notified.

"This is not an uncommon occurrence with anthrax because adjacent properties may also contain the anthrax spores in the soil [sic]; we certainly hoped there wouldn't be other herds affected, but this is the nature of the disease," said state veterinarian Dr Keith Roehr. "We will expand our efforts onto the adjacent premises to protect the health of these cattle. At this time, all of the neighboring herds have been vaccinated for anthrax, and affected herds are being treated."

Anthrax vaccination is an important tool in preventing disease, although full protective immunity is not achieved until 7-10 days after a 2nd booster dose is administered. [Commonly, deaths cease by the 8th day after vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]

While the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) continues to monitor and remediate the situation with the livestock owners, the Northeast Colorado Health Department (CDHD) is performing its own public health investigation, ensuring that anyone at risk for a possible exposure to anthrax receives treatment.

NCHD has also been working with the Solid Waste Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and CDA to ensure proper disposal of the animal carcasses. All of the initially infected carcasses have been incinerated; incineration kills anthrax spores and is the best means of disposal of the carcasses.

"At this point, we really don't anticipate any health threat for the residents in northeast Colorado in regards to anthrax or from the smoke or plume from the incineration of the carcasses," said Dr. Cappello, the district public health administrator for the Northeast Colorado Health Department. "Anthrax is not spread person to person, and anyone that has not had direct contact with infected cattle is not at risk of illness. We will continue to monitor the situation and follow up with those individuals that have been exposed through contact, but at this point, there has been no human illness associated with this outbreak in cattle."

For information related to the human health risks of anthrax, contact NCHD at (970) 522-3741. For information related to livestock information, contact CDA at (303) 239-4161.

[Spores being omnipresent in the soil is a damn fool idea that originated way back in the 1960s at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, it takes a lot of effort and no small amount of luck to find _Bacillus anthracis_ spores in soil. They are not immortal. You will only find them where some animal died or was buried, or in relation to buried industrial waste (hides, hair, wool). They just don't spring up out of the soil and bite the next cow that comes by. Plus spores only survive in alkaline calcium rich soils. In acid soils, they are dead in about 14 months.

Almost certainly, these new cases are the result of biting flies that have fed on the index ranch and were looking for a fresh blood meal in the cattle in the adjoining ranches, and thanks to having contaminated mouthparts, voila! Hopefully, the surrounding herds have finished getting their stock vaccinated.

How this large number of cases was initiated is a matter of conjecture until the local investigations have been completed. A suspicion would be that there had been sporadic cases, but the rancher had just dumped the carcasses somewhere convenient, a piece of scrub, a gully, whatever. This was a problem we saw year after year in Louisiana in the past, and the farmers wondered why the disease kept reappearing.

Effective anthrax control is made up of 2 important parts: the proper disposal of carcasses so as to have no residual ground contamination, and proactive regular vaccination. And the nice thing about anthrax control is that if you do it right, you will have eradicated the disease in 5-10 years, depending on how bad it was to start with. - Mod.MHJ
