A northeast North Dakota woman has died after falling ill to a rare disease that's spread by infected rodent droppings, urine and saliva, the state Department of Health said Monday, 27 Aug [2018].

The unidentified adult woman fell ill to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS]. People can develop [an infection leading to] HPS by breathing air that's contaminated with the virus when fresh rodent droppings, urine or nesting materials are disturbed, but it's not transmitted from person to person.

The woman had possible contact with rodent urine or droppings or rodents in the environment, according to a news release. She was not named in a news release nor was her city of residence.

"People need to be mindful of the presence or evidence of wild rodents or rodent nests when conducting clean-up activities in a house, barn or other buildings, especially in rural areas," Jill Baber, epidemiologist for the department, said in a statement. "It is important to avoid actions that stir up dust, such as sweeping or vacuuming, if signs of rodents are present."

The state Department of Health has only received 16 reported cases of HPS since 1993, and 8 of them were fatal. The last reported case was in 2016.

Early symptoms include fever, muscle and body aches, fatigue, headache, dizziness, chills, nausea and vomiting. The illness progresses in a few days to include coughing and severe shortness of breath.

[Although this is the 1st case of a hantavirus infection in North Dakota this year (2018), a previous case of a hantavirus infection was posted on ProMED-mail in 2016.

The report above indicates that the woman was present in several settings where her Sin Nombre hantavirus might have been acquired.

The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the source URL above (2nd image). - Mod.TY
