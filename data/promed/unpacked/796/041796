5 NU Medical Students In Hospital With Meningitis
--------------------------------------------------
Rare Strain Of Disease Linked To Jamaican Trip
By Tom McCann
Tribune Staff Writer
Five Northwestern University medical students have been hospitalized this
week after they contracted a non-contagious form of meningitis, probably
from a parasitic worm, while vacationing in Jamaica on spring break.
The particular strain [type of meningitis -DS of the disease--eosinophilic
meningitis---cannot spread from human to human like its viral and bacterial
counterparts, and the painful headaches usually subside within weeks.
Although doctors at Northwestern expect all of the medical students to
recover fully, severe cases can be fatal.
"We are concerned about a few of [the students because they really are
quite sick," said Dr. Stuart Johnson, an infectious disease specialist at
Northwestern who is counseling the students. "It's extremely rare, but
right now we have to treat this as a possibly deadly disease."
Experts at Northwestern said the cases represent the first time in 10 years
that they have encountered this type of parasite in Chicago.
The students are believed to have come in contact with the food-borne
parasite, commonly called the rat lungworm, while traveling through Jamaica
two weeks ago.
Out of the 22 first-year medical students and their friends who took the
trip, seven began complaining late last week of unremitting headaches,
stiff necks and alternating numbness and tingling sensations in their limbs.
Five students remain in bed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, while two
others not yet examined have begun to come down with symptoms.
The worm, a native of Southeast Asia but steadily spreading throughout the
globe, is the prime cause of the disease. It develops within the lungs of a
rat but can be transmitted to humans through raw vegetables that come in
contact with its larvae or uncooked snails that feed on rat droppings.
After being ingested, the larvae settle along the thin covering of the
brain and in the spinal column [the meninges, where the body's immune
system attacks and kills them after about two weeks. But in the rare
instances where too much of the parasite has been eaten, the disease can
kill the host, said Dr. Thomas Simpson, a professor of international
medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
The Chicago Department of Public Health is investigating the source of the
meningitis and will take blood samples of all the students who took the
trip [presumably for serologic testing -DS. But several of those infected
have narrowed in on a Caesar salad they all shared one night at an
expensive restaurant in Montego Bay, the only place where the students were
all together.
Although still rare in this hemisphere, several cases of the meningitis
have been reported in Hawaii, Cuba and Puerto Rico, and a group of infected
rats was discovered in New Orleans in the 1980s, presumably taken there in
the hulls of shipping vessels, said Sue Partridge, a public health
specialist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The students' bout with the disease highlights the danger of eating
improperly prepared food while traveling abroad.
"Travelers are still pretty ignorant of the situation," Partridge said.
"But they have to realize they're taking a big risk when eating in some
countries. Not every place has the same health codes as the U.S."
Meanwhile, the students are enduring the headaches, waiting for the worm
larvae to be flushed out of their central nervous systems.

[The rat lungworm is the _Angiostrongylus (Parastrongylus) cantonensis_ , a
nematode. Disease is endemic in Hawaii, many other Pacific islands, South
East Asia (Vietnam, Thailand), the Western Pacific region (Malaysia, China,
Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines) and Cuba. Disease is most commonly
characterized by severe headache, neck and back stiffness and paresthesias.
Bell's palsy (transient facial paralysis) occurs in 5 percent of patients.
Low-grade fever may be present. The worm has been found in the CSF and the
eye. CSF (Cerebrospinal fluid) usually has a pleocytosis with 25-100
percent eosinophils; blood eosinophilia is not always present. Illness may
last a few days to several months.
The disease is transmitted through the ingestion of raw or insufficiently
cooked snails, slugs or land planarians, which are intermediate or
transport hosts harboring infective larvae. Prawns, fish and land crabs
that have ingested snails or slugs may also transport the infective larvae.
Lettuce and other leafy vegetables contaminated by small molluscs may serve
as a source of infection. The molluscs are infected by first-stage larvae
excreted by an infected rodent. In the rat, the larvae migrate to the brain
and mature to the adult stage; the young adults migrate to the surface of
the brain and through the venous system to reach their final site in the
pulmonary arteries. After mating, eggs deposited by female worms hatch in
terminal branches of the pulmonary arteries, the first-stage larvae enter
the bronchial system and pass up the trachea, are swallowed and passed in
the feces. In people, the cycle rarely goes beyond the CNS stage.

In a review article by Pien and Pien (Pien FD, Pien BC. _Angiostrongylus
cantonensis_ eosinophilic meningitis., Int J Infect Dis 1999 Spring;
3(3):161-3) there is mention of spread of the disease from Southeast Asia
to the South Pacific, Africa, India, the Caribbean, and recently to
Australia and North America, mainly carried by cargo ship rats. - MPP
[ProMED-mail extends its thanks to Dr. Pollack, a frequent contributor of
posts to ProMED-mail. It will be of interest to see if the clinical
diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis is confirmed. There are a number of other
causes of eosinophilic meningitis, but it would be hard to make them fit
this epidemiologic picture. - Man. Ed. DS
