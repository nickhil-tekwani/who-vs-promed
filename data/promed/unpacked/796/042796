An outbreak of brucellosis at the Veterinary School of the Asunción University in Paraguay, FCV-UNA [San Lorenzo, Gran Asunción], has cost the academic center its international certification, and has become a shameful experience for a country which is among the top world beef exporters. The National Agency for High Education Assessment and Credits reported in a release that the Mercosur certification, ARCU-Sur, of the Asunción University Veterinary School had been suspended. The sanction stands until the school has implemented the effective and efficient biosecurity mechanisms of the practical components in grass root work, and academic tests.

The release adds that once the academic year begins next February 2018, the agency will visit the Veterinary School and reconsider the certification. The process will count with the coordination of the Asunción University, which has been supportive all along.

This is the 1st time such a drastic action has been implemented in one of Mercosur member and associate countries, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, particularly since the 1st outbreak was first reported last October 2017 when a student and a professor reported positive to brucellosis. This followed what is believed to be contagion from a goat flock at the Veterinary School which subsequently were diagnosed positive.

It is believed that one of the persons who developed brucellosis died in late December 2017. This triggered the immediate removal of the Veterinary School dean Azucena Cabrera.

For Mercosur, and particularly Paraguay, an outbreak of brucellosis is extremely serious since the region is the world's main producer of beef and Paraguay is among the top 10 exporters, with an annual overseas sales of USD 1.7 billion dollars.

[It remains unclear how many of the diagnosed and suspected cases of brucellosis had symptoms consistent with clinical brucellosis and how many were asymptomatic but had positive brucellosis serology in this outbreak of _Brucella melitensis_ infection. The last ProMED-mail post noted 15 documented cases under treatment but did not note the fatality. It is not known how the fatal case was exposed to the goats and if the case was a student, a faculty member, or otherwise.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.

The City of Asunción, Ciudad de Asunción (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunción), is an autonomous capital district, not a part of any department. The metropolitan area, called Gran Asunción, includes the cities of San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Lambaré, Luque, Mariano Roque Alonso, Ñemby, San Antonio, Limpio, Capiatá, and Villa Elisa, which are part of the Central Department. The Asunción metropolitan area has around 2 million inhabitants. - Mod.LL]
