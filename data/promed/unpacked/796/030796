"MOSQUITO BITE"
>From January, those caught breeding them will be taken to court
There's at least one New Year's resolution Government is serious
about: as of January [2000, anyone caught with mosquitoes
breeding on their premises will be prosecuted.
Chief Environmental Health Officer David Watson said officials
had done all in their power to persuade people to stamp out
mosquito breeding sites, especially [those of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito which spreads dengue fever, and the time to act was now.
He said there had been much publicity in the media as well as one-
on-one talks with householders, but there continued to be "frivolous
excuses" as the mosquitoes bred without hindrance in some places.
"I am satisfied that we have done everything possible, and I am
sure that there is no one in Barbados who does not know about
dengue, and I am directing my principal environmental health
officers to start prosecution by Monday, January 3. There is no
turning back," he told the DAILY NATION.
The first week of January will see environmental health officers
(formerly known as health inspectors) converging on residential
areas, inspecting each home.
The first areas to be targeted will be those found to have high rates
of mosquito breeding and those where households were served
with mosquito nuisance notices.
Watson explained that whenever inspections are done, the name
of the head of the household will be recorded, and it is this person
who will be charged if a single mosquito larva is found on the
premises from January 3 [2000.
"I put dengue fever in the same light as AIDS because persons
who have mosquitoes breeding on their premises are not only a
danger to themselves but to everyone around them," he said.
Upon conviction, penalties range from $5000 [Barbados dollars or
three months in jail, or both, to a fine of $200 [Barbados dollars
per day for each day the offence continues.

[Thanks to Marco for this. It is good to see a country taking dengue
control seriously. Spraying against mosquitoes can only reduce the
problem; destroying breeding places around & inside houses eliminates
it. Cuba has done that more than once; but vigilance must be
maintained against reimportation of the mosquito. - Mod.JW
