Sri Lanka's health authorities Monday issued a cholera warning and
cautioned the public to take all necessary steps to prevent an island-wide
epidemic. The authorities said the incidence of cholera had reached an
alarming level in Polonnaruwa District in North Central Province and
Puttalam District in North Western Province and there is the possibility of
a spillover to other areas with the onset of the monsoon rains.
At least 10 persons have died of cholera so far and scores of others are
being treated at hospitals in the two regions. It is reported that more
than 100 suspected cholera cases were under medical attention and 31
positive cases had been identified and the patients had been admitted to
hospitals. Health officials have said proper drinking water and sanitary
facilities are of vital importance for curbing cholera. A health education
team and paramedical personnel have been despatched from Colombo to the
affected areas to help bring the situation under control.
