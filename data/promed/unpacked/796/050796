The recent postings about
plague on ProMED-mail didn't address really well the issue of cats, plague,
and
risk of transmission to humans. As the former State Public Health
Veterinarian in New Mexico, and author of several papers on cats, plague,
and transmission to people, I was able to gain a lot of experience in this
area.
Whenever the risk of cats acquiring plague is mentioned, flea control is
always emphasized. Our studies in New Mexico indicated that cats probably
do not primarily acquire plague by the bite of a flea. In some unpublished
research we did, having seen fleas on your cat or lack of use of flea
control did not increase the probability of a cat getting plague, in
comparison to other cats in the household and neighborhood that did not
come down with the disease. Evidence in the infected cats of a flea bite,
such as an abscess on the leg or back, or bubo in those areas, was
relatively rare. In addition, the type of fleas that spread plague in the
western U.S. are rodent fleas, not cat fleas, and as such don't spend a
whole lot of time on cats compared to rodents.
Rather, the primary risk
factor was hunting behavior. This fits with the predominant symptom in cat
plague cases of submandibular lymphadenopathy (with those lymph nodes
draining the mouth/head area). Of course, we can't be sure whether the
cats are becoming infected by direct inoculation of the organism in the
infected rodents into the mouth, or by infected fleas from the rodents
biting the cat in the face while the cat is eating them. Lesions inside
the mouth and tongue, including abscesses, were also reported, perhaps
supporting the direct inoculation rather than flea bites to the face.
Thus, although flea control is important and should be recommended, in
regards to reducing cats getting plague, preventing hunting behavior is
more important, and of course, can be difficult to do with outdoor cats. I
believe the educational materials on plague need to emphasize the
importance, if you have an outdoor hunting cat, of prompt veterinary
diagnosis of any illness, including just the down and draggy febrile cat
(which could have septicemic plague), but particularly the cat with fever
and a bubo.
It's been decades since we've had person-to-person spread of
primary pneumonic plague in the U.S. Thus these days a person's primary
risk factor for developing primary pneumonic plague is from an undiagnosed
cat, whose symptoms have progressed far enough that it's pneumonic. This
rarely happens any more with people, who usually get hospitalized before
they develop plague pneumonia. The case count of people developing
pneumonic plague from cats, or from handling cats with draining plague
abscesses or buboes, keeps increasing, because of a lack of early diagnosis
of plague-infected cats.
People also can catch plague directly from their
clinically ill plague-infected dogs, which few people are aware of.
Fortunately, most dogs infected with plague develop subclinical infections,
but some clinical illnesses with the capability of being transmitted to
people have occurred .
I think these particular aspects too often are overlooked.

[This is an interesting discussion of a very practical matter and we
appreciate Dr. Eidson's taking time to send her thoughts and data to us. A
plague expert, to whom I am grateful, at CDC/Ft. Collins suggested to me
that flea control is recommended primarily to reduce the risk that hunting
cats will bring infectious fleas into their owners' homes, rather than as a
means to keep cats from getting plague. As Dr. Eidson points out, most
cats appear to acquire plague through ingesting infected rodents (these
conclusions come largely from studies she published in the Am J Vet Med).
Nevertheless, cats that explore rodent burrows, or kill and eat
flea-infested rodents, could serve as temporary hosts for these
ectoparasites and bring them into human habitations, etc., where they could
jump off and bite people - Mod CHC]
