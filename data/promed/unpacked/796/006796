The news of a possibly dangerous rodent virus prompted earlier questions on
ProMED-mail regarding how to deal with infection risk, especially with
hantaviruses, and what is the responsibility of a teacher when teaching
mammalogy classes, where work with small rodents has traditionally been a
common topic. I have dealt with this problem in Finland for some 20 years.
Also, many colleagues in Europe have contacted me on this problem,
especially after HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was found in North
America in 1993.
My simple advice is: be honest with the students, and there will be no real
problems.[* At the very beginning of the course I have usually given a
detailed lecture about rodent zoonoses, especially about nephropathia
epidemica (NE), caused by Puumala (PUU) hantavirus and transmitted by the
bank vole _Clethrionomys glareolus_. This rodent is the most common mammal
species in Finland and in many other parts of Europe. After receiving the
information, students can freely decide what to do with rodents. We have
not categorically quit all rodent work, because students like it. Usually
most students do not care very much and participate in field work.[** We
have face masks available, but they are not popular [*** among students.
We have, however, changed the live trapping training to _Microtus_ sp.
instead of _Clethrionomys_ sp. [**** I also emphasize that if any of the
students have problems with blood pressure, kidneys, heart etc., , they
should not do live trapping. In our Finnish experience, live trapping of
bank voles is the most certain way to be infected with PUU virus. Even
though we have about 1000 diagnosed human cases of NE yearly, it should be
remembered that only 20 - 25% of seropositive people have had an acute
disease, suggesting that most of infections are inapparent or too mild to
be diagnosed. [***** The 0.1% case fatality rate does not affect the
thinking of students; they regard such a risk as poor genetic luck and
compare that with driving a car, which is clearly more dangerous.
Being a mammalogist, and especially a rodent scientist, is, however, a
definite occupational risk (c.f. Clement's response). We studied the
seroprevalence to hantaviruses among European mammalogists at the Second
European Congress of Mammalogy (Southampton 1995) (Vapalahti et al 1995.
Hantavirus antibodies in European mammalogists. Lancet 345:1569). The mean
in Europe was 11% (all positive were PUU), [****** and there was a clear
gradient with increasing trend from south and west to east and north. This
distribution is parallel to the degree of population fluctuations of the
bank vole in Europe. In all main areas, the seroprevalence in mammalogists
was clearly higher than what is known for "normal" populations. That is,
in Finland the mean seroprevalence to PUU is 5%, but among professional
mammalogists it is 50%. The seroprevalence also increased with career
length in Finland; after 15 years, the curve balanced. In addition, based
on my personal knowledge of Finnish mammalogists, almost all who have been
live-trapping bank voles for research for more than 5 or 10 years, are
seropositive and many of them have had NE. The best way to get NE is the
common habit of rodent trappers to blow the vole out of the live trap.
[******* The rodent may resist leaving the trap while the trapper breaths
deeply in for the next blow and inhales all [that is on the dust
particles. [******** Personally I have contracted e.g. NE and pulmonary
tularemia this way.
I would emphasize that the information above deals only with PUU and the
bank vole in Europe. Dobrava hantavirus in the Balkans is much more
pathogenic (5-10% case fatality rate), and that problem must be treated in
a different way, not to speak about Sin Nombre and related viruses in the
Americas. Finally, an interesting comparison: PUU in Europe is much less
pathogenic than Sin Nombre virus and related viruses in North America, but
it seems, respectively, that PUU is much more easily transmitted from
rodents to humans than is Sin Nombre virus.

[The asterisks are mine. Responses, in order:
1. "My simple advice is: be honest with the students, and there will be no
real problems." -- Honesty does not eliminate problems.
2. "Usually most students do not care very much and participate in field
work." -- This is another reason they are called "students".
3. "We have face masks available, but they are not popular among students."
-- Safety devices and precautions should not be a choice for anyone.
4. "We have, however, changed the live trapping training to _Microtus_ sp.
instead of _Clethrionomys_ sp." -- Five hantaviruses have been isolated
from _Microtus_ sp. rodents, including two in Europe. None are recognized
pathogens, but that will be small consolation to the first person to
acquire a hantavirus infection from one of these critters.
5. "Even though we have about 1000 diagnosed human cases of NE yearly, it
should be remembered that only 20 - 25% of seropositive people have had an
acute disease, suggesting that most of infections are inapparent or too
mild to be diagnosed." -- The remainder are not inapparent or mild.
6. "The mean in Europe was 11% (all positive were PUU)" -- This is
impossible to have proven with single serum samples. The presence of
Dobrava and Hantaan viruses in Europe speak volumes for the necessity for
elevated safety precautions.
7. "The best way to get NE is the common habit of rodent trappers to blow
the vole out of the live trap. The rodent may resist leaving the trap
while the trapper breaths deeply in for the next blow and inhales all [that
is on the dust particles." -- Do not try this! I do not know what sort of
traps these people are using but we have no problem removing rodents from
traps; we shake them into a plastic, zip-lock bag containing a metal tea
strainer stuffed with anaesthetic-soaked gauze pads. I suggest the Finnish
government review field procedures used by its employees.
8. "Personally I have contracted e.g. NE and pulmonary tularemia this way."
-- Thanks, you have proven my point.
