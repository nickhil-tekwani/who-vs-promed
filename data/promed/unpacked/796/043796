Carmen Belen Lihaut Sequera, Coordinator of the National Council of Producers in [Veracruz] State, said, "Coconut production has fallen by 99 per cent, due to the lethal yellowing disease and a complete lack of replanting. [In] 2008 we started to see the disease, but since 2010 production began to disappear completely. We need to take care of the problems in Veracruz."

During 2013-2014, producers had planted 1700 hectares of coconut tolerant to lethal yellowing. More than 700 producers are affected by this crisis across the entire state, she said. "The Creole variety of the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico is dying, it is going to become extinct, and replanting them is urgent."

She also said that the producers of coconut had been forced to bring plants [that are] 85 per cent tolerant to the disease from certified nurseries of [the state of] Colima themselves. She urged the authorities to solve the problem of replanting the coconut trees.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae strains) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. LY-type diseases like Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) in Ghana, the "maladie de Kaincope" in Togo and Awka disease (lethal decline, LD) in Nigeria, previously included in the 16SrIV group, have been reclassified as the new group 16SrXXII (Nigerian coconut lethal decline (LDN) group, _Ca._ P. palmicola strains; see link below).

Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities.

Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids (ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643) is causing great concern.

In Mexico, two 16SrIV strains were reported in the common palm species _Sabal mexicana_ and _Pseudophoenix sargentii_ (ProMED-mail post 20110223.0592 and link below). A potential role of _S. mexicana_ as a permanent source of LY phytoplasma inoculum for coconut palms was suggested.
