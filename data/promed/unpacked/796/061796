Epidemic Malaria Transmission _ Armenia, 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------
The dissolution of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) has resulted in the
disruption of the health infrastructure in many of the republics, as
indicated in part by increases in infectious diseases that were previously
controlled (e.g., diphtheria, typhoid, and hepatitis A).
In 1994, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Armenia (1995 population: 3.5
million) detected the first locally acquired case of malaria since the
1940s; the number of imported cases (15) was approximately twice the annual
average during 1986-1989 (seven).
In 1995, although no locally acquired cases were reported, the number of
imported cases increased to 502. In 1996 and 1997, the total (locally
acquired and imported) number of reported cases of malaria was 347 and 841,
respectively. This report summarizes surveillance for malaria in Armenia
during 1996-1997.
MMWR Editorial Note: ... From 1945 to 1986, FSU-wide malaria eradication
efforts (including mosquito vector control, case detection and treatment,
and chemoprophylaxis) curtailed transmission in Armenia, one of the 15
Newly Independent States of the FSU. During 1988-1995, severe financial
constraints and the war with Azerbaijan contributed to cessation of
vector-control activities in Armenia (which had included the use of
mosquito-larvivorous fish [ _Gambusia affinis_ ], insecticide spraying, and
the reduction of mosquito breeding sites). These circumstances, combined
with an eroding health infrastructure, may have hindered new malaria cases
from being diagnosed, treated, and reported properly during this period.
Displaced persons returning from the war with Azerbaijan during the
cease-fire accounted for many of the imported cases in 1995; the resurgence
of locally transmitted malaria probably resulted from persons with imported
cases transmitting infection to the increased density of vectors.
The magnitude of the increase in malaria may be underestimated because
surveillance relied on clinical suspicion. Because few cases were seen
until recently, physicians may not have suspected malaria and submitted
blood smears for laboratory confirmation.
Efforts led by WHO are under way to institute ... control measures during
the next malaria season; additional control measures may be taken if
resources become available.
