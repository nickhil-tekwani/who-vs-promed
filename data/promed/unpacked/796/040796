Oral vaccination of wildlife against rabies has been one of the most
remarkable achievements in wildlife disease management. As a result of this
novel approach, large areas of Europe and North America have been freed of
terrestrial rabies.
However, as a wildlife biologist, I would like to point out that the fox
population has indeed increased in certain areas of Europe, as mentioned in
the posting 20050414.1074. However, it has also decreased in other areas. A
general 8-fold increase in fox numbers is an exaggeration and is not
supported by any scientific field data. [The cited posting said "has grown
as much as 8-fold", thus referring to the extreme, not to the average.
Significant increase in fox densities, even when restricted to limited
areas, might be of epidemiological significance.- Mod. AS].
Several commercial oral rabies vaccines for wildlife are available which
use the following rabies virus strains; SAD Berne, SAD B19, SAD P5/88,
Vnukovo, ERA, SAD VA1, SAG1, and SAG2. The latter 3 are so-called "escape
mutants" with 1 (SAG1, SAD VA1) or 2 (SAG2) substitutions at site 333 of
the viral glycoprotein. All these attenuated rabies vaccine viruses are
direct or indirect derivates from the original SAD-strain (Street Alabama
Dufferin) that was isolated from a rabid dog in Alabama in 1935.
Furthermore, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rabies
glycoprotein (V-RG) is also available as an oral rabies vaccine.
In other words, all commercial available oral rabies vaccines are live
virus vaccines and can therefore revert to virulence under field
conditions, as has been documented for the SAD Berne and ERA-strain
(Wandeler, 1988; Wandeler, 1994). There are documented differences in the
residual pathogenicity and immunogenicity between the different SAD-strains.
Although the recombinant V-RG cannot induce rabies, other safety issues are
involved with this vaccine, as has been demonstrated in the only known
serious human incidence associated with an oral rabies vaccine (Rupprecht
et al., 2001). The [information about] reversion to virulence of the German
vaccine as mentioned in the New Scientist article is misleading and
actually incorrect. [Though the issue might be debatable, ProMED-mail has
reservations about the said adjectives; see further commentary. - Mod.
AS]. A short description of this case can be found in the Rabies Bulletin
Europe (Vanek et al., 2004). First of all, there is no such thing as "the"
German vaccine; there are actually 3 licensed German vaccines (SAD B19, SAD
P5/88 and SAD VA1) from 2 different manufacturers. Although the Austrian
case is still under investigation, it was shown by different laboratories
that the virus strain isolated from the brain of the fox was a SAD-related
virus (as all live-modified oral rabies vaccines) but not identical with
the oral rabies vaccine virus distributed in the area (SAD P5/88).
The 3 suspected cases in Germany are nothing more than that; suspected
cases [see commentary]. The standard rabies diagnostic techniques to
identify [differentiate] field virus from vaccine virus (monoclonal
antibodies vs. PCR) have given contradictory results, and hopefully these
cases will be clarified in the near future.
The claim by Michel Aubert that the German vaccine is ineffective is
incorrect, considering that this vaccine virus (SAD B19) still is the most
widely used oral rabies vaccine in the world in terms of number of
countries and baits used (more than 100 million vaccine baits since 1983).
Several whole countries and huge areas in other countries that have used
this vaccine virus exclusively have already been free of terrestrial rabies
for many years (e.g. Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, eastern part of
Germany). Other countries will hopefully achieve this goal in the near
future (e.g. Austria, limited area in western part of Germany, Poland).
The vaccine virus used is just one of the many parameters influencing the
success of oral vaccination. The actual rabies situation, density of
settlements, and the fox population, together with the selected baiting
strategy, are some of the other major factors determining the outcome of
the vaccination campaigns.

[The observations of Dr Vos are informative and well-documented. It is
interesting to note that other attenuated rabies vaccines besides the
Vaccinia/antigen vector vaccine are still being used.
The New Scientist article presented Dr Aubert's claim that "the virus in
German vaccine sometimes reverts to the disease-causing form" as well as Dr
Muller's counterbalancing statement that "there have been only 3 suspected
cases in Germany in the past 5 years". In view of the central place given
to this (vaccine strain safety) issue in the current discussion, it seems
appropriate to present the original text from ref 2:

rabies in Carinthia, Austria: A case report; Rabies Bulletin Europe, Vol 28, 2.
<http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org/q2_2004/startq2_04.html>:
"On 31 May 2004, a young fox showing apathy and wasting was shot near the
village of Gallizien in the district of Volkermarkt, Carinthia. --- The
animal was handed in for routine rabies diagnosis at the Institute for
Veterinary Disease Control in Moedling, Austria. Initially the fluorescent
antibody test (FAT) of the brain sample showed a positive result. Therefore
additional diagnostic tests were carried out. RTCIT (rabies tissue culture
infection test) was performed on mouse neuroblastoma cells according to the
OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines with positive
result. Also the MIT (mouse inoculation test) confirmed this finding. ---
While a young fox (approximately 3 months old) was involved, it was deemed
highly unlikely that this animal had reached Gallizien from a
rabies-infected area on its own, especially because the nearest rabies foci
is over 75 km away (Croatia).
The fox brain sample together with the oral vaccine strain used during the
vaccination campaign in 2003/2004 were also analysed by means of RT-PCR
(reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) of the rabies virus
nucleoprotein gene yielding positive results. Subsequent sequencing of the
900 bp long PCR products showed that the virus strain from the rabid fox
was related very closely to the oral vaccine strain. For confirmation
complementary studies were initiated in close collaboration with the WHO
Collaborating Centres in Weybridge, Great Britain and Wusterhausen,
Germany. The present case showed that infection of a young fox with a live
rabies vaccine-like virus is possible. Nevertheless, in the light of the
intensive vaccination in this area during the last years the present case
may be considered as a rare event".
The said description does not refer to the relationship between the
causative rabies virus and SAD P5/88. Final results of the complementary
studies in the rabies reference labs in Weybridge and Wusterhausen will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
