----------------------------------------------------------------------
A few points have now been made about MRSA.
I can't give Dr. Rosenberg exact figures about MRSA in this hospital but we
now see 20+ new cases per month, three years ago it was perhaps a tenth of
that. The phage typing results we get are quite varied; there are one or
two predominant types but many are 'non-typable'. I know many other
hospitals in southern England are in a similar position to us. I get the
impression the staphylococcal reference lab. in London is getting swamped
with MRSA, a while back they sent round a circular asking hospitals to send
them in only in cases of particular importance (we now send in mainly just
bacteraemic isolates). A good rapid method for determining relatedness of
MRSAs is sorely needed.
If it is of interest to anyone, I looked at our
staph bacteraemias for last year and using equivalent 'patient episodes' got
an index of 10.9% risk of MRSA being associated with bacteraemia, 10.7% for
MSSA; MRSA appeared more invasive than MSSA only in intensive care patients.
My denominators were a bit fuzzy but I did try to exclude cases picked up by
screening.
I agree the British MRSA guidelines are very strict and I don't think
hospitals with any number of cases can use them - they'd shut down if they
did. I believe the next revision of the guidelines may be toned down. The
point is well made that there is no evidence any of this isolation business
does any good - it's all based on good intentions and gives one the feeling
of doing something about a situation. The year-on-year British public
health reports show an almost exponential increase in MRSA - it's difficult
to conceive how things could be worse if current efforts at containment were
abandoned all together. What exactly one should do about MRSA I don't know
either, but I do believe that our current approach makes things worse, not
better.
Junior doctors have a much lower threshold for treating a report of
MRSA than MSSA and this increases vancomycin usage with its attendant
problems. Anyone found MRSA positive (patient or staff) suffers predictable
disadvantages due to MRSA management - much more rarely due to MRSA itself.
I agree with what I believe Dr. Rosenberg is suggesting - a serious outbreak
should be treated as a serious outbreak whatever the causative microbe.
Sadly in the UK the relentless pursuit of MRSA now seems to have become a
matter of religious dogma.
I acknowledge Dr. Molitor's argument about the limited therapeutic options
for treating MRSA but I've not yet found a case where there was no
therapeutic option at all. Sure these reserve drugs are expensive, but if
we stopped wasting money on unproven containment rituals we'd have more
money for treating patients.
Dr. Lin describes problems with nursing homes refusing MRSA patients in
Singapore that are similar to those in Britain. Many nursing homes here are
independent and so can make their own rules, often with input from their
medical insurers. The government Department of Health recently published
guidelines for nursing homes on this subject that very much tried to
downplay the importance of MRSA. Interestingly, the committee that
formulated the guidelines was made up entirely of community physicians with
no imput from hospital MRSA experts (a wise move from some points of view).
I note Prof. Ransjv's comments about the (lack of) importance of nasal
carriage and MRSA. J. Hosp. Infect. 1990, 15, 137-142 suggests it may be
important in some situations.
(Could I ask Dr. Rosenberg to check the Romero-Viva reference? - I can't
find it.)
