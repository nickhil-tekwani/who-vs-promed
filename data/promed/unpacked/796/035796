New Caledonia: Dengue Virus Type 1 Outbreak
-------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2003, a total of 265 laboratory confirmed cases have
been reported, including more than 150 over the past two weeks. Most of the
patients were confirmed on early samples, showing a positive result for
dengue virus type 1 (DEN-1) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This
confirms the rapid spread of the outbreak, which now affects practically
all parts of the Northern and Southern Provinces (cases reported in 24 of
30 municipal districts, since 1 Jan 2003). In the Northern Province it can
be noted that the number of foci around the initial one of Poindimie has
increased and new ones are currently being described in the municipal
districts of Kaala-Gomen, Canala, Houailou, and Hienghene. In the Southern
Province, active transmission sites are beginning to emerge in Yate and
Thio. Around Noumea, the most affected zone is still the northern part of
Mont Dore suburb, but cases are now more frequently observed close to the
city centre. To date, Pines and Loyalty Islands seem to be still dengue free.

Australia: 16 Cairns residents test positive for dengue fever
-------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the far north of Queensland say that they have
confirmed two more cases of the potentially fatal dengue fever and have
another 60 possible cases on file. Queensland Health says 16 Cairns
residents have so far tested positive for the mosquitoborne disease during
the past two weeks. Tropical Public Health Unit director Jeffrey Hanna says
the situation is similar to the "outbreak" in 1998, which afflicted about
500 people, 100 of whom required hospital treatment.

Australia: concern about dengue hemorrhagic fever risk in Cairns suburbs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
North Queensland health authorities are working frantically to contain an
outbreak of dengue fever spreading like wildfire through Cairns. Confirmed
cases of the tropical mosquitoborne disease almost doubled to 30, and at
least 30 other cases are suspected, the Tropical Public Health Unit stated.
Of major concern is that people infected by a different strain [serotype?]
in a 1998 outbreak will be infected again, leaving them vulnerable to the
potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. The health unit's public health
physician Geoffrey Hanna said the current outbreak was confined to 2 Cairns
suburbs that were also badly affected five years ago. Efforts were focused
on stopping the disease spreading further afield.
"That's one of our major concerns - is it going to jump to another suburb,
is it going to jump to Townsville?" Dr Hanna said. "I think it's inevitable
we will have some spread. But the question is when and how extensive will
it be? We just can't predict that." The worst-case scenario would be if the
disease spread to Port Douglas and Mossman, about 70 km north of Cairns,
where 274 people contracted the disease in the 1998 outbreak.
In a bid to contain the outbreak, authorities are interviewing each patient
about where they have been and who they have had contact with. Response
teams then go to those areas, eliminating mosquito sites, spraying suspect
spots, and warning households. Residents and tourists have been urged to
wear repellent and use mosquito coils. Those already sick have been told to
stay home.

Australia: dengue fever cases in Cairns continue to increase
------------------------------------------------------------
Tropical Public Health Unit (TPHU) spokeswoman Rose Spencer today said that
more than 40 people have been diagnosed with the mosquitoborne disease in
the far north Queensland tourist city of Cairns. Another 40 people are
awaiting the results of tests. Ms Spencer stated that cases had been
confirmed in the city's northern beaches, including Palm Cove, indicating
that the disease had spread from the inner city. The Dengue Response Team
is trying to ensure the outbreak does not spread beyond the city by
inspecting and spraying households.
Dengue mosquitoes breed in backyards and are active during the day.
Households are being urged to empty any stagnant water containers. A Cairns
City Council spokesman said if people fail to heed official warnings to
clean up their backyards, they could be punished. "The state government can
impose fines or (the resident) can end up in court, so it's quite essential
that people take those directions seriously," he said.
The authorities fear 500 Cairns and Port Douglas residents who were
infected by a different dengue strain [serotype] in a 1998 outbreak could
be infected again. The second infection would leave them vulnerable to
[developing] potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. There are about 50
million to 100 million cases of dengue fever worldwide each year and
several hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Indonesia: West Java set for worst outbreak of dengue fever
-----------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of dengue fever claimed 19 lives in West Java in the month of
January [2003] alone, a health official in the provincial capital of
Bandung stated. The toll was compiled from 24 regencies and municipalities
in West Java, said Fatima Resmiyati, head of West Java's Health Office
Environmental Bureau. She said the death toll was almost certainly higher
than 19, as her office continued to seek data in the months after January.
Her office has recorded 417 cases of dengue fever.
Its spread had reached worrying levels, Fatima said, adding that the
regencies of Subang, Depok, Indramayu, and Cirebon had registered 12
deaths. She said the last outbreak, following a five-year cycle, occurred
in 1998, when dozens died. Fatima said most of the deaths were the result
of people seeking medical treatment too late. The death toll was highest
among the poor, those who were most reluctant to seek medical help, she
said, adding that her office planned to provide free treatment for the poor.
Health officials have also warned of an outbreak in Jakarta this year, with
443 cases but no deaths reported so far. In South Sulawesi dengue fever has
already killed 23 and required 546 others to be admitted to hospital this
year. Besides dengue fever, West Java is facing the similar but non-lethal
chikungunya disease, carried by _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes. Chikungunya
follows a 20 year cycle, which explains why most people are unfamiliar with
it. Fatima said the disease had so far affected 400 people in the province.
Its characteristic symptoms include pain in the joints or muscles and
fever. "Chikungunya is relatively [benign], it doesn't lead to death," she
said.
Efforts to fight both diseases are limited to fumigating, which may cause
the mosquitoes to become [resistent] to the chemicals. Health officials
urged the public to drain or cover water where both types of mosquitoes
breed. Health minister Achmad Sujudi has said that his Ministry needed Rp
1.6 trillion (around $180 million) to effectively exterminate the _Aedes
albopictus_ mosquito this year. The budget would cover 70 000 villages
across the country, and also include programs to eradicate other
communicable diseases like dengue fever, leprosy, malaria, and
tuberculosis, officials said.

Vietnam: dengue cases increasing in Mekong Delta
------------------------------------------------
The Vietnamese Health Ministry said today that 1701 people contracted
dengue in January and February in Vietnam, a 66 per cent increase over the
same period last year, and that 3 people died of the disease. Carlo Urbani,
a World Health Organization (WHO) vectorborne disease expert in Hanoi, said
it is "too early to say if this year will be the year when dengue reaches
epidemic proportions."
The last such epidemic was in 1998, when 234 866 people were infected and
383 died, according to WHO. Last year, 21 908 people were infected, down 23
per cent from 2001. Health experts say large dengue outbreaks tend to occur
every 5 years. The hardest hit provinces this year are in the southern
Mekong Delta region, where high humidity provides a good breeding ground
for mosquitoes that transmit dengue.

Malaysia: dengue virus type 3 appears in Malaysia
-------------------------------------------------
[The appearance of] a new strain [serotype] of dengue virus in Malaysia has
brought about a drastic increase in the disease, with 11 deaths so far this
year. Health minister Chua Jui Meng says that the new dengue virus type 3
(DEN-3) has affected a lot of people, as most Malaysians do not have
antibody to [this serotype]. The health minister has blamed the outbreak on
an increase in public apathy to ensuring clean surroundings and an
exceptionally heavy rainy season.
Malaysia recorded 11 394 dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases
last year, with a total of 57 deaths. Mr Chua stated that there have been
3410 dengue cases this year. He says Malaysia is among 100 countries in the
Asia Pacific region that have a dengue virus problem.
