Pomegranate exports hit all-time low
------------------------------------
Pomegranate exports from Karnataka have hit an all-time low of 1865
metric tonnes during 2008-09, a drop of 41 percent compared to the
previous fiscal year. The state, which had seen a peak export of 30
000 tonnes in 2004-05, has been witnessing drops in both production
and exports due to the attack of the devastating bacterial blight
disease (BBD) in all the growing areas of the state. Karnataka's
variety of pomegranate has been in high demand in the European and
West Asian markets.

The state's area under pomegranate plantation has declined
drastically from a peak of 14 000 hectares [34 600 acres] in 2004-05
to around 8000 hectares [approx 20 000 acres] in 2008-09 due to the
rampant spread of BBD. SV Hittalmani, Department of Horticulture,
said, "A large number of farmers have uprooted pomegranate plants in
the last five years."

Severe damage to the crop was noticed in 9 districts. The
horticulture department has identified some of the varieties that are
susceptible to the disease. Currently, they are implementing a 3-year
programme to weed out the disease. The National Horticulture Mission
(NHM) had recommended adoption of good management practices (GMP) to
fight the bacteria. "Stringent control measures have been taken by
active farmers in Koppal and Raichur districts, and the results are
encouraging," Hittalmani said.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot)
is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_punicae_. The main damage is observed on fruits, which develop black
spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. The
disease has become an increasingly serious threat for pomegranate
growers of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. For example in
2006/2007 in Maharashtra, oily spot was found to be the main disease
with 100 percent infection in some orchards.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit
and cuttings), mechanical means and wind-splashed rain. Disease
development and spread are favoured by cloudy weather and
intermittent rainfall, and heavy rains are thought to be a triggering
factor for epidemics. No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been
found to show any resistance to oily spot. Disease management
includes use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures, and
bactericidal sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the
latter may lead to rejection of exported fruit by some countries.

Another strain of the same species, _X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_,
causes citrus canker, a disease that poses a serious economic threat
to citrus industries worldwide.
