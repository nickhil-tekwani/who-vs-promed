At least 2 persons have died of Japanese encephalitis [virus
infection] in the past 2 days in Kanchanpur district in far-western
Nepal. The 2 died Friday [19 Aug 2011].

They were admitted in hospital on Friday [19 Aug 2011] and died while
undergoing treatment in Mahakali Zonal Hospital.

Although the government has started a campaign to eradicate Japanese
encephalitis from Nepal by vaccinating all against the disease, the
programme hasn't been able to address all. Dozens of people still die
of the disease contracted particularly through pigs and ducks.

In the same month [August 2011], one more death was reported. Hence,
the death toll has reached 3 in the district due to encephalitis.

One person from Dang died due to the same cause last month [July
2011], and over a dozen patients are undergoing treatment for the
disease at Bheri Zonal Hospital, Nepalgunj.

[Vaccination will certainly reduce the number of clinical cases in
humans. The proportion of the population immunized is not mentioned.
Meanwhile, avoidance of mosquito bites is the obvious preventive
measure. The virus circulates between birds transmitted by _Culex_
mosquitoes. Pigs are amplifying hosts.
