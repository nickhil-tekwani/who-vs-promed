A 20-year-old contracted tuberculosis from smoking a trendy hookah pipe, doctors have warned. The unidentified patient, from Sweden [Switzerland?], rushed to hospital after coughing up blood following 3 months of chest pains and a high fever. An X-ray and CT scan of the man's chest revealed the vicious bacterial infection had got into his lungs.

The patient was a regular hookah smoker and used the fruit-flavoured devices up to 5 times a week with friends. Medics believe he contracted TB from the mouthpiece of a hookah pipe, which is often passed around among friends during smoking sessions.

CT scan shows a cavern [cavity] in the left upper lobe, one of multiple throughout the lung.

They say the number of puffs inhaled from a hookah is 10 times higher than when smoking a cigarette because sessions can go on for hours in bars and lounges. This means users are exposed to a higher volume of harmful bacteria and susceptible to infections. The case was revealed in the European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine [1]. Writing in the journal, the scientists said doctors must be aware of the increased risk of hookah pipes as their popularity continues to surge. They say physicians must quiz patients about their hookah smoking habits if TB is suspected.

Up to 1/5th of young people in the US and Europe use the devices, as well as famous footballers and celebrities. Hookah is an ancient form of smoking in which charcoal-heated tobacco or non-tobacco based shisha smoke is passed through water before inhalation.

In August [2019], a University of California study found one draw of a hookah pipe had the equivalent amount of hazardous substances as an entire cigarette. They discovered the water actually creates ultrafine particles, which are able to reach the deepest parts of the lungs. Chemists analysed emissions during a typical waterpipe session using custom-built apparatus. The waterpipe produced a significantly larger amount of carbon monoxide (CO) compared to a cigarette, according to the findings published in the journal Aerosol Science and Technology. This is mainly due to the burning of charcoal to heat the tobacco or herbal mixture in its bowl. The dose of CO from a single waterpipe smoking session was equivalent to a dose of CO from 12 cigarettes, the authors wrote.

At the beginning of the 19th century, TB killed at least one in 7 people in England. But today -- thanks to improvements in health, faster diagnoses and effective antibiotics -- less than 6 per cent of those with TB are killed by the disease, with just under 4672 cases reported in the UK in 2018. Despite these improvements, in 2010 a report into TB in London and Britain as a whole found that the number of cases in the capital had risen by almost 50 per cent from 1999.

Professor Alimuddin Zumla of University College London attributed the rise to people living under "Victorian" conditions, with poor housing, inadequate ventilation and overcrowding in certain deprived areas of London. He also said the increase in TB cases was predominantly among people born outside Britain, but who appear to have been infected in the UK, rather than in their country of origin. Researchers in Wales said that of those infected with this disease in 2017, 55 per cent were born outside the UK. Although, 20 per cent had at least one of the following social risk factors: Being in prison; Alcoholism; IV drug use; [and] Poor housing or homelessness.

Abstract
-----------
"A 20-year-old Swiss male presented at the emergency department with acute onset of febrile temperatures and hemoptysis and a 3-month history of productive cough. An X-ray and CT scan of the chest, sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cultures for _Mycobacteria_ revealed pulmonary infection with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. None of the classical risk factors for tuberculosis were present, but the patient reported regularly smoking a water pipe. Water-pipe smoking poses a serious risk of _M. tuberculosis_ transmission."

The case report says that the Swiss patient had travelled to England, Spain and Dubai in the previous 2 years, but had no known exposure to tuberculosis; that he was HIV-negative; that he regularly smoked a water pipe (hookah) up to 5 days a week, usually together with the same 4 friends, but also in other settings; and that no other active tuberculosis cases were found through contact investigation (1).

Hookahs are water pipes that are used to smoke specially made tobacco that comes in different flavors, such as apple, mint, cherry, chocolate, coconut, licorice, cappuccino, and watermelon (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/tobacco_industry/hookahs/index.htm). The tobacco in hookahs is exposed to high heat from burning charcoal; the smoke is said to be at least as toxic as cigarette smoke and carries many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking.

Hookah smoking is typically done in groups, with the same mouthpiece passed from person to person, often at hookah cafes and bars. Shared mouthpieces and the heated, moist smoke have been cited to facilitate the spread of diseases, such as tuberculosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16513054) and viruses such as herpes simplex (https://www.lung.org/assets/documents/advocacy-archive/comments-hookah-oversight.pdf).

The authors of this case report think that use of a shared hookah was the likely source for their patient's TB infection. However, if this were the case, why weren't any of the patient's 4 friends with whom he regularly shared a hookah similarly infected. Transmission of tuberculosis is thought to usually require close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment, such as a household, homeless shelter or school. However, outbreaks of TB due to genetically linked TB strains among people who do not have anything in common other than living in the same neighborhood, using the same public facilities such as food markets, or frequenting the same cybercafes at a shopping mall have been described. See ProMED-mail posts Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore (03): (AMK) linked to 2012 cybercafe outbreak 20160622.4302632 and Tuberculosis - China: (SH) neighborhood transmission, residents, migrants 20180428.5771588. Perhaps the source for the Swiss patient's TB infection was a person with active TB, unknown to the investigators, who frequented the same hookah cafes in Switzerland or perhaps in one of the countries visited by their patient, but who did not share the same hookah with the patient.

A study by Yang and colleagues, which used genotyping of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates collected from patients in Shanghai to establish transmission patterns (ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, MDR - China: (Shanghai) primary, neighborhood outbreaks, 2009-2012 20161216.4702532), found that genomically clustered cases did not have anything in common other than living in the same neighborhood or using the same public facilities such as food markets. Only a small number of cases were traced to household contacts. This Shanghai MDR-TB outbreak was similar to an MDR-TB outbreak in Singapore, where a neighborhood outbreak was linked to use of cybercafes at a shopping mall (ProMED-mail Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore (03): (AMK) linked to 2012 cybercafe outbreak 20160622.4302632). - Mod.ML
