Officials from the Agriculture Ministry met with their Palestinian counterparts on Wednesday [28 Jan 2015] for an information exchange regarding ongoing avian flu cases, the ministry said, since "emerging diseases do not recognize borders."

Israeli and Palestinian delegates met at the ministry's offices in Beit Dagan [HaMerkaz District, Israel], where they discussed disease eradication and continued modes of cooperation. The delegates included representatives from the Agriculture Ministry and Health Ministry, as well as Palestinian Veterinary Services managers from Ramallah and Gaza.

Also attending the meeting were representatives of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] and of the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE], the ministry said.

At the same time as the meeting, a new case of 35 000 chickens infected with avian flu was identified at Moshav Beit-Halevi [HaMerkaz District], near Hadera, the Agriculture Ministry said.

Ministry officials ordered the birds' immediate culling and burial.

This contamination case was the latest of several that have impacted farms in northern-central Israel and in the Palestinian Authority in the past 2 weeks.

Other sites of infection this week included Kibbutz Magal -- a Menashe Regional Council community [Haifa district], just west of the Green Line -- and Binyamina-Givat Ada [Haifa District], according to a report that Dr. Nadav Galon, chief veterinarian at the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Services, submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health on Sunday [25 Jan 2015].

At Magal, 40 000 birds -- 10-week-old turkeys -- were deemed susceptible and 15 000 tested positive for avian flu, the report said.

About 5000 died from the disease, while 35 000 were culled, the data said.

The Binyamina-Givat Ada site, containing 36-week-old broiler chickens, had 17 000 susceptible animals, Galon's report stated. With 3500 of them testing positive, 1700 of the chickens died from the disease, while 15 300 were culled, he wrote.

At the end of last week, Agriculture Ministry workers completed culling operations at the country's 1st facility to show signs of avian flu this year [2015]: the Aviel turkey-fattening farm in Hadera.

Avian flu, or H5N1, is highly contagious among poultry.

The virus is zoonotic, meaning it could spread to humans. The 1st documented case in humans occurred in 1997, and it mainly circulates in southeast Asia and northeast Africa.

In addition to the cases recorded thus far in Israel proper, several West Bank Palestinian farms have encountered the virus in their poultry.

Affected birds were discovered and culled last week at the Siris poultry farm near Jenin [West Bank], and in Beit Amin [West Bank], south of Qalqelia.

Last week, the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria facilitated the transfer of 100 safety suits for those handling infected birds, and 1000 anti-viral Tamiflu pills for Palestinian farmers at risk of infection.

At Wednesday's meeting, the delegates discussed further modes of cooperation regarding the prevention, diagnosis and control of the disease -- with the goal of establishing an umbrella group for regional cooperation on containing the virus, the ministry said.

Following the identification of the new outbreak affecting a chicken farm in moshav Beit HaLevi, HaMerkaz (Hebrew for central) district, the Israeli Veterinary Services issued on Thu 29 Jan 2015 a detailed official list of all locations put under animal movement restrictions, underlining the ban upon transportation of poultry into and from them, including exports into the Palestinian territories.
