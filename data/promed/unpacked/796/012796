Influenza update 155
--------------------
Summary
-------
- Active influenza transmission continued in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with increasing activity in North America, northern China and several countries in Europe. A few countries in southern Europe and North Africa have peaked as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea.
- Most countries of the tropical zone reported low levels of influenza activity.
- The most commonly detected virus type or subtype throughout most of the temperate areas of northern hemisphere temperate zone has been influenza A(H3N2). In Mexico and Central America where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is the predominant subtype circulating; China and the surrounding countries which are still reporting a predominance of influenza type B virus.
- Antiviral resistance continues to be observed at very low levels and has not increased notably over levels reported in previous seasons.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Overall, influenza activity in the northern hemisphere is still increasing. In some countries, including the United States of America or the United Kingdom, the season appears mild in comparison to previous years. However, in other countries activity has reached levels similar or higher than previous years.

North America

In Canada, overall influenza activity continued to increase over the past few weeks. The national consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) increased from 31.3 to 38.6 consultations per 1000 in the last week of February and the proportion clinical specimens testing positive for influenza increased from 10.5 percent to 17.9 percent. Institutional outbreaks of influenza have also increased markedly in the last 2 weeks of February. In epidemiological week 9, there were 29 outbreaks reported including 13 in long term care facilities, 9 in schools, one in a hospital, and 6 in other settings. 160 influenza-associated pediatric hospitalizations have been reported this season, 69 percent of which were in children under age 5 years. 53 percent of these hospitalizations were associated with influenza A. There have been 226 adult influenza-associated hospitalizations this season, 47.8 percent of which were in patients aged > 65 years. ILI activity is similar in magnitude to previous years; the number of institutional outbreaks appears somewhat lower than in previous years at this point in the year. Influenza type B was reported in an increased proportion of positive specimens and accounted for 46.6 percent of all influenza viruses in epidemiological week compared to 36.5 percent of influenza viruses since the beginning of the season. Influenza A and B viruses were not evenly distributed by age; type B viruses were 50 percent of the influenza viruses detected in children under the age of 5 years in week 9 but only 29.3 percent of viruses in adults over the age of 65 years. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has accounted for 30.2 percent of influenza A viruses for which subtype information is available in children under the age of 5 years this season but only 8.1 percent in adults over the age of 65 years. Since the start of the season, of the 107 influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have been characterized, 94.4 percent were antigenically related to the virus in the current influenza vaccine (A/Perth/16/2009). Similarly, 98.9 percent of the 87 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized were antigenically similar to the A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus. Of the influenza type B viruses characterized, 55.3 percent were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 and 44.7 percent influenza B viruses were antigenically related to the reference virus B/Wisconsin/01/2010-like, which belongs to the Yamagata lineage. All viruses tested for antiviral resistance since the season began were susceptible to oseltamivir (451 tested) and zanamivir (450 tested).

In the United States of America (US), influenza activity is elevated in some areas but ILI remains relatively low nationally and accounts for only 2 percent of outpatient visits reported. The national seasonal threshold for ILI visits is 2.4 percent. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus increased from 18.4 percent to 21.3 percent. 3 states experienced high ILI activity (Alabama, Missouri, and Oklahoma), 2 states experienced moderate ILI activity (Illinois and Kansas), and all other states reported low or minimal activity. The number of states reporting widespread influenza activity increased from 6 to 9 states over the last reporting week. The proportion of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza reported in the 122 cities sentinel surveillance system remained below the national epidemic threshold. One influenza-associated paediatric death was reported associated with influenza A(H3) virus making a total of five deaths in children 18 years or younger this season. Of the 593 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated cases hospitalizations, 521 (87.9 percent) were influenza A, 61 (10.3 percent) were influenza B, and 1 (0.2 percent) was an influenza A and B co-infection. Among those with influenza A, 185 were A(H3N2) and 61 were A(H1N1)pdm09. The most commonly reported underlying medical conditions among adults hospitalized with influenza were chronic lung disease, metabolic disorders and obesity. The most common underlying medical conditions in children hospitalized with influenza were chronic lung diseases, asthma and neurologic disorders. 50 percent of children hospitalized with influenza had no identified underlying medical conditions. Influenza A viruses were the most commonly detected influenza viruses in most regions, accounting for 94.7 percent of influenza viruses in the 1st week of March. Influenza A(H3N2) accounts for 76.8 percent of the influenza A viruses for which subtyping was performed since the beginning of the season but has decreased slightly in proportion compared to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In the 1st week of March, A(H3N2) viruses were only 64.7 percent of influenza A viruses subtyped. Of the influenza viruses characterized antigenically so far this season, 78.4 percent of 407 influenza A(H3N2) and 98.4 percent of 127 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were related to viruses contained in the current seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. This represents a notable increase in the non-vaccine related influenza A(H3N2) virus detections. 36 of the 78 (46.2 percent) influenza B viruses characterized belong to the Victoria lineage of viruses and were characterized as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, the influenza B component of the 2011-2012 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. All except one the 439 influenza A and 79 influenza B viruses tested this season have been susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications oseltamivir and zanamivir. The one resistant virus was an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In Mexico, the proportion of samples positive for influenza decreased from about 30 percent to 25 percent at the beginning of March, which is the lowest since the start of the year. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was still the most commonly detected virus subtype.

Europe

In Europe, while much of the continent continued to report stable or increasing levels of respiratory disease activity, Albania, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain have now reported decreasing trends in ILI and ARI consultation rates. During the 1st week of March (epidemiological week 10) sentinel outpatient clinics collected 1708 respiratory specimens, of which 723 (42 percent) tested positive for influenza viruses, marking 2 consecutive weeks of decline from a peak of 46 percent. ILI consultation rates in most countries are below levels reported in the 2010/11 influenza season though this is not universal and some countries have exceeded last year's levels. Numbers of SARI cases reported are lower than the same period in the 2010/11 season but could rise with the continuation of this season. All-cause mortality reported by EuroMOMO (The European Mortality Monitoring Project) which was low earlier in the season increased in the past few weeks among the population > 65 years of age. Across Europe, 91 percent of laboratory confirmed influenza cases were influenza A and 9 percent were influenza B. Influenza A(H3N2) continued to be the most commonly detected influenza virus in circulation accounting for 98.8 percent of influenza A viruses subtyped since the beginning of the season. All of the influenza A viruses characterized since the beginning of the season were similar to the current vaccine viruses; 12 of 10 influenza B viruses tested were of the Yamagata lineage. None of the 245 viruses tested for antiviral sensitivity were resistant.

Northern Africa and eastern Mediterranean

Influenza activity in the northern Africa and eastern Mediterranean regions has already peaked at the beginning of the year and the number of positive influenza samples has been low for the past few weeks. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common subtype detected throughout the season, but there has been an increase in the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, which became the most common subtype in the last week.

Temperate countries of Asia

In northern China, the percentage of ILI visits reported by national sentinel hospitals has slightly increased since the previous week and is now above 3 percent but lower than the peak that occurred in January. Rates overall have been similar to last season. ILI rates in Mongolia increased, exceeding the national alert threshold. The proportion of pneumonia patients among hospitalized patients increased also sharply over the last 3 weeks and was higher than the peak of the 2010/11 season. In both countries, influenza B remains the predominant circulating influenza type. Influenza activity in Japan and the Republic of Korea indicates declining trends since peaking in January and February, respectively. Whereas influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant circulating virus during the season in Japan and the Republic of Korea, the proportion due to influenza B increased the last weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas

Country transmission of the tropical area of South America have reported low or undetectable levels of influenza

Sub-Saharan Africa

In sub-Saharan Africa, available data indicate little influenza activity in most countries.

Tropical Asia

Overall, influenza activity in tropical Asia is decreasing or low and influenza B remains the most commonly detected type.

In southern China, the percentage of ILI visits reported by national sentinel hospitals decreased slightly and is under 3 percent. Of 1173 specimens tested in week 9 in south China, 552 (47.1 percent) were positive for influenza. Most influenza virus transmission was associated with influenza B (71 percent of positive specimens); and 100 percent of subtyped influenza A viruses were influenza A(H3N2). In China, special administrative region Hong Kong, overall influenza activity seemed to have peaked in mid-February. Most influenza virus transmission was associated with influenza B (78 percent). Monitoring of influenza associated intensive care unit admissions or deaths among patients 18 years or above since 13 Jan 2012 counted 57 laboratory confirmed cases, 34 of which died.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The temperate areas of South America, Australia and New Zealand are seeing influenza activity at inter-seasonal levels.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

In summary: During weeks 8 and 9 in 2012, laboratory confirmed influenza activity continued to increase in many countries in the northern hemisphere. Influenza A(H3N2) remained the predominant virus subtype detected globally. In general, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was low. Influenza B virus activity increased in a number of countries and remained the main circulating virus type in China. In Europe, regional and widespread outbreaks of influenza A(H3N2) were reported with increasing co-circulation of influenza B in some countries. - Mod.CP]
