Re: Global Infectious Disease Surveillance, Response and Prevention Network
(GIDSRPN) proposal [see end of this post]:
WANTED: Advocates for Global Health
Senator Paul Simon once said "if there were just 10 people in every [US]
Congressional District...who really pushed on the [hunger] issue...we could
literally change the world". We are confident that informed and well
organized advocates can make major changes in US foreign policy regarding
international health and global disease control efforts. Changes that will
improve the lives of millions of people globally. We invite you to join
with us in making 'health for all' more than a noble slogan.
We in the USA can play a major role in ensuring that every man, woman and
child has at least the basic necessities required for good health: access to
primary health care, clean water, sanitation, education, adequate nutrition,
quality voluntary family planning, and adequate shelter. Most of these are
measurable and affordable goals agreed to by the USA and most other nations
at global summits during this decade. Given the increasing domestic threat
from infectious diseases, meeting these global humanitarian goals is a wise
"national security" goal as well as stimulating the economic health of every
nation.
NCIH will work with you in educating your colleagues, your community, and
your elected officials about the need for a sufficient global approach to
health. Please indicate below your level of participation as 'one of the
ten' in your Congressional District or as a Washington/Metro area activist.
___A Force of Ten: Consider me one of the ten people in my Congressional
District who will help in keeping my policy makers informed on international
health issues. (Writing letters, making calls and/or face to face meetings
as my time allows.)
___Adopt a Congressperson. There are 535 of "them"' and thousands of us.
If you live anywhere in the US or even in the nation's capital, NCIH
invites you to adopt one House or Senate policy maker to keep up-to-date on
international health issues. We will provide you with monthly updates by
e-mail or fax, along with talking points and related information. We want
to be assured that every House and Senate office gets at least one quality
contact on important issues. Beginning and maintaining a relationship with
a policy maker's key staff is one of the most powerful activities you take.
___Media Network: "Letter-to-the-Editor" writer. Educating the public and
policy makers via the print and broadcast media may be the most powerful
tool we have for reversing isolationist trends affecting the foreign policy
debate. Almost monthly there are issues relating to international health
that deserve more media attention or explanation. NCIH will provide you
with pre-written "letters-to-the-editor" you can adapt to your liking and
local interests for submission to your local newspaper.
___Congressional District Coordinator: I will volunteer with NCIH in
coordinating others in my Congressional District/local community to keep our
Members of Congress informed. Please send me more information regarding this
level of participation as an NCIH Congressional District Coordinator.
___State Coordinator: I will volunteer with NCIH in coordinating others in
my State who will keep our Senators and Congresspeople informed. Please send
me more information about this level of participation as an NCIH State
Coordinator.
___International Health Seminars: NCIH members and others committed to
progress in the "Health for All" agenda can host local forums to inform
their colleagues and the general public of the vital connections between
international health issues and the quality of life in our local
communities. If you are interested in taking a leadership role in hosting
a forum in your community NCIH can support you in that effort in a variety
of ways.
___In the Washington DC metro Area: I will volunteer at NCIH or from my
home to educate and influence the media and key policy makers directly or
assist NCIH staff in achieving other NCIH mission-related goals.
The Hill Corps: This DC based group of international health advocates takes
direct actions to influence policy makers and the local media.

___Phone Team of 57 volunteers ensures that every House or Senate office
gets at least one brief message whenever an action is needed. You can
take on a specific state ranging from small states with only two Senators
and one
Representative or a large state like California with 52 House offices.

___Briefing Team prepares and delivers face-to-face mini-briefings for key
House and Senate offices.
___Media team researches and writes response to coverage or lack of
coverage of international health issues in the Metro area and national
print media.
___Research and/or write brief or detailed position papers on local/global
health connections, issues or trends. These will be used in a variety of
ways in shifting isolationist thinking and influence policy making. Valuable
information is out there. Pulling it together in brief, clear and
understandable papers, paragraphs, or sound bites greatly empowers our
advocacy efforts.
Please send me information on:
__ "How to write a letter or fax a message to my Member of Congress"
__ "How to make a phone call to my Member of Congress"
__ "How to write a Letter-to-the-Editor"
__ "How to write an Op-Ed piece for a local Newspaper"
__ "How to set up a meeting with an Editorial Board of a local newspaper"
__ "How to set up and conduct a meeting with a Member of Congress"
__ House and Senate testimony on international health and development needs.
Below are some of the legislative initiatives NCIH may be working on.
[1] Authorization and Appropriation bills dealing with international health
and development issues.
[2] World Summit for Children Implementation Act 1997 (HR1427): Increases in
funding for Child Survival, nutrition, basic education, TB control, AIDS
education and family planning will be crucial in achieving the year 2000
goals established at the 1990 World Summit for Children:
1. A one third reduction in 'under-5-mortality rates'
2 Halving 1990 maternal mortality rates
3. Halving 1990 rates of malnutrition among the world's under-fives (to
include the elimination of micronutrient deficiencies, support for breast
feeding by all maternity units, and a reduction in the incidence of low
birth weight to less than 10%)
4. 90% immunization among under-ones, the eradication of polio, the
elimination of neonatal tetanus, 90% reduction in measles cases, and 95%
reduction in measles deaths.
5. Halving of child deaths caused by diarrhoeal diseases.
6. One third reduction in child deaths from acute respiratory infections.
7. Basic education for all children and completion of primary education by
at least 80% -girls as well as boys.
8. Safe water and sanitation for all communities
9. Acceptance by all countries of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, including improved protection for children in especially difficult
circumstances.
10. Universal access to high-quality voluntary family planning information
and services in order to prevent pregnancies that are too early, too
closely spaced, too late or too many.
[3] Global Infectious Disease Surveillance, Response and Prevention Network
(GIDSRPN) proposal: NCIH is developing a proposal to fund the establishment
of a global network of adequately staffed and supplied health posts in every
nation. These health posts would be capable of providing most of humanity
with the disease surveillance, control and prevention capacity needed to
stem most of the world's suffering from infectious diseases as we enter the
next millennium. As a matter of dignity and human security, no one should
be denied affordable access to the most basic of human health needs.
Ideally these Health posts will be able to notify responsive authorities on
the outbreak of any new or existing pathogens as well as receive the most
recent information on treatment, prevention and improving public health.
