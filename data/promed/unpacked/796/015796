Agriculture ministry officials in Kenya are pointing an accusing
finger at Uganda as the origin of the banana wilt disease that has
attacked the country's Teso District.
The new district commissioner, Johnstone Mwirigi, sounded the [alarm]
on Friday [23 Mar 2007] during an agricultural field day at Ikapolok,
near Malaba [the province capital]. He said the outbreak was of great
concern as it threatened to spread to the neighbouring districts of
Busia, Bungoma, and Mt. Elgon.
Amagoro, Amukura, and Chakol divisions were the most hit with more
than 50 percent infection. Only Angurai division is safe, Mwirigi
added.
With the situation getting out of control, the Kenya government has
ordered the inspection of all materials coming from Uganda to curb
the disease, which affects banana roots.
The agriculture ministry secretary, Simon Songa, said they would work
with the Ugandan government and other stakeholders to combat the
spread of the disease. "We cannot allow this scenario to persist. We
shall ensure it is managed once and for all," said Songa [during an
address to] Teso residents, including the area Member of Parliament,
Sospeter Ojaamong.

[Unfortunately, this is not surprising. It is very difficult to limit
intra-continental spread of plant pathogens. Some success can be
hoped for only when extremely strict biosecurity measures are taken
very early on in an outbreak in both the diseased area and any
adjacent still unaffected areas. Among these measures are large scale
eradication measures, strict isolation procedures -- including a
strictly enforced total import embargo on all material derived from
the reported and any other potential hosts, good surveillance, and an
efficient eradication task force. In this instance, such measures
would hardly have been feasible due to the likely lack of the
required facilities and funds. In any case limited success could have
been expected, at best, since the outbreak was spotted late, the
countries share a very long land border, banana is a staple crop,
which would make eradication of plants largely impossible, and
_Fusarium_ may be endemic in the region.
Teso is an administrative district in the Western Province of Kenya.
