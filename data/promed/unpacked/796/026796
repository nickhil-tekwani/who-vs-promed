[1] WHO update

Summary:
- Influenza activity across the northern temperate regions have continued to decline to near inter-seasonal levels in much of North America, Europe, and northern Asia, though low level persistent transmission was still noted in many countries.

- The persistence of transmission in the northern hemisphere temperate regions has been associated with increasing numbers of influenza type B virus appearing late in the season in a number of countries of North America and Europe. Prior to this, influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus in North America, A(H1N1)pdm09 in Europe, and both in varying proportions in different countries of northern Asia.

- Low levels of influenza activity continued to be reported across the tropical regions of the world, and activity in countries of the southern hemisphere remained at inter-seasonal levels.

- Nearly all influenza A viruses characterized this season [2012-2013] have been antigenically related to those contained in the current trivalent vaccine. Among the B viruses characterized, those that were of the Yamagata lineage were antigenically related to the viruses recommended for the trivalent vaccine, but a sizable number of B viruses were also of the Victoria lineage. Only very low numbers of oseltamivir and zanamivir resistant viruses have been detected.

- In China, new cases of H7N9 have been reported with over 100 cases to date.

- A summary review of the Northern Hemisphere influenza season will be published in the World Epidemiological Report on 31 May 2013.

[2] EuroFlu Bulletin

Summary, week 16/2013: Recent declines in clinical indicators have been observed in nearly all countries in the WHO European Region, and influenza activity is now below seasonal thresholds in most. The percentage of sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) specimens testing positive for influenza, and the circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 relative to influenza B, have also declined during recent weeks.

Virological surveillance for influenza:
During week 16/2013, 1360 specimens tested positive for influenza, with 770 (57 percent) positive for influenza B, similar to week 15/2013 (Fig. 1). Among total weekly influenza detections (sentinel and non-sentinel), the proportion of influenza A viruses in relation to influenza B has gradually decreased since week 03/2013, when type A viruses represented 76 percent of influenza detections.

Among 327 influenza A viruses that were subtyped during week 16/2013, 109 (33 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 218 (67 percent) influenza A(H3N2) (Fig. 2a). Since the beginning of the season (week 40/2012), 93 840 influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been detected and typed. Cumulatively, 59 055 viruses (63 percent) were influenza A, and 34 785 (37 percent) influenza B (Fig. 2b). Cumulatively, influenza A has been the most commonly detected virus since week 47/2012. Of the 37 992 influenza A viruses that have been subtyped, 25 397 (67 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09, and 12 595 (33 percent) were A(H3N2).

In addition, the lineage for 5689 influenza B viruses has been determined: 5212 (92 percent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 477 (8 percent) to B/Victoria.

The circulation of influenza viruses remained diverse across the region, with most countries reporting influenza B as the dominant virus. Only Ireland, Kyrgyzstan and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland) reported dominance of influenza A; Switzerland and Ukraine reported co-circulation of influenza A and B (Map 1).

Virus strain characterizations:
For the 2012/2013 northern hemisphere influenza season, WHO recommends inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (from the B/Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines (see more at the WHO headquarters web site).
