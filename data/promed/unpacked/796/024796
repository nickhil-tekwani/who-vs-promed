WEST NILE VIRUS, RAPTORS - USA (04)

I am writing to correct an error I made in my reply posted to ProMED-mail
several days ago re: West Nile Virus in raptors [see: West Nile virus,
raptors - USA (03) 20020928.5421], as well as to modify the general tone of
my post slightly. The error made was in referring to Mr Ward Stone of the
New York Pathology unit as a veterinarian; he is the state wildlife
pathologist, but not a veterinarian or veterinary pathologist.
I also wish to make it clear that I personally do not believe that
pesticides are necessarily the cause of the recent supposed increase in
raptor mortalities in the north east, any more than I believe that West
Nile virus is necessarily the cause. What I believe is that we should label
wildlife diseases with definite labels when we have definite diagnoses from
the veterinarians and veterinary laboratories examining them. Until then,
we should make it clear that, while we might have strong evidence to
believe that we have a diagnosis, we should label that diagnosis as being
presumptive, not definitive. My chief concern is that policy makers use
these reports to make decisions about taking action. Because some of these
actions (for example, widespread application of mosquito control chemicals)
might be having potential side effects, we ought to be certain of our facts.
