Indonesia hit by tetanus outbreak
----------------------------------
A tetanus outbreak is killing Indonesians who survived last week's
tsunamis, as many had not been immunized against the potentially fatal
infection, a South African humanitarian organisation said on Wed, 5 Jan 2005.
"There is a full-blown outbreak and people have started to die," said
Global Relief spokesperson Murray Louw in a statement.
The organization said 12 of their volunteers, including doctors, nurses,
engineers and search and rescue personnel, arrived in Indonesia's Banda
Aceh on Sun, 2 Jan 2005, near the epicentre of the earthquake which caused
the tsunamis.
Louw said tetanus can infect even minor cuts and scratches. Symptoms of
the infection include muscle rigidity and spasms, particularly of the face
and jaw, hence its common name, lockjaw.
Global Relief is to send another team to Indonesia while other teams are to
leave South Africa for Sri Lanka and India in the coming weeks.

[The scope of this reported outbreak is not stated, and ProMED would
appreciate more information.
Indeed, it is not surprising that tetanus would occur after the tsunami,
given the number of injuries. Although the lay public tends to associate
tetanus with injuries such as stepping on a rusty nail, the injury itself
can be quite minor, and no signs of local infection or injury may be
present. The disease tetanus is an intoxication due to the elaboration of
tetanus toxoid by _Clostridium tetani_. Universal immunization with the
toxoid in early childhood will prevent the disease, and boosters are
recommended once per decade after the primary series. Postinjury
prophylaxis uses tetanus immunoglobulin and tetanus toxoid booster. In a
mass injury situation, this is difficult to accomplish. - Mod.LL]
