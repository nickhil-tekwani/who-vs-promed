Pingtung county in southern Taiwan is an important onion-producing area. The area has been affected by extreme weather and intensive winter rainfall. Diseases have recently been found in some fields. A survey of agricultural damage detected an outbreak of onion anthracnose. There were similar cases in 2021. Farmers are worried about the weather fluctuations causing the bulbs to rot and increasing yield losses.

The regional Agricultural Committee was asked to promote disease prevention and control methods. Onions need a lot of water to develop their bulbs; this often leads to root damage, which causes leaf yellowing and wilting of plants. The bacterial disease soft rot mostly occurs during bulb maturation, post-harvest storage, and transport. Farmers are urged to increase field monitoring and use of approved agrochemicals early in the crop cycle.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.

Both fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_, _Colletotrichum_, _Gibberella_ species) and bacterial soft rot (_Dickeya_, _Pectobacterium_, Pseudomonas_ species) are mentioned in the translation as the cause of the problems above. It is not clear which of the diseases is present, or if perhaps both have been found. (For more information on these pathogens, refer to previous ProMED posts in the archives.)

A large number of fungal, bacterial, and nematode pathogens, as well as several viruses and phytoplasmas, are known to affect onion (_Allium cepa_) and related crops. Reliable diagnosis of the specific pathogen(s) involved is required for designing effective management strategies for any local situation.
