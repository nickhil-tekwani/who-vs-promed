https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-expands-eligibility-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-booster-dose-16-and-17


Today [9 Dec 2021], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, authorizing the use of a single booster dose for administration to individuals 16 and 17 years of age at least 6 months after completion of primary vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

"Vaccination and getting a booster when eligible, along with other preventive measures like masking and avoiding large crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, remain our most effective methods for fighting COVID-19," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, MD. "As people gather indoors with family and friends for the holidays, we can't let up on all the preventive public health measures that we have been taking during the pandemic. With both the delta and omicron variants continuing to spread, vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19."

On 19 Nov 2021, the FDA authorized the use of a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for administration to all individuals 18 years of age and older after completion of primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. Today's action expands the use of a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for administration to individuals 16 and 17 years of age at least 6 months after completion of a primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the FDA-approved Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA) are the only COVID-19 vaccines currently available for the 16- and 17-year-old age-group. Individuals who are 16 and 17 years of age should only receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or Comirnaty as their booster dose.

"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been available to individuals 16 years of age and older for nearly a year, and its benefits have been shown to clearly outweigh potential risks," said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Since we first authorized the vaccine, new evidence indicates that vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 is waning after the 2nd dose of the vaccine for all adults and for those in the 16- and 17-year-old age-group. A single booster dose of the vaccine for those vaccinated at least 6 months prior will help provide continued protection against COVID-19 in this and older age-groups."

The EUA for a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 16 and 17 years of age is based on the FDA's previous analysis of immune response data that supported use of a booster dose in individuals 18 years of age and older.

The FDA had analyzed the immune response data from approximately 200 participants, 18 through 55 years of age, who received a single booster dose approximately 6 months after their 2nd dose. The antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus one month after a booster dose of the vaccine, when compared to the response one month after the 2-dose primary series in the same individuals, demonstrated a booster response. The FDA's assessment of the effectiveness of a booster dose for individuals 16 and 17 years of age is based on these data. Based on the available data for individuals 18 and older regarding effectiveness, the FDA has concluded that these data support extending the eligible booster age population to 16- and 17-year-olds.

In the time since Pfizer initially submitted safety and effectiveness data on a single booster dose following the 2-dose primary series to the FDA, additional real-world data have become available on the increasing number of cases of COVID-19 in the USA and on the risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. These additional data enabled the FDA to reassess the benefits and risks of the use of the vaccine in a wider population. The FDA has determined that the benefits of a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or Comirnaty outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis in individuals 16 and 17 years of age to provide continued protection against COVID-19 and the associated serious consequences that can occur including hospitalization and death.

Pfizer is conducting post-authorization/post-marketing studies to assess known serious risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. In addition, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety concerns.

The fact sheets for recipients and caregivers and for healthcare providers contain information about the potential side effects, as well as the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. The most commonly reported side effects by individuals who received a booster dose were pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, as well as fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain and chills. Of note, swollen lymph nodes in the underarm were observed more frequently following the booster dose than after the 2nd dose of a 2-dose primary series.

The FDA did not hold a meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on today's [9 Dec 2021] action, as the agency previously convened the committee for extensive discussions regarding the use of booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines and, after review of Pfizer's EUA request, the FDA concluded that the request does not raise questions that would benefit from additional discussion by committee members. The FDA will be publicly posting documents regarding the agency's decision on its website following authorization.

The amendment to the EUA was granted to Pfizer Inc.

[Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, said the CDC's stronger recommendation for everyone to get boosted signals to him that a booster is now part of the vaccine regimen. Yet Offit, who is also a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, wrote a joint op-ed this week in which he and 2 other scientists argued that boosters were not yet needed for everyone and that healthy young people should wait to see whether an omicron-specific booster might be needed (https://khn.org/news/article/fully-vaccinated-definition-boosters-ambiguity/). - Mod.LK]

[B] AstraZeneca antibody treatment
Date: Thu 9 Dec 2021 00:24 EST

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the 1st injectable monoclonal antibody cocktail for long-term prevention of COVID-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The FDA issued an emergency use authorization Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] for AstraZeneca's antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against COVID-19. To date [9 Dec 2021], such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of COVID-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.

Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate immune responses from a COVID vaccine. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a COVID vaccine or its components.

The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every 6 months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83% effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.

It's unclear how the highly mutated omicron variant of the coronavirus -- which is spreading in 57 countries, including the USA -- might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company's BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus's spike protein in different and complementary ways. Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement.

Still, for many of the estimated 3% of US adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. "This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression," said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Evusheld as PrEP, he said, "provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40% to 80% of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."

Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe COVID. Even after vaccination, many people -- including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions -- have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against COVID.

[JH], 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a Facebook patient advocacy group for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. [JH], hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group's members. "We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear," she said.

Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it "should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine." PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people.

In the major clinical trial of Evusheld as PrEP, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5200 initially unvaccinated participants in the USA and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median 6 months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 by 83% compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.

There have been no cases of severe COVID-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to 5 severe cases and 2 such deaths in the placebo group. The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.

Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe COVID, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3% were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.

The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700 000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The 1st doses should be available "very soon," with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said. While the drug is free to patients, healthcare facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs.

[2] Omicron danger
Date: Thu 9 Dec 2021
Source: Ground Truths [edited]
https://erictopol.substack.com/p/is-omicron-ominous


Is omicron ominous? The short answer is yes. It's still early, and there are plenty of mixed signals, but here is what we know and the holes in our knowledge base that will soon be filled in.

1. Omicron is clearly more immune evasive than any prior variant

Omicron has an extraordinary number of mutations, greater than 50, compared with the Wuhan ancestral strain and with their positions in the virus, more than 30 of these within the spike protein, there is considerable "antigenic drift" -- this version of the virus looks different to our immune system compared with prior versions of SARS-CoV-2.

In South Africa, where there have been 3 major waves during the pandemic so far, the reinfection rate for people with prior COVID was low but more than doubled since the omicron outbreak began. That is a definite sign of immune evasion, since the people who developed immunity from prior infection were unable to fend off a new one with omicron.

The term "immune escape" is frequently used, but it's not all or none; it's a continuum. This property of the live virus was quantified in the Alex Sigal lab in South Africa for the 1st time yesterday [8 Dec 2021] by taking blood samples from 12 people who have been vaccinated or prior infection plus vaccinated and determining what level of antibodies are required to neutralize omicron. [See] key graph [at the source URL] that shows people with hybrid immunity (infection plus vaccination) had preserved protection, but the people with 2 vaccine shots did not. (Note that the 41-fold overall reduction of neutralization is a lab result, different from and not proportionate to some level of reduced immunity seen clinically.)

Similar results have since been made available by 2 other academic groups (Karolinska Institute, Sweden and Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany) extended to the Moderna vaccine, and by Pfizer today [9 Dec 2021]. The protection should be restored by the 3rd (booster) shot because the data to date show a striking (~30-40-fold) rise in neutralizing antibodies after a 3rd shot.

This aligns with the reinfection risk that has surfaced for omicron; its immune-evasive property has also become apparent by diminishing vaccine protection. Among the early detected cases around the world, many breakthrough infections were reported in people considered fully vaccinated, some even weeks after receiving their 3rd (booster) shots. These cases have largely been associated with mild symptoms, aligning with the expectation that vaccine protection against severe COVID illness will be preserved.

The immune-escape property of omicron, with potential to override our vaccines, is the central concern and can be met 3 ways: (1) booster shots, (2) an omicron-specific vaccine, and (3) a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine which would theoretically be variant-proof. Fortunately, our immune response to omicron is not just tied to the rapid neutralizing antibodies; it also relies on T cells, which have been strongly linked to prevention of severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths. Variants, to date, have had only minimal influence on the T-cell response. Even with omicron's ability to evade our antibodies to some extent, it will have a harder time overriding our memory, on-demand T cells induced by vaccination or prior infections. That provides hope for preserved protection from hospitalizations and deaths, for which we'll have data in the weeks ahead.

2. Is omicron more contagious than delta? Likely yes, but how much?

This seems probable because we have already seen omicron's very steep growth curves and superspreader events in Norway, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, with a high proportion of individuals infected. Like with the immune-evasion feature, the question here is the magnitude of more infectiousness compared with delta. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control projects that omicron will become the dominant virus strain in Europe in coming months. That's because it appears to have both increased infectiousness and the ability to evade our immune response.

Remember that increased transmission can be from either more contagiousness or more immune evasion or both. The magnitude of change for these properties will determine if (likely when) and how long it will take for omicron to replace delta as the major strain throughout the world.

[3]. Does omicron cause more mild or severe illness than delta?

Early reports from South Africa indicated the possibility that cases were milder, requiring fewer hospitalizations and oxygen supplementation. But the population assessed was predominantly young, had prior COVID, or were vaccinated. We can hope this is the case but will not really know the answer to this question until much larger numbers of people aged 60 plus, those without prior infection or vaccination, or several months out from vaccination, are studied. Fortunately, there are no data to suggest omicron is associated with more lethality or severe COVID than prior variants.

A key point here is that high transmissibility, which we are clearly seeing, will get a lot more people infected. Even if a smaller fraction doesn't get severe illness, that's still a lot more people very sick. That also means more long COVID, too, which can occur with mild cases and can be quite disabling.

4. Omicron will prolong the pandemic

We haven't yet gotten delta in any semblance of containment here in the USA and even in many countries that have much higher vaccination rates, such as Denmark (the top virus sequencing country in the world), where omicron has quickly gotten above 2% of cases.

This portends new waves across the globe as omicron fully competes with delta, ultimately displacing it, which will take months. The contingency is that another variant that could crop up that competes with omicron (hopefully not, but we can't rule that out). So instead of achieving an endemic state soon, that'll, at best, be delayed a matter of months. This reinforces why we must get the entire global population of people protected ASAP, to ultimately achieve containment everywhere.

I wish I had a better report for the 1st edition of Ground Truths. Maybe it should have been called hard, inconvenient truths today [9 Dec 2021]. I'm sure we'll get more reassuring clinical data on the protection from boosters and the efficacy of anti-COVID pills, particularly Paxlovid, which should prove to be fully effective versus omicron, in the days ahead. We'll review how important these pills are going to play in subsequent posts. In the meantime, we know and have all the mitigation measures that would protect against any respiratory virus. And if you haven't gotten boosted, please go for it. If you've had COVID and a vaccination, you should be well protected. We can, and will, with all the tools at our disposal, get through this latest challenge.

[3] Africa (Zimbabwe)
Date: Wed 8 Dec 2021

https://www.news24.com/fin24/economy/omicron-drives-record-positive-covid-19-cases-in-zimbabwe-20211208


As the omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads, Zimbabwe is reporting record daily cases and its highest ever test positivity rate. While the numbers have also been boosted by a jump in government testing, the fact that 1 in 3 tests are positive for the pathogen signals strong community transmission in the country. "It is very clear that the inevitable is now here," Agnes Mahomva, the co-coordinator of Zimbabwe's national COVID-19 task force, said in an interview.

South Africa's 25 Nov 2021 announcement that, together with Botswana, it had identified the new variant has sparked concern that the strain could rapidly spread around the globe.

Zimbabwe recorded 4031 new infections on Tuesday [8 Dec 2021], surpassing the previous record of 3110 reached during a 3rd wave of infections in July [2021], Health Ministry data show. All infections for 7 Dec 2021 were domestic cases, signalling the rise in transmission in local communities, it said.

The positivity rate -- the proportion of tests that are positive -- was 35%, according to the ministry. That compares with 1.4% 2 weeks ago. Still, little sequencing of samples has been done to determine which variant they are.

"We are at the stage of mass infections and rising hospitalizations, which is an ominous sign," Solwayo Ngwenya, the acting chief executive officer at Mpilo Hospital, said from the nation's 2nd-biggest city of Bulawayo. Hospital groups in South Africa have so far reported that the strain appears to cause milder illness than earlier variants.

Zimbabwe conducted 11 535 tests on Tuesday [7 Dec 2021] compared with 2500 the day earlier, Mahomva said. Disruptions to business because of the surge in infections are increasing, with the University of Zimbabwe announcing a suspension of in-person classes from 9 Dec 2021, a week earlier than planned for its end-of-year break. The Judicial Services Commission, which has oversight of the country's judiciary, said on Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] operations at the High Court and several magistrate's courts will be suspended.

Zimbabwe is targeting vaccinating 60% of its 15 million population. Fewer than 3 million people, or about 20% of the population, have so far been fully vaccinated.

[4] USA: COVID deaths undercounted
Date: Thu 9 Dec 2021 14:43 EST
Source: USA Today [edited]
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/09/covid-death-count-america-cdc/6435124001/


Death rates among Native, Hispanic and Black Americans still outpace pre-pandemic figures, showing the hidden toll of COVID-19 on communities of color even as vaccines have become widely available, according to data released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Consider the impact to Hispanic residents: In the first 10 months of 2021, before the typically deadly winter months, the death rate for Hispanic Americans was 17% higher than it was in all of 2019. That follows 2020, when the death rate was 40% higher than 2019.

It's particularly bad in places like Albuquerque, New Mexico; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Jersey City, New Jersey; and New York City. All have had higher death rates for Hispanics during the pandemic than the national rate.

The new data, which provides cause of death information down to the county level for 2020 and January through October of this year [2021], has more detail, more recently, on deaths during the pandemic than ever before. Information included -- such as where someone died, what other causes of death were on the death certificate or whether a body was autopsied -- can point to communities where COVID-19 deaths have been undercounted.

Public health experts say the true death toll of the pandemic in the USA is upward of 20% higher than the official tally. That's based on research showing that deaths attributed to COVID-19 do not account for all the increased deaths in 2020 and 2021 when compared to prior years. Researchers call the number of deaths above a typical year "excess deaths."

That means the number of Americans who have died from the virus could be closer to 1 million, not the roughly 793 200 deaths officially recorded as of Thursday [9 Dec 2021]. But it's been hard for researchers to figure out exactly how many COVID-19 deaths are going uncounted and why.

"We've almost certainly undercounted," Dr. Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics for the CDC, said. "But if we want to really improve the data, we need to know a little more. We need to know where we're missing cases."

The data could answer questions about what types of non-COVID-19 deaths increased during the pandemic and which COVID-19 deaths have been misclassified as something else, such as death from heart disease, stroke, or a respiratory illness, said Andrew Stokes, an assistant professor of demography and sociology at Boston University's Department of Global Health.

"In a public health emergency, real-time surveillance is critical," Stokes said. "This data will be routinely updated with a 2- to 4-week lag, and it also allows us to drill down to the county level and see how things are evolving locally. That is unprecedented compared to where we were at just a year ago."

Hispanics had the highest increase in death rates from 2019-2020 of any single demographic group tracked by the CDC. Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Black Americans weren't far behind. The death rate for Native Americans and Alaska Natives rose by 37% from 2019-2020. For Black Americans, it rose by 29%. The new CDC data show the 2021 death rates for those groups are on track to exceed pre-pandemic levels.

For Native Americans and Alaska Natives, the death rate so far in 2021 is 11% higher than it was in all of 2019. The 2021 death rate among Black Americans is on track to remain above 2019. In 2020, the death rate among white Americans was 14% higher than in 2019. For the first 10 months of 2021, it's 9% lower than 2019, suggesting that deaths for the full year will be closer to pre-pandemic levels.

Daniel Dawes, executive director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, said the 2021 figures for communities of color are "really troubling," though the disparities are not surprising. The figures reflect the unequal impact of the coronavirus on communities of color. Hispanics, African Americans and other people of color have long struggled with access to health care and insurance to deal with health conditions such as asthma and diabetes.

COVID-19 vaccination rates for people of color have lagged white Americans. Recent data suggest the gap is narrowing, but it hasn't been eliminated.

Of the 3.4 million Americans who died in 2020, roughly one-third died in their home, mirroring national trends prior to the pandemic. However, deaths at home increased from 2019-2020 more than in-patient deaths, especially in the early months of the pandemic.

While COVID-19 was the leading cause of death for those who died in a medical facility, the virus ranks considerably lower for those who died at home. The leading cause of death at home, lung cancer, was 13% higher than in previous years, and the 2nd, coronary heart disease, was 20% higher.

Deaths at home increased in states with larger rural populations, including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Iowa. "Almost all of the excess home deaths are occurring for other causes," Stokes said.

"Whatever the story explaining the difference between excess and COVID deaths is, it's in these home deaths, and we need to get to the bottom of them," he said. "These were people who were afraid to go to the hospital, who were afraid to lose contact with loved ones, who heard the shelter-in-place policies and thought they wouldn't be able to get care, or who, if ICU beds were full, didn't have access."

By looking at groupings of underlying causes of death -- such as deaths from heart attacks in Hinds and Rankin counties, 2 counties in the Jackson, Mississippi, area -- we can see how the pandemic changed why and how Americans die. In Hinds County, deaths from acute myocardial infarction, or heart attacks, increased 54% from 2019 to 2020. In neighboring Rankin County, they doubled. In both places, most of those deaths happened at home. The increase in heart attack deaths at home suggests that those people avoided treatment for other conditions or were in fact sick with COVID-19.

While deaths from heart attacks are common outside a hospital, the stark increase during the pandemic points to existing problems worsened by the pandemic. Mississippi ranks lowest in the country on a number of health indicators, and it has one of the country's highest rates of diabetes and heart disease.

"The combination of fear and misinformation around COVID meant people who may have contracted the disease were afraid to go in, or they didn't have access to health care, so they couldn't afford it," said Dr. Paul Burns, a social epidemiologist and assistant professor of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

There are sizable gaps in the data as local and state medical examiners and coroners wrap up their death reporting for the year. Due to a lag in death certificate reporting, more than 110 000 deaths in 2021 haven't been assigned a cause of death yet. Another 74 000 deaths in 2021 are attributed to an "ill-defined" cause -- nearly double the annual average before the pandemic. That's likely due to overwhelmed medical examiners and coroners who haven't finished investigating those deaths.

The impact of undercounted COVID-19 deaths is 2-fold, experts say. It can lead to complacency and undermine preventative measures like masking. And a low count of COVID-19 deaths might result in fewer state and federal resources in a given county or region.

"That's why accurate reporting of COVID deaths is important," said Enbal Shacham, a professor of public health at Saint Louis University and a leading expert on community health and health behavior. "It should define the public health infrastructure in your community."

https://www.dawn.com/news/1662802/pakistan-reports-first-suspected-case-of-omicron-variant-in-woman-from-karachi


Pakistan reported its 1st "suspected" case of the new coronavirus variant omicron in a woman in Karachi on Wednesday [8 Dec 2021], Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho said, adding that a genomic study was being carried out for confirmation.

In a video message, she said that the genomic study of the coronavirus patient's sample had not been conducted but "the way the virus is behaving, it seems like it is omicron." She further said the patient was 57 years old.

"Omicron is very transmissible but deaths or serious [conditions] have not been seen in recent reports coming from South Africa (where the variant was first detected). There is no cause for concern. We are conducting a genomic study which will take one or 2 weeks."

It would be confirmed whether the woman was infected with the omicron variant once the study was completed, she added. "The virus also spreads because people are not vaccinated. This woman was not vaccinated either. I am appealing to you to get the 2nd dose and if you are fully vaccinated, get the booster dose. It can protect you," she stressed.

The minister's statement came hours after her spokesperson Mehar Khursheed confirmed the detection of the 1st omicron case in a woman from Karachi. She said the infected woman was unvaccinated and had been admitted for treatment at Aga Khan University Hospital.

According to a letter written by the district health officer of Karachi's East district to the provincial director general of health, the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit in the metropolis "reported the 1st case of new COVID-19 'omicron' variant on 8 Dec 2021 at 7 pm." The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the woman, who was 65 years of age, was unvaccinated and did not have a travel history. She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] and was isolating at home.

The rapid response team was "taken on board immediately" for tracing, testing, quarantining, vaccination, and other preventive measures to control the infection's spread as per the guidelines of the National Command and Operation Centre, the letter stated. The district's health team also "immediately" contacted the woman's family to take a detailed history and trace her contacts. The deputy commissioner of the district was also requested to take the necessary action -- micro smart lockdown -- according to the letter.

Meanwhile, the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad said the sample of the coronavirus patient was "not yet confirmed to be omicron via whole-genome sequencing" which would be performed after the NIH received the sample. A statement issued by the Aga Khan University Hospital later in the day stated that the hospital had received the "1st patient suspected of [having] the COVID-19 omicron variant."

"We are awaiting the results of the final (genome sequencing) confirmatory test, which will take a few days. We have reported the suspected patient to the health department for their action. The patient did well and has been discharged," the hospital's spokesperson Anam Haleem said in the statement. He added that the hospital's prevention and management protocols are adequate for the treatment of the coronavirus.

The booster dose (Pfizer) will be administered to individuals above 30 years of age from tomorrow [10 Dec 2021] in the city of Colombo, Regional Epidemiologist Dr Dinu Guruge said today [9 Dec 2021].

She said they will be sending an SMS to all the eligible citizens. "Please do not panic and create unnecessary public gatherings as there are enough vaccines for all," she tweeted.

Dr Guruge told Daily Mirror that all those who have received the COVID jab from one of the vaccine centres in Colombo City will be getting an SMS. When asked when will the booster dose be given to people 30 plus in other areas, she said the booster rollout for them will commence by next week [week of 13 Dec 2021] covering the entire country.

The booster dose is currently being administered to 60 plus and people above 30 with comorbidities.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 10 Dec 2021 at 07:24 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 674 744 / 474 735 / 339
Bangladesh: 1 578 550 / 28 016 / 168
Pakistan: 1 288 366 / 28 812 / 127
Nepal: 823 554 / 11 549 / 386
Sri Lanka: 570 672 / 14 555 / 676
Afghanistan: 157 585 / 7321 / 182
Maldives: 92 754 / 255 / 460
Bhutan: 2648 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 58 987, 1723, 2344, 1605, and 5201 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 60 326, 1642, 2547, 1664, and 5126 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India, also a decreasing trend in Sri Lanka, but a state of almost stability in the other 3 countries. The daily case positivity remains below 1% in India and 1.5% in Bangladesh.

The first 2 cases of the omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529) were detected on 2 Dec 2021 in India, and as of 9 Dec 2021, the total number of cases attributed to the variant has increased to 23 in the country (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/23-omicron-variant-cases-across-india-health-officials-inform-standing-committee/articleshow/88194094.cms). A case of this variant has also been reported from Sri Lanka, as indicated in item [E] above. A suspected case of the variant has been reported from Pakistan, according to item [D] above, but the confirmation result based on the sequence data is still pending. Update on the variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron. According to European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, as of 8 Dec 2021, 55 countries have already reported COVID-19 cases caused by the omicron variant. Nepal is one of them (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-omicron-data-8-december), suggesting that, in total, 3 countries in South Asia have already confirmed the presence of the virus variant in their territories, and sooner or later, the other countries might report the same, as was seen for the delta variant of the virus. Preparation in South Asian countries is required to gather and analyze real-time disease data to assess the transmissibility, severity, and probable ability of the variant to evade immunity already developed in the populations through massive vaccination initiatives and also by natural infections.

Over the course of 24 hours since yesterday (9 Dec 2021), a total of 624 people died in India due to COVID-19. Of them 225 were from Kerala state, comprising 36.1% of the total deaths encountered across the country (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). As of 10 Dec 2021, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 311 887 257 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 8 Dec 2021, 47.62% have received the 1st dose and 29.47% of the target population have received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 10 Dec 2021 at 10:36 AM, a total of 131 311 097 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 19 157 444 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 29 720 188. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 68.2% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/). The country has also started booster dose vaccination for people above 30 years of age.
