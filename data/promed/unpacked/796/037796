Dr. Paul Van Buynder, with Fraser Health, said Friday [3 Jan 2014] that 15 patients, many of them otherwise healthy young people, were recently admitted to intensive care units in hospitals in the region. By Sunday [5 Jan 2014], he added 5 more to the total for those in intensive care in B.C., where at least 40 people have been hospitalized due to H1N1 influenza this season [2013-14].

Fraser Health says an outbreak of H1N1 flu has sent at least 40 people in B.C. to hospital, with around half of them ending up in intensive care units. "It is a lot for us at this particular time, especially because there is not a lot of circulating disease in the community at this point, and so we're worried that this has happened to so many people so quickly," he said. He said the ages of the patients turning up with H1N1 flu span the spectrum, and include those in their 30s. He also said at least one of the patients is pregnant, and also that one person may have died from this flu strain.

"I have one person who hasn't been confirmed, but I'm pretty sure did pass away from this," Van Buynder told CBC News. "People should always be concerned about influenza in winter. It does kill people. It makes people very ill."

Van Buynder said medical officials are seeing small pockets of H1N1 breaking out across the region, in a pattern mirroring the flu's spread in Alberta, Ontario, and Texas.

Alberta's Health Minister Fred Horne said last week that there have been 965 lab-confirmed cases; another 251 people have been hospitalized due to influenza, and 5 people have died so far this flu season [2013-14].

In Ontario, 6 people are believed to have died from H1N1 influenza, and 3 have died from the virus in Saskatchewan.

[It is not clear whether these hospitalised cases of H1N1 seasonal influenza virus infection in British Columbia are more severe than those recorded in the previous year, or whether they are merely a consequence of fewer other infectious diseases and greater availability of hospital facilities.

Spread of seasonal H1N1 influenza virus infection up to the present has remained confined to North America. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
