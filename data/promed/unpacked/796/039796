The Public Health Agency of Canada has confirmed an additional 7 illnesses due to _E. coli_ have been linked by investigators to BC [British Columbia] cheese products that were recalled last week [week of 17 Sep 2013]. An outbreak linked to Gort's Gouda Cheese Farm in Salmon Arm, BC, has been blamed for an elderly BC woman's death and a rash of illnesses across other provinces since the beginning of July 2013.

Most of those who became ill began displaying symptoms in late August 2013 and September 2013, and the number of cases under investigation now totals 21.

Since Sat 21 Sep 2013, another 5 cases in BC have been added to the list of illnesses under investigation, along with another case in Alberta and one case in Manitoba.

Illnesses under investigation by Canada's Public Health Agency
--------------------------------------------------------------
Province / Total cases
British Columbia / 9
Alberta / 9
Saskatchewan / 1
Manitoba / 1
Quebec/ 1
Total = 21

On 17 and 19 Sep 2013, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Gort's Gouda Cheese Farm initiated a recall of 15 raw-milk cheese products that were sold either online, at the Gort's farm, or elsewhere in BC and Alberta between 27 May 2013 and 14 Sep 2013.

Recalled cheeses
----------------
- Mild Gouda cheese sold in packages of various sizes bearing a red "Raw" sticker, sold at certain retail stores in B.C. and via the Internet from 27 May 2013 to 14 Sep 2013

All sizes of the raw milk cheeses sold at the manufacturer's outlet, at retail stores in Alberta and BC, and via the internet from 27 May 2013 to 14 Sep 2013. They are:

[It has not been reported how much of the potential tainted cheese has been sold and if it is known which of the cheeses have been implicated to this point. There are now cases in 5 of Canada's 13 provinces (10) and territories (3). The issue of the safety of 60+ day aged raw milk cheeses related to EHEC is important to readdress:

In the USA, the FDA has established (FDA 21 CFR Part 133 http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=133) that unpasteurized milk cheese that is aged for 60 days or more at a temperature greater than 35 deg F (2 deg C) creates conditions able to eradicate milkborne pathogens. These observations followed epidemics of typhoid fever caused by cheddar cheese made from raw milk in the 1940s and survival data on _Brucella abortus_ in cheddar led to the 60 day curing period in the USA (1,2).

Reitsma (3) reported, however, that EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_) could survive the manufacture and curing of cheese, and using a 5-strain inoculum, others (4) confirmed that the 60 day aging was inadequate to eliminate EHEC. Confirming these experimental findings, several outbreaks of EHEC have been reported related to aged raw milk cheeses (5,6). The physiological responses of EHEC (7) as measured by stress responses to acid, osmotic pressure, and heat shock seem to contribute to the survival of EHEC during raw milk production.
