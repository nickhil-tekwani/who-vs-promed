A total of 5628 chickens and 4482 quail died in poultry farms in 3 townships
in northwestern Sagaing division, and 4 townships in northern Mandalay
division, as of 16 Mar 2006, since the outbreak of bird flu [began] in late
February 2006, Xinhua news agency reported Saturday.
The 3 townships in Sagaing division are Shwebo, Kanbalu and Khin U, while the
4 in Mandalay division are Pyigyidagun, Chanmyathazi, Chanayethazan and
Amarapura, the news agency quoted latest figures reported by the state-run
newspaper New Light of Myanmar Saturday.
In its measures to contain the avian influenza, the authorities slaughtered a
total of 13 970 chickens and 77 018 quail and quail eggs in these townships,
the figures show.
No human infection was found in the infected areas up to date, the report said.
To control the disease, the authorities have placed the townships in the 2
divisions under restricted zones, banning movement of poultry and temporarily
closing down fowl markets with other preventive measures being undertaken.
Myanmar's state-run media reported for the first time, on Thu 16 Mar 2006, the
outbreak of suspected H5N1 bird flu in the country's northern part.
According to the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department of Myanmar,
suspected avian influenza virus of H5N1 was mainly found in poultry farms in
Khin U township in northwestern Sagaing division and Pyigyidagun township in
adjacent Mandalay division in the first half of this month.
Meanwhile, the Bangkok laboratory have confirmed that the current bird flu
occurring in the country is H5N1 after samples of the dead chickens were
tested, disclosed a resident representative of the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) on Thursday.
An FAO expert group is currently in the bird flu-infected areas of Mandalay to
coordinated and cooperate with the Myanmar authorities for fresh measures in
preventing H5N1 from spreading further.
The FAO has preliminarily provided USD 45 000 dollars worth of equipment to
Myanmar for use in the measures which include 100 sets of protection
equipment, 500 liters of disinfectant, 50 sets of sprayers and 2 containers
for shipping samples, according to the FAO.

[2] Israel, poultry, H5, control activities

The Agriculture Ministry started Saturday [18 Mar 2006] culling hundreds of
thousands of birds infected with bird flu or in danger of being infected with
the deadly virus in 3 kibbutzim and a moshav in the south of the country.
Agriculture ministry officials said Saturday night that the poultry had
probably died as a result of the bird flu.
Specimens of dead chickens [sic; should read turkeys - Mod.AS] tested positive
for the H5 strain of the disease, but its classification as an N1 virus --
which has killed almost 100 people, mostly in Asia in recent years -- was
still not certain.
A form of testing hoped to conclusively identify the virus as the deadly form
of bird flu is still being carried out and the results are expected in on
Sunday [19 Mar 2006]. [According to Israel's official notification to the OIE,
17 Mar 2006, PCR tests of samples from the 2 first outbreaks were found H5N1
positive, while virus isolation was pending. - Mod.AS]
According to the head of the poultry department at the Agriculture Ministry,
Dr. Shimon Pokomonsky, the culling of poultry at Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha and
Kibbutz Nachshon will be completed Saturday [18 Mar 2006], and will begin
later in the day at Moshav Sdeh Moshe and Kibbutz Nahshon.
The culling of chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks is to be carried out by
poisoning the drinking water of birds within a 3km [2m] radius of the
communities thought to be affected by the virus. At least 12 000 birds are
thought to have been directly killed by the virus in the 4 communities.
According to the director of the veterinary services at the Agriculture
Ministry, Dr. Moshe Haimovitch, at least 200 000 turkeys will be culled, most
of them healthy birds that were close to the infected hen-houses. [In a press
conference Saturday evening, government representatives said that the
compensation to owners will be NIS 100.00 (USD 21.50) per culled turkey. -
Mod.AS]
In addition, health authorities decided to fly 4 million doses of bird flu
vaccines into Israel from The Netherlands. The government will consider
vaccinating all birds in Israel in an attempt to prevent the virus from
spreading. [Reportedly, the vaccine will be a DIVA, H5N2 inactivated vaccine.
The number of domestic avians (mainly turkeys and chickens) to be vaccinated
is at least 10-fold higher than the number of doses of the Dutch vaccine. -
Mod.AS]
The Cabinet is to discuss Sunday the implications of the bird flu outbreak,
compensation for farmers and prevention of the spread of the disease. The
director generals of the Health, Agriculture, Justice and Environment
Ministries are expected to attend the meeting.
Veterinarians and livestock farmers criticized the delayed and improper manner
of bird culling in southern Israel over the weekend. Photos from Kibbutz Holit
showing cattle [egrets], known transmitters of the bird flu, roaming in piles
of dead birds suspected of having contracted the disease, raise the fear of
the flu spreading.
"I have received numerous calls from poultry growers who condemn the delay in
culling, and the fact that it has not been carried out according to
procedures," Dr. Yariv Agur, an expert on avian disease, told Haaretz on
Saturday.
Miki Firk, the Agriculture Ministry's representative in charge of the affected
areas, stated that, "the worrisome photos were taken before we arrived at the
site, after which the carcasses were promptly disposed of." The Agriculture
Ministry's procedures dictate that the birds must be buried in a hole, the
bottom of which is covered by a thick plastic tarpaulin. The birds must be
covered with an additional tarpaulin and 2 meters of earth.
The bird flu was suspected of spreading to both Moshav Sde Moshe and Kibbutz
Nachshon, 25km from Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, Israel on Friday halted all exports of unprocessed chicken and
turkey meat to overseas destinations. The European Commission on Friday banned
imports of live poultry, poultry meat, eggs and poultry products from Israel.
The initial confirmation marks the first time that the deadly virus has been
detected in Israeli birds.
Government officials attempted to calm the public, saying that the chance of
human infection was low and that cooked poultry does not transmit the virus.
"The risk that people will contract [the virus] is very very low," Health
Ministry Director General Prof. Avi Yisraeli said Friday.
Ministry officials stressed that there is no reason for people to stop eating
poultry, since the virus cannot be transmitted via cooked food. However,
poultry farmers said that their main fear is that the public will ignore this
reassurance. Indeed, merchants said demand for poultry products, especially
turkey, was low Friday. Poultry farmers said a panic-driven consumer boycott
of poultry could do their businesses even more harm than the destruction of
their flocks.
After the turkey deaths were reported in the south Thursday, the veterinary
authorities imposed a quarantine on Ein Hashlosha and Holit as well as 2
neighboring kibbutzim, Nirim and Kissufim. The quarantine was extended to 10
kilometers Friday. The quarantine means that no birds can enter or leave the
kibbutzim, and no people will be allowed into the coops except those who must
care for the birds that are still alive. These essential personnel are
required to don suitable protective gear -- masks, goggles and protective
clothing -- before entering.
The H5N1 virus was detected in neighboring Egypt in February 2006, and
Agriculture Minister Ze'ev Boim said that the death of the birds in southern
Israel might indicate that the disease entered the country from Egypt.
Another possibility is that the disease entered from Gaza. The Israel Defense
Forces therefore asked the Palestinian Authority to deliver blood samples of
poultry from Gaza Strip henhouses, in order to determine whether they were the
source of the virus.

At a press conference held by the Agriculture Ministry [Israel] Saturday night
[18 Mar 2006], officials said the existence of bird flu in Israel has been
confirmed. Agriculture Ministry officials are estimating that the culling of
400 000 to 500 000 chickens at the 4 southern communities where bird flu was
discovered will end by Sunday evening [19 Mar 2006].
Officials have yet to identify the bird flu infection's source, but suspect
that a slaughterhouse in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi used by several
affected communities may be the culprit. Officials have ordered the
slaughterhouse be thoroughly disinfected twice. The vehicles used to
transport the chickens were also disinfected.
"If the slaughter house is the source for the spread of the disease, we
closed the circle," one official said.

[The discovery of the disease, almost simultaneously, in 4 separate sites,
only 2 of then in relatively close proximity, may indicate that the virus has
been evolving for some time, spread among the farms by human activities rather
than by wild birds. Hopefully, the applied vigilance -- and early, strategic
vaccination -- will help in preventing further spread. - Mod.AS]

[3] China, HPAI vaccines and silent excretors
Date: Sat, 18 Mar 2006

The discovery in southern China of healthy-looking chickens that are infected
with the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has raised fears among experts that
vaccines used in the country are substandard.
Bad vaccines for poultry can "mask" diseases. The vaccines protect birds,
which often don't show symptoms, but do not guard against infection and the
birds can shed the virus in their faeces. The virus then spreads to more
birds, mutates and can even jump species barriers, for example, into humans.
In a 2004-2005 survey, researchers found seemingly healthy but H5N1-infected
chickens in poultry markets in south China, including Guangdong, just north of
Hong Kong.
The development is unsettling. Chickens usually die within 24 hours of being
infected with H5N1, but without signs of disease the virus is harder to
detect, control, and also much easier to pass on to unsuspecting humans.
The risk of such asymptomatic poultry came to the fore earlier this month when
a man died in Guangdong after visiting several live poultry markets and
officials later said he probably caught the disease from live but H5N1-
infected birds.
Experts are now asking hard questions about the quality of China-made vaccines.
"With this finding of asymptomatic birds, we have to ask if this is because of
the vaccines they use, a mutation of the virus? The issue of vaccines has to
take top priority," said Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok.
The World Health Organisation, which backed China's plan to vaccinate billions
of poultry in 2005, is also concerned. Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's
outbreak response in China, said recently that studies were needed to see if
China's vaccination programme might be "masking" the virus, which has killed
about 100 people in Asia and the Middle East since 2003.
China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, which is linked to the Ministry
of Agriculture, makes flu vaccines for poultry. The ministry approves these
vaccines and controls their sale and distribution.
"Because information is not abundantly available, there is speculation the
vaccines may not be as effective. It is up to the Chinese authorities to be
more transparent," Lo said. China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has declined
comment.
An expert familiar with the situation said: "MOA is the only place allowed to
develop, manufacture and distribute vaccines. It is not the best vaccine. It
can save the bird's life but it can't stop the virus from replicating. The
bird looks good, but it has the virus. If you bring it into an unvaccinated
area, other birds die and people (who contract the virus) die," the expert
said.
"Places like Vietnam and Thailand are importing these Chinese vaccines. So
what is happening in China (asymptomatic poultry) can happen in these places
soon," said the expert.
But Vietnam, which has had no new bird flu outbreaks in poultry or humans
since November 2005, is not overly worried. It says the China-made vaccines
must pass quality-control tests. "We have been using Chinese vaccines
nationwide and there has been no problem regarding quality," said Hoang Van
Nam, deputy director of the Agriculture Ministry's animal health department.
"We have just completed tests of 20 000 poultry nationwide and found no trace
of bird flu," Nam said. Neither has the department found any asymptomatic
chickens.
Although Thailand bans H5N1 vaccination in chickens, there have been reports
of police seizing vaccines being smuggled along the Mekong River from China.
But nobody knows if they have been smuggled in successfully and used.
Although China has been vaccinating its farmed poultry in the past few years,
that has not stopped the virus from proliferating and mutating. After
scientists first isolated H5N1 in a goose in Guangdong in 1996, the virus has
continued brewing and there are now 5 dominant subtypes in southern China.
In the past year, H5N1 has spread across 14 Chinese provinces and regions, and
penetrated parts of the Middle East, Europe and Africa after infecting many
parts of Asia since late 2003.
Although migratory birds probably carried the virus from China's Qinghai Lake
to Africa and Europe, microbiologist Guan Yi from the University of Hong Kong
believes that the spread of the virus in southern China is due largely to
domestic poultry. "The virus outbreak in south China is not caused by
migratory birds, but domestic ducks and geese and maybe chickens," he said.
Guan, whose laboratory has genetically sequenced strains of the virus found in
many parts of the world, believes live poultry exports from southern China
probably introduced the virus into Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

[The paper in PNAS describing the discovery of H5N1 viruses in some apparently
healthy chickens in live-bird markets in southern China was presented and
discussed in posting 20060212.0468 (see there: [5] China - H5N1 multiple
sublineages). Reservations regarding some of the paper's conclusions were
later expressed by Les Simms (see [2] in 20060218.0536). Dr Guan Yi's
concerns about the possible role (deficient) vaccines may have played in the
creation of silent excretor chickens and the maintenance of H5N1 in China and
elsewhere were included in a previous post (see [4] China, subclinical
infection: chickens, ducks and geese; in 20060310.0761).
The quality of veterinary vaccines is a crucial factor in controlling
infectious diseases, avian influenza certainly not excluded. The Vietnamese
observations are significant, indicating that the issue is not simply the use
of vaccines, but their quality. When bona-fide, certified, safety-and-efficacy-
tested vaccines are used, the results do not disappoint. Wide-scale
application of uncontrolled vaccines, produced in uncertified plants, may
indeed lead to disastrous outcomes. China seems to have recently recognised
the problem and undertaken the complex task of improving controls on its
vaccines; early implementation is most desirable. - Mod.AS]

[4] Congo (Democratic Republic), suspected/undiagnosed mortality

Agricultural officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have recorded at
least 260 chickens and ducks suspected of having died of avian flu,
Agriculture Minister Constant Ndom Nda says.
Announcing this at a news conference in the capital, Kinshasa, he made a
public appeal to the United Nations for help to face the danger, and for the
rehabilitation of veterinary laboratories in Kinshasa and the southern city of
Lumbumbashi.
"We have passed Phase 4, and are no longer simply limited to mobilization but
to active intervention on the ground because we are now perhaps living in
danger," he said.
The permanent secretary at the ministry, Ali Ramazani, said it only learnt
about the birds on Thursday [16 Mar 2006], which actually died 3 or 4 days
ago. He said 100 of them died in a single day in Tshikapa, a town in the south-
central province of Kasai Occidental. He said the dead birds presented a
danger to public health because tests had not been conducted.
"The problem is that most of the dead chicken and ducks in Tshikapa have been
eaten," Ramazani said.
There were migratory birds among the dead. Samples of 6 dead pigeons, also
found in Kinshasa, have been sent to South Africa for laboratory analysis. A
cat, which ate one of the dead pigeons, also died.
Congo has taken several measures in response to the appearance of the virus in
Africa; first in Nigeria and then in Cameroon. All imports of eggs from
countries that have reported the avian flu have been banned.
Poultry imports account for 90 percent of Congo's supplies in the commodity.
The remaining 10 percent, or some 20 million free-range poultry, are reared in
the country.
