A strong medical team led by 30 doctors have started off today [30 Jul 2017] to help people suffering from Japanese encephalitis in interior parts of Churachandpur district [south western Manipur state]. There are no proper roads, hence it was difficult to reach the villages. The matter was discussed in the State Assembly yesterday [29 Jul 2017]. During the meeting, it was reported that the situation is not alarming but the positive cases are showing an increasing trend. About 73 cases have been detected positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE).

CM [chief minister of Manipur], Mr Biren said the situation is alarming and it needs to be attended to immediately. [An official] said he instructed the district officials to arrange transport facilities to move the patients to district headquarters or the state capital for medical treatment.

[2] Lychee debate

Has the lychee been exonerated? Eating lychee on an empty stomach did not trigger encephalitis-like symptoms in hundreds of malnourished children in Muzaffarpur, Bihar in 2014, resulting in deaths. So, a January paper in Lancet Global Health (Association of acute toxic encephalopathy with litchi consumption in an outbreak in Muzaffarpur, India, 2014: A case-control study; http://goo.gl/2Z93Ha) [see Acute toxic encephalopathy - India: (BR) lychee fruit, 2014 20170202.4809638] that pointed to a naturally occurring toxin in the fruit as the prima facie cause for death has been proved wrong.

New research from Bangladesh, published in the July 2017 edition of The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (Outbreak of sudden death with acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] among children associated with exposure to lychee orchards in Northern Bangladesh, 2012; http://goo.gl/F9VRMC), has proved that it is not the fruit but a banned pesticide that is the actual culprit. It may appear as though the last word on the issue has been spoken. But that is not the case. [See cited reference below]

In fact, the latest scientific paper on the issue lays bare the very process of scientific progress. In a recent public talk, astrophysicist and science TV host Neil deGrasse Tyson told the audience that scientists can think up of a lot of stuff, even publish them in research journals. But much of it is 'wrong'. Modern science discovers 'truths' through a simple process -- float a hypothesis and wait for someone to confirm or prove it wrong. Falsification is the cornerstone of science through which truth emerges.

To understand the nature of the debate, let us first focus on the Lancet paper, published by an Indo-US team of scientists from the National Centre for Disease Control in India (NCDC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC). Acute neurological illness had been reported from Muzaffarpur, a region famous for its lychee crop, for more than 20 years.

The illness peaked during the lychee season among children of people closely connected to the cultivation of the fruit crop. In 2014, there were 122 deaths. Hypotheses, death from Japanese encephalitis virus to pesticides, have been floated.

Before the Lancet paper, the illness had a 'mystery' tag attached to it. Though immediately after its publication, a medical scientist from Vellore claimed that the central idea of linking a naturally occurring lychee toxin to encephalitis-like symptoms among the dead children from Muzaffarpur had already been published in the Indian journal, Current Science (Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: Hypothesis, May 2014, http://goo.gl/Sb89JG). That 'plagiarism' [duplicate publication?] charge is yet to be settled.

The Lancet paper researchers claim that they had done an exhaustive 'PubMed' search on all published papers linking "hypoglycin A or methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), naturally occurring fruit-based toxins [found in lychees] that cause hypoglycaemia and metabolic derangement" with the unexplained neurological illness that killed Muzaffarpur's children.

While the controversy raged, the Bangladesh researchers claimed this month [July 2017]: "Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation."

The difference in location notwithstanding, it appears that the authors of the paper are negating the Lancet findings -- or, those published in Current Science. If exposure to pesticides, such as the banned endosulfan, is indeed the cause of the deaths, then the Muzaffarpur case needs to be reopened.

Can there be a case that both pesticides and MCPG are the cause of the deaths? There is also a possibility that the killer in Bangladesh is not the same as that in Muzaffarpur. Or, that both hypotheses are wrong.

There are several positives for the management of AES that emerge from this apparent game of research one-upmanship -- injecting glucose, control of banned pesticides, thorough washing of fruits, and a public policy to effectively control malnourishment and hunger. While science looks for more culprits in the lychee story, there is a question that begs an answer: why do only the poor and marginalised die of eating lychees?

[This report raises several important questions concerning AES: could both pesticides and MCPG be the cause of the deaths? There is also a possibility that the killer in Bangladesh is not the same as that in Muzaffarpur. Or, that both hypotheses are wrong. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India and Bangladesh, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus infections and are classified as AES with undetermined etiology. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. Other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed. The report below adds intoxication from exposure to agrochemicals as another possibility. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.

Muzaffarpur district is located in the Indian state of Bihar (see map in [1] above).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Recurrent outbreaks of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) among children in lychee growing areas in Asia highlight the need to better understand the etiology and the context. We conducted a mixed-methods study to identify risk factors for disease, and behaviors and practices around lychee cultivation in an AES outbreak community in northern Bangladesh in 2012. The outbreak affected 14 children; 13 died. The major symptoms included unconsciousness, convulsion, excessive sweating, and frothy discharge. The median time from illness onset to unconsciousness was 2.5 hours. The outbreak corresponded with lychee harvesting season. Multiple pesticides including some banned in Bangladesh were frequently used in the orchards. Visiting a lychee orchard within 24 hours before onset (age-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 11.6 [1.02-109.8]) and 3 days (aOR = 7.2 [1.4-37.6]), and family members working in a lychee orchard (aOR = 7.2 [1.7-29.4]) and visiting any garden while pesticides were being applied (aOR = 4.9 [1.0-19.4]) in 3 days preceding illness onset were associated with illness in nearby village analysis. In neighborhood analysis, visiting an orchard that used pesticides (aOR = 8.4 [1.4-49.9]) within 3 days preceding illness onset was associated with illness. Eating lychees was not associated with illness in the case-control study. The outbreak was linked to lychee orchard exposures where agrochemicals were routinely used, but not to consumption of lychees. Lack of acute specimens was a major limitation. Future studies should target collection of environmental and food samples, acute specimens, and rigorous assessment of community use of pesticides to determine etiology.

Discussion
The clinical manifestations in case-patients including sudden onset without a prodromal phase, becoming unconscious within a median of 2.5 hours of illness onset, and the short duration between onset of illness to death all suggest that the outbreak was more likely due to a toxic poisoning than an infection. The outbreak was restricted to the lychee season and to a geographic area in which lychees are grown, which suggests that this outbreak of AES may be linked to exposure to lychees or lychee orchards.

In India, the leading hypothesis of AES etiology among children living near lychee orchards was the ingestion of phytotoxins, specifically methylenecyclopropylglycine that is present in lychee seeds and pulp, which can lead to hypoglycemia among malnourished children. Without acute biological specimens, and therefore, lack of measured blood glucose levels from children in this outbreak in Bangladesh, we were unable to investigate this hypothesis directly. However, our epidemiologic and clinical findings suggest that methylenecyclopropyl-glycine alone may not explain this AES outbreak among children. There are multiple lines of evidence that agrochemical poisoning may also have contributed.

In our study, the signs and symptoms are also consistent with acute pesticide poisoning in children reported in different countries of the world.

The outbreak ended following the onset of the monsoon rains, which suggest that the toxin associated with the lychees was on their surface, rather than contained in the fruit. In India, a similar pattern was observed, where the number of cases peaked in mid-June and declined immediately after the onset of monsoon rains. Moreover, the findings of washing fruits and vegetables protective against lychee-associated illness in India further supports our assertion that toxin associated with the lychees may be on the surface.

Finally, in India, mortality decline among AES case-patients after rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous dextrose. Although we were unable to measure blood glucose level among the case-patients, however, distribution of blood glucose meter among clinician may help identifying patients with hypoglycemia and rapid correction of hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose may reduce mortality in children in Bangladesh.

[The authors indicate that studies based on hospital records and retrospective interviews have significant limitations in confirming the etiology of AES and establishing agrochemical intoxication as the causative factor. One hopes that this study will stimulate prospective studies of AES that will include laboratory supported toxicology confirming exposure to specific, identified agrochemicals, and the clinical details following exposure, including incidence of hypoglycemia, a frequently mentioned condition in AES cases in India.

A report based on this publication was posted on 27 Jul 2017 [see Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh: (RP), pesticide identified, 2012 20170728.5212796]. However the original published report (above) provides additional detail. In the previous report, Mod.TG provided relevant toxicological information that follows. - Mod.TY

"Endosulfan, a commercial product of 2 isomers, is a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide. As such, it may be used as wood preservative, but is also a contact poison for many insects and mites. Therefore it has been used on food crops, such as vegetables, grains, fruits and teas to rid these crops of damaging pests.

"Endosulfan is a highly toxic substance whose toxicity is partly dependent upon how the pesticide is applied. The body absorption is rapid in the presence of alcohols, oils or other emulsifiers (on the skin or in the preparation), but otherwise is slowly and incompletely absorbed by the body.

"Generally endosulfan appears to affect the central nervous system. Acute symptoms include incoordination, agitation, convulsion and even loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include vomiting, and diarrhea. In cattle grazing fields sprayed with endosulfan blindness has been documented. Furthermore, these animals may recover when removed from the exposure and given time, perhaps of a month or more. Likewise sheep and pigs grazing on treated fields have been reported with incoordination and blindness.

"Chronic toxicities may affect kidneys, liver, blood chemistry, and the parathyroid gland. There may be other chronic effects such as reproductive effects, teratogenic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects.

"While endosulfans can and do affect a number of body systems chronically, the case of the children in the fruit orchards is an acute case.

"It seems that despite the age of the original case, we at least have an answer regarding the poisoning of the children. - Mod.TG"]
