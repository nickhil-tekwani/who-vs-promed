Pehuenche [indigenous people] community leaders in Alto Bio-Bio requested the intervention of officers from the Agriculture Ministry because of the occurrence of cases of strangles, and the number of animals affected by this condition may increase because of the heavy rainfall that occurred last weekend [26-27 May 2012].

The recent frontal system not only caused prolonged blackouts and difficulties in communications; they also generated more concern in Pehuenche people because of the occurrence of the aforementioned disease, which leads animals to become quite weak.

Strangles affects horses, which are of vital importance not only for transporting people and goods in this remote highland area but also from a cultural point of view, since they are used for traditional ceremonies.

Mr Pedro Paine, a local leader in Butalelbun community, which is located near the Argentinian border, expressed concern because of the effects of strangles after the recent heavy rainfalls, and requested local agricultural authorities to intervene.

Meanwhile, the Agricultural and Livestock Farming Service (SAG, by its Spanish initials), through its spokesman Mr Guido Merino, assured that the strangles diagnoses were made during inspection visits carried out in this area, but these cases are circumscribed to certain areas and affected animals are currently being treated with antibiotics.

However, Mr Merino emphasized that his institution had not received any formal request from the local communities, and insisted that the diagnosis of strangles was made after a routine inspection visit in Alto Bio-Bio, an area located in the Chilean highlands.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of _Equidae_ characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and generally produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram positive, capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group C streptococcus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is a fever of 103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]. Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3-5 per cent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease to other horses. Those affiliated with the government veterinary office are quite conscious of biosecurity and are able to assist the track veterinarian and the owners with proper methods to avoid spreading the disease. - Mod.TG]
