FDA APPROVES IRRADIATION OF MEAT FOR PATHOGEN CONTROL

The Food and Drug Administration today approved irradiation of meat
products for controlling disease-causing micro-organisms. The approval
applies to fresh and frozen red meats such as beef, lamb and pork.
"Irradiation of meat could prove to be another important tool to protect
consumers from food-borne disease," said Michael A. Friedman, M.D., Lead
Deputy FDA Commissioner. "The process has been shown to be safe and to
significantly reduce bacterial contamination."
This approval is based on FDA's thorough scientific review of a substantial
number of studies conducted worldwide on the effects of irradiation on a
wide variety of meat products. The studies included examination of the
chemical effects of radiation, impact on nutrient content of irradiated
products, potential toxicity concerns, and effects on microorganisms in or
on irradiated products. FDA concluded that irradiation is safe in
reducing disease-causing microbes in or on meats, and that it does not
compromise the nutritional quality of treated products.
FDA has previously approved irradiation of poultry to control pathogens, of
pork for control of the trichina parasite, of foods such as fruits,
vegetables, and grains to control insects, and of spices, seasonings, and
dry enzymes used in food processing to control microorganisms.
Irradiation of food products to control food-borne disease in humans has
been generally endorsed by the United Nation's World Health Organization
and the American Medical Association.
Irradiation, although a potentially useful tool for helping reduce risk of
food-borne disease, is a complement to, not a replacement for, proper
food-handling practices by producers, processors, and consumers.
This approval is in response to a petition filed in August 1994 by Isomedix
Inc. of Whippany, N.J.

[Many thanks to Robert for this important information. Certainly, Jim
Steele and others who have advocated irradiation as a tool over the years
must feel gratified. It is important that irradiation is actually used as a
tool along with other steps in a farm to table food safety strategy rather
than a panacea. Food contamination can clearly occur after irradiation.
Likewise, farm-based, transport and slaughterhouse pathogen reduction
strategies must be ensure a clean product even if irradiation is added as
additional measure of food safety. Irradiation should never be used as the
only way we achieve safe food or else it will just obtain a bad name. It
already has a lot to overcome in this regard, not the least of which are
consumer perception and economics.- Mod.PC
