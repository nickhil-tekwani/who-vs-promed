Equine influenza - Australia (NSW, QLD): summary situation report,
issued at 4.30 PM [Australia time]
30 Aug 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This information is an update on the information provided on 28 Aug
2007, which should be referred to for background information [see
ProMED-mail 20070829.2836].
1. Key Points
--------------
Equine Influenza (EI) was 1st detected at Eastern Creek Quarantine
Station (ECQS), Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on 17 Aug
2007. Sick horses were seen on 22 Aug 2007 at Centennial Parklands
Equestrian Centre (CPEC) in Sydney.
There are currently 45 infected premises (IPs) in Australia; 4 of
these are in Queensland (Qld) and the remainder in NSW. More than 80
premises have been traced and assessed (e.g. awaiting laboratory
results) or are waiting to be assessed. Confirmed cases remain
confined to NSW and Qld.
A single case in a racehorse in a stable at Randwick racecourse in
Sydney has tested positive. Samples are being re-tested at the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) as a matter priority.
Exposure to other racehorses is very likely to have occurred. More
cases may be expected in Randwick stables in the future.
At this stage it is not possible to identify the index case. There is
an agreed national ban on horse movements in place till 1 pm Fri 31
Aug 2007. Risk based guidelines have been developed for the issuing
of permits to move equines in un-infected jurisdictions.
It is encouraging that almost all IPs have been detected on the basis
of tracing information. Recently, there has been evidence of lateral
spread between farms in some peri-urban areas. Extension efforts to
encourage high levels of bio-security are continuing.
2. Current situation
----------------------
Laboratory results from AAHL (Australian Animal Health Laboratory)
have shown the virus from the 1st 2 IPs, multiple other locations in
NSW, and from Warwick, Qld, to be H3 Equine Influenza.
New South Wales
---------------
IPs have been confirmed in the following locations: Centennial Park,
Moree, Parkes Showground, Berry, Wilberforce, Eastern Creek,
Tamworth, Cattai, Ourimbah, Mt Hunter, Kulnura, Aberdeen, Moonbi,
Muswellbrook, Maitland, Redfern, Lake Macquarie, and near Newcastle.
Eastern Creek Quarantine Station
--------------------------------
All horses are being monitored. On 29 Aug 2007 a horse under
observation was detected with an elevated temperature. Diagnostic
samples from this horse have been sent to AAHL. NSW has declared an
air exclusion zone for one nautical mile [1852 meter] around and for
700 feet [213.36 meters] above the ECQS facility.
Queensland
----------
More than 50 percent of horses at the IP at Warwick are showing
clinical signs. IPs are also located at Brisbane (Kenmore), Minden
(near Gatton), and Rosewood (near Brisbane). Restricted areas have
been, or are being declared around the 4 IPs. Investigation of
reportedly sick horses associated with IPs is a priority. Qld has
tested a consignment of NSW horses at Helidon that arrived from
Maitland over the weekend, with negative results. Their quarantine
period is over with no disease, but they remain contained due to the
standstill order.
Other jurisdictions
-------------------
All traces notified by NSW and Queensland have also been followed up.
Reported cases of equine respiratory disease have been investigated
with negative findings to date.
3. Response
---------------
A Local Disease Control Centre (LDCC) has been established at the NSW
DPI's (Department of Primary Industries) Elizabeth Macarthur
Agricultural Institute (EMAI) at Menangle via Camden just south of
Sydney. Queensland has established a local disease control centre
(LDCC) at Toowoomba and a State Disease Central Headquarters (SDCHQ)
in Brisbane.
10 km (6.2 mi) restricted areas have been declared around each of the
IPs. No movement of horses is permitted within, into, or out of these
areas. Further tracing of horse movements onto and off IPs is being
urgently undertaken. All tracing cases are being investigated and
inspected according to a formal protocol.
The public is being asked to report all horses with a fever and
respiratory signs to the LDCC for follow up.
