Poliovirus Weekly Update 27 Jun 2018, World Health Organization
-------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
New cVDPV cases reported this week: 8
[Note: there are 8 newly confirmed cVDPVs isolated from 7 actual paralytic polio cases. In one of the cases in Somalia, there were 2 virus types of cVDPV isolated from the case (cVDPV2 + cVDPV3) but an inability to determine which of the isolates was responsible for the paralytic disease in the affected individual. - Mod.MPP]

Headlines
- cVDPV outbreak in Papua New Guinea.

Summary of new cases this week:
- Papua New Guinea: cVDPV case type 1
- DR Congo: 3 cVDPV cases type 2
- Somalia: 1 cVDPV case combining type 2 and type 3 and, 2 cVDPV cases type 3.

Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 8.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) occurred in Kandahar province, with onset of paralysis on [27 Apr 2018].

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported this week. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3. The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki, Balochistan.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is 4, and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno State, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) is confirmed in Jigawa state, with isolation of the virus from environmental samples and 1 AFP case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018].
- 5 new cVDPV type 2s have been reported from environmental samples in Sokoto LGA with collection dates between [13 Mar 2018] and 9 May 2018.
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits, and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners supporting the local public health authorities to conduct outbreak field response. A round of mOPV2 vaccination covering part of Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi and Sokoto was implemented in May [2018] and early June [2018].

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- In May [2018], one polio vaccination campaign with bOPV took place, targeting vulnerable island populations in Lake Chad.

Central Africa
- 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). One in Mongala province with onset on [26 Apr 2018], a 2nd one in Ituri province with onset on 5 May [2018], and a 3rd one in Haut Katanga with onset on 14 May [2018].
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in the DRC in 2018 is 7.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Horn of Africa
- New circulating vaccine derived poliovirus cases were reported in Somalia: 1 cVDPV case combining type 2 and type 3 in Hiran province with onset on 11 May [2018] and 2 cVDPV cases type 3 in Middle Shabelle with onset on 16 and 23 of May [2018].
- 3 cVDPV positives from the environment are reported this week from Banadir province, Somalia: 1 cVDPV type 2 collected on 17 May [2018] and 2 cVDPV type 3 collected on [1 and 13 Feb 2018].
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

Papua New Guinea
- The PNG Government declared a cVDPV outbreak in Morobe province as a National Public Health Emergency.
- 1 case of cVDPV type 1 has been reported, and 2 cVDPV type 1 community contacts have been reported as well.
- The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with the GPEI partners in launching a comprehensive response. Some of the immediate steps include conducting large-scale immunization campaigns and strengthening surveillance systems that help detect the virus early. These activities are also being strengthened in neighbouring provinces.

[Starting with the good news, there are no new reports of WPV1 cases or WPV1 positive environmental samples. Are there truly no new isolates, or are there positive environmental samples awaiting further laboratory analyses?

Moving on to the not so good news, cVDPV is a problem. Five of the 8 newly confirmed cases this week have been reported as advanced notification (the case in Papua New Guinea, 1 of the 3 cases in the DR Congo, and the 3 cases in Somalia. These cases serve as heralds of areas with low vaccination coverage permitting the "silent" passage of the OPV viruses in these populations leading to mutations and reversion of neurovirulence of these vaccine viruses, so they are cVDPVs, able to be transmitted and result in paralytic cases similar to those seen with infection with WPVs. Questions that come to mind include: How long can a VDPV circulate undetected? Is it safe to say that after 3 years of no evidence of the virus in the environment that there is no cVDPV? (the WPV1 circulated undetected in Northern Nigeria for 5 years before surfacing in a small outbreak involving 4 clinical cases). Now that IPV has been introduced into an area with lower vaccination coverages with the OPV, if there is cVDPV in the area, will it continue circulating among IPV vaccinated individuals? Are there sufficient numbers of environmental sampling locations to serve as a good monitor for picking up WPV and cVDPV in the communities?
