Past history of H5N1 in Russia? (FAO bulletin 26?)
-----------------------------------------------
Regarding the H5N1 identified in Novosibirsk in July 2005, ProMED
posting 20050730.2216, 30 Jul 2005, cites CIDRAP News as follows: "If
the report is accurate, the outbreak marks the 1st known appearance
of the H5N1 virus in Russia."
However, according to the FAO bulletin Update on the Avian Influenza
situation (FAO AIDE NEWS, issue 26, 20 Dec 2004, see link and excerpt
below), H5N1 was identified in migrating birds there "during the past
4 years."
I don't know whether this was subsequently disproved, or whether
there is another reason for the statements that July 2005's H5N1
finding is the 1st in Russia, but I thought I would call the apparent
discrepancy to your attention for clarification. Please remember, I
am a psychiatrist, not a vet, and this stuff is hard for me to sort
out.
Here is the FAO citation:
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/AVIbull026.pdf>
"Russia: In the last issue of FAO AIDE news (No. 25) we published
information that may have misinterpreted the original scientific
data. We have subsequently learned that on several occasions H5N1
avian influenza viruses have been isolated from migrating birds in
the Novosibirsk region of Russia during the past 4 years. In 2003, an
H5 avian influenza virus was isolated and sequenced by the Laboratory
to Investigate and Monitor Emerging Zoonotic Diseases (Novosibirsk,
Russia) from a wild mallard duck on Lake Chany in the south of
Western Siberia. The A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian influenza virus was
related, but not identical, to H5N1 avian influenza viruses currently
circulating in domestic poultry in Asia. The virus's hemagglutinin
sequence showed 90-95 percent similarity to the current Asian H5N1,
which is in turn similar to Eurasian H5 avian influenza viruses
A/duck/Potsdam/1402-6/86 (H5N2) and A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1).
These data emphasize the need for continuing surveillance of
migratory birds for avian influenza viruses. Studies of these viruses
will increase the understanding of the ecology of avian influenza
viruses, including the transfer of these viruses between migratory
birds and domestic poultry. However, the A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian
influenza virus is not the same virus as the Asian H5N1, and is not
evidence of infection and spread of the current Asian H5N1 avian
influenza virus by migratory birds to areas outside infected Asian
countries/regions. (19 Nov 2005, source: Dr. Swayne, Southeast
Poultry Research Laboratory, USDA/ARS)."

[We are grateful to Dr. Lanard for her attentive observation. It
might be assumed that CIDRAP actually meant the 1st known H5N1
"outbreak" rather than "appearance" (of the virus) in Russia.
Dr. Lanard's query has been forwarded to Dr. David Swayne, the author
of the FAO citation. Dr. Swayne (Laboratory Director, Southeast
Poultry Research Laboratory USDA/ARS, <dswayne@seprl.usda.gov>) has
kindly forwarded to us the following clarification:
"All AI viruses are type A influenza viruses in the virus family of
_Orthomyxoviridae_, but are subdivided into subtypes based on
hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins using serological
tests. There are 16 H and 9 N subtypes thus potential for 144
different H and N combinations. In addition, all AI viruses fall into
one of 2 pathotypes: low (LPAI) and high (HPAI) pathogenicity.
The virus reported last spring from Novosibirsk is an H5 subtype,
but, based on sequencing, was related but not identical to the H5N1
HPAI viruses in SE Asia. They are like 3rd cousins, only related to
each other by 90-95 percent. In addition, the SE Asia H5N1 are HPAI
viruses, but the prior Novosibirsk virus is LPAI virus. The subtype
of the N has not been reported, so it could be any of the N1-9.
The current virus from Novosibirsk has been reported only over the
Internet as H5N1 and has not been verified as H5N1 by the OIE/FAO or
WHO reference laboratory. We must [suspend] judgment until verified."
We are very grateful to Dr. Swayne for his response. Final, official
data on the current Russian isolate are anticipated.

Precursor genes of future pandemic influenza viruses are perpetuated
in ducks nesting in Siberia. Arch Virol. 145(5):885-93. (..."the
genes of the isolates in Siberia are closely related to those of H5N1
influenza virus strains isolated from chickens and humans in Hong
Kong in 1997 as well as to those of isolates from domestic birds in
southern China.") - Mod.AS]
