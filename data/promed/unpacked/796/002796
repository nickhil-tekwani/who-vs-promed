Los Angeles County plans to require hospitals to begin reporting when patients are infected with a certain superbug so lethal that it can kill half its victims, health officials said Thursday [6 Oct 2016]. Unlike 2 dozen other states, California has not required hospitals to report when patients are sickened with the lethal bacteria, which federal officials warn is one of the nation's most urgent health threats. The hospitals will be advised of the new reporting requirement "in the next few months," said Dawn Terashita, deputy director of the county's acute communicable disease control program.

The change comes after the [LA] Times reported Sunday [6 Oct 2016] about how a Manhattan Beach resident [a woman] was sickened with CRE [Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae] after a May 2014 surgery at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. The patient's daughter said she called the county's public health department to report her mother's infection but was told it wasn't a reportable disease. [The patient] died from the CRE infection after spending 5 weeks in the hospital, mostly in the ICU, according to her medical records.

The county had stopped requiring hospitals to report CRE infections in 2012 "due to resource limitations," according to officials, although some hospitals had continued to voluntarily submit bacterial samples from patients stricken with the superbug.

Tershita said that the county does not plan to release the names of the hospitals reporting the CRE infections except in rare cases. "If we feel there is some reason to have the hospital identified to protect the patient, then we would," she said. She said health officials will use the data to "look for clusters of infections and prevent outbreaks."

Nursing homes and clinics won't be required to report when their patients are infected with CRE, Terashita said. California does not track how many patients die from infections acquired in hospitals, and the county will not require hospitals to report whether patients with CRE die or survive, Terashita said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimates that 75 000 hospital-acquired infection cases die during their hospitalizations each year. Some experts have challenged that number, saying it underestimates the number of deaths.

Since late 2014, CRE has caused 3 outbreaks at Los Angeles County hospitals, including at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, where 3 patients died. Those outbreaks were traced to a type of medical scope that has been shown to be especially difficult to disinfect. [The patient who died from CRE infection in 2014] had 2 scope procedures just before her surgery at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. Torrance Memorial officials did not answer questions about whether other patients were sickened [but] said they had ruled out medical scopes as the source of [this patient's] infection. They said the hospital "takes patient safety, particularly as it relates to infection control, very seriously."

Because of CRE's high risk, the CDC has advised local health officials to require health facilities to report such cases, and if that is not possible, health departments should still survey hospitals and nursing homes for the presence of the superbug to make sure the facilities are trying to stop its spread, according to the agency's guidelines. CRE cases gathered from 2010 to 2012 showed that LA County was "a high-prevalence region" for the superbug.

County officials said they had already been working to prevent the infections, including by sending public health nurses to hospitals to consult on potential outbreaks and proper infection controls.

[Carbapenem antibiotics include imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are not a nationally notifiable condition. To better understand the true number of infections caused by these organisms in the U.S., CDC collects information on CRE from 2 surveillance systems (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/TrackingCRE.html):
- The Multi-Site Gram-Negative Bacilli Surveillance Initiative or MuGSI collects data on 5 common strains of Enterobacteriaceae and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ at 10 sites across the country (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/eip/mugsi_techinfo.html).
- National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) tracks healthcare-associated infections of over 17 000 facilities nationwide (https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/).

Carbapenemase-producing CRE (CP-CRE) are currently believed to be primarily responsible for the increasing spread of CRE in the U. S. There are several different types of carbapenemases (e.g., KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM, and IMP). Figures showing the number and distribution of CP-CRE by U.S. states and Puerto Rico are available at: https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/TrackingCRE.html. KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae are the most widely distributed CP-CRE, being reported from all states and Puerto Rico, except for Idaho and Maine. The other less common carbapenemases reported in the U.S. are NDM, OXA-48, VIM, and IMP enzymes. - Mod.ML
