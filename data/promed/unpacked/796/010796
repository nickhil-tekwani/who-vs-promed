To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes under the WHO update. Information from the Worldometer data which as yet is not available as "a frozen time" for when we access the data will still be presented so a more current case count by countries with high activity can be searched by those who wish to see the data. Recognizing there are subscribers who do not wish to see these data I am reorganizing the post so the Worldometer table is the last post, in which case one can stop reading without having to wade through numbers of lesser interest. - Mod.MPP]

[1] Israel: school outbreaks
Date: Sun 31 May 2020
From: Eliana M. Aaron <eliana@healthcareisrael.com> [edited]


Cluster: high schools in Israel
There is currently, as of [31 May 2020], a cluster of 160 COVID-19 cases in the Gymnasium High School in Jerusalem started by a super spreader faculty member. 125 of these cases are students. The school closed last week with mass testing of students and staff underway.

Background
Israel has fared well during COVID-19 with strong measures put into place early, including social distancing, mandatory masks, contact tracing, and high compliance rates. Israel's CFR is currently 1.67% with total cases of 17 071, 285 deaths, and 86.6% of all cases recovered. Israel's numbers continued to drop with average daily new cases dropping from a peak of 598 the week of [30 Mar 2020] to 14.3 average daily new cases the week of [18 May 2020]. Throughout the weeks with low new case numbers and dropping death rates, the population became more lax on the 3 regulations mandated by the government: mandatory mask wearing, 2 meter [6 ft] social distancing, and increased hygiene/handwashing.

The demand for testing has decreased, and for weeks testing resulted in an average of 0.3% positive tests. Drive-through testing sites were closed, some COVID-19 wards closed. Furthermore, enforcement of regulations was weak in institutions and businesses despite the strict re-opening criteria and highly publicized guidelines.

In Israel, nurseries and grades 1-3 opened up with restrictions on [9 May 2020]. Grades 4-12 opened up with restrictions [17 May 2020]. On [19 May 2020], due to a severe heatwave, the government relaxed the mask wearing requirement in schools, outdoors, and in non-air conditioned buildings during the heatwave only (heatwave ended on [22 May 2020]). The details of who did not have to wear a mask were not well understood by the public, nor when the temporary reprieve expired.

Starting [26 May 2020] the national positive test ratio has increased to 1.8-6.2% of total daily tests (from the 0.3% ratio that had been stable for weeks).

On [26 May 2020] the Ministry of Health reported a cluster at the Gymnasium High School in Jerusalem, allegedly started by a "silent super spreader" who was reportedly asymptomatic. Within 2 days the school was closed. Students were seen on [25 May 2020] exiting the Gymnasium High School en masse with no masks or social distancing noted, despite regulations mandating masks and social distancing in schools.

Small outbreaks in other high schools around the country have been noted, and this seems to be the primary source of the current clusters seen. The Israel Ministry of Health has launched a new public education program to teach all students about the regulations, hoping for a trickle down effect for home education. The criteria for testing has been widened, and the public is encouraged to get tested if they have any symptoms or have known contact with actual or suspected cases. People in institutions where there has been a positive case will all be tested. Drive-through test sites have re-opened in major cities. Israel has the capability of testing many thousands of tests daily and had among the world's highest tests per capita rate for months with 61 804 tests per million population. Enforcement of COVID-19 public health regulations is a priority of the Ministry of Health in order to keep the economy open.

People ages 10-19 account for 15.8% of all COVID-19 cases in Israel, and compliance with social distancing and mask wearing is challenging in this population.

[ProMED would like to thank Dr Eliana M Aaron for sharing this information with us. The challenges of reopening schools are clearly identified by the school cluster presented above. Teenagers are notoriously non-compliant with health related messages, as seen with management of chronic diseases in this age cohort. With respect to COVID-19, there is the added challenge of a higher mild to no disease infection in this age group as seen by the lower age specific proportional infection rates. While one school is profiled in the report above, there is mention of multiple clusters occurring in other high schools around the country and the concurrent observed rise in positive testing rates and increased testing demand.

Other countries beginning the return to schools might take this in consideration and proactively plan for managing social distancing and mask use compliance in this population. - Mod.MPP

[2] COVID-19 mortality and cancer patients under treatment: The Lancet

ref: Lee LYW, Cazier JB, Starakey T, Turnbull CD, UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project Team, Kerr R, et al. COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer on chemotherapy or other anticancer treatments: a prospective cohort study. The Lancet. Online First. Published: 28 May 2020. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31173-9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.

Methods
In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the 1st COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission.

Findings
From [18 Mar 2020], to [26 Apr 2020], we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9.42 [95% CI 6.56-10.02]; p less than 0.0001), being male (1.67 [1.19-2.34]; p=0.003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1.95 [1.36-2.80]; p less than 0.001) and cardiovascular disease (2.32 [1.47-3.64]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1.18 [0.81-1.72]; p=0.380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks.

Interpretation
Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

A preliminary PubMed search came up with 116 articles using "COVID mortality, cancer" of which the 6 references below were the only ones not dealing with speculations or focused only on cancer treatment. Interestingly they all mentioned the co-exiting mortalities but none presented the data in the same manner as the article above controlling for the coexisting mortalities when assessing observed mortality rates. Clearly the story awaits more data and more studies, but this is a good step in the right direction.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 31 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Today we celebrate World No Tobacco Day. Smoking kills 8 million people worldwide each year and is associated with increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

- People living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from COVID-19. The pandemic has also caused NCD service disruption according to preliminary results of a rapid assessment, and WHO encourages governments to 'build back better'.

- The President of Costa Rica and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros launched the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool, a policy initiative aimed at making vaccines, tests, treatments, and other health technologies to fight COVID-19 accessible to all. The initiative has 5 priority areas. Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, has released a statement analysing the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and emphasizing that recovery must lead to a different economy, an economy of well-being.

- The WHO Regional Office for Africa has urged caution as countries ease lockdowns. WHO Regional Director Dr Moeti stressed that "Ending a lockdown is not an event, but a process..."

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 56.4% of the global newly reported cases and 69.4% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 40.6% were reported by Brazil, 32.0% the USA, Peru 9.8%, Chile 6.4%, and Mexico 4.9%.

The European region reported 17.2% of the global newly reported cases and 16.4% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 45.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by France 8.8%, the UK 7.9%, Turkey 4.9%, Belarus 4.4%, Spain 3.3%, and Sweden 3.2%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 12.8% of the global newly reported cases and 6.2% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 20.2% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Qatar 15.6%, Iran 15.1%, Saudi Arabia 10.7%, Egypt 9.1%, and Kuwait 6.7%.

The African region reported 3.2% of the global newly reported cases and 1.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 46.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 14.9%, Cameroon at 6.0%, Ghana at 4.1%, Kenya at 3.9%, Congo DR and Algeria at 3.6% each, and Senegal at 2.9%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of the global newly reported cases and 0.3% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 48.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore at 41.5%, Japan at 3.9%, and Malaysia 2.5%.

The South East Asia region reported 9.4% of the global newly reported cases and 6.1% of global fatalities. India reported 75.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 16.0%, Indonesia 5.0%, and Nepal 1.7%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 31 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas continues to increase, as does South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. This same shifting focus of activities as seen by the growth in percentages of total cases reported by each region (or decrease in proportion of cases reported by the European region) in the data presented above. - Mod.MPP]
