A fast-spreading disease has resulted in the death of dozens of cattle [see comment] in Chamar Khan, Mastuj village in Chitral. Shepherds in the village are unaware of the cause of this outbreak and fear the outcome will put a strain on their pocket.

Mir Khan, a shepherd, told The Express Tribune his goats and sheep were diagnosed with an ailment that weakens their stamina and kill them within a few hours.

"Cattle in the 12 villages of Chamar Khan will be afflicted by the disease if adequate measures are not taken to protect them," he said.

According to Mir, shepherds are facing losses worth millions of rupees on account of this outbreak. A majority of shepherds have slammed the livestock department for neglecting the matter.

Many shepherds believe the livestock department has neither collected data in this regard nor taken any efforts to combat the disease. Shepherds have repeatedly pressed the department to vaccinate their cattle.

At least 50 sheep and goats have been killed so far and many more are feared dead. Officials privy to the development told The Express Tribune 250 sheep and goats were shifted to veterinary hospitals for treatment. However, vaccinations are not available at most of these hospitals.

When contacted, Mastuj Livestock Office Veterinary Supervisor Akber Hayat said the technical term for this disease is peste des petits ruminants (PPR).

PPR is an acute or sub-acute viral disease of goats and sheep characterized by fever, necrotic stomatitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and sometimes death.

It was first reported in the Ivory Coast in 1942 and subsequently surfaced in other parts of West Africa. Goats and sheep appear to be equally susceptible to the virus, but goats exhibit more severe clinical disease. The virus also affects several wild small ruminant species. Cattle and buffalo are only subclinically infected. People are not at risk.

According to Hayat, veterinary medicines to counter this disease are not readily available at hospitals in Mastuj.

He said the livestock director has been informed about the fast-spreading disease.

"He has vowed to send medicines to Chitral via Peshawar soon," the supervisor said. "We can arrange medicines and vaccination on an urgent basis. However, people are reluctant to pay for them as the treatment is usually provided for free by the government."

Shepherds have pressed the livestock department to provide them vaccinations along with a proper veterinary team. They have also demanded measures should be taken to protect their cattle [see comment] as they cannot afford to lose more of their livestock.

[The title of the report above, as presented in the Pakistani daily Express Tribune, is "Epidemic: viral disease takes its toll on cattle in Chitral." This title (and repeated mentioning of cattle, allegedly infected, in the report itself) may be misleading. PPR (peste des petit ruminants; also known as kata, pseudorinderpest, and stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex) is an acute contagious disease caused by a morbillivirus in the family _Paramyxoviridae_, antigenically very similar to the rinderpest virus. It affects small ruminants and occasionally wild animals and, as apparent from recent reports, dromedary camels as well (in Sudan and Iran; see 20160521.4237105).

PPR occurs in countries in Africa lying between the equator and the Sahara, including countries of the Horn of Africa; since the late 1980s, the disease has spread to the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most if not the whole Middle East, and eastwards. Outbreaks of PPR are known to be common in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, the entire mega state China, north Africa, the Caucasus, and Tajikistan. Several events of undiagnosed fatal disease of camels, of which PPR was included among the listed suspected candidates, have been reported from Pakistan during the recent years; requested information is pending (see 20160521.4237105).

The event in Chitral deserves to be diagnosed/confirmed by laboratory tests, addressing small ruminants as well as cattle (hopefully excluding a morbillivirus in this species). Laboratory results, likely to confirm PPR in the small ruminants, are anticipated soon. To protect the Pakistani livestock owners from the devastating losses caused by PPR, vaccination deserves to be undertaken.

In case camels are kept on the same or adjacent premises as the affected animals, information on their health status will be of interest. - Mod.AS
