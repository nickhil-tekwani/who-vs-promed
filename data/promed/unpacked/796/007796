Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Infections Linked to Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 12 Jan 2018, 25 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] I 4,[5],12:b:- (24 people) or serotype Newport (1 person) have been reported from 9 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page. One more ill person infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ I 4,[5],12:b:- has been reported from Canada.

State / Case Count
California / 9
Colorado / 1
Connecticut / 1
Massachusetts / 2
New Jersey / 1
New York / 1
Oklahoma / 1
Pennsylvania / 5
Washington / 4
Total / 25

WGS showed that isolates from people infected with _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- are closely related genetically. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. Illnesses started on dates ranging from [Thu 11 May 2017] to [Sat 4 Nov 2017]. Ill people range in age from one year to 82, with a median age of 19. Among ill people, 19 (76 percent) are male. 6 people (24 percent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut is the likely source of this multistate outbreak. This investigation is ongoing. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Ten (63 percent) of 16 people interviewed reported eating or maybe eating coconut. Of these 10 people, 8 (80 percent) reported having an Asian-style dessert drink that contained frozen shredded coconut.

Throughout the outbreak investigation, state and local health officials have collected different food items from restaurants where ill people consumed Asian-style dessert drinks. In November 2017, laboratory testing of a sample from coconut milk made in one restaurant in New York did not identify the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:-, but did identify a strain of _Salmonella_ Newport. This sample was from coconut milk made with Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut, as well as other ingredients. WGS showed that the _S._ Newport isolated from the coconut milk was closely related genetically to a _S._ Newport isolate from an ill person from Massachusetts who had consumed an Asian-style dessert drink.

In December 2017, officials in Massachusetts collected food items from a restaurant where that ill person had consumed Asian-style dessert drinks. One sample from frozen shredded coconut identified a strain of _Salmonella_ that was new to the PulseNet database and has not been linked to any illnesses. This sample was from an unopened package of Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut. As a result, on [Wed 3 Jan 2018], Evershing International Trading Company recalled all Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut. The recalled product was packaged in 16-ounce plastic bags.

Officials in Massachusetts returned to the restaurant and collected more Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut in January 2018. On [Fri 12 Jan 2018], laboratory testing confirmed that samples from that frozen shredded coconut identified the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:-. Laboratory testing of other samples identified several types of Salmonella bacteria, including _S._ Javiana, _S._ Rissen, and _S._ Thompson. These samples were from unopened packages of Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut sold before [Wed 3 Jan 2018]. CDC is reviewing the PulseNet database to determine if the other isolates from the frozen shredded coconut are linked to any illnesses.

The frozen shredded coconut linked to this outbreak was used as an ingredient in Asian-style dessert drinks served at restaurants. The product was also sold in grocery stores and markets in several states. Frozen shredded coconut can last for several months if kept frozen and may still be in retail stores or in people's homes. CDC recommends that retailers not sell, restaurants not serve, and consumers not eat recalled Coconut Tree Brand frozen Shredded Coconut.

This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates when they are available.

[_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:b:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5] 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case b:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.
