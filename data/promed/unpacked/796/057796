Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections
---------------------------------------
Since the last update on 21 Jul 2020, an additional 87 ill people have been reported in this outbreak, including 38 from 8 new states: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Virginia.

As of 23 Jul 2020, a total of 212 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport have been reported from 23 states.

Total / 212

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2020 to 11 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from 0 to 92 years, with a median age of 40, and 54% of ill people are female. Of 117 ill people with information available, 31 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 48 isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
On 10 Jul 2020, CDC PulseNet identified an outbreak of 13 _S._ Newport infections in 3 states. Since being identified, the outbreak has rapidly grown to a total of 212 infections in 23 states.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started. The CDC encourages people experiencing symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection to report their illness to their local health department and participate in these interviews. This information is vital for public health officials to identify the source of this outbreak and to take steps to prevent additional illnesses.

At this time, the investigation has not identified a specific food, grocery store, or restaurant as the source of this outbreak. The CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.
