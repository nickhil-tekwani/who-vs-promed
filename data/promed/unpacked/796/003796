_Plum pox virus_ detected in Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees
--------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of France recently
informed EPPO [European Plant Protection Organisation] of the
detection of _Plum pox virus_ (family _Potyviridae_; PPV - EPPO A2
List) in Aquitaine and Midi-Pyrenees. The presence of PPV was detected
for the 1st time in a nursery in Midi-Pyrenees region. Tracing-back
studies showed that the PPV-infected material originated from another
nursery in Aquitaine region, which was also found to be infected.

Further investigations will be carried out to determine the original
source of this infection. Both nurseries were producing propagation
material for the national and local markets, and no material belonging
to the infested lots has been exported outside France. Phytosanitary
measures are currently being taken: plant destruction, withdrawal of
plant passports for the production sites concerned (that is, all plots
with propagation material of _Prunus_ within a radius of 1000 m [0.6
mi] around the infected plot) for a minimum period of 3 years,
intensive surveys in _Prunus_ growing plots within a radius of 2500 m
[1.5 mi] around the infected sites and testing of asymptomatic
plants.

_Plum pox virus_ detected in Denmark
------------------------------------
In Denmark, _Plum pox virus_ (genus _Potyvirus_, PPV - EPPO A2 List)
was detected for the 1st time in 1986 and subsequently eradicated.
>From 2008 to 2010, annual surveys were carried out. All Danish
nurseries and garden centers were inspected twice a year and trees
were sampled (at random and when suspicious symptoms were observed).

As a result, PPV was detected in 5 sites (4 nurseries and 1 garden
centre) during that period. Tracing-back studies showed that some PPV
infections were linked to imports from other EU member states and that
one could be traced back to one Danish orchard. Eradication measures
have been taken in all infected sites.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus)
has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the
Americas, but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It
affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent
yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also
susceptible including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual
plants.

Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may
include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to
premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless
in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into several
strains according to their serological and molecular properties, and
some strains do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical
inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not known
to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance
of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being
debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of
introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult
but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus
reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material.
Resistant cultivars are available for several types of stone fruits.
