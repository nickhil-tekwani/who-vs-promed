A young girl suspected of having bird flu has died on the Indonesian
island of Sumatra, a hospital official said today [21 Oct 2007]. "She
was admitted on Saturday [20 Oct 2007] but died less than 12 hours
later, at around 11 pm (0200 AEST)," said Azizman Daad, a doctor at
the Arifin Achmad hospital in Riau province. Daad said that samples
from the 10-year-old's body were to be sent to the capital Jakarta
for testing to confirm the cause of death. Local tests indicated that
she had bird flu.

The official human death toll from bird flu in Indonesia is 88, the
highest in the world. Most human cases have come from contact with
infected poultry, but Daad said it was not immediately clear whether
that was the case for the girl.

The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is endemic in birds across nearly
all of Indonesia. Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation,
has reported 109 bird flu infections, including the fatalities, since
it recorded its 1st case in July 2005.

[If this suspected case of H5N1 avian influenza is confirmed, the
deceased 10-year-old will become the 110th human case and the 89th
fatality to have occurred in Indonesia. Previously, there have been
only 4 cases and 3 deaths in Riau province on the island of Sumatra.
