Japan: Hepatitis E Virus Detected in Liver and Blood of Wild Boar
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Government researchers have [detected the RNA] of hepatitis E virus in wild
boars trapped in 4 prefectures, Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry research
groups have reported. The [RNA] that was detected is very similar to that
found in hepatitis E [virus-infected] patients who contracted the virus in
2003 in Hyogo and Tottori prefectures, strongly suggesting that the people
contracted the virus from wild boar meat. Noting that heat kills the virus,
the ministry has urged people to cook wild boar thoroughly and avoid eating
it raw or rare.
2 research groups captured 85 wild boars in Nagano, Aichi, Wakayama, Hyogo
and Nagasaki prefectures between November 2003 and April 2004. The
researchers detected the virus' [RNA] in the liver and blood of 8 boars; 3
each in Hyogo and Nagasaki prefectures, and one each in Aichi and Wakayama
prefectures. Among these, the [RNA] found in boar in Aichi, Wakayama and
Hyogo prefectures was virtually identical to that found in the patients.
In Nagasaki and Tottori prefectures during 2003, the virus was discovered in
a number of people, each of whom had eaten wild boar meat and liver. The
boar meat had been strongly suspected as the cause, but until now,
researchers had not found any decisive evidence.

[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is globally distributed and is transmitted
enterically as well as between humans and animals. Phylogenetic analysis has
identified 5 distinct HEV genotypes (types III and V have been confirmed as
present in Japan). In developing countries HEV is transmitted principally by
the fecal-oral route, and water-borne epidemics are common. In
industrialized countries zoonotic transmission may be more usual. Sporadic
cases of hepatitis E have been reported in Japan in the past, and widespread
infection of HEV has been reported among wild rats in different parts of the
country. Zoonotic spread of HEV is indicated by the fact that human and
swine isolates of HEV are quite similar in terms of nucleotide sequence, and
experimental cross-species transmission of swine HEV to a chimpanzee and of
human HEV to swine have been demonstrated. The detection of hepatitis E
virus in 8 of 85 wild boar in 5 prefectures inn Japan confirms the suspicion
that the outbreaks of hepatitis E virus infection in Nagasaki and Tottori
prefectures in 2003 (described in the ProMED-mail posts listed below) were
initiated by the consumption of improperly cooked wild boar meat. - Mod.CP]
