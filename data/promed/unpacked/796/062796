The following comments are in response to the statement [in the ProMED
posting referenced below]: "The Animal Health Laboratory at the University
of Guelph said thoroughbreds -- pure breeds -- also have contracted herpes
in the suspected outbreak."
It is a common misconception that the term "thoroughbreds" is synonymous
with pure breeds in the horse world. Both Thoroughbred and Standardbred
horses, along with many other "pure" breeds (e.g., Appaloosa, American
Quarter Horse, Morgan, Arabian, etc.) are breed designations.
Mixed breed horses are described simply as grade or crossbreeds, often with
the underlying crosses described, such as Thoroughbred x Morgan. Quarter
Horses aren't one quarter anything [their name comes from their high speed
for distance up to a quarter mile]; they are a breed, comparable to, say, a
Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog.
Thoroughbreds are the breed represented in the racing industry in the US
with riders on the back that compete in commonly recognized races such as
the Kentucky Derby.
Standardbreds are a racing breed that competes at a trot or pace gait in
harness, pulling a sulky and driver. American Quarter Horses are a
multipurpose breed that also race in less well-recognized events, competing
with a rider on their back, for shorter distances than Thoroughbreds,
typically one quarter mile.
Animals that are recognized by the breed association as "purebred" will
have registration papers to prove the fact. Racing associations require
competing individuals to have registration papers. A news story indicating
the involvement of Thoroughbreds in a disease outbreak has significance
because it may imply the involvement of valuable racing, training, or
breeding animals, which often travel widely around this continent and the
world.
