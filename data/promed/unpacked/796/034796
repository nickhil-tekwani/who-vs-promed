A peach tree in a commercial grove in Adams County has been found to
have the plum pox virus, the 1st such finding of 2006, the state
Department of Agriculture said.
"Our surveyors have found the 1st positive commercial orchard tree
this year. It's located in the quarantined area of Menallen Township,
Adams County," Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff said.
"There will be no need to expand the quarantine area as a result of
this detection," Wolff said. "A single tree in an 8-acre block of
peach trees has tested positive for the virus, and only one grower is
affected. In total, 15 acres of stone fruit trees will have to be
removed as a result of the detection."
Plum pox virus severely decreases fruit production, the department
said in a news release. Infected fruit may appear deformed or
blemished and could drop prematurely from trees, it said.
"However, Plum Pox causes no harm to animals or people who eat
diseased fruit," the release said.
It said USDA surveyors have found two residential properties with
infected trees. One property is in South Middleton Township,
Cumberland County, within an existing quarantine area. The other is
in Franklin Township, Adams County, where a small quarantine area
will be established.
Homeowners in both places have been contacted and the infected plants
have been removed, the department said.
When a virus-infected tree is found, the department establishes a
500-meter buffer zone around the infected tree and orders removal and
destruction of all stone fruit trees within the zone.
Plum pox is a latent virus and typically requires 2 to 3 years of
testing before it can be detected in a tree.
A small area around the homeowner property in Franklin Township will
be quarantined, making the municipality the seventh in Adams County
to be impacted by the quarantine, the department said.
"Pennsylvania has an effective eradication program for this disease,"
said Wolff. "Although we continue to find positive samples, we've
seen a tremendous decline in the virus since we started the program in 1999."
A ban on planting stone fruit trees is in place for homeowners in all
areas under quarantine.
Plant species included in the ban on planting are peach, nectarine,
apricot, cherry and plum fruit trees, as well as many ornamental and
flowering fruit trees and shrubs such as purple leaf plum, sand
cherry, flowering almond and flowering cherry.
Wolff said his department will continue to survey the affected areas
and expects to conduct at least 230 000 tests this year.

[The fruit crop plant peach, _Prunus persica_, develops virus
symptoms in the fruit when infected by the plum pox virus (family:
Potyviridae, genus Potyvirus).
The virus was first detected in the USA in 1998, and since that time
an effort at detection and eradication has managed to suppress the
virus well. There have been no reports in ProMED-mail since 2000
(20000123.0120) in the USA, and the summary provided in this report
is a well-written update on the current efforts and practices used to
manage the virus in Pennsylvania. Despite the success at
suppression, the new report is a reminder that eradication remains
elusive. The web site quoted in the report is very complete and the
link to plum pox virus is provided in "Links:".
