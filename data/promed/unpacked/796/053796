In early July 2021, an alert of a suspected outbreak was raised to the Health Division of Tshopo Province in the north-eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The initial alert followed an increase in deaths among people presenting with symptoms including fever, headache, and stiff neck, and some with bloody diarrhea. Samples of blood and stool were collected and tested for Ebola virus disease, shigellosis, and salmonellosis. These tested negative on [19 Aug 2021] by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) lab in Kinshasa.

Meningitis was suspected and as of [16 Sep 2021], a total of 37 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sent from the University Clinics Laboratory of Kisangani to INRB lab in Kinshasa. Of these, 7 were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris on [1 Sep 2021] from Kinshasa, and were confirmed to be _Neisseria meningitidis_ by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on [6 Sep 2021]. Additional testing (serotyping) was conducted on these samples from [6 to 13 Sep 2021], which were identified as serogroup W by Pasteur Institute Lab in Paris. The remaining 30 samples are planned to be sent to Pasteur Institute, Paris.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that this strain of meningococcus was susceptible to ceftriaxone. Preliminary retrospective investigations suggested that the outbreak started in early June [2021] in 2 mining areas in Banalia Health Zone in the north of Kisangani, the capital of Tshopo Province. This outbreak is currently active and cases continue to be reported.

As of [18 Sep 2021], a total of 608 suspected including 12 confirmed cases of meningitis, and 161 deaths (case fatality ratio of 26%), have been reported in the Banalia health zone. Among these cases, 68% (416/608) are aged 15 years or older. Additionally, 16 out of the 20 health areas of the Banalia health zone have notified at least one suspected case of meningitis.

Public health response
----------------------
The national health authorities, in coordination with WHO, are providing support in responding to this event. The response measures include the following:
- The local committee for the management of health emergencies is conducting regular meetings to coordinate response activities at the provincial level as well as in the Banalia health zone;
- a reactive vaccination campaign against meningitis, with vaccine containing meningococcal W antigen, is being planned;
- continuation of in-depth investigations at community level to determine the epidemiological links;
- active search for contacts and suspected cases in the mining quarries and in the community;
- strengthening of community-based surveillance;
- organized mobile clinics to support case management, sample collection, and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures in the affected areas;
- supplying additional 5000 doses of ceftriaxone by the International Coordination Group (ICG) to reinforce the antibiotic stock;
- implementing risk communication activities.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Since 2015, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported a high number of suspected cases of meningitis. Parts of the country lie within the African meningitis belt [1], where bacterial meningitis is endemic and also experiences epidemics, with 6000 to 10 000 suspected cases reported annually. However, only a very small proportion (0-2%) of cases are laboratory confirmed each year.

From [1 Jan to 1 Aug 2021], the DRC reported a cumulative total of 3842 suspected cases including 189 deaths, representing a case-fatality ratio of 5%.

In Tshopo Province, which is in the African meningitis belt, the last meningitis epidemic was reported in November 2009, with 214 cases and 18 deaths (case-fatality ratio of 8%). In May 2016, the province organised a preventive vaccination campaign against meningitis A during which almost 1.7 million people aged between 1 and 29 years were vaccinated. Since then, passive surveillance has been implemented in the province as part of integrated disease surveillance.

Meningococcal meningitis is associated with a high case-fatality ratio (up to 50% when left untreated) and a high incidence (over 10%) of severe sequelae. The current event has already affected 608 people, with 161 deaths. The number of cases and deaths is expected to increase given the infectiousness and lethality of bacterial meningitis.

Logistical challenges, in addition to accessing and communicating with many areas within the health zone, further prevents implementation of an adequate response.

Additionally, the country is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which is impacting the health systems and disease surveillance capacities; and the existence of other ongoing epidemics in the country is limiting resources for the response to the meningitis outbreak.

At the national level, there is a high risk of the disease spreading to other health zones and to the city of Kisangani, the capital of Tshopo province, due to the movement of people between the affected area and other parts of the country.

At the regional level, the risk is assessed to be moderate due to the cross-border movements between the populations of the Central African Republic and the Tshopo province, and more than 100 mining sites in Banalia where people from neighbouring provinces and the Central African Republic travel for work. Although cross-border measures against COVID-19 may limit the travel and also enhance detection of symptomatic cases.

The risk at global level is assessed to be low.

WHO advice
----------
It is necessary to strengthen the country's capacity and provide necessary means for diagnosis in order to respond to the current epidemic in an effective manner. Adequate logistics, proper training of healthcare workers on case identification and notification, and conducting risk communications in the affected health areas to heighten community awareness on measures to prevent transmission of meningitis, what symptoms should be monitored, and when to seek care, as well as strengthening community surveillance and lab capacity are critical in order to organize the response.

Additionally, the country should prepare and conduct a rapid meningitis W vaccination campaign for at-risk populations.

Authorities should strengthen clinical management with ceftriaxone, provide psychosocial care for patients and families, and monitor patients affected by sequelae during and after the disease.

WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade with the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the information available on the current outbreak.

[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are divided into territories and cities. Banalia, the community affected by the meningococcal meningitis outbreak, is a territory in the province of Tshopo, in the north-central part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banalia_Territory); the provincial capital of Tshopo is the city of Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), with an estimated population of 1.2 million residents in 2020 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisangani). A map showing the location of Tshopo can be found at http://goo.gl/DM2AT8. A map showing the location of Banalia can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/Yo1GJifUCGnZjsre9.

The "African Meningitis Belt" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east, where numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported each year during the dry season, between December and June, and every 5-12 years large outbreaks occurred (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/meningococcal-disease). Before mass preventive immunization campaigns with a meningococcal conjugate serogroup A vaccine, which started in 2010, serogroup A meningococcus accounted for an estimated 80-85% of all cases in the meningitis belt. As of June 2015, over 220 million persons aged 1 to 29 years received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in 15 countries of the African meningitis belt; since then, the proportion of serogroup A declined dramatically, but other meningococcal serogroups such as serogroups W, X, and C have replaced serogroup A, although at a lower frequency and smaller size of the outbreaks (https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/meningococcal-meningitis and https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/Supplement_4/S274/5610778). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-meningitis-belt-of-sub-Saharan-Africa-and-meningococcal-serogroup-A-conjugate-vaccine_fig1_320819976.

Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis, many due to meningococcus serogroup A, have occurred in the DRC in the past (see ProMED posts listed below) and a mass meningococcal conjugate A vaccination campaign took place in 6 DRC provinces that vaccinated about 18 million people (aged 1-29 years) between 2016-2018 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822965/). The report above from WHO confirms that almost 1.7 million people aged between 1 and 29 years of age were vaccinated against meningococcus serogroup A in 2016 in Tshopo province.

Following the mass introduction of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African meningitis belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by the emergence of meningococcal disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.

In fact, in 7 of 37 CSF samples in the current outbreak in Tshopo province, the pathogen has been determined to be _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W; serogroup typing on the other 30 samples is still pending.

To stop the spread of serogroup W, WHO reports above that a rapid mass meningococcal meningitis serogroup W vaccination campaign in Tshopo province is planned for at-risk populations. Vaccines that target serogroup W contain 4 meningococcal surface polysaccharides A, C, W, and Y chemically bonded ("conjugated") to a protein to produce a robust immune response to the polysaccharide. We anticipate further reports on the progress being made to control this outbreak. - Mod.ML
