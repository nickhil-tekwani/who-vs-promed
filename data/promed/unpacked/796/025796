Leptospirosis has been diagnosed clinically in 2 men recently
returned from a fishing holiday at a resort in the Picardie region of
northern France. One case has since been serologically confirmed.
Both patients were at the same resort at the same time (mid-September
2006), and became unwell about a week after their return to the UK.
We wish to alert clinicians and laboratory staff to the possibility
of leptospirosis in people who have been on similar activity holidays.
Leptospires infect a variety of wild and domestic animals, including
rodents, cattle and pigs, which then excrete organisms in their
urine. Leptospires are naturally aquatic organisms and are found in
fresh water, damp soil, vegetation, and mud. Human leptospirosis thus
usually occurs following exposure to water or environments
contaminated by infected animal urine, and is associated with a
variety of occupations and activities in which this contact occurs;
farming, agricultural work and sewer maintenance. Recreational
activities with possible exposure include canoeing, windsurfing,
swimming in lakes and rivers, pot holing, and fishing.
Typically, symptoms develop 7 to 14 days after infection, though, on
rare occasions the incubation period may be short as 2 to 3 days or
as long as 30 days. Symptoms vary, and are usually biphasic. There is
an abrupt onset of a flu-like illness with high fever, severe
headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting. Jaundice, red eyes,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, or a rash may follow.
The relevant authorities in France are being informed.

[It is important to be aware that this infection is not just one
associated with flooding in the developing world. Clinically,
obtaining and interpreting the appropriate epidemiologic information
(such as determining that those affected had been on a fishing trip)
is vital in making a diagnosis.
