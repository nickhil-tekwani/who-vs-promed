More than 30 000 stray canines roam the streets [in Oruro], causing 10
cases of dog bites per day.

There have been 10 cases of canine rabies confirmed by laboratory
tests and have put the citizens of Oruro on alert. Meanwhile, the
officials of the departmental [state of province equivalent] Health
Services (SEDES) seek to avoid transmission between the more than 30
000 dogs that roam the streets of this capital, without control by
owners and without vaccination.

The last vaccination was carried out this past August [2011] and
managed to immunize 53 854 canines of the nearly 83 498 dogs that
exist within the Oruro jurisdiction, a number estimated by the
Zoonoses Unit of SEDES, but it is likely that the number will increase
with the individuals that live in the department's provinces. The head
of the Zoonosis Unit, Ernesto Vasquez, said that its personnel are in
an emergency [situation] to control the disease in dogs that have been
identified, especially in neighborhoods peripheral to the city and in
the population surrounding Oruro, Machacamarca.

Oruro is a city where people love dogs, but also, there are thousands
of people who raise dogs only to abandon them on the streets. There is
no place free of dogs. The number of dogs has increased in Oruro in
recent years, and dog bites continue to increase. In 2001, for
example, there were 915 dog bites, while in 2005, they increased to
1065. The highest number was registered last year [2010], with a total
of 1598, according to the statistics prepared by the Zoonosis Unit.

In the markets, the dogs lurk under the seats where food is sold,
waiting so that someone will give them a bone. People who love dogs
eat a little and then share their food with the hungry dogs.

Citizens are protesting to SEDES about the massive numbers of stray
dogs in the streets of Oruro. Meanwhile, the people who are unable to
avoid it have to step on dog feces on the sidewalks.

International Fight Against Rabies Day is 28 Sep [2011], and it is
expected that by this date, the inauguration of the Zoonosis Center
will take place. It is estimated that at least 250 animals will be
caught and eliminated in this facility each month.

[There has been a canine rabies problem in Cochabamba department this
year (2011). Now, clearly, Oruro has a significant stray dog problem
that has become acute with the presence of rabies in the canine
population there. The repeat of a vaccination program focused on both
owned and stray street dogs would likely provide faster reduction of
the rabies risk than implementing culling. Culling stray dogs later
could then be a 2nd step, avoiding disruption of the susceptible stray
population that might lead to greater risk of transmission as the
remaining strays fight over territory.
