MEASLES - NEW ZEALAND

New Zealand is now experiencing a measles epidemic, the first since 1991.
The epidemic began in February and March 1997 with community outbreaks in
Auckland and Hamilton. Case numbers increased rapidly during April, May
and June and measles spread to affect most geographical regions of New
Zealand.
To the end of June 1997, there had been 927 notifications of which 422 had
been confirmed by laboratory testing or by a history of contact with a
laboratory confirmed case. Of these cases 54 were hospitalised. There
have been no measles deaths reported. Highest rates of disease have been
in those aged 6-8 months (658.0 per 100,000) followed by those aged 9-11
months (570.3 per 100,000). Rates of disease are markedly higher in
Pacific Islands people (118.4 per 100,000) and Maori (27.7 per 100,000)
than in European (16.0 per 100,000).
The Ministry of Health and the regional health authorities (RHAs) have
introduced an intensified immunisation programme to control measles.
This programme involves identifying local outbreaks of the disease, and
co-ordinating a prompt and intensified local response, including
vaccination of all 2-10 year old children with an early second dose of
MMR vaccine, in place of the dose that is usually given at 11 years of age.
The intensified immunisation programme may involve further adjusting
recommendations for the age of vaccination depending on the age of those
affected by the local outbreak.
Weekly and Monthly updates on measles can be accessed on the New Zealand
Ministry of Health's Web site (http://www.moh.govt.nz/pubs_on.htm).
Articles and notes on the epidemic are also published in the New Zealand
Public Health Report, which is also found on that web site.
