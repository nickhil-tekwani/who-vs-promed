As many as 30 hepatitis B & C patients were detected out of 300 who reached the Blood Screening Camp organized by the doctors and lab technicians of the Hepatitis Treatment & Prevention Center of Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Larkana, here on 1 May 2017 at Town Hall. Out of these 30 patients, 10 had hepatitis B, and 20 were suffering from C viral disease, which has hit the poor populace hard.

Of these 300 people, 130 were women and 170 men. Out of 500 other people who were screened for diabetes, 150 were found suffering from the same disease, and the doctors claimed to have provided them with required medicines and treatment. Those in whom hepatitis was detected were asked to get their blood tested with ELISA and PCR tests at Larkana so that treatment could be provided.

Dr. Jehangir Awan, Dr. Rahmatullah Soomro and Dr Manzoor Hussain of CMCH supervised the camp and examined the patients. The camp was inaugurated by Municipal Committee Chairman Allah Dino Bhutto who talking to the media said that the camp has been organized on the directions of MNA [Member of National Assembly] Faryal Talpur who is now determined to provide all required medical facilities to the ailing population of Naudero [a town in Larkana district] and its adjoining areas and villages.

He said that she has directed the project director of Hepatitis Program to open a treatment center at Naudero within a month, adding that funds have also been released, and work has also been accelerated on the establishment of a trauma center and cardiology ward here in the hometown of martyred Bhutto leaders.

[In the absence of a history of injected drug abuse, many cases of these bloodborne viral infections in the developed world are caused by non-sterile reused needles and other medical devices. HBV is also commonly transmitted perinatally, HCV much less so. Both HBV and HCV remain significant causes of chronic liver disease manifested by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Preventing these diseases relates to prevention of primary infection via the HBV vaccine and strong efforts to minimize transmission by safe sexual practices, and prevention of injection-associated transmission, and treatment, which is most useful at this point in HCV.
