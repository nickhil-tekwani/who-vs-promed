Viet Nam: tamiflu active against most recent avian influenza virus isolates
-----------------------------------------------
Roche's influenza drug oselamivir (Tamiflu) suppresses the often deadly
strain of avian influenza [virus] seen in Viet Nam, which experts fear will
soon cause a human pandemic, US researchers said on Monday [18 Jul 2005].
They stated that tests in mice showed the drug, licensed for use against
influenza in general, could suppress the newest strain of avian A (H5N1)
influenza virus that is sweeping though flocks of poultry in Viet Nam,
Cambodia, China, and elsewhere in Asia.
Public health experts say the avian flu virus is mutating and fear it could
develop the ability to spread easily from person to person and kill
millions in a flu pandemic. The H5N1 strain [serotype] has killed more than
50 people in Asia since 2003. More than 140 million chickens have been
killed in the region in a bid to halt the disease.
"We need to know whether antiviral drugs can prevent and treat avian flu,
because in the early stages of a global outbreak, most people would be
unvaccinated," said Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the study. "If a pandemic
occurs, it will take months to manufacture and distribute a vaccine to all
who need it."
The team at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee
tested 80 mice with oseltamivir. None of the mice that got a placebo and
then were infected with the Viet Nam strain of H5N1 survived. 5 of 10 mice
given the highest daily dose of oseltamivir for 5 days survived. But,
writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the researchers said 8 of 10
mice given the drug for 8 days lived. This will help experts decide how
much drug to use and how long to treat people should the virus begin to
spread among humans.
The researchers found the new Viet Nam strain is much more virulent [in
mice?] than a 1997 variant of H5N1 that killed 6 people in Hong Kong. "The
H5N1 avian influenza viruses are in a process of rapid evolution. We were
surprised at the tenacity [?] of this new variant," said St Jude researcher
Elena Govorkova. "Our results provide baseline information that will be
needed for further studies on preventing and treating avian influenza with
antiviral drugs."
Governments are buying and stockpiling doses of Tamiflu to use in case of
an avian flu pandemic, but experts say they will need many more than the
few million doses now on hand.

[The neuraminidase protein (NA) of influenza virus determines the
N-antigenic type of the virus. The NA protein cleaves terminal sialic acid
residues from glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides. It plays an
important role in the spread of influenza virus from cell-to-cell, because,
in cleaving sialic acid residues, it releases virus bound to the surface of
infected cells, thereby facilitating spread of virus through the
respiratory tract. Inhibition of viral neuraminidase activity both
diminishes the spread of virus through the respiratory tract and has the
added benefit of reducing virus shedding. Tamiflu is an orally deliverable
compound that specifically inhibits the activity of the influenza virus NA
protein and which, unlike the other influenza antivirals (amantadine and
rimantadine), exhibits few side effects. In human trials, the greatest
benefit is seen in those patients presenting <30 hours after development of
influenza symptoms, those with severe symptoms, or those in high risk
groups. In addition to treatment of the infection, neuraminidase inhibitors
are effective prophylactically and have been shown to limit spread (by
shedding) of infection in close communities, such as families and in
nursing homes. The mouse experiments described in the above report are
encouraging in that a recent isolate of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus from
Viet Nam retains full sensitivity to Tamiflu as judged by assay in mice.
The cost effectiveness and practicality of using neuramindase inhibitors in
the control of influenza virus infection, however, remains an open
question. - Mod.CP]
