Investigations are still ongoing at a Uttoxeter abattoir [slaughterhouse] after a slaughterman became the only meat worker in the country to die after contracting bovine tuberculosis (TB).

[The patient], of Stramshall, died at Burton's Queen's Hospital on 28 May 2012 after contracting the disease, which is usually a major killer of cattle and wildlife.

Now the Health and Safety Executive has revealed a full investigation into TS Sargeant Abattoir, in Roycroft Grange, Bramshall, where [the patient] worked, is ongoing.

Dr Ian Scott, a consultant pathologist at Queen's Medical Centre, in Nottingham, told the inquest, held at Burton Town Hall, that the limited post mortem concentrated on his chest and samples were sent to Birmingham, which confirmed the unusual cause of death.

He said the bovine TB is contracted by contact with an infected animal carcass through "aerosol" spread such as blood and urine.

Dr Scott said it was difficult to know how long the 53-year-old had the infection as it had spread throughout his body. However, he had suspicions it was a probably a more recent infection that had spread quickly.

[The patient] was always with beef cattle as he would rear them and then work as a slaughterman for the abattoir, which is registered to slaughter cattle infected with bovine TB.

Lynne Spooner, an inspector for the HSE [Health and Safety Executive], said an investigation had originally been carried out to ensure there was not an epidemic as the abattoir was registered to take infected cattle from surrounding farms as well as from [the patient]'s own farm.

Her investigation did raise concerns as she found the cattle infected with bovine TB were being slaughtered but there were no controls in place to stop the aerosols from the carcasses.

Miss Spooner found there was a presence of bovine TB and the workers were being exposed to it through the aerosols.

She added: "What we don't know is the exact point when he contracted bovine TB as we cannot categorically say [it was] because of his work at the abattoir. There is also the potential he was exposed to it on his own farm as well. The HSE has done extensive work to monitor the risk and this has been looked into in great detail. We are currently awaiting the results of a risk assessment."

Miss Spooner told the inquest that they had seen a significant increase in cattle infected with the disease in the last 10 years and samples sent off for testing from TS Sargeant found 50 per cent were returned positive.

She said the transmission of bovine TB to humans in the general population had decreased but it is difficult to say from occupational exposure as workers may develop it later in life when their immune system has weakened.

South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh said [the patient] died from multiple organ failure, pulmonary (bovine) tuberculosis, and ulcerative colitis.

He ruled his death was due to industrial disease.

Mr Haigh said: "Where and when he became infected is unclear but maybe it was a more recent rather than historic infection. The colitis he was being treated for may have made the infection develop quicker. The likelihood is he caught the infection from his work at the slaughterhouse as opposed to the farm but we cannot be sure about this."

He added that this was the only case they are aware of in the country.

TS Sargeant Abattoir said it had no comment on the investigation.

[Uttoxeter is a town in Staffordshire, in the West Midlands region of England.

_Mycobacterium bovis_ has been identified in humans in most countries where isolates of mycobacteria from human patients have been fully characterised. The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_ is higher in farm and slaughterhouse workers than in urban inhabitants. The transmission of _M. bovis_ to humans via milk and its products is eliminated by the pasteurisation of milk. One of the results of bovine tuberculosis eradication programmes has been a reduction in disease and death caused by bovine tuberculosis in the human population.

It is necessary to distinguish _M. bovis_ from the other members of the "tuberculosis complex," namely _M. tuberculosis_ (the primary cause of tuberculosis in humans), _M. africanum_ (occupies an intermediate phenotypic position between _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_), _M. microti_ (the "vole bacillus," a rarely encountered organism), _M. pinnipedii_, and _M. caprae_. For the prescribed laboratory techniques, please refer to "Chapter 2.4.7. Bovine Tuberculosis" in OIE's Terrestrial Manual (2009 version) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf. - Mod.AS]

[Conventional microbiologic diagnosis of human tuberculosis (TB) relies on methods that allow only identification of "Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex". "M. tuberculosis complex" is composed of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), as well as _Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) and several other genetically closely related species: the BCG bacillus, _M. africanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and _M. canetti_. Mb is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an essential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to treat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb.

Differentiation of Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as epidemiologically. To distinguish Mb from these other species, special tests have to be done, such as spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of Mb infection might be missed and the patient treated inappropriately.

The pathology of Mb infection in cattle is similar to that of TB in humans, with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis leading to chronic debilitation and coughing, and potential hematogenous spread to other organs. Infectious aerosols can be generated when an animal with lung cavities, which contain high numbers of mycobacteria, coughs or sneezes. Mb can then spread from cow-to-cow by inhalation of the aerosolized organisms. One to 2 per cent of MB-infected cows develop mycobacterial mastitis with shedding of the organism in milk and possible spread of infection in their calves.

Mb can be transmitted to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of Mb does occur. Following ingestion of Mb-contaminated food, Mb most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes. These forms of Mb infection occur commonly in children and were common in people in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of Mb, primary pulmonary Mb infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. Reactivation of latent Mb infection can occur in later life and especially in those individuals with underlying immunosuppressive disorders such as HIV infection or who are receiving corticosteroid therapy, in whom the disease can be rapidly fatal.

No mention is made in the report above of the patient ever having scrofula, so we can assume this patient likely inhaled aerosolized respiratory secretions from an infected animal on his own farm or aerosols generated in the slaughterhouse. The fact that he had ulcerative colitis suggests that he may have received immunosuppressive medication for this diagnosis, which would have a detrimental effect on his immune system's ability to control TB. In fact, all patients with TB should be tested for HIV infection and there is no mention of this patient's HIV status in the news report above.

Since his farm and the slaughterhouse where he worked were known to have Mb-infected animals, there should be environmental control measures in the workplace to prevent or reduce generation of infectious aerosols, and thus reduce exposure of employees to Mb. Also, employees suspected or known to have developed Mb TB should be rapidly diagnosed and treated to prevent further spread of infection. Workers in such facilities should be wearing face masks that filter infectious aerosols and they should be screened by periodic tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assay to assess for latent TB and they should have periodic medical exams.

This patient certainly should have been evaluated for latent TB if he were started on immunosuppression for ulcerative colitis and at the time relieved him from work in this potentially life-threatening environment. To assess for spread of Mb from slaughtered cattle or this infected employee, other employees should be tuberculin skin tested or interferon-gamma release tested and an attempt should be made to assess if the patient's Mb genotype matches that of Mb isolated from recently slaughtered cattle or his farm animals.

Human Mb TB still occurs in many developing countries, where Mb TB remains endemic, and may be under-appreciated in many developed countries because of the limited use of complex and expensive diagnostic laboratory testing. The same is also likely true in much of the developing world, where bacteriologic diagnostic testing is generally limited to acid-fast stained sputum smear examination. - Mod.ML
