------------------------------------------------------------
I repeatedly have seen references relating the banning of DDT to the
resurgence of bedbugs as an international problem. I wonder what the
evidence is for this, and what may be more to the point, what is the
status of pesticide resistance, including DDT, in the current
population?

[DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane), an organochlorine
insecticide, was introduced in 1939 and used extensively during World
War II to control insect-borne human diseases, such as malaria and
typhus. After World War II, DDT was also used extensively as an
agricultural insecticide. Because of concerns regarding its toxicity,
DDT was banned in the US in 1972, unless an unusual public health
emergency were to arise, and was subsequently banned for agricultural
use worldwide under the 2001 Stockholm Convention on persistent
organic pollutants like DDT. Vector control use has not been banned,
but it has been largely replaced by less persistent alternative
insecticides. Nine countries, however, in Asia and Africa reported in
2009 continued use of DDT for vector control: Ethiopia, India,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, and
Yemen
(<http://chm.pops.int/Programmes/DDT/ProgressReport/tabid/132/language/en-US/Default.aspx>).

Following the introduction of DDT, bedbugs almost completely
disappeared throughout much of the world, but within several years,
DDT-resistant bedbugs were noted worldwide (Busvine JR:
Insecticide-resistance in bed-bugs. Bul. Wid Hith Org. 19; 1041-52;
available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2537818/pdf/bullwho00516-0089.pdf>),
and since then bedbugs haven't lost their resistance to DDT in parts
of the United States and elsewhere (Karunaratne SHPP, et al:
Insecticide resistance in the tropical bedbug _Cimex hemipterus_.
Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology 2007; 88(1): 102-7; abstract

25(1): 45-51; available at
<http://comp.uark.edu/~aszalan/pdf/steelman_et_al_bed_bugs_jaue_2008.pdf>.)

When bedbugs began reappearing in the United States in the late
1990s, many of the early infestations involved people from other parts
of the world where DDT usage continued
(<http://www.sterifab.com/new_web_page/MAGAZINE_REPRINTS/july%20bed%20bugs.pdf>).
Bedbug populations sampled across the US have also shown resistance to
pyrethroid insecticides (Romero A, et al: Insecticide Resistance in
