Update: Investigation of Anthrax Associated with Intentional Exposure and
Interim Public Health Guidelines, October 2001
On 4 Oct 2001, CDC and state and local public health authorities reported a
case of inhalational anthrax in Florida (1). Additional cases of anthrax
subsequently have been reported from Florida and New York City. This report
updates the findings of these case investigations, which indicate that
infections were caused by the intentional release of _Bacillus anthracis_.
This report also includes interim guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis
for prevention of inhalational anthrax and other information to assist
epidemiologists, clinicians, and laboratorians responding to intentional
anthrax exposures.
For these investigations, a confirmed case of anthrax was defined as 1) a
clinically compatible case of cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal
illness* that is laboratory confirmed by isolation of _B. anthracis_ from
an affected tissue or site or 2) other laboratory evidence of _B.
anthracis_ infection based on at least 2 supportive laboratory tests. A
suspected case was defined as 1) a clinically compatible case of illness
without isolation of _B. anthracis_ and no alternative diagnosis, but with
laboratory evidence of _B. anthracis_ by one supportive laboratory test or
2) a clinically compatible case of anthrax epidemiologically linked to a
confirmed environmental exposure, but without corroborative laboratory
evidence of _B. anthracis_ infection.
Laboratory criteria for diagnosis of anthrax consist of 1) isolation and
confirmation of _B. anthracis_ from a clinical specimen collected from an
affected tissue or site or 2) other supportive laboratory tests, including
(a) evidence of _B. anthracis_ DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
specimens collected from an affected tissue or site, (b) demonstration of
_B. anthracis_ in a clinical specimen by immunohistochemical staining, or
(c) other laboratory tests (e.g., serology) that may become validated by
laboratory confirmation.
Florida
On October 2, the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) and the
Florida Department of Health (FDOH) were notified of a possible anthrax
case in Palm Beach County. The suspected case was identified when a gram
stain of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a gram-positive bacilli. An
epidemiologic investigation was initiated by FDOH, PBCHD, and the FDOH
state laboratory. The state laboratory and CDC confirmed _B. anthracis_
from a culture of CSF on October 4. Later the same day, FDOH and CDC
epidemiologists and laboratory workers arrived in Palm Beach County to
assist PBCHD with the investigation. As of 16 October, 2 confirmed cases of
inhalational anthrax have been identified.
The index patient was a 63-year-old male resident of Palm Beach County who
sought medical care at a local hospital on October 2 with fever and altered
mental status. Despite antibiotic therapy, his clinical condition
deteriorated rapidly, and he died on October 5. An autopsy performed on
October 6 confirmed the cause of death as inhalational anthrax. An
investigation revealed no obvious exposures to _B. anthracis_.
On October 1, the second patient, a 73-year-old co-worker of the index
patient, was admitted to a local hospital for pneumonia. On October 5, a
nasal swab was obtained from the patient that yielded a positive culture
for _B. anthracis_. Subsequent testing revealed positive PCR tests for _B.
anthracis_ in hemorrhagic pleural fluid and reactive serologic tests. The
patient remains hospitalized on antibiotic therapy. Enhanced case finding
and retrospective and prospective surveillance systems were initiated in
Palm Beach, and surrounding counties. Environmental assessments and
sampling were performed at the index patient's home, work site, and travel
destinations for the 60 days preceding symptom onset. Environmental
sampling revealed _B. anthracis_ contamination of the work site,
specifically implicating mail or package delivery. Environmental samples of
other locations the patient visited, including extensive sampling of his
home, were negative.
Questionnaires were administered to employees at the index patient's work
site. Postexposure prophylaxis was administered, and nasal swabs were
obtained from those with exposure to the work site for >1 hour since August
1. Of 1075 nasal swabs performed, one was positive for _B. anthracis_.
Environmental and co-worker testing indicated contamination of specific
locations at the work site. The investigation and environmental sampling
are ongoing.
New York
On October 9, the New York City Department of Health notified CDC of a
person with a skin lesion consistent with cutaneous anthrax. CDC sent a
team to New York City to provide epidemiologic and laboratory support to
local health officials. As of 16 October, 2 persons with confirmed cases of
cutaneous anthrax have been identified. One person with confirmed anthrax
was a 38-year-old woman who had handled a suspicious letter postmarked
September 18 at her workplace. The letter contained a powder that
subsequently was confirmed to contain _B. anthracis_. On September 25, the
patient had a raised lesion on the chest, which over the next 3 days
developed surrounding erythema and edema. By September 29, the patient
developed malaise and headache. On October 1, a clinician examined the
patient and described an approximately 5 cm long oval-shaped lesion with a
raised border, small satellite vesicles, and profound edema. The lesion was
nonpainful and was associated with left cervical lymphadenopathy. Serous
fluid from the lesion was obtained and was negative by gram stain and
culture. The patient was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin. Over the next
several days, the lesion developed a black eschar, and a biopsy was
obtained and sent to CDC for testing. The tissue was positive by
immunohistochemical staining for the cell wall antigen of _B. anthracis_.
The other person with confirmed cutaneous anthrax was a 7-month-old infant
who visited his mother's workplace on September 28. The next day, the
infant had an apparently nontender, massively edematous, weeping skin
lesion on his left arm; he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Over
the next several days, the lesion became ulcerative and developed a black
eschar; clinicians presumptively attributed the lesion to a spider bite.
The infant's clinical course was complicated by hemolytic anemia and
thrombocytopenia, requiring intensive care. The diagnosis of cutaneous
anthrax was first considered on October 12 after the announcement of the
other confirmed anthrax case in New York City. A serum specimen collected
on October 2 was positive for _B. anthracis_ by PCR testing at CDC; a skin
biopsy obtained on October 13 was positive by immunohistochemical staining
at CDC for the cell wall antigen of _B. anthracis_. No suspicious letter
with powder was identified at the mother's workplace. Both patients were
treated with ciprofloxacin and are clinically improving.
_B. anthracis_ grew from swabs (2 nasal and one facial skin swab) from 3
other persons, suggesting exposure to anthrax. One of the exposures was in
a law enforcement officer who brought the letter containing _B. anthracis_
from the index patient's workplace to the receiving laboratory. The other 2
exposures were in technicians who had processed the letter in the
laboratory. Environmental sampling in both workplaces is ongoing and
investigations of other exposed persons continue.

Editorial Note:
The findings in this report indicate that 4 confirmed cases of anthrax have
resulted from intentional delivery of _B. anthracis_ spores through mailed
letters or packages. These are the first confirmed cases of anthrax
associated with intentional exposure in the United States and represent a
new public health threat.
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming
bacterium _B. anthracis_. It occurs most frequently as an epizootic or
enzootic disease of herbivores (e.g., cattle, goats, or sheep) that acquire
spores from direct contact with contaminated soil. Humans usually become
infected through direct contact with _B. anthracis_ spores from infected
animals or their products (e.g., goat hair), resulting in cutaneous anthrax
(2). Inhalational and gastrointestinal are other forms of the disease in
the natural setting (4,5). Human-to-human transmission has not been
documented.
Clinical laboratorians should be alert to the presence of Bacillus species
in patient specimens. In particular, laboratorians should suspect _B.
anthracis_ when the specimen is from a previously healthy patient with a
rapidly progressive respiratory illness or a cutaneous ulcer. If _B.
anthracis_ is suspected, laboratories should immediately notify the
health-care provider and local and state public health staff. For rapid
identification of _B. anthracis_, state and local health departments should
access the Laboratory Response Network for Bioterrorism (LRN). LRN links
state and local public health laboratories with advanced capacity
laboratories---including clinical, military, veterinary, agricultural,
water, and food-testing laboratories. Laboratorians should contact their
state public health laboratory to identify their local LRN representative.
Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated to prevent inhalational anthrax after
a confirmed or suspected aerosol exposure. When no information is available
about the antimicrobial susceptibility of the implicated strain of _B.
anthracis_, initial therapy with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is
recommended for adults and children. Use of tetracyclines and
fluoroquinolones in children has adverse effects. The risks for these
adverse effects must be weighed carefully against the risk for developing
life-threatening disease. As soon as penicillin susceptibility of the
organism has been confirmed, prophylactic therapy for children should be
changed to oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg of body mass per day divided every 8
hours (not to exceed 500 mg three times daily). _B. anthracis_ is not
susceptible to cephalosporins or to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and
these agents should not be used for prophylaxis.
CDC is assisting other states and local areas in assessing anthrax
exposures. Additional information about anthrax and the public health
response is available at:

* Cutaneous illness is characterized by a skin lesion evolving from a
papule, through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar; edema,
erythema, or necrosis without ulceration may be present. Inhalational
illness is characterized by a brief prodrome resembling a "nonspecific
febrile" illness that rapidly progresses to a fulminant illness with signs
of sepsis and/or respiratory failure, often with radiographic evidence of
mediastinal widening; signs of bacterial meningitis may be present.
Gastrointestinal illness is characterized by severe abdominal pain usually
accompanied by bloody vomiting or diarrhea followed by fever and signs of
septicemia.
Clinical Forms of Anthrax
The following clinical descriptions of anthrax are based on experience in
adults. The clinical presentation of anthrax in infants is not well defined.
Inhalational. Inhalational anthrax begins with a brief prodrome resembling
a viral respiratory illness followed by development of hypoxia and dyspnea,
with radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening. Inhalational anthrax is
the most lethal form of anthrax and results from inspiration of 8000 to 50
000 spores of _Bacillus anthracis_ (3). The incubation period of
inhalational anthrax among humans typically ranges from 1--7 days but may
be possibly up to 60 days. Host factors, dose of exposure, and
chemoprophylaxis may affect the duration of the incubation period. Initial
symptoms include mild fever, muscle aches, and malaise and may progress to
respiratory failure and shock; meningitis frequently develops.
Case-fatality estimates for inhalational anthrax are extremely high, even
with all possible supportive care including appropriate antibiotics.
Cutaneous. Cutaneous anthrax is characterized by a skin lesion evolving
from a papule, through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar. The
incubation period ranges from 1--12 days. The lesion is usually painless,
but patients also may have fever, malaise, headache, and regional
lymphadenopathy. The case fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax is 20%
without, and <1% with, antibiotic treatment.
Gastrointestinal. Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by severe
abdominal pain followed by fever and signs of septicemia. This form of
anthrax usually follows after eating raw or undercooked contaminated meat
and can have an incubation period of 1--7 days. An oropharyngeal and an
abdominal form of the disease have been described. Involvement of the
pharynx is usually characterized by lesions at the base of the tongue,
dysphagia, fever, and regional lymphadenopathy. Lower bowel inflammation
typically causes nausea, loss of appetite, and fever followed by abdominal
pain, hematemesis, and bloody diarrhea. The case-fatality rate is estimated
to be 25%--60%. The effect of early antibiotic treatment on the
case-fatality rate is not established.
