[Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by _Francisella tularensis_. The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, 0.2-0.5 micrometre x 0.7-1.0 micrometre, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 degrees C. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.

Two types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.

The disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes.

It is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.1.18 "Tularemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_TULAREMIA.pdf
(adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to tularemia are spelled out in chapter 8.15 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.15.htm.

According to the most recent 6-month OIE report, tularemia was reported as present in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, and Switzerland). In addition, Spain and the United States have reported the disease limited to certain zones. In 82 countries the disease has never been reported, and in 40 the disease was reported absent in this period. On the other hand, most countries have not specified surveillance for tularemia, some maintain "general surveillance" and very few maintain "targeted surveillance" countries (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).

A map showing the distribution of disease in domestic and/or wild species can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseasedistributionmap. (Note: at both WAHID links, to view the information on tularemia, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).

Although Tularemia had not been reported in the Netherlands since 1953, this event should not come as a surprise since the disease is present in the surrounding countries such as Germany, France and Belgium. The Dutch province of Limburg is situated in south Netherlands, bordering Germany and Belgium. The Dutch source "Groene Ruimte", cited at the end of the commentary, says: "The bacterium has been recently demonstrated in 3 percent of hares found dead in northern Germany. It is spread over France. The last case in Belgium, a hare, was reported in 2011" (http://www.groeneruimte.nl/nieuws/artikel.html?id=151747). - Mod.CRD
