Hospital emergency departments were last night [12 Jul 2007] put on
alert after the 1st case of polio was detected in Australia in 21 years.
A 22-year-old man carrying the disease was in isolation in a
Melbourne hospital last night and health authorities were trying to
track down the 249 passengers who shared his [2 Jul 2007] Thai
Airlines flight from Bangkok to Melbourne. Those on flight TG999 were
urged to contact the health information hotline on 1800 004 599,
which is open between 8.30am and 10pm.
The man is a student living in Melbourne and had been home to
Pakistan. He was admitted to Box Hill Hospital with symptoms
including fever, vomiting, and muscle stiffness. His condition was
improving. In cases where the illness becomes severe it can cause paralysis.
The Chief Medical Officer, John Horvath, issued the alert saying
while the risk of infection in Australia was low, polio was highly
infectious. Professor Horvath said the last case of wild type
poliovirus [WPV] infection in Australia occurred in 1986.
The Western Pacific Region, including Australia, was certified as
polio-free in 2000 "so any case of polio is a significant public
health concern", he said.
"The patient, who has recovered from his initial paralysis, will
remain in hospital in isolation until he is diagnosed polio free and
his household contacts will be asked to remain in home quarantine
until it is established that they are not infected," he said.
[Presumably they will be keeping him in isolation until he is
documented to no longer be excreting WPV in both his nasopharynx and
stool - Mod.MPP] "While the risk to health care workers is very low,
all staff who had contact with the patient will also be screened
appropriately."
All Australian hospital emergency departments have been asked to look
out for signs or symptoms. While most Australians are vaccinated
against polio as children, some older people and immigrants have not been.
Professor Horvath said passengers on the flight "are considered to be
at low risk of contracting the disease" and the risk of transmission
to the community is also low. "However, polio is a highly infectious
disease and it is appropriate to take precautionary measures," he said.
He said polio has been eradicated in most of the world except a few
countries including India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.

[As mentioned in the newswire above, Pakistan is one of 4 remaining
countries considered endemic for wild poliovirus (WPV) activity.
According to the most recent data available on the polio eradication
website (10 Jul 2007) there have been 9 cases of WPV-associated polio
reported from Pakistan this year (since January 2007), as compared
with 11 cases reported during the same time frame last year (2006).
Of note is that both WPV type 1 and WPV type 3 are presently
circulating in Pakistan: the date of onset of the most recently
identified WPV 1-associated case, was 14 May 2007, and the date of
onset of the most recently confirmed WPV 3-associated case was 13 May
2007 (see <http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).
The newswire does not provide information on what part of Pakistan
this case had visited, nor does it provide information on the type of
WPV isolated. More information on the epidemiologic investigation
into this case would be appreciated.
Polio is a vaccine preventable disease. The vaccines currently
available have a vaccine efficacy in the 95 to 99 percent range. (The
US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention sponsored Pink Book on
Immunizations, Poliomyelitis chapter, has a more thorough discussion
with extensive bibliography and is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/polio.pdf>).
Australia switched from using the attenuated oral poliovaccine (OPV)
to using the injectable inactivated poliovaccine (IPV) in November
2005 (see
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-communic-factsheets-polio.htm>).
In spite of excellent vaccination coverages these days, there are
most likely pockets of 'susceptibles' who either had less than
optimal vaccination histories in childhood (dating back to those born
since the early days of polio vaccine availability in the mid 1950s
and 1960s) or have not been vaccinated for either medical reasons or
non-medical rejections (religious or otherwise). When WPV is
introduced into these communities, the risk of further transmission
of the virus is there, with inherent risk to those unvaccinated
individuals in the communities. Hence the appropriate caution on the
part of the health sector in Australia.
As mentioned in the newswire above, the Western Pacific Region (WPRO)
of the World Health Organization (WHO) was declared to have been
polio-free in 2000. For historical interest, the WPRO press release
declaring polio eradication is an interesting read, available at
<http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20001029.htm>.
