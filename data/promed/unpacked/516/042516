Ebola hemorrhagic fever in south Sudan - WHO update
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 24 May 2004, the health authorities of Yambio County have
reported a total of 19 cases, including 4 deaths, of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever (EHF) in Yambio, Western Equatoria, south Sudan. Laboratory testing
performed by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) United States, have
confirmed EHF.
WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN), along with a
team from WHO headquarters, have been working closely with the health
authorities and partners in Yambio County helping with the creation of a
Crisis Committee to control the outbreak.
This committee includes UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontieres-France, and other
non-governmental organizations and churches working in public health. The
committee is working actively in social mobilization, supporting case
management in Yambio hospital, and organizing the follow-up of contacts of
people who have been ill with the disease.
Currently, the outbreak appears to be restricted to the environs of Yambio,
however, neighboring countries have been notified. At this stage, WHO
recommends no special restrictions on travel, or trade, as a result of this
outbreak.

New strain of Ebola virus responsible for outbreak in southern Sudan
-----------------------------------------------
Teams of international scientists are traveling to southern Sudan,
following an outbreak of a new strain of the deadly Ebola virus. World
Health Organization officials have traced an Ebola-like disease to the town
of Yambio, in the Western Equatorial region of south Sudan. 15 cases of the
potentially fatal virus have been confirmed over the past fortnight, and 4
people have died. More than 100 others are being kept under surveillance. 4
people are in isolation at Yambio Hospital, so the total infected could
still rise.
Previous major outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever [caused by different
strains of Ebola virus] have occurred in several parts of Africa: 1976 -
southern Sudan, 117 deaths; 1976 - Congo, 280 deaths; 2000 - northern
Uganda, 173 deaths; 2002 - Congo, 100 deaths.
The Ebola virus, in its early stages, is hard to diagnose, because some of
the symptoms, such as fever and joint pain, mimic malaria. Many people go
on to develop internal bleeding, a characteristic typical of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, and without medical attention, the prospects are bleak.
A crisis group has been set up with aid agencies in the region in an
attempt to curtail the spread of the disease. The last major outbreak was
in Uganda 2 years ago; hundreds died. The hope is that quick action now
will avert a similar crisis in southern Sudan.

[Details are awaited of the precise relationship of this strain of Ebola
virus to the strains isolated previously in the Sudan and elsewhere in
Africa. A preliminary report (see: Acute hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (W
Equatoria) (02) 20040521.1369) suggested that a milder form of disease
might be associated with this strain. - Mod.CP]
