[11 Jan 2020]
Dear Doctor,
Updates on the Cases of Infection with Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Further to our letter dated [9 Jan 2020], we would like to update you with the latest situation of the reported cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province.

After the preliminary determination that the pathogen of "viral pneumonia with unknown cause" is a novel coronavirus, the expert groups have immediately revised and improved the protocols on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of viral pneumonia with unknown cause. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has arranged the samples of existing patients to be tested for nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus, and the Expert Groups have made overall assessments on the patients hospitalised for observation and treatment, taking into consideration information on clinical picture, epidemiological information and laboratory testing results, etc.

As of yesterday ([10 Jan 2020]), 41 patients have been diagnosed to have infection of the novel coronavirus. The earliest and most recent cases had onset of illness on [8 Dec 2019] and [2 Jan 2020], respectively. Symptoms include fever, malaise, dry cough and shortness of breath. The vital signs were stable in most of the cases. Among them, 2 patients have been discharged, 7 patients are in serious condition and 1 died, while the remaining patients are in stable condition. The fatal case affected a 61-year-old man with abdominal tumour and chronic liver disease who was admitted to a hospital due to respiratory failure and severe pneumonia. The diagnoses included severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septicaemic shock and multi-organ failure.

According to information from the National Health Commission, epidemiological investigations revealed that the patients are mainly business operators at a market called "Hua Nan Seafood Wholesale Market" in Wuhan, which has been closed since [1 Jan 2020]. A total of 739 close contacts have been identified and 419 of them are healthcare workers. All have been put under medical surveillance, and no related cases have been detected so far. There have been no new cases since [3 Jan 2020]. For the time being, the Mainland's investigation has neither identified any infection of healthcare workers nor definite evidence of human-to-human transmission.

Regarding the laboratory tests, relevant experts have released a coronavirus genome from a case of the Wuhan outbreak. The sequence can be downloaded from the following website: http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319. The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection is conducting molecular testing for a number of coronaviruses, and the current test is able to detect the novel coronavirus based on sequence comparison but not yet evaluated due to unavailability of the novel coronavirus.

We will closely monitor the situation and update you further when more information becomes available. You may visit the designated webpage (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html) for updated information on the reported cases fulfilling the reporting criteria for Severe Respiratory Disease associated with a Novel Infectious Agent and the relevant health advice. Please draw the attention of the healthcare professionals and supporting staff in your institution/working with you to the above. Thank you for your continuous support in combating communicable diseases.

Yours faithfully,
(Dr. SK Chuang)
for Controller, Centre for Health Protection

Taiwan is expected to develop a screening test in a week's time for the new type of coronavirus that has killed one and sickened dozens in the Chinese city of Wuhan, according to Taiwanese health authorities on Saturday ([11 Jan 2020]).

The coronavirus, believed to have originated at a local seafood market in Wuhan, has afflicted 41 as of Friday ([10 Jan 2020]). On Wednesday ([9 Jan 2020]), it took the life of a 61-year-old man who had developed severe pneumonia, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

The man, who was found to have frequented the Huanan Seafood Market for business, also suffered from chronic liver disease as well as abdominal tumors. Those who have come down with the virus have shown such symptoms as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, and fatigue, said the Commission.

Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said it is working on analyzing the virus' genome sequence, which has been provided by Chinese health authorities. Preliminary mapping indicated the coronavirus bears an 87.6% likeness to a virus carried by bats, while it is 79% similar to SARS and 52% similar to MERS. The transmission methods have yet to be identified.

The CDC believes a fast screening test can be developed in a week and will be able to detect the coronavirus in 4 hours, reported UDN. The health authorities also rebuffed rumors that Taiwan has reported its 1st confirmed case of the illness, warning that those spreading disinformation could be subject to a fine of up to TWD 3 million (USD 100 082) in accordance with the Communicable Disease Control Act.

HKSARG representatives to go to Wuhan
-------------------------------------
In response to media enquiries, a spokesman for the Food and Health Bureau gives the following reply today ([11 Jan 2020]):

With the arrangement of the National Health Commission, the Under Secretary for Food and Health, Dr. Chui Tak-yi, together with representatives from the Department of Health and Hospital Authority, will depart for Wuhan, Hubei Province on [Mon 13 Jan 2020] to learn about the situation of the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, prevention and control measures and clinical management. They will return to Hong Kong on [Tues 14 Jan 2020].

[With the public release of the genome and the opening up for professional visits from outside of Wuhan, it is hoped there will be speed in further defining the coronavirus, as well as confirmation from an outside reference laboratory. We await further feedback from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and other countries who have been identifying arriving passengers from Wuhan for febrile respiratory illness as to whether this virus has travelled outside of the Seafood Market, and outside of Wuhan City.

The information on the reported fatality is one of an individual with multiple co-morbidities, including abdominal tumors (not further defined), severe pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), septicemic shock and multi-organ failure.
