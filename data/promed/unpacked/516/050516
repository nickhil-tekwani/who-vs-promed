[1] WHO Ebola Situation Report
Date: 28 Jan 2015

The response to the EVD epidemic has now moved to a 2nd phase, as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. To achieve this goal as quickly as possible, efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding, case management, safe burials, and community engagement is used as effectively as possible.

For the 1st time since the week ending 29 Jun 2014, there have been fewer than 100 new confirmed cases reported in a week in the 3 most-affected countries. A combined total of 99 confirmed cases were reported from the 3 countries in the week to 25 Jan 2015: 30 in Guinea, 4 in Liberia, and 65 in Sierra Leone.

Case incidence continues to fall in Liberia and Sierra Leone, [but] Guinea reported 30 confirmed cases in the week to 25 Jan 2015, up from 20 confirmed cases in the previous week. The north Guinean prefecture of Mali, which borders Senegal, has reported its 1st confirmed case.

In the week to 18 Jan 2015, 6 of 20 (30 percent) new confirmed and probable cases in Guinea arose among registered contacts. During the week to 25 Jan 2015, 2 of 4 (50 percent) new confirmed cases in Liberia arose among known contacts. Equivalent data are not yet available for Sierra Leone. The target is for 100 percent of new cases to [be found] among known contacts, so that each and every chain of transmission can be tracked and terminated.

In the 21 days to 25 Jan 2015, it took an average of 0.7 days in Guinea, 0.5 days in Liberia, and 0.8 days in Sierra Leone for a patient sample to go from collection through to the communication of the laboratory test result to a national ministry of health. The target is to have results within 24 hours of sample collection. [This has clearly been reached; well done! - Mod.JW]

The case fatality rate among hospitalized cases (calculated from all hospitalized cases with a reported definitive outcome) is between 54 percent and 62 percent in the 3 intense-transmission countries, with no indication of an improvement over time.

All health care facilities in the 3 most-affected countries are assessed for their compliance with minimum standards of infection prevention and control (IPC), with the aim that 100 percent of facilities meet such standards. Data will soon be available on the proportion of health facilities that meet minimum IPC standards.

A total of 816 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 488 reported deaths. Neither Guinea nor Sierra Leone reported a health worker infection in the week to 25 Jan 2015. Liberia reported 2 health worker infections during the same period, compared with 0 cases the previous week.

A total of 27 sub-prefectures in Guinea reported at least one security incident or other form of refusal to cooperate in the week to 21 Jan 2015. A total of 2 districts in Liberia and 4 districts in Sierra Leone reported at least one similar incident during the same reporting period.

There have been in excess of 22 000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases (Annex 1) of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1 - see source), with almost 8800 deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 30 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 4 in Liberia, and 65 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 25 Jan 2015.

A stratified analysis of cumulative confirmed and probable cases indicates that the number of cases in males and females is similar (table 2 - see source). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are almost 4 times more likely to be affected than are children.

[This appears rather paradoxical, because one might expect children aged 14 and under to be hugged and touched by parents and adult relatives significantly more than older children. It would be interesting to know the rate in infants and toddlers. - Mod.JW]

[2] Testing Ebola vaccines now in Africa
Date: Wed 28 Jan 2015
Source: National Journal [edited]
http://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/there-s-an-ebola-vaccine-in-africa-now-what-20150128


It was an unprecedented effort to bring an experimental vaccine to a large-scale clinical trial in just 4 months. That's a lightning pace for the pharmaceutical industry, which normally works on a decade timescale.

"I've been doing this kind of work between 25 and 30 years," Ballou says. "I certainly never experienced something like this." GSK put about 175 people on the project in August [2014] after the World Health Organization declared Ebola an international public health emergency. Other projects were shelved. "We've had to disrupt the entire system at every level to try to make things go as quickly as possible and yet not sacrifice on quality or patient safety," he says.

Phases I and II of drug trials assess safety. Phase III is where we see whether the drug really works in the field. On 23 Jan 2015, GSK shipped 300 vials of the vaccine that will inoculate 9000 people in a phase III clinical trial in Monrovia, Liberia. The National Institutes of Health will oversee the effort, which will involve 27 000 people. Another 9000 in the trial will get a different vaccine formulation. The last 9000 will get nothing. All will be monitored.

Success is not assured. Ballou says the vaccine would need to protect 50 percent of the people who receive it to be considered useful. He's facing a catch-22: As Ebola infections in Africa are starting to decline, it becomes vastly more difficult to test a vaccine. "It's a real dilemma," says Margaret Harris, an MD and spokeswoman for the World Health Organization. "It's extremely good news that the cases are coming down, but it does mean we may not have clear phase III data."

To accumulate more data, WHO is organizing concurrent phase III trials in Guinea and Sierra Leone. They will test the GSK vaccine and another developed by Merck. Johnson & Johnson is starting safety trials on a 3rd, which could join them in phase III later in [2015]. The trial in Guinea may achieve results faster than the one in Liberia. Instead of passively waiting for disease to strike -- as in a randomized-control design -- researchers in Guinea will target known outbreaks in a 1st-of-its-kind "ring vaccination trial."

When a person becomes infected by the virus, health care workers in Guinea will immunize the community around the patient. Thus, a ring of resistance is formed around a carrier. (Using this design, smallpox was eradicated from the globe.) The researchers will then monitor the community to see whether anyone else gets sick. But one ring alone cannot prove the vaccine's effectiveness. There will be about 90 rings in Guinea. In some of the rings, the community will receive the vaccination right away. In other rings, there will be a delay between infection and inoculation. The test: Do the communities who get immunized immediately fare better than those in the delayed ring? If there's a strong level of protection in 1st rings, and that level of protection wanes in the later rings, that's evidence the vaccine works.

Even with the concurrent studies, Harris says the timeline for a final vaccine decision is unclear. Initially, WHO thought the trials could be done in a few months. Now "that information may not be available by the middle of the year," she says. In the worst case for the vaccine (and best case for Africa right now), if there are no more Ebola cases, WHO will still obtain valuable information on vaccine safety and side effects. But it won't know for sure whether the vaccine works.

If a vaccine passes clinical muster, there are still hurdles to clear. Right now, because it contains a live virus [not Ebola - a vesicular stomatitis virus carrier. - Mod.JW], Ballou's Ebola vaccine needs to be stored at minus 80 C [minus 112 F]. That's really cold, about the temperature of dry ice. And it is not practical for a mass vaccination campaign in Africa. "It has to be something that can be stored in an ordinary refrigerator," Harris says. ... - more

[It's not just a question of whether, because of declining case numbers, those they vaccinate will get exposed but, in the light of the postulated mass immunity from asymptomatic infections, whether they can find 27 000 people without antibody; see Ebola update (26): WHO update, reforms, immunity, Guinea numbers, susp. 20150127.3124382, item [3]. - Mod.JW]
