MYCOBACTERIOSIS, ROCKFISH - USA (MARYLAND)

A wasting disease that kills rockfish and can cause a severe skin infection in
humans has spread to nearly 3/4 of the rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay, cradle
of the mid-Atlantic's most popular game fish.
The mycobacteriosis epidemic could carry profound implications for the
rockfish, also known as striped bass. The fish fuel a $300-million industry in
Maryland and Virginia, but because the bacteria kill slowly, effects on the
stock are only now emerging.
The disease also sends a grim message about the entire bay ecosystem. The
rockfish remains bay conservationists' only success story -- a species nearly
wiped out, then revived by fishing limits.
But as the number of rockfish surged, the fish remained in a body of water too
polluted to support the level of life it once did. That made them vulnerable
to a malady researchers did not see coming -- a signal, some scientists say,
that controlling fish harvests is no longer enough to ensure long-term
survival of a species.
"We used to think that if you got hold of fishing, all your problems would be
solved," said James H. Uphoff Jr., a biologist at the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources. "But now all these ecological problems crop up, and we
don't understand them."
Indeed, nearly a decade after mycobacteriosis first appeared, scientists
remain utterly baffled about its implications, including those for humans.
Researchers know that the Chesapeake, where most rockfish spawn, also breeds
the bacterium and is the epicenter of the disease. Yet they don't know how or
why it appeared, whether it will spread to other species, or if the infection
it causes is always fatal.
A new study suggests that since the illness was discovered among bay rockfish,
non-fishing mortality among them has tripled in the upper bay. But scientists
cannot explain why, at the same time, anglers are catching plenty of fish.
In humans who touch the fish, the microbe can cause a skin infection known as
fish handler's disease, which is not life-threatening but can lead to
arthritis-like joint problems if untreated. Watermen say the only sick fish
they see are in small, overcrowded rivers and streams. The netting season that
ended 28 Feb. 2006 "was a super-good season as far as catching, and a good
season as far as the price," said Larry Simns, president of the Maryland
Watermen's Association. With no evidence of health risk from eating the fish,
watermen say, prices have remained stable.
But at Ristorante Tosca in downtown Washington, "some people ask, 'Is it
safe?' " chef Massimo Fabbri said of the rockfish on the menu. Such questions
have prompted Fabbri to buy the restaurant's wild rockfish from Northern
Europe and Ecuador, paying about 3 times what he would for local
bass. "Wouldn't you?" he asked.
As researchers test a long list of hypotheses, they say their search for the
bacterium's source and implications highlights the limitations of modern
science when pitted against the complexities of the wild.
"Scientists attempt to unravel things [and] are supposed to follow the
information wherever it leads us," said Victor Crecco of the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection, author of the mortality study. "We're
going to have to do more work to explain these contradictions."
For centuries, striped bass fishing has been as rich in lore as it was in
quality. In ideal conditions, rockfish can live up to 30 years: The biggest on
record was a 125-pound female, landed off North Carolina in 1891. In this
region, charter boat operators tell of swimsuit-wearing amateurs landing
dozens of the silver-scaled fighters in a day -- the fish longer than one's
arm, bellies made fat on the teeming schools of menhaden that are a chief food
source.

[The genus Mycobacterium is most often associated with tuberculosis and
leprosy. However, there are many species, and in fish they are non-
tuberculosis mycobacteria. In healthy people, these are not usually a major
cause of disease.
Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria are generally thought to be relatively common in
the environment. Most often they are found in swampy and or acid conditions
often associated with high organic loads, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and
a low pH. There is some evidence that low levels of zinc and iron may also
make conditions more favorable for mycobacteria. They have been found in some
lakes.
One species, _M. marinum_, has been found in both fresh and salt water. This
organism can also cause disease in birds, mammals, and other aquatic animals.
Young infected fish do not display clinical signs. As the disease progresses
and the fish ages, or if an older fish is infected, the fish may show evidence
of emaciation and muscle wasting, exophthalmia [eyes bugging out], and skin
ulceration. Fish may become bloated and anorexic. Internally, the liver,
spleen, kidney, and heart may develop somewhat characteristic granulomatous
lesions. The granulomatous nodules cause edema within the body cavity,
peritonitis develops, and the infection progresses systemically, even
affecting the skeletal system. The fish may develop clearly visible skin
ulcerations.
The most common form of transmission is believed to be ingestion of infected
material. This may occur when foodstuffs are tossed overboard, or when fish
consume other decaying fish. It is also possible for this organism to pass
from parent to offspring.
The same species of Mycobacterium that causes fish diseases may cause skin
lesions in people, which has been referred to as "fish handler's disease."
Generally this occurs at breaks in the skin, such as around the cuticles, or
when there is contact with a very high number of organisms. The pustules,
which ooze a white pus, resemble a rash where skin contacts the water. In
healthy people this is usually a self-limiting situation, but severe localized
infections have resulted in deep wounds. Immunologically compromised
individuals are at risk of systemic infections.

Infection rates range from 10 to 100 percent. There is no cure for
Mycobacterium infections, but conditions in the environment that promote it
should be identified and hopefully corrected. If the disease occurs in
aquaculture conditions, destroying the stock, cleansing the area, and
restocking may be the best options. However, the entire Chesapeake Bay may be
infected, so identifying the conditions that promote Mycobacteriosis and
correcting it may be the only option.

[From the Maryland State Department of Natural Resources website:
"Mycobacteriosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus
Mycobacterium. These species of marine mycobacteria such as _Mycobacterium
marinum_ & _M. chelonae_ are ubiquitous in the [marine] environment. Newly
identified species such as _M. chesapeaki_ & _M. schottsii_ (see ref. below)
have only been described from the Chesapeake Bay. At least 10 species of
mycobacteria have been isolated from striped bass lesions."
