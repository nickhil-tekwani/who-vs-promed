[Japanese news media are reporting that the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries Agriculture (MAFF) announced the suspected
BSE case (reported on ProMED before) had been confirmed. One of
the following articles also reports the somewhat nervous reaction of
schools in Japan. My search of the MAFF website did not turn up this
information. - Akira Goto

UK lab confirms Japan's mad cow affliction
-------------------
In a devastating blow to Japan's beef industry, British mad cow
specialists have confirmed that a Chiba Prefecture cow was the first
such animal in Asia to have been struck by the disease, government
officials said Saturday.
"We have concluded that the cow was indeed infected with mad cow
disease," Shigeo Miyashima of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Ministry said during a hurriedly-arranged news conference held at 2
a.m.
The news conference was called after neuropathologists at Britain's
Veterinary Laboratories Agency, who had studied brain samples
removed from the Chiba Prefecture cow, delivered the damning
conclusion late Friday night.
Miyashima promised that the ministry is doing its best to prevent a
major outbreak of the disease, which is also called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). "We are tracking down all cattle that were
raised together with the BSE-infected cow. The ministry has also
applied a stricter standard for its mad cow-testing system, so we believe
the possibility of a new outbreak remains low," Miyashima, head of the
ministry's animal health division, said.
But the ministry's moves failed to calm the Chiba Prefectural
Government. It decided Saturday to adopt BSE prevention measures
used by the EU on cattle raised in the prefecture, because officials
believe that toeing the Agriculture Ministry line won't be enough to win
back consumers' confidence in Chiba beef.
On Friday, the Agriculture Ministry decided during an expert panel
meeting to temporarily ban imports of all meat and bone meal from
abroad, as infected feed is thought to be the disease's primary carrier.
Japan has already stopped importing the feed from the European
Union, whose member nations -- in particular Britain -- have suffered a
massive BSE outbreak.
However, ministry officials refused to slap a prohibition on some 400
000 tons of meat and bone meal produced domestically, saying, "Since
we have only one case of BSE, we believe feed made with domestic
cattle [is clean."
In June [2001, the ministry forced the EU to shelve the publication of
an EU report warning about a high probability of BSE erupting in
Japan by insisting that it was confident about the safety of beef in
Japan.
On 10 Sep 2001 the ministry announced that a cow apparently
suffering from mad cow disease had been found in Chiba Prefecture in
August, but said it had been put down and incinerated. Officials
admitted 4 days later that the incineration never took place, and the
carcass had been ground into meat and bone meal.
Since then, the ministry has told livestock farmers that meat and bone
meal can be fed only to chickens and pigs because they would not be
infected with the disease. However, a livestock farmer admitted Friday
that he had given such meal to his cattle.
An attempt to track down 71 other cattle that were raised together with
the BSE-infected cow in Saroma, Hokkaido, is also running into
difficulties because many of them have already been put down and
sold on the market.

Mad cow outbreak confirmed in Japan
-----------------------
British government veterinarians have confirmed that a Japanese dairy
cow that was suspected of having contracted mad cow disease has been
infected with the illness, the first case reported outside Europe,
Japanese government officials said Saturday.
The infected cow, a 5-year-old Holstein raised at a dairy farm in Shiroi,
Chiba Prefecture, first showed symptoms of the disease on 6 Aug 2001
when the owners found the animal could not stand on its own.
In a hurriedly-arranged news conference, ministry officials said the
government has no idea how the cow was infected but ruled out an
immediate ban on the use of meat and bone meal as feed for cows.
MBM feed has been blamed for the spread of mad cow disease in
Europe.
The ministry has declared domestic MBM feed to be safe but is
considering a total ban on imports.
After suspicions were raised on 6 Aug 2001 about the condition of the
Shiroi cow, Japanese veterinarians conducted 4 tests, 3 of which
returned positive results for the disease, ministry officials said.
The Japanese government, which announced the results on 10 Sep
2001, sent the test results to Britain's Veterinary Laboratories Agency
for further tests.
The agriculture ministry said Friday that it will review a proposal to
ban all MBM imports. The proposal was made by experts the ministry
appointed to draw up measures to stop the possible spread of mad cow
disease in Japan.
Agriculture ministry officials said the ministry will study the measure,
which could put Japan at odds with trade rules set by the World Trade
Organization. Under WTO rules, member countries that impose a
comprehensive import ban on MBM feed must extend the restriction to
domestically produced feed as well.
Earlier Friday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tsutomu
Takebe told a news conference that the suspected case of mad cow
disease is unlikely to affect people and vowed to increase efforts to
ease public concerns over safety. "The cow involved has not been
distributed as beef so there is no possibility that the disease will infect
people in this case," Takebe said.
Meanwhile, government sources said the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry is considering requiring dairy farmers to dispose of cow body
parts that are most susceptible to mad cow disease before distribution
to the market in a bid to prevent further infections. Cows' brains, spinal
cords, and small intestines are marked for disposal under the measure,
because they are considered to put humans at a high risk of contracting
the disease if consumed, the sources said.
The health ministry currently has no intention of implementing the
measure because only one case of mad cow disease has been
discovered in Japan, ministry sources said. According to the sources,
the ministry's plan requires meat processing sites to dispose of
designated cow organs by burning and for meat dealers and restaurant
managers to follow guidelines in accordance with relevant laws, such
as the Food Sanitation Law.
The ministry also plans to test 1 million cows aged 30 months or older
from late October [2001.
The health ministry is also considering improving ways of detecting
symptoms of CJD in humans, adding that the link between mad cow
disease and its human variant cannot be ignored, the sources said.
There are no reports of a human contracting variant CJD in Japan.

Beef off school menu
------------------
The outbreak of mad cow disease in Japan, confirmed Saturday by
British veterinary experts, has led at least 1765 public schools in 14
prefectures to remove beef from their lunch menus, according to a
Kyodo News survey released Saturday.
Education boards in 107 cities, towns, and villages in 3 other
prefectures are also planning to drop beef from their school lunch
menus amid rising fears of infection, after the government announced
on 10 Sep 2001 that one dairy cow in Chiba Prefecture was suspected
of having been infected.
The survey shows school authorities in Ibaraki have been most active
in changing their menus, reporting that the measure had been taken at
421 elementary schools and 167 junior high schools. Tokyo came next,
with 338 elementary schools and 153 junior high schools, followed by
Tokushima with 100 elementary schools and 32 junior high schools.
In Yamanashi, local education boards have reported that beef has been
removed from the menus in all but one of the 108 public elementary
and junior high schools in 7 cities.
Substitutions by the municipal education board in Kainan, Wakayama
Prefecture include jelly instead of boiled sausages, pork for beef in
"oden" stews, and noodles in broth instead of spaghetti with meat
sauce. The education board in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, said it had
replaced beef with pork in a curry noodle dish and so far had
experienced no difficulty in finding substitutes.
However, many local education boards in southern Japan -- notably
those in Kyushu and Okinawa -- say they are not particularly
concerned about eating beef. "The agriculture ministry has declared
beef and dairy goods are safe," the Hiroshima municipal education
board stated.
Elsewhere, some education boards say they have yet to consider the
situation, while others declined to answer the Kyodo survey, citing fear
of "misunderstanding" or overreaction to the mad cow scare.
