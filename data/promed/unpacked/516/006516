A sheep plague has been racking flocks in the northern Jordan Valley and has so far killed about 200 lambs and infected dozens of sheep. This is the season when sheep give birth and the lambs are sold, so the epidemic has caused the shepherds heavy financial damage.

Flocks belonging to 6 groups of Palestinian shepherds have reportedly been affected, but hardest hit has been the flock of BB of the community of Khalet Makhul. The disease, which is caused by the virus peste des petits ruminants, also known as goat plague, cannot be transmitted to humans.

As in Israel, in Palestinian Authority areas immunization against peste is not obligatory. But now [that] high mortality of lambs [has been] discovered in several flocks, the Palestinian Agriculture Ministry [has] immunized at least 17 000 animals in the northern Jordan Valley.

The ministry has issued instructions about precautionary measures -- for example, the carcasses must be buried in deep pits with lime spread on top. Shepherds said they had hitherto been burning the carcasses.

[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR, popularly called 'sheep and goat plague'), is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family Paramyxoviridae. It affects mainly sheep and goats, and occasionally wild small ruminants.

Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established. PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia.

The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterised by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often 2ary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form.

PPR must be confirmed by laboratory methods, as rinderpest, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease and other erosive or vesicular conditions as well as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia; which can cause clinically similar disease.

The above and additional data on PPR, its diagnostic techniques and vaccines, are available in OIE's Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.10_PPR.pdf.

PPR appeared 1st in northern Israel in January 1993. The route of introduction (most likely, from Lebanon) has not been established. Since then, the disease has become endemic in the territories of Israel and the Palestinian authority. Its control has been achieved by annual mass vaccinations of susceptible animals. Initially, rinderpest vaccine was applied but since the early 2000, it has been replaced by a homologous PPR vaccine, with very satisfactory results.

On [1 Jul 2016], Israel's State Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) published the discontinuation of compulsory, state organized PPR vaccinations, declaring further vaccinations as privatized and voluntary. It could be worthwhile to closely follow the impact of the said policy change on the incidence of PPR.

The above media report mentions sheep as the affected species. Many of the flocks in the region are mixed, including sheep and goats alike. The region they are located in is situated on the southern part of square 5 and the northern part of square 7, in the interactive map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html (on the western side of the Jordan river).

The Palestinian authority reported to the OIE 18 PPR outbreaks during 2016 and 19 during the 1st 6 months of 2017; this may be indicative of an increased incidence. The report for the remaining 6 months of 2017 is likely to be published during the coming months. Since the disease is endemic, no immediate notifications are to be published. - Mod.AS
