Minister of agriculture (Mentan) Syahrul Yasin Limpo said that a serotype of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus that was attacking local cattle in 6 [regencies] had been found. Therefore, the manufacture of FMD vaccine in the country will soon be accelerated.

"While waiting, the director general (DG) livestock and animal health at the Ministry of Agriculture [DG AH-MOA]) has been assigned to import vaccines. Not [a large quantity], just [while] waiting for the vaccine to be available because it takes time to manufacture. In 14 days the director general will bring it," Syahrul said in a press statement on Wednesday 11 May 2022.

The DG AH-MOA, Nasrullah, added that the Commission of Veterinary Experts is currently conducting discussions, to accelerate the implementation of domestic FMD vaccine manufacture. "God willing, hopefully we can make it as soon as possible. Because we have made it before, when the FMD was released, only the serotype was different so it had to be remade again. But the instrument, the expert, is with us," he said. "Earlier, the minister said, the serotype has been found. Serotype O with strain Ind-2001, apparently this is common in South East Asia," continued Nasrullah. At the same time, he said, efforts will be made to increase the immunity of farm animals.

"This FMD is a virus so there is no cure but there is prevention. While waiting for the vaccine to be made, we import it for areas affected by FMD. If it is not exposed [animal population], we will use our own vaccine," said Nasrullah.

[The FMD virus type O, topotype Middle-East South-Asia (ME-SA), lineage Ind-2001, has been the most prevalent FMD virus in the Indian subcontinent during more than 15 years. Since 2009 it became recognised outside of its original region (namely India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh) entering some countries in the Middle East: the United Arab Emirates in 2009, recurring there in 2014; Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, the virus entered the Maghreb countries Tunisia and Algeria, spreading in 2015 to Morocco.

Since 2015, O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 has been circulating in South East Asia, reportedly starting in Laos, spreading to Viet Nam, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, South Korea and, most recently to Eastern Russia (Orenburg) and Mongolia. 2 sublineages of the Ind-2001 lineage have been identified by the WRLFMD from the said countries throughout the years: d (earlier, in Laos and South Korea) and later e, which has been identified by the WRLFMD in Laos, South Korea, China, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Russia (Orenburg). This sublineage is currently circulating also in Nepal and Bhutan (current information from India is not available in the WRLFMD website).

It may be assumed that vaccine matching tests addressing the Indonesian pathogen have already been started; their results are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS]

Director general of livestock and animal health, Nasrullah, has said that Indonesia had experienced several outbreaks of FMD, starting from the entry of FMD into Indonesia in 1887 in Malang, East Java which then spread to various regions, until the last outbreak on the island of Java in 1983 which started in East Java.

"With various efforts to control and overcome FMD, finally Indonesia succeeded in declaring FMD-free status in 1986 through Minister of Agriculture Decree, World Animal Health Organization (OIE) Number XI of 1990," said Nasrullah in his introduction, quoted on Thursday [12 May 2022]. Therefore, the declaration of FMD-free for Indonesia in accordance with the OIE provisions refers to the conditions for countries that have been declared free of FMD without vaccination. To get the recognition of FMD-free status, he continued, a formal report is required to the OIE, which explains in detail the program for eradication, surveillance, monitoring, animal health infrastructure, and the organization of the livestock industry.

The Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY) reported the first 2 cases of FMD. Cases were found in livestock in Galur District, Kulon Progo Regency. The head of the DIY Agriculture Service, Sugeng Purwanto, said the first 2 cases were found in a cow and a goat belonging to a local farmer. Both had suspected or indicated acute status since showing symptoms of being infected with FMD a few days ago.

"[In view of the suspicion], only in the form of caution, we have taken some concrete steps, directly coordinated by the Kulon Progo Regency Government with the police. Sugeng confirmed that the 2 animals have now been isolated or quarantined by a special task force. This includes disinfecting the cage where the cows and goats previously lived. Sugeng claims that, so far the findings of the FMD case in the DIY region have only been found in Kulon Progo. Other districts/cities [of Yogyakarta] still have no reports.

[The authorities] will continue to monitor the traffic of livestock shipments. This step, according to Sugeng, will still be the main focus of his staff. Especially considering the need for meat consumption in the DIY region, about 50 per cent of which is met from other regions.

Vehicles transporting livestock from red or black areas spreading FMD will be immediately asked to turn back by the checkpoint officer. Meanwhile, those arriving from the green area will still undergo inspection. The special task force team for anticipating FMD, continued Sugeng, will directly monitor animal markets as a step to prevent the possibility of being missed at the entrance to livestock traffic. "We still maintain conduciveness. We don't panic and so on, we remain vigilant," he concluded.

[The Special Region of Yogyakarta is a provincial-level autonomous region of Indonesia in southern Java. For the location of the Galur district within the Kulon Progo Regency, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/1fNLTwhEM33LrpgM9.

If the cases are confirmed, the Special Region of Yogyakarta will become Indonesia's 3rd province infected by FMD, and the 2nd on the island of Java. The provinces already reported officially as infected are Aceh (known as the northernmost and westernmost province-level division of Indonesia) on the island Sumatra, and East Java, on the island Java.

FMD virus may spread into uninfected regions by several means, including legal and/or illegal introduction of infected animals and/or their products, including meat, in particular bone-in meat.

Meat is imported to Indonesia from several countries, led by Australia, New Zealand, and India. India, in contrast to the other exporters, is an FMD-endemic country. India exported to Indonesia 76.3 million kg of meat with a transaction value of USD 263.5 million during 2020 (last year of which data are available; see https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20220513183814-92-796556/6-daftar-negara-asal-impor-daging-sapi-indonesia). - Mod.AS
