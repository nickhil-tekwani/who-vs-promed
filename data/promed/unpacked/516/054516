disinfection of infected premises/establishment, transport vehicle,
and transport container. -Treatment of infected animal: extraction
and destruction of larvae followed with flushing with nolvasan and
Catron spray followed with oral Capstar (nitenpyram). Catron spray is
a topical insecticide indicated for screwworm and ear ticks.)

[Screwworm infestations are commonly considered as a livestock
problem but can certainly occur in any warm-blooded animal.
Occasional introductions into the United States from imported animals
do occur. We have been very fortunate that further spread has been
prevented by alert veterinary practitioners who reliably, until now,
identify the parasite in their clinics. For example, in 2000 a
veterinarian in Loxahatchee, Florida identified screwworm in a horse
imported from Argentina, and a private practitioner in Miami, Florida
found screwworm infestation in a cat which had just returned from
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 1997 another practitioner from San Antonio,
Texas diagnosed screwworm in a wound suffered by a basset hound.
The Southeastern United States became free of the disease in 1959 and
the USA was officially free of the disease in 1966, although annual
reintroductions of the parasite from Mexico occurred in Texas until
1982. The disease was eliminated by breeding irradiated, sterile male
flies and releasing them by plane to breed ineffectually with local
populations in targeted geographic areas. This premeditated strategy
of "shooting blanks" has proved to be successful in Central America
as well the United States. It does, however, require a specialized
facility to produce the sterile male flies. Unfortunately, in 2003, a
failure of sterilization led to release of approximately 50 million
fertile males in Panama and Chiapas, Mexico.
An abbreviated summary, taken from the USDA (US Department of
Agriculture) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service is provided below
and the full reference can be found at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsscworm.html>
Screwworms are parasites that can cause great damage to domestic
livestock and other warm-blooded animals. The larvae of this pest
enter open wounds of the host animal and feed on the raw flesh. Rare
cases of humans being infested with screwworm have been reported.
The United States has been free of screwworm since 1966. The US
livestock industry could suffer USD 750 million in production losses
annually if this pest were reintroduced to the United States.
The screwworm is actually an insect that, in its adult stage, is
about twice the size of the common housefly. It has orange eyes and a
blue-grey or grey body with three dark stripes running down its back

After mating, the female screwworm fly lays her eggs in the open
wounds of livestock and other mammals. One female can lay up to 400
eggs at a time and as many as 2800 eggs during its 31-day lifespan.
These eggs can hatch into larvae in as little as 12 hours.
Screwworm larvae grow by feeding on the flesh of living animals and
can grow to be over one-half inch (1.27 cm) within 5 to 7 days after
hatching. The full-grown larvae then drop from the wound and tunnel
into the soil where they form protective cases to house the pupae.
The adult screwworm flies emerge from the pupal case and are ready to
mate again within 3 to 5 days.
Animals are infested when the eggs hatch in the wound of an animal
and the larvae feed on the animal's flesh. Wounds that may become
infested by screwworm include those caused by feeding ticks, bites of
vampire bats, castration, dehorning, branding, shearing, wire cuts,
sore mouth in sheep, and shedding of the velvet in deer. Navels of
newborn mammals are a common site for screwworm infestation. It is
very difficult to see early stages of screwworm larvae feeding in a
wound; only slight movement may be observed. As the larvae feed, the
wound is gradually enlarged, becoming wider and deeper. - Mod.PC
