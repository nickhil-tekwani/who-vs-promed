The current outbreak of dengue-2 (DEN-2) virus began in the islands of
the Torres Strait in December, 1996. This region is located between the
northern part of Queensland (Australia) and Papua New Guinea. All DEN-2
cases occurred in residents or travellers to the Torres Strait islands. More
recently, (April 1997) local transmission of DEN-2 virus has occurred in
Cairns (Far North Queensland).
Nucleotide sequence comparison of the E/NS1 protein gene of a Torres Strait
and a Cairns DEN-2 virus isolate showed 100% similarity for the region
nt 1869 to nt 2511 of the genome. These isolates were found to be most
closely related to DEN-2 virus from Burkina Faso in 1986.
These DEN-2 virus isolates are distinct from the DEN-2 virus currently
circulating in the Cook Islands, which were found to be most closely related
to the DEN-2 virus responsible for the 1992-1993 outbreak in Far North
Queensland.
Sequence comparison of the complete E protein gene of the DEN-2 virus from
Cook Islands and Tahiti (French Polynesia) by Dr. Elaine Chungue at the
Institute Louis Malarde, Papeete, showed 100% similarity. These data
suggest the 1992-1993 Australian strains may have moved to the Pacific [Not
really moved but extended to the Pacific islands with a disappearance of that
topotype and replacement by another. This sort of hyperendemic situation is
most worrisome. -- Mod CHC] to be replaced by new strains.
