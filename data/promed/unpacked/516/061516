The Ministry of Public Health, through its Office of the Director of
Health Surveillance, reported this Monday [25 Aug 2011] that 9 people
died due to hantavirus [infections] in the country. All cases
occurred in the western region.

There are a total of 21 confirmed [hantavirus infection] cases. In
Presidente Hayes department [state or province equivalent], 6 cases
are confirmed, 13 in Bloqueron [department] and another one in Itapua,
a non-endemic area. The case fatality rate is 43 per cent. All the
deaths to date correspond to the Chaco axis of Presidente Hayes
(3[deaths]) y Boqueron (6).

Ecological pressure on the westernmost department, generated by
indiscriminate forest cutting and fires, would be a condition of the
occurrence of cases. These situations cause the reduction of the
population of natural predators of countryside rats (_Calomys laucha_)
and promote the population increase of these rodents, which, in turn
come to [human] populations in search of water and food.

The main means by which hantaviruses are transmitted to human beings
is via the respiratory [route] in aerosols contaminated with urine,
excreta or saliva of these rodents. It can also be transmitted by
handling rodents or touching one's nose or mouth after handling them.
One cannot acquire the virus [infection] by contact with another
person.

The initial symptoms are myalgia and fever that generally begin after
2 weeks after infection [starts], but the incubation period can be as
short as 3 days or as long as 6 weeks. Other common symptoms are:
headache, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
However, the primary symptom of hantavirus disease is respiratory
difficulty caused by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs. These
problems develop some days after the initial symptoms.

The way to prevent this disease would be to maintain a clean house to
avoid rodents, wash dishes immediately after use, clean counters and
floors, keep food of domestic animals and water far from the house at
night, store food in sealed places and keep trash in recipients with
hermetically closed tops, the official concluded saying.

[Although not mentioned in this report, a 16 Jul 2011 ProMED-mail post
(archive number 20110721.2196) indicated that Leguna Negra hantavirus
was responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in Presidente
Hayes department.

In addition to Laguna Negra virus, other hantaviruses that can cause
HPS and are found in Paraguay (and their rodent hosts), from a list
kindly provided by Dr James Mills, include Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys
chacoensis_), Lechiguanas (_Oligoryzomys flavescens_), Central Plata
(_Oligoryzomys flavescens_), Anajatuba (possible HPS; _Oligoryzomys
fornesi_), Oran (__Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), and Juquitiba
(__Oligoryzomys nigripes_).

Iqitos confirms its 2nd fatal hantavirus victim. The deaths of 2 women
have been confirmed in Iquitos from [a] hantavirus infection, who
become the only cases nationally, according to a statement by the
regional health director, Hugo Rodriquez Ferruci, in a press
conference.

"There are 2 confirmed cases, the 1st registered early in July and the
2nd presented on 12 Aug [2011]. Regretfully, it was not possible to
give the results immediately, but according to the report sent from
Lima, they indicated to us that the deaths of these 2 people are due
to [a] hantavirus [infection]," Rodriguez stated.

The physician indicated that all measures are being taken to alert the
population about symptoms [of the disease] and to go immediately to
health centers. He also requested that they clean their houses,
utilizing bleach throughout the house, and close up foodstuffs
adequately.
