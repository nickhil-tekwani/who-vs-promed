From: WHO, Weekly Epidemiological Record <http://www.who.ch/emc/>

Among other critical health problems, Afghanistan has been suffering from a
cholera outbreak since July this year. Approximately 1,500 cholera cases
per day are being recorded in Kabul Province. Other areas affected are
Logar, Bamyan, and Uruzgan Provinces in the south of the country. Exact
numbers are difficult to obtain due to the current security problems.
Laboratory investigation has confirmed that the outbreak is caused by
_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor. According to information available to date
the case fatality rate has been low.
Data are collected from 59 health facilities that are part of a national
surveillance system supported by WHO. The Ministry of Health with the
support of WHO have set up a Cholera Task Force which meets regularly and
is attended by several agencies (WHO, ICRC, UNDP, UNICEF). NGO 's. which
were withdrawn from Kabul Province, are not yet able to return but
negotiations are currently in progress to redress this situation.
