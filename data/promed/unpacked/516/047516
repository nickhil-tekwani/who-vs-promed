Movements of fish in and out of Earlswood Lakes, Norton Lane,
Earlswood, Solihull, West Midlands have been restricted, following
the confirmation of koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease. Movements of fish
in and out of the adjacent waters, known as Mereside Pools, have also
been restricted.

Defra has issued a Designated Area Order prohibiting the movement of
fish to and from Earlswood Lakes and Mereside Pools, Solihull, West
Midlands.

KHV disease affects common carp and carp varieties such as koi. It
can result in high rates of fish mortalities.

There are no implications for human health.

It became a legal obligation to notify suspicion of KHV disease on 6
Apr 2007. The measures developed in partnership between government
and industry to help combat outbreaks were announced on 21 May 2007.

Suspicion of the presence of the disease should be immediately
reported to: the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science (Cefas) in Weymouth Tel: 01305-206673/206674; E-mail:
<fish.health.inspectorate@cefas.co.uk>.

Notes to editors

- The Diseases of Fish (Designated Areas) (England) (No. 7) Order
2008, issued under the 1937 Diseases of Fish Act (as amended),
restricts the movement of any live fish or live eggs of fish into or
out of the designated area without the prior written consent of Defra.

- The designated area incorporates Earlswood Lakes (Engine Pool,
Windmill Pool and Terry's Pool) and Mereside Pools, Solihull, West
Midlands and comprises the waters and the land in the area bounded by
a line drawn from the following Ordnance Survey grid references:
SP11257450 following the course of the lane known as Valley Road to
SP11707400, following the course of the B1402 road to SP11507320,
straight to SP10157385 and returning to SP11257450.

- KHV disease may be suspected if dead or dying fish with other
clinical evidence such as bleeding from the gills, white patches on
the gills or skin, sunken eyes and hyperactive behavior are found in
fisheries, other inland waters, fish farms, fish dealers, retailers,
aquaria and garden ponds. These signs usually appear when water
temperatures are between 15 and 28 C.

- Details of the statutory and voluntary controls in place to help
combat outbreaks of KHV disease may be accessed from the following

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

KHV was 1st isolated in the UK in 2000 during a disease outbreak in
northern England. Outbreaks of clinical disease with signs similar to
KHV disease had been reported in 1998 and 1999. More KHV outbreaks
were confirmed in each of the years 2001-2003 using PCR and cell
culture-based assays. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples
taken in 1996 during an unexplained mass-mortality of koi and common
carp in the UK.

Aquatic Animals, CHAPTER 2.1.17., at
