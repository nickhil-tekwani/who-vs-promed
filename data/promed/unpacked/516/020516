MYCOBACTERIUM ULCERANS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Weekly Epidemiological Record 14th May 2004, produced and published by
the World Health Organisation, Geneva lists 30 countries throughout the
World where _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ ([the agent responsible for] Buruli
Ulcer) Infection has been reported. _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection
produces a chronic progressive disease which primarily involves
subcutaneous fat with secondary skin ulceration. Untreated, the infection
leads to extensive ulceration, scarring, contractures and considerable
deformity and debility. In some countries, particularly in West Africa,
the disease has displaced leprosy to become the 2nd most important
mycobacterial infection of man.

The disease characteristically occurs in closely defined areas, generally
in close relationship to stagnant or slowly moving water. In many of the
countries listed there are numerous, separate such recognised areas.

The report also lists cases of the disease in international travellers,
giving both the country of diagnosis and treatment and the country where
the disease may have been acquired. The report is of value not only to
countries where the disease occurs, but also for clinicians elsewhere who
may be considering the diagnosis in a returned traveller.

The Epidemiological Record may be accessed at: <http://www.who.int/wer/en>

References to published articles describing the foci are available on
request. Apart from the recorded foci listed in the report, there are
likely to be many more areas throughout the world where the disease occurs
and is either not diagnosed as such or has not been
reported. Correspondents who may be aware of such areas are asked to send
details to:

[The incubation period of Buruli ulcer is months to several years. The
disease frequently starts as a painless, sometimes pruritic skin nodule
which ulcerates and results in deforming massive ulceration. The bacterium
produces a cytotoxin that destroys the tissue. Although the organism is
susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents such as clarithromycin,
rifampin, amikacin and fluoroquinolones, antimicrobial treatment alone has
not been particularly successful. Lesions should be excised surgically
(hopefully when they are small) with skin grafting when necessary. - Mod.DK.

ProMED-mail is pleased to assist in this request for information on
geographical distribution of mycobacterium ulcerans. If subscribers have
information to share, please contact Dr. Kingsley Asiedu <asieduk@who.int>
directly. We look forward to seeing a summary report of additional areas
identified with infection once this information is available. - Mod.MPP]
