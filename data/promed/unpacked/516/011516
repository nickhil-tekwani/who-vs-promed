Government and private veterinarians are working around the clock to identify the cause of hundreds of reported incidents of cattle abortions in the Windhoek district [Namibia]. The reports originate from various farms, with losses ranging from 5 to 45 and even 128 on certain farms. It is suspected the incidents of abortion are occurring more widely than reported.

Numerous samples have been submitted to the Windhoek Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), as well as to Onderstepoort and Path Care in the Western Cape. Thus far, only the bacterium _Enterococcus casseliflavus_ has been identified, which, according to literature, is not known to cause abortions. Tests for other known venereal diseases have also been negative so far.

Although most of the abortions reported took place between the stages of 3 to 6 months, there were also reports of older calves aborted. It seems that symptoms vary, but one is a high fever of the cow shortly before aborting.

As much information as possible is needed, and it is crucial to report any incidents of cattle abortions to the CVL or veterinarians. A form is available from DVS offices to report the abortions.

Veterinarians told Farmers Forum that the basis of all abortion prevention programmes is sound herd health management. They say biosecurity is key. Their advice is to minimise the risk of introducing diseases on the farm. If the disease can enter the herd, it can spread within the herd. Either effectively quarantine cattle for a minimum of 14 days, or maintain a completely "closed" herd.

Special attention must also be given to the health status of bulls. Purchased bulls can introduce disease and spread it. Farmers are thus advised to get their veterinarians to assess the health status of their bulls and to only buy bulls from farms with a proven high health status.

Vaccination is an integral component of a complete herd health programme. It is not a remedy for poor management. Many of the infectious diseases that cause abortions in cattle have vaccines available, which are safe and effective.

Thus, farmers are advised to work closely with their vets to develop vaccination programmes targeting diseases that their farms are at risk from. Vaccines will not work if they are not properly handled and administered.

Abortion is the production of a dead calf within 270 days of insemination. Most abortions go undetected for up to about 120 days. Most herds have an abortion rate of 2 percent per year. A rate of 5 percent per year indicates a significant problem.

Abortion can be divided into non-infectious and infectious causes. Infectious causes are the most important and the ones for which there are specific control measures. Abortion due to infection can occur as a secondary complication of severe infection in the dam but often occurs without clinical signs.

The diagnostic rate of abortion submissions is low. It can be increased with good recording and maximising the amount of material submitted. All abortions in cattle need to be reported to the local animal health officer, who will decide if a statutory abortion investigation is needed.

[The following listed potential causes of cattle abortion deserve to be taken into consideration:

1. Infectious Causes
---
Neosporosis
Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD)
Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR, Bovine Herpesvirus 1)
Leptospirosis
Brucellosis
Mycotic Abortion
_Arcanobacterium pyogenes_
Trichomoniasis
Campylobacteriosis
Listeriosis
Chlamydophilosis (Chlamydiosis)
_Ureaplasma diversum_ Infection
_Mycoplasma spp._, _Histophilus somni_ (_Haemophilus somnus_) and a wide variety of other bacteria can also cause sporadic abortions in cattle. Occasionally, _Salmonella spp._ cause abortion storms.

Other infectious causes of abortion:
Rift valley fever virus, an important zoonotic virus which would cause abortions in cattle while seriously affecting also small ruminants;
Bluetongue virus;
Schmallenberg virus, Simbu serogroup Akabane and other bunyaviruses (where present) cause abortion and fetal anomalies.
Pestiviruses (eg BVDV) may also contaminate live vaccines produced on tissue cultures. It would thus be useful to exclude a vaccine-related event.
Parainfluenza-3 virus causes abortion in experimentally inoculated seronegative cattle but is seldom, if ever, diagnosed in field cases of abortion.

2. Noninfectious Causes
---
Vitamins A and E, selenium, and iron have been implicated in bovine abortions, but documentation based on experiments is available only for vitamin A.

Heat stress causes fetal hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis. High maternal temperature due to pyrexia may be more important than environmentally induced heat stress.

A number of toxins can cause abortion in cows. Ponderosa pine needles can cause abortion if ingested in the last trimester; the cows may become moribund after delivery and hemorrhage excessively. The toxic factor is believed to be estrogenic. Locoweed (_Oxytropis_ or _Astragalus_ spp.) contains an indolizidine alkaloid that can affect the corpus luteum, chorioallantois, and neurons, resulting in abortion or deformities. Broomweed (_Guttierrezia microcephala_) ingestion can also cause abortion, as can coumarins from rat poison, many grasses, or moldy sweet clover.

Mycotoxins, especially those with estrogenic activity, have been implicated in bovine abortions. Nitrates or nitrites have also been incriminated, but experimental evidence is controversial.

Some of the above data have been derived from the MSD Veterinary Manual at https://www.msdvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/abortion-in-large-animals/abortion-in-cattle.

The rate of abortions (in percentage) on affected farms will be helpful. Final results of the lab tests are expected with interest. - Mod.AS
