Epidemiological summary
- Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX). The monkeypox national Technical Working Group (TWG) has been monitoring cases and strengthening preparedness/response capacity.

- A total of 66 suspected cases have been reported 1 Jan - 29 May 2022. Of the suspected cases, 21 were confirmed from 9 states: Adamawa (5), Lagos (4), Cross River (2), FCT (2), Kano (2), Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), River (1), and Imo (1), with 1 death recorded. This was in a 40-year-old man with renal co-morbidity and on immune-suppressive drugs.

- The 20 new suspected cases in May 2022 were reported from 11 states: Lagos (5), Bayelsa (2), Adamawa (2), Rivers (2), Niger (2), FCT (2), Delta (1), Oyo (1), Kaduna (1), Edo (1), and Gombe (1). This is a 100% increase in case reporting as compared with April 2022, when 10 new cases were reported, and is likely due to ongoing efforts to increase awareness and improve surveillance.

- The 6 new confirmed positive cases (out of the 20 suspected cases) in May 2022 were confirmed in 4 states: Bayelsa (2), Adamawa (2), Lagos (1), and Rivers (1).

- From September 2017 to 29 May 2022, a total of 578 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country.

- Of the reported cases, 247 (42.7%) have been confirmed in 22 states: Rivers (53), Bayelsa (45), Lagos (34), Delta (31), Cross River (16), Edo (10), Imo (9), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (6), FCT (8), Enugu (4), Abia (3), Plateau (3), Adamawa (5), Nasarawa (2), Benue (2), Anambra (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Ebonyi (1), Niger (1), and Ogun (1).

- A total of 9 deaths have been recorded (CFR= 3.6%) in 6 states, namely Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1), and Rivers (1), from September 2017 to 29 May 2022.

Export of monkeypox to the United Kingdom (UK):

The NCDC was notified by the UK International Health Regulations (IHR) focal point about the case of exported monkeypox from Nigeria on 7 May 2022. The case was confirmed on 6 May 2022. The patient visited Nigeria between 20 Apr and 3 May 2022. The NCDC coordinated and supported the relevant state governments in Nigeria in carrying out an extensive investigation and response.

Activation of emergency operations centre (EOC):

The NCDC team and partners conducted a risk assessment to evaluate the current national and global epidemiological reports of monkeypox. The recommendations from this prompted the activation of the National Multisectoral Emergency Operations Centre at level 2. This EOC will continue to coordinate ongoing response activities in the country while contributing to the global response.

Challenges with monkeypox surveillance:
1. Suboptimal monkeypox surveillance in all states of the Federation
2. Non-prioritisation of Monkeypox as a disease of public health importance due to low-risk perception

Recommendations:
1. Risk communication and social mobilization
2. Advocacy to Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) and other professional groups on a high index of suspicion and disease notification

Key activities:
1. The multi-agency MPX emergency operation centre coordinates monkeypox activities at NCDC.
2. Offsite support is being provided to states.

Next steps:
1. Deployment of the One Health animal surveillance team
2. Weekly follow-up calls/emails to the state's surveillance team and MPX treatment facilities
3. Follow-up with trained health-care workers on plans for step-down training

[Monkeypox virus clearly is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except to the far northeast. The above report does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.6% is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

The report does not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people, but not readily. - Mod.TY

In the Congo in 2022, 9 people have died of monkeypox, while Nigeria has recorded its 1st death from the disease this year [2022], the countries' health authorities said, even as at least 20 countries continue to grapple with sudden outbreaks not seen in years.

Dr. Aime Alongo, chief of the Sankuru health division in Congo, said Monday [30 May 2022] that 465 cases of the disease have been confirmed in the nation, making it one of the worst-hit in West and Central Africa, where the disease is endemic.

The persistence of the disease in Congo is due to the consumption of dead monkeys and rodents, Dr. Alongo said. "The residents enter the forest, pick up the corpses of monkeys, bats, and rodents, which are the reservoirs of monkeypox," the official added, urging those with monkeypox symptoms to visit a health center to isolate themselves.

[The above report indicates that there are 465 confirmed cases of monkeypox (MPX) cases in the DR Congo this year (2022), with 9 deaths (case fatality rate of 2%). This is substantially fewer case number than was reported earlier this year [2022]. A 20 Apr 2022 report (see Monkeypox - Africa (05): Congo DR 20220422.870276) stated that the DR Congo (DRC) tallied 1088 monkeypox cases during the 1st 3 months of 2022, according to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO). This is comparable to the number of cases reported during the same period in 2021 (1126). A total of 52 fatalities have been attributed to monkeypox this year [2022] to 20 Apr 2022 (CFR 4.8%). Neither this report nor the 20 Apr 2022 one indicates if any of these cases were due to person-to-person transmission, or if all were due to contact with infected wild mammals (non-human primates and rodents). - Mod.TY
