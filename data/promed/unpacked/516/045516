USDA confirms soybean rust in United States
-----------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service today [10 Nov 2004] confirmed the presence of soybean rust [SR] on
soybean leaf samples taken on Saturday [6 Nov 2004] from 2 plots associated
with a Louisiana State University research farm. While this is the 1st
instance of SR to be found in the United States, the detection comes at a
time when most soybeans have been harvested across the country. As a result
of the harvest, the impact of the fungus should be minimal this year [2004].
SR is caused by either of 2 fungal species, _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, also
known as the Asian species, and _P. meibomiae_, the New World species. The
Asian species, the one found in Louisiana, is the more aggressive of the 2
species, causing more damage to soybean plants.
USDA will dispatch its SR detection assessment team, composed of scientific
experts and regulatory officials, to the site within 24 hours. The
assessment team will work closely with Louisiana State Department of
Agriculture representatives to assess the situation and conduct
surveillance around the detection site to determine the extent of disease
spread.
SR is spread primarily by wind-borne spores capable of being transported
over long distances. Based on predictive models, APHIS believes that the
detection in the U.S. is related to this year's [2004] very active
hurricane season. While the harvest for this year is complete, during next
year's planting season, producers will need to watch for symptoms of the
fungus, such as small lesions on the lower leaves of the infected plant
that increase in size and change from gray to tan, or reddish brown, on the
undersides of the leaves.
USDA and the soybean industry have been cooperating on awareness efforts
and will amplify those efforts now that the disease has been found in the
U.S. Lesions are most common on leaves but may occur on petioles, stems,
and pods. SR produces 2 types of lesions, tan and reddish brown. Tan
lesions, when mature, consist of small pustules surrounded by slightly a
discolored necrotic area with masses of tan spores on the lower leaf
surface. Reddish brown lesions have a larger reddish brown necrotic area
with a limited number of pustules, and few visible spores, on the lower
leaf surface. Once pod set begins on soybean, infection can spread rapidly
to the middle and upper leaves of the plant.
SR can be managed with the judicious use of fungicides. However, early
detection is required for the most effective management of SR. Monitoring
soybean fields and adjacent areas is recommended throughout the growing
season. Fungicide applications can reduce yield loss, depending on the
plant developmental stage, the time when SR is detected, and the fungicide
application method. Efficacy information for producers on fungicides is
available through state university extension services.

[USDA and APHIS plant pathologists have been anticipating the arrival of SR
in the U.S. for several years. Now that it has been detected, efforts must
be directed to containing the disease. Depending upon conditions in the
area, it may be difficult to detect SR-infected soybean plants in areas
near the outbreak site. To save space, I have listed only the 1st and most
recent postings for SR.
