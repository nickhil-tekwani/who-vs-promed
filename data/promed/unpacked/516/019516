[1] Commentary: Measles hysteria hits USA

Recent commentary on the current reported measles outbreak from healthcare professionals and government officials, blasted across the major media nearly nonstop, amounts to virtual hysteria, with unvaccinated people being singled out on the basis of utterly biased reporting. While public confidence in vaccine safety is decreasing, public debate is being essentially forbidden. Now, police-state measures threatening fines and quarantine of those refusing vaccines are rising, with persecution of the unvaccinated already happening in some places.

In support of recent legislation (H.B. 1638) in Washington state, biochemical engineer Brian S. Hooker, who has published multiple papers on the issue of ineffective vaccines, addressing a House committee, said: "There's a problem with measles in Washington ... but it's not low vaccination rates. It's actually high rates with a vaccination product unable to provide lifetime immunity or vigorous maternal protection to infants during their 1st year of life."

Alternative health practitioner Brian David Andersen, of the Tri Vortex Institute in Palm Desert, Calif., recalled that the measles has always been one of those maladies "that you get once in childhood, stay home a few days from school, and then you're naturally immune." He added, "All that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other vaccine skeptics really want are impartial, rigorous studies to fully determine vaccine ingredients and find out, once and for all, if the vaccines actually work and are worth all the expense and the risks they create."

[This report represents a perspective on the measles outbreak not generally read on ProMED, but prevalent in the social media. In order to be able to intelligently argue for vaccination with MMR, and counter false claims, the full report should be read. The scientific data clearly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine. Further support is provided by noting that vaccine cases coincide with populations with low vaccination rates.

[2] Opinion: A regrettable milestone in the measles epidemic
Date: Mon 29 Apr 2019
Source: The Seattle Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/a-regrettable-milestone-in-the-measles-epidemic/


Measles is a truly miserable virus. The disease itself, once you are infected, makes you feel awful, many times worse than the flu. There is no treatment for measles. We have no antiviral medications, no cure. Once someone is infected, medical science is essentially helpless against this potentially deadly illness.

What we do have is a very good, safe and effective vaccine. If we immunize enough people, we can create a shield of protection across communities. Unfortunately, in the USA, that shield is now riddled with holes.

Last week, the USA reached a regrettable new milestone in its fight against measles, as reports are being made of the 681st measles case. This makes 2019 the record holder for measles since the USA declared the disease eradicated in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Measles has been diagnosed in 22 states. As measles cases continue to climb, so do the chances we will see someone die from measles.

We need to fight this epidemic at every level, starting now, before that happens. We must shore up our shield of protection. To do that, we need a multipronged approach.

First, the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] calls on the CDC to launch a comprehensive strategy to increase parents' confidence in vaccines, address barriers to vaccination, and improve access to vaccines in all communities. We need a national strategy to drive immunization rates high enough to achieve community immunity in every city and state.

Second, we must surround parents with the information they need to make the decision to vaccinate. That's why we need the help of companies like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest to elevate evidence-based information on immunizations in the online communities where parents are gathering.

Finally, states can take steps to increase immunization rates. California enacted a law in 2015 that makes it harder to obtain a nonmedical exemption to school-entry immunization requirements, and we hope to see other states follow suit.

In Washington, we are awaiting Gov. Jay Inslee's signature on a bill to prohibit personal exemptions specifically for the MMR vaccine. In 2019, legislation has been introduced in more than 10 states to restrict or eliminate nonmedical exemptions.

No vaccine protects 100% of the time; we depend on many people being vaccinated to protect those for whom the vaccine doesn't work as well, or those who can't be vaccinated. Children are more vulnerable when they attend schools with low immunization rates.

Parents should have access to the immunization rates at their children's schools or child-care centers, so they can understand the risk. All parents should be empowered to protect their children where they live, learn and play.

We stand on the cusp of a new era in infectious diseases in this country, one where a disease we had largely eradicated has again gained a foothold. It's still possible to contain this disease, but only if we act quickly.

Let's not watch more children suffer. As a pediatrician and a parent, I implore you to choose to protect your loved ones with a very safe, effective vaccine. If given the choice, no child would choose the measles.

[Byline: Kyle Yasuda (President of the AAP)]

[3] Measles outbreak raises questions about immunity in adults
Date: Sun 28 Aug 2019

https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/04/28/measles-outbreak-raises-questions-about-immunity-in-adults/23718559/


Adults in the United States who were vaccinated against measles decades ago may need a new dose depending on when they received the shot and their exposure risk, according to public health experts battling the nation's largest outbreak since the virus was deemed eliminated in 2000.

Up to 10% of the 695 confirmed measles cases in the current outbreak occurred in people who received 1 or 2 doses of the vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

The figure illustrates what can happen when a large number of individuals, even those who have been vaccinated, are exposed to the measles. CDC recommends that people who are living in or traveling to outbreak areas should check their vaccination status and consider getting a new dose.

Dr. Allison Bartlett, an infectious disease expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, said the "continued vulnerability to infection" is why high-risk adults such as healthcare workers are routinely advised to get a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine if they have not had one.

But knowing your vaccination status can be tricky, experts said. "It's complicated and often futile because it's very difficult to resurrect those old records," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

People vaccinated in the United States since 1989 would most likely have received 2 doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot under federal guidelines, and that is still considered the standard for protection.

Anyone vaccinated between 1963 and 1989 would likely have received only 1 dose, with many people immunized in the earlier years receiving an inactivated version of the virus. Americans born before 1957 are considered immune as they would have been exposed to the virus directly in an outbreak.

Merck & Co Inc is the sole U.S. provider of the MMR vaccine. The company said in a statement that it has "taken steps to increase U.S. supply" of the vaccine due to the current outbreak.

In general, the CDC says 2 doses of the measles vaccine should provide 97% protection; one dose should offer 93% protection. However, immunity can wane over time. This has occurred even in adults with 2 documented doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Michael Phillips, chief epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health, which serves parts of New York City, a hot spot in the USA outbreak. He said in kids, "the vaccine is really effective," but in some adults, memory T-cells, which recognize and attack germs, do not fight the virus as effectively as they once did.

Rapid blood tests are available that can detect whether a person is immune based on the level of measles antibodies, but the tests are not 100% reliable.

Adults who have any doubt about their immunity should get another dose, Schaffner said: "It's safe. There's no downside risk. Just roll up your sleeve."

[4] Measles vaccine effectiveness: supportive data, Background
Source: GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]
https://www.gideononline.com/2019/04/29/measles-vaccine-effectiveness-supportive-data/


Where data are available, reported rates of measles are inversely related to vaccination coverage. This observation is true for virtually every country ... from Algeria to Zambia - and are most evident as percentage vaccine coverage exceeds 80%. The following charts are based on WHO statistics for measles incidence and estimates (rather than individual reports) of true vaccine coverage.

Note in the following charts, that when groups of countries are compared, the disease rates themselves are often numerically lower for countries which have attained highest vaccination coverage [1,2].

For example, in the 3rd chart, the relatively low vaccine coverage for the Africa is reflected in a relatively high disease rate for that region. The two lower charts depict a decrease in fatal measles cases which have paralleled increasing vaccine coverage.

[5] UNICEF: Worldwide cases
Date: Sat 27 Apr 2019
Source: Nation [abridged, edited]
https://nation.com.pk/27-Apr-2019/110-000-measles-cases-worldwide-reported-in-2019-unicef


More than 110 000 measles cases were reported worldwide in the 1st quarter of 2019, UNICEF revealed, adding that these figures represent a 300% hike from the same period last year [2018].

"The ground for the global measles outbreaks we are witnessing today was laid years ago," said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. "The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."

An estimated 169 million children missed out on the 1st dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017, the UN children's fund noted. That's an average of 21.1 million children per year, with widening pockets of unvaccinated children creating pathways for measles outbreaks.

An estimated 110 000 people, most of them children, died from measles in 2017, a 22% increase from the year before [2016].

Two doses of the measles vaccine are essential to protect children from the disease. However, due to lack of access, weak health systems, complacency, and in some cases fear or scepticism about vaccines, the global coverage of the 1st dose of the measles vaccine was reported at 85% in 2017, a figure that has remained relatively constant over the last decade despite population growth.

Global coverage for the 2nd dose is much lower, at 67%. The World Health Organisation recommends a threshold of 95% immunisation coverage to achieve so-called 'herd immunity'. In high-income countries, while coverage with the 1st dose is 94%, coverage for the 2nd dose drops to 91%, according to the latest data.

The United States tops the list of high-income countries with the most children not receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, at more than 2.5 million. It is followed by France and the United Kingdom, with over 600 000 and 500 000 unvaccinated infants, respectively, during the same period.

An adult who recently arrived from outside the USA was recently confirmed as having the 1st case of the measles on Long Island since outbreaks elsewhere in New York have been reported, officials said. The Suffolk County Department of Health Services said that the case does not appear to be related to any current measles cases in New York State, but it is jointly investigating the case with the New York State Department of Health and will take appropriate action based on the findings.

Earlier this week we reported an update on the measles outbreak in the Brooklyn/Queens area of New York City. Since Oct. 2018, 390 confirmed cases have been reported as of [23 Apr 2019].

According to NYC health officials, all but 12 of these individuals with measles are members of the Orthodox Jewish communities of Williamsburg (323; 83%) and Borough Park (55; 14%). A total of 7 individuals who do not identify as members of the Orthodox Jewish community have been diagnosed with measles since the outbreak began.

The vast majority of individuals diagnosed with measles have been children (330, 85%), of whom 304 (92%) were unvaccinated. A total of 60 cases have occurred among adults, of whom 43 (72%) were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status.

A total of 29 individuals have been hospitalized, including 6 in the intensive care unit. Serious complications include 17 individuals with pneumonia.

Eight individuals, including the initial case, acquired measles while travelling abroad to Israel (5), the United Kingdom (2) and Ukraine (1), areas with active outbreaks, highlighting the need for MMR vaccination for individuals traveling overseas.

As of 24 Apr 2019, there have been 390 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October [2018]. Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community.

The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland County

[8] New York: Williamsburg Yeshivas closed, fines imposed
Date: Mon 29 Apr 2019

https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/1720410/breaking-two-more-williamsburg-yeshivas-closed-due-to-measles-57-summonses-issued-to-unvaccinated-individuals.html


As part of their efforts to contain a significant measles outbreak, officials in New York closed more schools, issued more fines and lobbied the Legislature on [Mon 29 Apr 2019] to eliminate religious exemptions for required vaccinations.

New York City's health department said [Mon 29 Apr 2019] it has now issued summonses to 57 people for failing to abide by an emergency order issued this month [April 2019] requiring people living in certain parts of Brooklyn to get the measles vaccine. If those citations are upheld at a hearing, each person could get slapped with a USD 1000 fine.

The schools will not be allowed to reopen until the NYC Health Department reviews and approves a submitted corrective action plan that addresses the ongoing lapses in complying with the Order. The Health Department had previously closed 5 schools--not including the programs shuttered today--for failing to comply with the Commissioner's Order. All 5 have been authorized to reopen under Health Department monitoring after submitting a corrective action plan that was approved by the Department.

"Schools that continue to disregard our direction during the outbreak will be closed down until they can prove to the Health Department that they will comply," said Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot. "The reality is, the longer it takes schools and individuals to comply with our Order, the longer this outbreak will continue."

In the state capital, Rockland County Executive Ed Day joined lawmakers at an event supporting the repeal of a state law allowing exemptions to immunizations based on religious beliefs.

Day, a Republican who's Rockland County's top elected official, urged for passage of the bill eliminating the religious exemption from vaccination as soon as possible. "This bill would be a godsend," Day said during a news conference at the state Capitol. "To wait is a recipe for medical disaster."

The New York Alliance For Vaccine Rights, a Long Island-based group that opposes the legislation, said the bill would violate longstanding rights of "religious practices and bodily autonomy."

Individual summonses
----------------------
In addition, 57 individuals have received summonses for being non-compliant with the Emergency Order since the City began issuing summonses last week.

Current case count
------------------
To date, 423 cases of measles have been confirmed since the beginning of the outbreak last October [2018]; 348 cases (82%) have occurred in Williamsburg (ZIP codes 11205, 11206, 11211, 11249), which has been under an Emergency Order issued [9 Apr 2019] requiring those who live or work in these ZIP codes to have been vaccinated with the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine (MMR). A small number of cases have occurred outside of these neighborhoods but have, to date, not resulted in sustained transmission of measles.

Geographic distribution of cases
--------------------------------
Eight individuals, including the initial case, acquired measles while travelling abroad to Israel (5), the United Kingdom (2) and Ukraine (1), areas with active outbreaks, highlighting the need for MMR vaccination for individuals traveling overseas. A small number of cases have occurred outside of the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods at the core of the current outbreak. These cases have been diagnosed in residents of Midwood/Marine Park (4), Brighton Beach (2), Flushing (2), Crown Heights (1), Bensonhurst (1), Far Rockaway (1) and the Hunts Point, Longwood and Melrose section of The Bronx (1). A total of 7 individuals who do not identify as members of the Orthodox Jewish community have been diagnosed with measles since the outbreak began in October 2018. Of individuals who acquired measles in New York City, only one person diagnosed with measles during this outbreak does not report an exposure associated with the Orthodox Jewish community of Williamsburg, Borough Park, or other area with measles activity.

[9] Colorado: Capitol - House passes immunization exemption bill

The Colorado House passed one of the legislative session's most contentious bills on [Sat 27 Apr 2019] afternoon, but it still has a tough road ahead before General Assembly adjourns next [Fri 3 May 2019].

House Bill 1312 would create a standard exemption form for parents and guardians who want to exempt their children from immunizations for school. Parents who choose not to vaccinate their children have testified at the Capitol that they see that as an intrusion by government into their relationship with their child.

Supporters say collecting data is a necessity to track how many children are immunized in the wake of measles outbreaks across the country. The goal also is to increase participation by reducing the number of people who skip vaccinations out of convenience. Exemptions otherwise remain unchanged for those who want to exempt their children for medical reasons or personal beliefs.

To become law, the bill still has to make it through the state Senate -- where Democrats hold a narrower majority -- in under a week.

[10] Texas: vaccine transparency
Date: Sat 27 Apr 2019
Source: Brownwood Bulletin, The Texas Tribune report [abridged, edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=34ec0e2c-68ca398f-34eef719-000babda0106-9581de234a64d6ce&u=https://www.brownwoodtx.com/news/20190427/texas-legislators-call-for-more-vaccine-transparency-amid-national-measles-outbreaks


As confirmed measles cases around the country hit the highest number since 2000 -- including more than a dozen confirmed cases in Texas -- state lawmakers are considering whether parents should have access to more information about how many students in local schools aren't vaccinated.

For well over a decade, Texas has sent an annual survey to schools about how many kindergarten and 7th grade students filed for exemptions from vaccines. But the data, while publicly available, is often incomplete and lacking some key details. While private schools and charter schools report exemption rates by school, the public school districts that most Texas children attend only publicly report a rate for the entire district.

Senate Bill 329 from state Sen. Kel Seliger would allow parents to access more detailed information for each school. It would include information such as the exemption rates broken down by vaccine type, the number of students who have "conscientious exemptions" -- vaccine exemptions for personal or religious beliefs -- and the number of students who have medical exemptions signed by doctors. The Amarillo Republican said the bill isn't meant to impact the decisions of individual families and whether they should vaccinate their children.

Texas law requires that children at all public and private schools have 10 immunizations for diseases such as tetanus, polio and whooping cough. Children must receive the vaccines before enrolling in kindergarten and are required to receive others, such as the meningococcal vaccine, in later grades. If parents want to opt out of the vaccine requirements through a conscientious exemption, they must submit a notarized affidavit form to the school that is valid for a 2-year period.

In 2003, Texas allowed conscientious exemptions for the 1st time in addition to medical and religious exemptions.

State data shows a marked increase in conscientious vaccine exemptions over the last decade, as the "anti-vaxxer" movement has taken hold. In the 2017-18 school year, the overall conscientious exemption rate for students enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade was 1.07%, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. In Texas' largest school districts, the conscientious exemption rate for kindergarten students was higher at 1.8%. Of those larger districts, Austin ISD, which had a total student enrollment of 81 346 students for the 2017-18 school year, had the highest percentage of conscientious exemptions for kindergarten students at 2.3%.

Yet the data is also missing many schools and districts that don't fill out the survey every year. Although it's mandated by Texas law, the state doesn't have a way to enforce that mandate, according to DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. And exemption data from schools and school districts with fewer than 65 students isn't released publicly.

[11] Summary of cases
Date: Mon 29 Apr 2019
Source: CNN [edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/health/measles-cdc-704-bn/index.html


There have now been 704 cases of measles in the USA this year [2019] the CDC said on [Mon 29 Apr 2019]. Federal health officials provided details about those cases that have not been reported this year until now including that 94% of those infected were exposed in one of the 13 outbreaks, 71% were unvaccinated, 67% are from New York City and New York state.

As many as 71% (503) of this year's [2019] USA patients were unvaccinated, 11% (76) were vaccinated with at least one of the recommended doses, and 18% (125) had an unknown vaccination status. Of those infected this year, 25 were younger than 6 months old, 68 were between 6 and 11 months old and 167 were between 16 months and 4 years old.

The new case total is 9 more than the agency reported on [Wed 24 Apr 2019] when it confirmed that the United States had reached the highest number of cases in a single year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. Elimination is when year-round transmission of an illness is interrupted, the CDC said.

"Increased global measles activity poses a risk to U.S. elimination, particularly when unvaccinated travelers acquire measles abroad and return to communities with low vaccination rates," said a report published [Mon 29 Apr 2019] by the CDC detailing the cases of the disease reported this year [2019]. According to the report, there have been 13 outbreaks of measles this year which account for 663 (94%) of the 704 cases. An outbreak is defined by the CDC as "a chain of transmission of 3 or more cases linked in time and place and is determined by local and state health department investigations." As many as 6 of the outbreaks were in "underimmunized close-knit religious or cultural communities." That includes the 474 cases reported by New York City and New York state, which account for 67% of all of this year's [2019] cases.

The New York outbreak began in October [2018] and is now the longest and largest outbreak in the USA since 2000. In all, more than 600 cases have been reported since October [2018], mostly in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. It began when an unvaccinated child visited Israel, returned infected, then spread the disease to others, according to New York City health officials.

"The longer this lasts the greater chance it will get a foothold," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said. She added that these communities have been targeted with misinformation that has spread.

Five cases of measles have been imported into the United States this year from Israel, which is just one of the countries where the 44 cases directly imported into this country in 2019 came from. The others are: Philippines (14 cases), Ukraine (8), Thailand (3), Vietnam (2), Germany (2), Algeria (1), France (1), India (1), Lithuania (1), Russia (1) and the UK (1), according to the CDC. An additional 4 travelers visited more than one country during the time when they would have been exposed to the virus. Of those travelers who brought measles to the United States after their trips, 88% were unvaccinated and all were old enough to be vaccinated, according to Messonnier.

According to the World Health Organization, the countries reporting the highest number of cases during the past 12 months were Ukraine (72 000), Madagascar (69 000) and India (60 000).

"Worldwide, 7 million measles cases are estimated to occur annually, and since 2016, measles incidence has increased in 5 of the 6 World Health Organization regions contributing to the ongoing risk for measles importation into the United States," the report said. The protection against the illness that results from a vaccination rate of more than 91% in children age 19 -- 35 months is at risk because of unvaccinated and undervaccinated communities, the report warned.

[The header of this report refers to a mother whose 5 year old child was too young to be vaccinated, and contracted measles. Because this virus is so highly infectious, young children and immunocompromised individuals depend on the rest of society to protect them from infection and risk of severe complications. This is the basis of public health, protection of the population; it is more than the individual.

Measles continues to spread in the United States, with more than 704 cases reported so far this year in 22 states.

U.S. health officials on [Mon 29 Apr 2019] updated the national tally. It has already eclipsed the total for any full year since 1994, when 963 cases were reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] says this year's [2019] count includes 44 people who caught the disease while traveling in another country. Some of them triggered U.S. outbreaks, mostly among unvaccinated people. That includes the largest outbreaks, in Orthodox Jewish communities in and around New York City.

Three-quarters of those who caught the extremely contagious disease are children or teenagers.

No deaths have been reported but 66 patients were hospitalized.

Measles cases nationwide rose to over 30 000 in the first quarter of the year, the Department of Health (DOH) reported yesterday [Sun 28 Apr 2019]. The latest DOH disease surveillance report showed a total of 31 056 measles cases were recorded nationwide from [January to 13 Apr 2019]. The DOH said recorded measles incidence is higher by 6641 from the cases posted during the same period last year.

Mortality due to measles this year [2019], DOH noted, also went up to 415, which is higher by 50 from last year's [2018] figure. The National Capital Region accounted for the biggest number of cases with 6075 including 106 deaths. Region 4A or Calabarzon posted the 2nd highest number of cases with 6010 including 111 deaths followed by Region 3 (Central Luzon) with 5091 and 73 deaths.

[15] Ukraine: 100 000 cases and 35 deaths since summer of 2017; Week ending Apr 20 additional 2141 cases. Cases rise to 41 640 in 2019
Date: Sun 28 Apr 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=ef7de5e2-b358e981-ef7f1cd7-0cc47aa88e08-f9a50029441f184b&u=http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-ukraine-100000-cases-35-deaths-since-summer-2017/


More than 2000 measles cases were reported in the latest update from the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

During the week ending [20 Apr 2019], health authorities saw an additional 2141 cases of measles-1106 adults and 1035 children. This brings the outbreak total for 2019 to 41 640 people - 19 271 adults and 22 369 children. In addition, one more individual died bringing the measles death toll to 15 since the beginning of the year [2019].

Kharkiv (290 patients: 216 adults and 74 children), Ternopil (219: 57 adults and 162 children), Kiev (187: 116 adults and 71 children), Lviv (161: 41 adult and 120 children) regions, and in Kyiv (170:88 adults and 82 children) regions saw the most cases during the week.

Since this outbreak began in the summer of 2017, more than 100 000 measles cases have been reported in Ukraine, including 35 deaths.

Health officials remind once again that for reliable protection against measles, all children must receive both the 1st and 2nd dose of measles vaccine in a timely manner.

Some people may suffer from severe complications from measles, such as pneumonia and encephalitis:
- As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.
- About one child out of every 1000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.
- For every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die from it.
In addition, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. SSPE generally develops 7 to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness.

[16] Nigeria: ranks highest with unvaccinated children.
Date: Wed 24 Apr 2019
Source: WHO All Africa [abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201904250065.html


The World Health Organisation has listed Nigeria as one of the 9 African countries where measles outbreaks have resurfaced.

WHO in a statement signed on Wed by Collins Boakye-Agyemang, its Spokesman for Africa, listed other countries to include Chad, Cameroon, DR Congo, Liberia, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali and Uganda.

The world health body said the global measles crisis is an urgent wake-up call to the need for countries to ensure that all children - no matter where they live - receive life-saving vaccines. It said African countries have experienced a resurgence of measles outbreaks in the last 12 months, adding that Madagascar, in particular, has had a large measles outbreak affecting more than 122 000 cases in the months between October 2018 and April 2019.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that accounts for 13% of all vaccine-preventable deaths in children younger than 5 years in Africa, infecting 9 in 10 people who are not vaccinated.

According to the WHO/UNICEF coverage estimates as of 2017, only 16 countries in the World Health Organization's African Region had achieved 90% or more immunisation coverage of the 1st dose of measles vaccine (MCV1). Across the region, MCV1 coverage has stagnated, at 70-73% since 2009.

WHO said vaccines are one of the most effective and cost-effective public health interventions available. Yet, 1 in 5 children in Africa still do not have access to all the necessary and basic vaccines a child should receive.

The body said every year, more than 30 million children younger than 5 years in Africa fall sick due to vaccine-preventable diseases. Of them, more than half a million die - representing 56% of the global deaths related to vaccine-preventable diseases.

It pointed out that, in Africa, vaccine-preventable diseases also impose an economic burden of USD 13 billion every year - funding that could be used to fuel economies and drive development.

In 2017, African Heads of State endorsed the Addis Declaration on Immunisation at the African Union Summit, committing to reach all children with life-saving vaccines. While political will for immunisation across the region is high, WHO said African Vaccination Week 2019 is a reminder for countries to renew their commitments and redouble efforts to achieve universal access to vaccines.

[17] Angola: 17 cases registered 738 suspected
Date: Mon 22 Apr 2019
Source: Reliefweb, a Government of Angola report [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/country-reports-17-cases-measles


At least 17 cases of measles were registered throughout the country during the 1st 3 months of the year [2019], with a total of 738 suspects, reported [Mon 22 Apr 2019] in Luanda, the Coordinator of the Expanded Vaccination Program, Alda Sousa.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of measles cases worldwide recorded in the first 3 months of 2019 has quadrupled compared to the same period last year [2018].

The coordinator said that despite the fact that in the year 2018 were registered 19 cases throughout the country the situation is not alarming compared to other years, due to the vaccination campaigns that have helped to control the outbreak of new cases.

The province of Uige is characterized as the province with the most confirmed cases (6), followed by Moxico (4), Lunda Sul (2), Namibe (1), Bie (1), Huambo (1), Huíla (1) and Cuanza Norte (1).

"We are in a time when the incidence of measles in Angola is not high because in previous years the average number of cases was 14 000 confirmed. Since 2014 the country has implemented vaccination campaigns against measles, so only last year [2018] we experienced an outbreak, but of small magnitude in the province of Luanda, in the municipality of Viana, "he said.
