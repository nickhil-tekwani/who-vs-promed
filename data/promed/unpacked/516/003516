KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 -- Private medical facilities including
clinics will have to report to the Health Ministry if they treat any of
the 26 infectious diseases listed by the ministry, Director-General
of Health Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman said today.
They could report such cases via any local authority such as the
municipal council or district health office, he said in a statement. The
diseases included tuberculosis, food poisoning, HIV/AIDS,
whooping cough, measles, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, yellow
fever, Ebola, leprosy, malaria and cholera.
Dr Abu Bakar also said 16 209 of the 430 906 foreign workers who went
for medical tests under the auspices of Fomema were found to be
ineligible to work in Malaysia as of Sept 13.
He said 10 968 of them had Hepatitis B, 2689 had venereal diseases,
1282 had TB and 162 HIV/AIDS.

around the world these days
