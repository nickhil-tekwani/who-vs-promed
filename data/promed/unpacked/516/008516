The result of the analysis of a monkey found in rural Itapetininga shows
that it died of yellow fever [virus infection]. Therefore, bordering cities
have also begun to vaccinate the population. In 2008, 2 cases of yellow
fever were registered in the State of Sao Paulo and 2 people died. In 2009,
25 cases [have been] confirmed and 9 people [have died].

The howler monkey was found dead in a site in a rural area of Itapetininga.
On 27 April [2009], it was sent for analysis and it was found that it died
of yellow fever [virus infection]. From then on concerns about the disease
[virus] infecting humans began.

According to the Epidemiological Surveillance of Itapetininga, 123 580
people were immunized in the city this year [2009]. According to the
coordinator, Aguida Marcondes, there is no reason to panic. The alert is
for neighboring municipalities. The State Secretariat of Health directed 6
cities in the region to halt the virus [infection by vaccination]: Tatui,
Pilar do Sul, Capao Bonito, Sao Miguel Arcanjo, Sarapui, and Alambari.

Yellow fever [YF] has a new profile
-----------------------------------
The Health Ministry is investigating an increased frequency of outbreaks
and cases in locations previously considered free of the disease.

A team of physicians, veterinarians and biologists appointed by the
Ministry of Health a few days ago began research in the field to discover
why the behavior of yellow fever in Brazil has changed in the country.
Outbreaks of the disease, which typically occur every 7 years, have become
more frequent.

The geography has also changed -- before it occurred at some specific
points in the territory; yellow fever has progressed recently to areas that
were previously considered free of disease. The latest examples are in Rio
Grande do Sul and in the south west of Sao Paulo [state]. Together, the 2
areas that before posed no risk for yellow fever, recorded between November
2008 and April this year [2009], 43 infections, with 16 deaths.

In this framework, the team went to the region where the outbreaks are
occurring. The goal is to decipher the causes of change and, mainly to try
to predict the most likely paths for disease in the near future. Based on
these data, epidemiologists intend to draw up a strategy to prevent new
cases in the short term.

The research work started 3 months ago. Last week [week of 17 May 2009], a
group of experts went to Rio Grande do Sul searching the affected areas, as
the last stage of the work. The same process was done in Sao Paulo. It is
expected that by July [2009], the preliminary results of the work will be
completed.

During the visit, the experts tried to answer several questions. Among
them, if there is an increase of breeding sites of the [mosquito] vector of
the disease [virus] and whether there is a tendency for migration of
monkeys -- and why this would be happening. The disease [virus] is
transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes. In forests, monkeys are the main
reservoir of the virus. "There are several hypotheses to explain these
changes," said the deputy coordinator of the Department of Epidemiological
Surveillance of the ministry, Carla Domingues.

Climate change is one of the top reasons considered. The warmer climate
favors the proliferation of mosquito vectors of disease [virus],
_Haemagogus_. Deforestation, which also promotes increased temperature, can
also cause the displacement of primates into the most populated areas. In
Sao Paulo, change may have been caused by changes in agriculture, increased
temperature and work in the region. "The affected area in the state is
close to dams. The combination of several factors may have led to that
change, " [she said].

This year [2009], for example, the temperature in Rio Grande do Sul was
very high, which may have favored the increase of mosquito breeding. "So
far we have several speculations. The work aims to understand the
[epidemiological and ecological] dynamics, and from thence predict other
areas susceptible to the spread of disease, " says Domingues. With the
confirmation of [YF virus] infection, the vaccination campaign was
organized in affected cities and nearby areas.

Official figures show that in Rio Grande do Sul 2.2 million doses were
applied. In Sao Paulo, 1.5 million people were immunized. "This number must
increase until the end of the month [May 2009], when the initiative ends, "
Carla Domingues says.

More vaccine will be purchased. With yellow fever spreading, the forecast
is that in 2010, there will be a need to expand the areas where the vaccine
is recommended as routine.

The team researching the behavior of yellow fever is now trying to
ascertain what are the next areas of risk of disease. "The idea is to try
to discover how expansion happens. Research in similar ecosystems evaluates
the need to vaccinate in contiguous municipalities or those that are
integral within the same watershed," he said. The expectation is that this
projection will be ready in July [2009], when the meeting will be held with
Biomanguinhos, the manufacturer of the vaccine.

[Dr Fernando Dias de Avila Pires offers the following comments concerning
the epidemiological changes related to yellow fever virus endemicity and
spread.

"There are 3 great excuses I have seen used by the authorities: El Nino,
global warming, and the "combination of various [un-named] factors," as
being responsible for [yellow fever] epidemics.

"In the present case, reality contradicts the hypotheses blaming
deforestation for the increase in the number of cases of yellow fever,
recently raised by many epidemiologists who know nothing about mammals
and/or animal behaviour. Not all species of _Alouatta_ [howler monkeys]
disappear with deforestation or migrate. They remain happy and jumping
around in capoes de mato [brushy patches], and small copses of trees, often
coming down to the ground. And they also live in cerrados [savanna
ecoregion of the Brazilian interior].

"The politically correct attitude towards conservation -- not deforestation
-- has caused an increase in urban populations of several mammal species. I
have noted an increase in road kills in Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do
Sul. In the 1980s, I started a group of MS students on a program for the
study of urban populations of monkeys, found in city parks in Porto Alegre.
Populations are increasing steadily. In Blumenau, a former MS student is
working along the same lines. Howlers live in a city park, close to
apartment buildings. People from the _Alouatta_ Project, based in nearby
Indaial, have a hard time preventing residents from feeding bugios
[howlers] in their backyards. At least in one instance they had to call the
policia florestal [forest rangers] for help."

In a ProMED-mail post of 11 May 2009 (archive no. 20090511.1754), Mod LJS
commented "As I have commented before, and I repeat: yellow fever does not
"progress", it always has been in the south, but only for reasons not yet
well understood, its transmission intensifies from time to time."

Clearly, ecological changes are occurring in areas where yellow fever cases
in humans and monkeys have been documented. Perhaps these changes, such as
increasing periurban and urban adaptation of howler monkeys, provide a
"bridge" between nearby foci of sylvan (jungle) YF virus maintenance into
the areas where the cases are occurring.
