This is in response to the posting on a neurological disorder affecting
chamois and ibex in the Swiss alps. I believe we should consider
encephalitis caused by tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus. Of course, the
typical habitat for chamois does not correspond to that of Ixodes ricinus,
the main vector of TBE. Moreover, TBE infection has not been associated
with symptoms in wild ungulates.
Certain populations of chamois, however, occur in typical I. ricinus
habitats, mainly due to disturbance by human "outdoor activities" (hiking,
hang-gliding etc.). Such animals appear to be more heavily infested by I.
ricinus ticks, than are roe deer, taken nearby.
My own studies take me to a sub-alpine site in eastern Switzerland where
TBE transmission is frequent, and where chamois appear to be the main local
host for adult I. ricinus, rather than roe deer. Chamois avoid human
contact more than do roe deer. Chamois-dependent tick populations
therefore may tend not to come in contact with people, which could explain
why people acquire TBE infection so sporadically in such areas.
Although chamois have never been implicated as reservoir hosts for TBE
virus, and the involvement of ibex suggests an altitude not suitable for
ticks, the reference to a neurological disease of ungulates "in a remote
area" might suggest this agent.
[Thanks very much for the response. I am a little surprised we didn't get
more comments because the request was cross posted on Epivet-L, a listserve
for veterinary epidemiologists. FYI, Chamois is _Rupicapra rupicapra_, a
small goatlike antelope found in the high mountainous areas of Europe and
the Caucasus. Chamois was at one time used to some extent in bookbinding,
but is now most famous for being a soft, pliable leather cloth made from
the skin of the chamois. Ibex is similar ruminant found in Europe and
elsewhere. - Mod. pc
