The veterinary department of Koboko district has confirmed an
outbreak of black quarter disease which has killed over 100 head of
cattle in the last few months.

Stephen Onzima, the district veterinary officer, said the disease
that was 1st reported in Kuluba sub-county in December 2010 has now
spread to all sub-counties in the district.

Onzima expressed fear that infection would escalate, because most
farmers do not report the cases in time.

He said it was not easy for farmers to recognise the disease because
it kills within a short period.

"Diseases which take a short time to kill show fewer signs. The black
quarter disease kills within 24-48 hours," Onzima explained.

He observed that animals affected by black quarter show signs of
fever, pain in the legs, inability to move, with saliva flowing from
the mouth. They eventually stop feeding, leading to death.

He attributed the infection rate to the dry season. He said animals
pick the bacteria spores up from the soil as they graze. "This is
because grass has dried off during the long drought season, leading to
more infections," he explained.

Onzima noted that they were planning to vaccinate 5000 head of cattle
in the district.

Christopher Buruga, one of the affected farmers in Godia village,
Midia sub-county, said he recently lost 2 cows which showed signs of
limping due to wounds on the legs and had a poor appetite.

[Black quarter disease is also known as blackleg in cattle. The
disease is caused by the bacteria _Clostridium chauvoei_.

It is a peracute disease affecting the heart muscle and skeletal
muscle of cattle. It is non-contagious but it has a very high
mortality rate, reaching almost 100 percent.

The _Clostridium_ spores are resistant to environmental change and to
many disinfectants and can survive for years in the soil. Generally,
these spores are ingested, either by contaminated feed stuffs or from
the animals picking it up as they graze. The organism itself can
survive in the gastrointestinal tract without causing disease. It is
not well understood what triggers the increased production of the
organism. Some believe it is stress; some believe it is muscle
bruising through issues of shipping or working the animals. The
bacteria itself produce a toxin which affects both the skeletal and
cardiac muscles, causing death of the muscle and, subsequently, the
animal.

Clinical signs include lameness, often with swelling in the affected
leg, depression, and anorexia. Often in the early stages of the
disease, there is a high temperature, reaching 106 F, and the swollen
areas are painful to the touch. As the disease progresses, the
swellings become cold and non-painful. The time from clinical signs to
death, is usually 12-36 hours.

Treatment is generally unsuccessful, but the vaccine is effective,
especially in the face of an outbreak. - Mod.TG]
