Bunchy Top banana disease has hit Hill banana growers in the Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu. The crop is the livelihood of farmers in the region.

Veera Arasu, Tamil Nadu Hill Banana Growers Federation, said, "We have successfully controlled the disease in the early 2000 with the help of Tamil Nadu Agriculture University [TNAU]. As the virus started attacking the plants again, we have approached the National Research Centre for Banana, along with TNAU for remedial measures."

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the type member of the genus _Babuvirus_ (family Nanoviridae) and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands.

BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools). Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting or natural cluster of plants is considered impossible, and the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates from different regions: the South Pacific group (including Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga, Western Samoa) and the Asian group (Philippines, Taiwan, Viet Nam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 per cent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.

In India, 2 native banana varieties from the Tamil Nadu Hills region have been recognised internationally by being granted "geographical indication status" (GI; protected name for products corresponding to a specific geographical origin) by the World Intellectual Propery Organisation (WIPO). These special varieties are of both cultural and commercial significance and are threatened by BBTV. The total area cultivated to Hills bananas is now estimated at less than 20 per cent of the 1980s area (see also ProMED-mail post 20091001.3418).
