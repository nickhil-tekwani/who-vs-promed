The NWT's [Northwest Territories'] chief public health officer has declared an outbreak of pertussis, or whooping cough, in the Dehcho region after a total of 7 cases were confirmed in 2 communities. The cases were confirmed in Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson, according to an advisory issued Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] morning. Last week, officials advised of 4 people that had been diagnosed in Fort Simpson [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/4-people-diagnosed-whooping-cough-fort-simpson-1.5861325].

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that affects the lungs and respiratory tract. It's particularly dangerous to children under one year of age.

This is the 2nd year in a row the territory has declared a pertussis outbreak. An outbreak declared in January 2020 in the Yellowknife and Tlicho regions led to at least 55 confirmed cases [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whooping-cough-nwt-1.5585871].

Residents of Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson are being asked to confirm their pertussis vaccinations as soon as possible by contacting their health centre, the advisory states. While the vaccine is safe and effective, the advisory says, immunity from it may fade over time. Boosters are typically offered in Grade 7, and then every 10 years as an adult. Pregnant women are also advised to get a vaccine between 27 and 32 weeks of their pregnancy, regardless of their last dose, in order to protect the newborn.

According to the advisory, the 1st symptoms of pertussis appear 7-10 days after exposure but may take as long as 21 days to develop. They include mild fever; runny nose; red, watery eyes; sneezing; and mild cough. The cough becomes worse about 10 days after exposure, "leading to severe, repeated, and forceful coughing spells that end with a whooping sound before the next breath," the advisory says. The cough tends to be worse at night and may lead to vomiting or difficulty breathing, and babies and small children may turn blue.

Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to someone with pertussis or is showing symptoms is asked to contact their health centre as soon as possible.

Anyone confirmed to have pertussis is strongly advised to stay at home, and in particular away from infants, young children, women in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and large public gatherings until their antibiotic treatment is completed.

[An outbreak of pertussis is reported above in the villages of Fort Simpson and Jean Marie River, Dehcho Region, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Dehcho is one of 5 administrative regions of the NWT. Fort Simpson is its administrative seat, with 1200 residents who are predominantly Indigenous people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Simpson). Jean Marie River is a village of 77 predominantly Indigenous people in the Dehcho Region of the NWT (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Marie_River). The other NWT regions with their regional seats are the Inuvik Region (Inuvik), Sahtu Region (Norman Wells), North Slave Region (Behchoko and Yellowknife), and South Slave Region (Fort Smith and Hay River). A map showing the location of Dehcho can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_Northwest_Territories.

In 2020, we reported pertussis outbreaks, probably a result of inadequate immunization, in communities with predominantly Indigenous peoples in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut (Pertussis update (03): Canada (NU) 20200620.7491247); in Yellowknife, the North Slave Region of the NWT (Pertussis update (02): USA (MN,PA,OR), Canada (NT) 20200208.6969310); and in Tlicho Region, NWT (Pertussis update (01): USA, Canada 20200102.6868270).

Routine pertussis immunization of infants, children, and adolescents with DTaP-IPV-Hib-containing vaccine is provided at 2, 4, 6, and 12-23 months of age (generally given at 18 months of age), followed by a booster dose of either DTaP-IPV or Tdap-IPV vaccine at 4-6 years of age (school entry) and a booster dose of Tdap vaccine at 14-16 years of age (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-15-pertussis-vaccine.html).

Routine pertussis immunization of adults with one dose of Tdap vaccine is provided to all adults 18 years of age and older. One dose of Tdap vaccine is also administered in every pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 32 weeks of gestation (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-15-pertussis-vaccine.html).

Routine vaccinations for babies, children, and adults are offered free of charge (https://www.ontario.ca/page/vaccines). - Mod.ML
