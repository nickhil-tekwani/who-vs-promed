The CDC is coming out with a special Bioterrorism-Related Anthrax [issue of
Emerging Infectious Diseases]:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/
Included are stories detailing the AMI contamination (and describing two
letters with powder, one of which was opened on or about Sept 25 and would
be consistent with first symptoms on Sept 28 and Sept 30 in the two
inhalational cases).
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no10/02-0354.htm
There is also a study on the Brentwood inhalational anthrax cases:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no10/02-0330.htm
as well as contamination locations and amounts at Walliingford, CT where
anthrax detection levels were almost as high as Brentwood:

[And much more. Frankly, this excellent issue of EID can only be described as
everything you never wanted to know about anthrax and related bioterrorist
events. It is a very thorough collection of articles and will become the
authoritative version of what happened in 2001. The editors and authors are
to be congratulated. - Mod.MHJ]
