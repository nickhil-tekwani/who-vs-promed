Three deer taken during this year's [2018's] deer gun season have tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD]. Two of the deer were taken in unit 3-F-2, known to have CWD, while the 3rd was taken in Divide, which was previously considered disease free.

CWD is a fatal disease of deer, moose, and elk that can cause long-term population declines if left unchecked.

Since 2009, 14 CWD-positive deer have been found in North Dakota, and all previous cases were from within hunting unit 3F2.

[2] Tennessee: CWD response plan implemented

The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) is enacting the Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) response plan, following a preliminary positive detection of CWD in white-tailed deer in Hardeman and Fayette counties. The response plan involves a coordinated effort between TWRA, Tennessee Department of Agriculture, and other partners.

Seven deer in Fayette County and 3 in Hardeman County have preliminarily tested positive for CWD. Additional samples are being tested, and the TWRA is actively trying to contact the hunters who harvested these deer.

"Once arrangements are made, TWRA will be encouraging hunters harvesting deer in these areas to submit their deer for testing," said Chuck Yoest, TWRA CWD coordinator.

"Hunters are our biggest ally in managing chronic wasting disease in Tennessee if it is confirmed here," said Dr. Dan Grove, wildlife veterinarian, University of Tennessee Extension. "Besides submitting deer from the to-be-defined CWD zone, the most important thing everyone needs to do is follow the regulations for moving harvested deer (see https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/twra/hunting/cwd.html/#law).

Although CWD has no known risk to the health of humans or livestock, it is a contagious and deadly neurological disorder that affects members of the deer family. It is transmitted through animal-to-animal contact, animal contact with a contaminated environment, and contaminated feed or water sources. It is the most significant threat to the deer population nationwide, as it is 100% fatal to deer and elk. Wildlife agencies across the country are working to inform the public about CWD, its deadly results, and possible impacts to economies. Currently, 25 states and 3 Canadian provinces have documented CWD. Last week, Mississippi announced a preliminary CWD-positive, hunter-harvested deer in Marshall County, which became the closest to Tennessee and the 4th overall this year [2018] in Mississippi. Other confirmed cases have previously been made in the border states of Arkansas, Missouri, and Virginia.

More information about CWD, including cervid import restrictions and videos that explain how to properly dress an animal before transporting it, can be found on TWRA's website at [https://www.tn.gov/twra] (see https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/twra/hunting/cwd.html/).

[3] Tennessee: response plan rules

After the confirmed detection of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in 10 wild deer, Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) commissioner Jai Templeton is implementing emergency rules to prevent further spread of the disease.

Hunters harvested the deer in Fayette and Hardeman counties. Targeted sampling by the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency (TWRA) indicated the presence of CWD.

CWD has no known risk to the health of humans or livestock. However, testing is recommended prior to consuming deer or elk meat harvested within the CWD Management Zone, which includes Fayette, Hardeman, and McNairy counties. CWD is a contagious and deadly neurological disorder affecting cervids, which are animals in the deer family and include deer, elk, moose, caribou, and reindeer.

"We have been working hard to prepare for this potential threat," commissioner Templeton said. "In collaboration with TWRA, the United States Department of Agriculture, hunters, and captive herd owners, we have developed a response plan. That plan is critical in protecting the wild and captive deer and elk in our state."

With the new emergency rules in place, owners of captive deer and elk will be required to report their herd inventory, location, and any sick animals to the state veterinarian. They will also be required to report deaths among their fenced captive cervids within 24 hours and make the carcass available to TDA for further testing.

Additionally, the importation of captive cervids into the state and the movement of captive deer or elk within the state require prior approval and a permit from the state veterinarian, as well as USDA-approved identification. The requirements from the new emergency rule do not apply to white-tailed deer and wild elk, which are prohibited from being retained in captive facilities.

"Just a few weeks before this detection, we joined TWRA, USDA, and other partners for a tabletop exercise to discuss and finalize a response plan," state veterinarian Dr. Charlie Hatcher said. "Now, we're following through. We encourage captive herd owners to keep a close eye on the animals in their care and report any signs of illness immediately."

A voluntary program administered by TDA, the Tennessee CWD Herd Certification Program, was put in place in 2013 to provide uniform herd certification standards and to support the domestic and international marketability of cervid herds. Facilities can be certified as disease-free after 5 years of program enrollment with no evidence of disease, and the program is required for the interstate movement of CWD-susceptible cervids.

[Both North Dakota and Tennessee have had an expansion of territory of CWD. There are very few states that have not been touched by this disease. It is likely appropriate for Tennessee to implement a plan. - Mod.TG
