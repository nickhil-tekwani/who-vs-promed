The NPPO of Germany recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of an outbreak of
_Phytoplasma mali_ [Pm] (Apple proliferation phytoplasma - EPPO A2 list) in
Sachsen.
In July 2004, shoots of 24 trees of _Malus_ spp. growing in an experimental
field, and of 5 trees in a field used for scion production, showed symptoms of
apple proliferation [disease]. PCR testing revealed the presence of Pm. The
infected trees were destroyed. Movement of trees from the experimental field
has been prohibited, and testing of scions for Pm from the scion production
field has been rendered compulsory before any movement.
Since infection has been confirmed, _Malus_ fields concerned have been
inspected every 2 weeks and further tested to assess the level of infection.
The pest status of Pm in Germany is officially declared as follows:
Transient: actionable, under eradication.

[Apple proliferation (AP) is one of the most important phytoplasma diseases of
apple, affecting almost all cultivars, reducing size (by about 50 percent),
weight (by 63-74 percent) and quality of fruit, as well as reducing tree
vigour and increasing susceptibility to powdery mildew (_Podosphaera
leucotricha_). It is transmitted by grafting and is disseminated in budwood
(both scion and rootstock). The [plant louse] Psyllid _Cacopsylla
melanoneura_ (Homoptera: Psyllidae) has been implicated as a vector, and the
overwintered adults are probably important in the spread of AP in apple
orchards. In Europe apple proliferation phytoplasma is an EPPO A2 quarantine
organism and is known in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,
Switzerland, UK (eradicated), Ukraine, Yugoslavia. Further spread or
propagation of the disease in infected budwood or plant material could lead to
considerable yield losses throughout the European and Mediterranean apple
cultivation areas. It has not been detected in the USA.
