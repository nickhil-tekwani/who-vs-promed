Scientists fear BSE epidemic in sheep
--------------------------------------
The Food Standards Agency said in the summer [that] there was a possibility
that sheep were infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) by the
same contaminated feed fed to cattle in the 1980s and early 1990s. Dr
Rowland Kao of Oxford University and colleagues in Oxford and the Institute
of Animal Health, Compton and Edinburgh, have published for the first time
in the journal Science [estimates of] the numbers involved, which are very
small compared with a national flock of about 40 million. Their model is
based on the numbers of infected cattle, the dose responses of cattle and
sheep to BSE, their levels of exposure to infected feed, and the number of
BSE-susceptible sheep in the United Kingdom (UK).
They warn that BSE may have been present in about 1500 British sheep at the
height of the disease in cattle in the early 1990s and may still be present
in about 20 animals. Fewer than 50 flocks would have been exposed to BSE by
2015 and the model predicts that the maximum number of flocks exposed is
just over 21 000, or about 40 per cent of the national flock after a century.
Although the current prevalence of the disease is probably low, the
scientists say that if sheep can transmit BSE "horizontally" between
members of a flock -- as is the case with the equivalent sheep disease
scrapie -- "a large epidemic could eventually develop". Professor Chris
Bostock, the head of the Institute of Animal Health, who participated in
the group, has warned that this outbreak could build into an epidemic if
nothing is done over a long period. Dr Kao said that it was unlikely that
there would be a sudden surge in the probability of eating BSE-infected
animals -- and therefore no [reason for] panic -- but that "by no means
should we be complacent that the problem would just go away on its own."
The scientists conclude that the study shows the importance of a current
plan to breed sheep that have an in-built genetic resistance to scrapie.

[There are several "ifs" in these modelling results, only partly reflected
in the article above. For the convenience of ProMED-mail subscribers, we
include the abstract of the paper from which is is derived [RR
Kao (<rowland.kao@zoo.ox.ac.uk>), MB Gravenor, M Baylis, CJ Bostock, M
Chihota, JC Evans, et al. The potential size and duration of an epidemic of
BSE in British sheep. Science online 22 Nov 2001]: "Because there is a
theoretical possibility that the British national sheep flock is infected
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), we examine the extent of a
putative epidemic. An age cohort analysis based on numbers of infected
cattle, dose responses of cattle and sheep to BSE, levels of exposure to
infected feed and number of BSE-susceptible sheep in Britain showed that at
the putative epidemic peak in 1990, the number of cases of BSE-infected
sheep would have ranged from fewer than 10 to about 1500. The model
predicts that fewer than 20 clinical cases of BSE in sheep would be
expected in 2001 if maternal transmission occurred at a rate of 10 percent.
Though there are large uncertainties in the parameter estimates, all
indications are that current prevalence is low. However, a simple model of
flock-to-flock BSE transmission shows that horizontal transmission, if it
has occurred, could eventually cause a large epidemic." - Mod.AS]
