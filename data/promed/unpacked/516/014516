Mauritania
• No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental sample was reported this week. There were 7 positive samples linked to the Jigawa outbreak in 2021.

Mozambique
• 3 new WPV1 cases were reported this week from Tete province (the same province as the 1st WPV1 case with onset of paralysis in March [2022], which was reported in May [2022]), with onset of paralysis in May and June 2022. 1 of the new cases is reported from a district bordering Zimbabwe. This brings the total number of cases in the country to 4. Reporting of these new cases within a short time span indicates that intensified surveillance efforts are working in the province.
• 2 of the 3 new viruses are more closely linked with the WPV1 isolated from the 1st case of Mozambique with onset in March 2022 from the same province, indicating local circulation of WPV1 within the province and probably the country. However, the WPV1 found in Magoé district (close to the Zimbabwe and Zambia borders), is an orphan virus which is more closely related to the virus found earlier in Malawi. Genetic analysis further indicates that there are clearly at least 2 transmission chains that are co-evolved after introduction of the virus in Tete province in Mozambique. While it is difficult to speculate, distribution of WPV1 and their genetic linkage suggests that missed transmission in bordering areas around Mozambique-Zimbabwe-Zambia cannot be ruled out.
• Mozambique has implemented 3 immunization rounds using bOPV since the detection of the 1st case from March [2022]. Assessments of these rounds show gradual improvements in quality, round to round, though quality remains suboptimal in Tete province.
• A field investigation is ongoing in response to these latest cases, with focus on surveillance and to more clearly assess geographical scope of circulation, and to ultimately guide future response plans
• 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported; 1 each in Nampula and Zambezia. These cases are linked to each other and part of a new emergence. The case from Nampula had an onset of paralysis in January 2020 and the 1 in Zambezia in May 2022, making it the 1st cVDPV1 case in the country this year [2022].

Niger
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 8 cases in 2022. There were 18 cases reported in 2021.

Nigeria
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. The number of cases in 2022 remains 30. There were 415 cases reported in 2021.

Senegal
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There were 17 cases reported in 2021.

Sierra Leone
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There were 5 cases reported in 2021.

• Almost 2/3 of the areas reporting the bulk of cVDPV2 cases have not implemented type 2-containing polio vaccination campaigns, underscoring the risk both to local children and to neighbouring countries.
• Intensive efforts are ongoing to access Yemen's northern governorates with polio vaccine.

[This past week has been an active week for polio identification. 4 newly confirmed WPV1 cases -- 1 in Pakistan (the 13th case) and 3 in Mozambique; the latter related to circulation of 2 different importations -- 1 to Malawi and 1 to Mozambique. The case identified near the Zimbabwe border is also worrisome. Note that a 14th case was reported in Pakistan yesterday [27 Jul 2022] (see Poliomyelitis update (32): WPV1 AFP (Pakistan) 20220728.8704718)

On the VDPV activity, there is confirmation of positive environmental samples of the same VDPV2 in both Israel (Jerusalem) and USA (NY) in June 2022.

cVDPV1 was identified in 2 countries (Madagascar and Mozambique); and cVDPV2 identified in 3 countries -- AFP cases in Chad and DR Congo, and ES in Benin.

Sigh..... while the previous week was slow for polio activity, this week is disconcertingly active with spread to countries previously polio-free.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

Update on report of polio detection in United States
----------------------------------------------------
Statement
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has been informed of a case of paralytic polio in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, New York, United States.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are coordinating with New York State health authorities on their investigation. Initial sequencing confirmed by CDC indicates that the case is type 2 VDPV.

Following the detection, the Global Polio Laboratory Ne2rk (GPLN) has confirmed that the VDPV2 isolated from the case is genetically linked to 2 Sabin-like type 2 (SL2) isolates, collected from environmental samples in early June [2022] in both New York and greater Jerusalem, Israel. Further investigations -- both genetic and epidemiological -- are ongoing to determine possible spread of the virus and potential risk associated with these isolates.

It is vital that all countries, in particular those with a high volume of travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level and at the lowest administrative level to protect children from polio and to minimize the consequences of any new virus being introduced.

Any form of poliovirus anywhere is a threat to children everywhere. It is critical that the GPEI Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 is fully resourced and fully implemented everywhere, to ensure a world free of all forms of poliovirus can be achieved.

[The report in item 2 suggests that the origin of this virus may have been in Israel as Israel uses IPV followed by OPV. Since there was no history of recent travel to Jerusalem mentioned for the case, other travellers either coming from or returning from a trip to Israel served as the vehicle of travel for the virus. - Mod.MPP]
