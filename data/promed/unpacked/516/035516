The Friedrich Loeffler Institute ( FLI ) confirmed the infection of wild birds with highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N8 in Plön, Schleswig-Holstein.

Further suspected cases from Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wuerttemberg (Bodensee) are currently under investigation. In recent days these viruses have already been confirmed in domestic poultry (turkeys) in Hungary and wild waterfowl in Hungary (mute swan), Croatia, and in Poland (gull, duck) close to the German border, near Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The FLI advises to increase attention and strongly recommends reviewing biosecurity measures on poultry farms and optimizing [them] if necessary. In particular, contact between wild birds and poultry should be prevented.

This applies to birds kept in zoological collections as well.

In the case of the dead tufted ducks found at Lake Plön in Schleswig-Holstein, the county laboratory made a preliminary diagnosis of avian influenza. Samples for confirmation were sent to the National Reference Laboratory for avian influenza at FLI. Today [8 Nov 2016], highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N8 has been confirmed in 3 samples. Further samples of wild birds found dead in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Württemberg are currently under investigation. On the Swiss and Austrian side of the Bodensee [Lake Constance], suspect cases of wild birds found dead are also under investigation.

[Subscribers are encouraged to refer to the FAO EMPRES Watch Vol 35 (September 2016, p 1-6) entitled "H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4 detected through surveillance of wild migratory birds in the Tyva Republic, the Russian Federation -- potential for international spread" available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6113e.pdf, mentioned previously in postings 20160920.4501532, 20161104.4608240, and 20161108.4614616.

Little is known about the potential of the emerging H5N8 strain to infect humans. This, and several other avian influenza virus strains (H5N2, H5N3, H5N6) have started in recent years their circulation in different parts of the world. In the potential-zoonotic context, subscribers may find interest in WHO's review of February 2015, titled "Warning signals from the volatile world of influenza viruses" (see http://www.who.int/influenza/publications/warningsignals201502/en/ and posting 20150317.3237174). - Mod.AS
