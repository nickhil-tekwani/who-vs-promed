Coach Party Affected by Suspected Norwalk-like Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
In Oban, 2 tourists [with suspected Norwalk-like virus infection] have been
treated in hospital. All 16 others on a coach tour from England also
suffered severe vomiting and diarrhoea. Until now, the Oban outbreak has
remained secret, despite a visit to the hotel at the weekend by public
health officials in protective gloves and disposable gowns. The mystery
infection is similar to the "winter vomiting [disease]", which forced
Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary to close earlier this year, and saw soldiers
in Afghanistan flown home to Britain for emergency treatment.
Environmental health officers and medical officials yesterday confirmed
that the Oban outbreak at the weekend was not confined to one hotel.
Incidents have been recorded elsewhere in Argyll and Bute, and further
north. Crisis meetings to discuss the latest outbreak and its implications
have been held by health boards, tourist chiefs, tour operators, and local
authorities across the Highlands. With symptoms taking 48 hours or more to
appear, there are concerns of further spread -- especially as Oban is the
embarkation point for ferries to Mull, Coll, Tiree, Barra, South Uist,
Colonsay, Lismore and Islay. Last month, almost 50 passengers and crew
aboard a ferry that sails 3 times a week from Aberdeen to Orkney suffered
similar symptoms. It is understood public health consultants with Grampian
Health Board, which treated that outbreak, were party to the Oban talks.
Hygiene issues, it is understood, have been discounted, with the infection
likely caused by person-to-person spread through inhalation of the virus.
Sandy Taylor, head of public protection for Argyll and Bute Council, said
18 guests and 3 staff at a Hotel in Oban, suffered vomiting and diarrhoea
on Fri 12 Jul 2002, with 2 guests hospitalised. The likely source was a
sick coach passenger who infected the others. Mr Taylor said the hotel and
coach operator acted swiftly and responsibly. Disinfecting procedures were
carried out, and the tourists were now home, all well. "In recent weeks,
there have been a number of similar incidents throughout the Highlands," he
added.

[Outbreaks of "winter vomiting disease", associated with Norwalk-like virus
infection, are continuing sporadically throughout the UK according to
anecdotal reports. These outbreaks are characterized by person-to person
spread rather than by food-borne transmission. The origin of this outbreak
is unclear, since those affected were predominantly members of a coach
party travelling through the Highlands of Scotland from elsewhere in the
UK. Also the report does not indicate whether the coach party was leaving
or entering the Highland Region. As yet there appears to have been no
laboratory confirmation of the identity of the agent involved. - Mod.CP]
