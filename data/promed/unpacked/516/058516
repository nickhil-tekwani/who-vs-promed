[According to the CDC Q fever webpage http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/:
"Q fever is a worldwide disease with acute and chronic stages caused by the bacteria _Coxiella burnetii_. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs, although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. During birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organism is extremely hardy and resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection."

Q fever is an important zoonosis, with veterinarians, laboratory workers, farmers and abattoir workers at risk. Surveys have shown that significant numbers of livestock handlers have antibodies, indicating exposure to the organism.

Less than half of people infected become ill, and most infections are mild. But affected persons can develop a high fever with headache, muscle pains, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, chest and stomach pains. The fever can last for one or 2 weeks and lead to pneumonia or affect the liver. Treatment involves long term antibiotic therapy.

In a small percentage of cases, a chronic, severe debilitating disease occurs. People with suppressed immune systems and those with pre-existing heart valve problems are at risk of this complication, which is often fatal. There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.

Q fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.

The following information was obtained from a publication titled "Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011." In the discussion it was noted that: "This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea. The annual incidence of Q fever in Korea is much lower than that in France, Australia and Taiwan (0.02 vs. 2.5, 0.1, and 0.38 per 100 000 population, respectively). As the disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from nonspecific febrile illness to neurological disorder, and there are no known outbreaks in Korea, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose Q fever without an increased awareness. Serological diagnostic testing is limited, because it is available at only one national laboratory. Therefore, Q fever is likely to be under-diagnosed and under-reported in Korea."

"According to national surveys of_ C. burnetti _ seroprevalence in the Korean population, the seropositivity rate of high-risk occupation groups, such as dairy farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, was 3.7-10.2 percent (data not shown). Q fever is not currently considered to be a significant threat to public health in Korea. Only sporadic cases have been reported to date, but there is a possibility of an epidemic. Therefore, increased awareness among physicians for better detection and treatment of Q fever, expansion of the diagnostic system, and further investigations for undiscovered risk factors, are persistently required."

This immediate notification report does not mention what actions, if any, were taken to address the exposed human population. Such information may be of value in future follow-up reports, particularly given that the disease in humans is under-reported.

According to information available in the OIE WAHID database, through June 2013, Q-fever was considered absent http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation. Therefore, any additional information on Q-fever in South Korea during the 2nd semester of 2013 would be of interest, especially with respect to the number and location of previous outbreaks, given that the last reported event occurred on 16 Jul 2013. - Mod.CRD
