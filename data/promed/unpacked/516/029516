A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel has
recommended routine vaccination of infants against diarrhea and vomiting
caused by rotaviruses, which kill up to a million babies and children a
year worldwide, including 300 in the United States.
Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics, which developed the vaccine to be
sold in the United States under the name RotaShield, said it welcomed the
recommendation of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

[CDC does not have approval rights for vaccines but the Food and Drug
Administration, which does, surely will consider CDC's studied opinion. -
