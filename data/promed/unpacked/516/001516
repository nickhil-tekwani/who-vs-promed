DEFINITION OF TERM, AT RISK: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Wed, 05 Nov 1997 11:04:43 -0500
From: Alexandra Sevilla <alexs@wri.org>

World Resources Institute is in the final stages of writing and
fact-checking our next issue of World Resources (due out in March 1998),
which is focusing on Human Health and the Environment, that includes an
extensive section on emerging and resurgent infectious diseases.
In the process of finalizing the report we have come up against a brick
wall trying to find a generally accepted definition of "at risk". I was
hoping that one of the moderators or subscribers to ProMED-mail would be
able to tell me how "at risk" is defined in infectious diseases. Is there
a standard WHO or CDC definition? We are stating facts and figures
provided through WHO documents, including numbers of people who are "at
risk" of contracting a disease.
How are these numbers determined? Is it simply an estimate of the number
of people who live in an area where a disease is endemic? Or does it
involve an estimate of the number of people who live with a lack of basic
human needs and are more susceptible to contracting the disease?
Environmental factors which promote a certain disease vector, etc?
Basically, what is the criteria that is used by WHO or CDC or whoever to
determine who is at risk and who isn't? If this definition varies from
disease to disease and if there is not a general definition, then I would
want a definition for as many diseases as possible.

[I believe that the answer is in the last paragraph, and that one needs
only to pick up a textbook to find the answer for specific diseases.
ProMED-mail would appreciate the comments of subscribers who can be of
greater help to Alexandre Sevilla. -Mod.ES]
