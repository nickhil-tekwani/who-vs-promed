Foot-and-mouth disease spreads nationwide
-----------------------------------------
To date, 26 provinces and cities across the country have declared an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

Functional agencies in these localities are facing difficulties in
combating the disease because they do not have enough vaccine against
the deadly virus.

Nearly 500 cattle have been infected by FMD in the central province
of Quang Nam. The epidemic has hit 8 out of 18 districts in the
province and is likely to spread more widely. The provincial
veterinary agency has taken measures for quarantine and sterilisation
in order to stop the spread of the disease.

Since FMD was 1st reported in the northern province of Quang Ninh,
more than 400 cattle have been culled as the province also suffered a
shortage of vaccine against the epidemic.

[The ongoing FMD outbreak started in June 2007, as reported by Viet
Nam to the OIE; on 23 Feb 2008 it was declared as endemic. Since then,
no follow-up reports have to be submitted and the disease situation is
covered in the periodic semi-annual and annual reports. The last
available report is the annual 2009 report.

According to the website of the Southeast Asia Foot and Mouth Disease
Campaign (SEAFMD), during 2010, 246 new outbreaks were recorded. All
sampled outbreaks have been caused by FMDV serotype O. For the above
