Cases of leptospirosis and related deaths have increased in Western Visayas this year [2022], according to the Department of Health (DOH) regional office. The DOH said 596 cases were recorded from January to 3 Dec 2022, compared with 343 during the same period last year [2021].

Leptospirosis-related deaths increased from 43 last year [2021] to 81 this year [2022].

Negros Occidental logged the highest number of cases at 225, followed by Iloilo, 141; Antique, 101; Capiz, 38; Guimaras, 26; Aklan, 15, and Iloilo City, 9.

Negros Occidental also recorded the highest number of deaths at 34; Iloilo, 13; Antique, 12; Aklan, 7; Capiz, 3; Guimaras, 2, and Iloilo City, 1.

Cases of leptospirosis also increased in Bacolod City from 25 last year [2021] to 41 this year [2022]. Nine deaths were recorded this year [2022] compared with 6 last year [2021].

Leptospirosis, which is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals, can enter the body through the skin, eyes, nose and mouth, especially if the skin is broken due to a cut or scratch. The DOH said outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, such as floodwater.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to the urine of infected animals or to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - Tanzania: (LI) fatal, RFI 20220719.8704520.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that, when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis).

Western Visayas (pop., about 7.9 million residents), an administrative region in the Philippines, consists of 6 provinces (Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Guimaras, Iloilo and Negros Occidental) and 2 highly urbanized cities, Bacolod and Iloilo City (the regional center city). Western Visayas consists of the major island of Panay, the smaller Guimaras, several outlying islands, and the western half of the larger island of Negros (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Visayas).
