An unidentified epidemic has killed about 100 people in the past week in
Malakal, south Sudan's third largest town, and more are dying every day,
residents and press reports said on Wednesday.
Mongo Ajak, the governor of Upper Nile state, of which Malakal is the
capital, told the privately owned Al-Usbua newspaper that 78 people had
died in Malakal from the disease and it was still killing around five
people a day. Other sources put the number of victims at over 100.
The disease, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea, is reported to
be widespread in the residential quarters of Malakal, 680 km (410 miles)
south of Khartoum. One resident of the town said 17 very sick people were
on a river barge on their way to northern Sudan to seek treatment, and even
cattle and chickens were also dying from the disease.
The state health minister, Thomas Abwal, said his ministry had sent
experts, including epidemiologists and laboratory technicians, to Malakal
to collect stool, water and other samples for laboratory analysis in
Khartoum. He said two more experts were on their way to try to identify the
disease.
"There are many diseases that have these symptoms and, unless we have the
results of the laboratory analysis, we cannot say what it is,'' Dr Abwal
said.
