Fear gripped people after score of cases of fever with acute joint pain were reported in various parts of Swat [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province]. However, health experts said that there was nothing serious as it was a seasonal fever outbreak.

The majority of the people affected with fever belong to Faizabad union council where over 100 patients were recorded.

"Four days ago I got high fever with acute pain in my bones. I rushed to hospital where it was found malaria after initial investigation. However, I recovered after medication and taking rest for some days," said a resident of Faizabad area near Saidu Sharif.

Residents of the area said they had experienced dengue fever in the past and when the present fever spread in the area people feared it was once again dengue. Meanwhile, cases of fever with pain in bones were reported in other parts of Swat, including Salampur, Kokrai, Shagai, Khwazakhela, and Madyan.

A resident of Salampur who accompanied his son admitted in Saidu Sharif teaching hospital, said that his son got fever with pain in joints 2 days ago. "The doctors admitted him, saying he got chikungunya and suggested that he would remain in the hospital for 2 more days for his complete recovery," he told this correspondent.

Doctors at Saidu hospital said that it was a seasonal fever caused by mosquitoes. They said they had received patients from different areas of Swat and not from a specific area.

"Actually, the cases are of mosquito-borne fever which is seasonal and common in this weather. We have received several patients this month [August 2018] and majority of them were suffering from malaria, typhoid and chikungunya," said Dr Hameed, who was on duty in the medical ward of Saidu teaching hospital. He said that the patients recovered after using simple medicines.

Dr Zeeshan, a focal person for district health office in Swat, said on contact that there was no serious issue about the disease as it was a seasonal fever. He said that health teams were also sent to Faizabad where they conducted investigation.

"Until now we have screened about 174 people in the area and mainly malaria and typhoid fever were found in them. We have also sent blood samples of few patients to the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, for investigation and confirmation," he told Dawn.

[The report above mentions chikungunya as 'seasonal fever' due to mosquitoes. The report does not mention if the chikungunya cases have been lab confirmed as the facilities for lab confirmation are limited at present in the country.

It is noteworthy that malaria, dengue, and chikungunya are all vector borne diseases transmitted through mosquitoes. The clinical presentation can be quite confusing with some distinctions in fever patterns, features such as rash or join pains with chikungunya and non specific symptoms common to all.

This presents a challenge in confirmation of clinical diagnosis which can direct specific therapy in case of malaria and appropriate supportive management for the other 2 diseases.

It is recommended that if malaria microscopy and rapid device testing for dengue can be implemented at basic health facility levels, these 2 diseases can be ruled out and managed at that level reducing the need for unnecessary referrals. - Mod.UBA
