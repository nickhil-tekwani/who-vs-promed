There is some evidence that farm family members, slaughterhouse workers,
and household contacts of patients develop protective immunity to
_Escherichia coli_ O157 and/or verotoxin, in contrast to infected patients,
perhaps as a result of repeated low level exposure.

There is some evidence (see references) to suggest that farm residents and
those in rural areas experience subclinical immunizing Vero cytotoxigenic
_Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) infections. According to Travena et al., farming
families and farmers do become cases of _E. coli_ O157.
1. Wilson JB, Clarke RC, Renwick SA, et al. Vero cytotoxigenic _Escherichia
coli_ infection in dairy farm families. J Infect Dis 1996; 174: 1021-7.
Human VTEC infection was negatively associated with age (P < 0.05) and was
not associated with clinical illness. Many dairy farm residents experience
subclinical immunizing VTEC infections at a young age, which frequently
involve non-O157 VTEC found in cattle.
2. Evans J, Chalmers RM, Chart H, et al. Evidence of persisting serum
antibodies to Escherichia coli O157 lipopolysaccharide and Verocytotoxin in
members of rural communities in England. Eur J Epidemiol 2000; 16(10):
885-9. The techniques of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
immunoblotting were used to examine a total of 1667 serum specimens, from
apparently healthy members of rural communities in England, for antibodies
to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of _E. coli_ O157 and Verocytotoxins (VT).
29 specimens from 22 individuals were shown to have antibodies specific for
_E. coli_ O157 LPS. Some of these lived on livestock farms and had
occupational contact with cattle, suggesting that personnel working with
farm animals may produce serum antibodies to the O157 LPS antigens. 15
people had IgG class antibodies to O157 LPS, suggesting long term exposure
to _E. coli_ O157, and 5 people had serum antibodies on more than one
occasion showing evidence of persistent antibodies to O157 LPS. 13
specimens from 12 of 22 individuals also contained antibodies to VT1, VT2,
or both toxins. 10 specimens contained antibodies to VT1 and VT2, 3
contained antibodies to VT2 only.
3. Aslani MM, Badami N, Mahmmoodi M, Bouzari S. Verotoxin-producing
_Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) infection in randomly selected population of Ilam
Province (Iran). Scand J Infect Dis 1998; 30: 473-6. In rural areas, most
individuals carrying VTEC isolates were asymptomatic, whereas in urban
areas, a significant association was found between VTEC isolation and
diarrhea (p < 0.01).
4. Reymond D, Johnson RP, Karmali MA, et al. Neutralizing antibodies to
_Escherichia coli_ Vero cytotoxin 1 and antibodies to O157
lipopolysaccharide in healthy farm family members and urban residents. J
Clin Microbiol 1996; 34: 2053-7. These findings are consistent with a
greater level of exposure of dairy farm residents to VT-producing E. coli
(VTEC) strains. The high rate of seropositivity to VT1 in farm residents
probably reflects the booster effect of repeated VTEC exposures and argues
against a sustained generalized immunosuppressive effect of VT1.
Seroepidemiological studies may help in assessing the level of exposure of
different populations to VTEC strains.

cytotoxin producing _Escherichia coli_ O157 infection from farm animals to
humans in Cornwall and west Devon. Commun Dis Public Health 1999;2:263-8.
Cases associated with animal contact included farm visitors, holidaymakers,
and members of farming families and farm workers.
