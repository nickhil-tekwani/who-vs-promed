Foot and mouth disease suspected in Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe
--------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 17 Jul 2003 from Dr SK Hargreaves, principal
director of livestock & veterinary services, Department of Livestock &
Veterinary Services, Harare:
Report date: 17 Jul 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical. Epithelia have been collected and will be
submitted for analysis at both the Botswana Vaccine Institute and
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South Africa.
Date of initial detection: 16 Jul 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: 8 July 2003.
The suspected outbreak affects four farms in Manyame district, Mashonaland
East province. These farms are within 10 km of one another.
Total number of animals in the suspected outbreak: 2961 head of cattle.
Total number of clinical cases: 485 head of cattle.
Origin of infection:
This is the first outbreak in the Export Zone since 1989. Investigations on
the source are currently underway but it is suspected that illegal movement
of infected cattle from provinces like Masvingo and Manicaland (eastern
part of the country), where the disease is enzootic, could have led to the
outbreak. Recently there has been an increase in cattle movement associated
with the ongoing Land Reform. Some of the cattle movements have been
illegal, that is, from areas quarantined for FMD.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Quarantine: the provinces of Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central and
Mashonaland West have been put in quarantine and the only movement
permitted is for direct slaughter.
- Zoning: the traditional FMD control zones remain as before.
- Vaccination: vaccination coverage will now include areas at risk in
Mashonaland East province.
- Surveillance: all livestock in the quarantine areas are under regular and
intensive surveillance.
Additional information will be published in OIE Disease Information dated
25 Jul 2003. Meanwhile, for further details visit the website

Foot and mouth disease hits Zimbabwe
------------------------------------
HARARE: More than 1000 cattle in prime ranching areas south of Harare have
been infected with foot and mouth disease, threatening vital beef exports,
state radio reported on Friday. "We believe that the source has been due to
some illegal movements of livestock and this is being followed up," Stuart
Hargreaves, the principal veterinary director in the southern African
country was quoted as saying. "We are also investigating other possible
areas where there could be infection," he added.
The movement of cattle in the area has been restricted to prevent the
spread of the disease, the radio said. The country, which is already
critically short of foreign currency, will need to find 2 million dollars
to import vaccines to deal with the outbreak, according to official reports.
Zimbabwe earns millions of dollars every year from beef exports mainly to
the European Union, as well as other countries in Africa and Asia. But
cattle farming has taken a battering with the country's commercial herd
decreasing from 1.5 million to 250 000 in recent years, according to
official figures.
