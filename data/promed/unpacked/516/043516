The Epidemiology Organisation in the Stavropol region has stated that this region continues to report cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). 21 cases were registered among the residents of 9 districts (Apanasenkovskij, Arzgirskogo, Budennovsky, Ipatovsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Novoselytsya, Trunovskogo, Turkmen, Shpakovsky). Human cases of CCHF are the result of tick bites. Removal of ticks from animals using unprotected hands is often a source of infection.

This year [2013], a total of 4393 people were treated for tick bites, which is 26 percent less than in the same period last year. According to the results of laboratory studies, CCHF virus was detected in ticks collected in 8 districts, indicating that CCHF virus is still widespread in the region.

[The Stavropol Region (Krai) is a federal subject of Russia in the North Caucasian Federal District. Its administrative center is the city of Stavropol. Population: 2 786 281 (2010 Census). A map showing the location of Stavropol can be accessed at http://www.russiasregions.com/southern_federal_district.html. The adjacent region of Crimea is the original site of isolation of CCHF virus and was formerly part of the Soviet Union. It is now part of Ukraine.

Northward expansion of CCHF has been limited by the distribution of the tick vector. Detailed information concerning the distribution of CCHF can obtained from the WHO website at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/. - Mod.CP
