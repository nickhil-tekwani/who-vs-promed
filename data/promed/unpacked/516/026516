From: Diane Goade <DGoade@salud.unm.edu>
I recently asked our pharmacy, where a small supply of ribavirin is generally
on hand, what their cost is for ribavirin. I was quoted approximately $ 970
for the average 2 gm intravenous loading dose (30 mg/kg to initiate treatment
of certain severe viral illnesses). That figure is for the loading dose
alone, not for the entire course of therapy.
