The Ebola outbreak that has killed 18 people in western Uganda
appears to be spreading, officials said on Sunday [2 Dec 2007], as
authorities examined a sample taken from a dead patient in the south
of the country. Government officials told AFP that the disease, which
flared in September [2007], had spread to 3 new zones in the
impoverished Bundibugyo district near the border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

Virologists were meanwhile examining a sample taken from a suspected
victim who died overnight in the Mbarara region, 160 km southeast of
the affected district. Health officials said several dozen medics and
support staff had fled Bundibugyo when their co-workers became
infected with the virus in an outbreak that has already killed 18
people and infected 61.

Virologists were also investigating an isolated patient in the
neighboring Port Portale district as well as the fatality in Mbarara.
"There are fears that the disease has spread," said a top health
ministry official who requested to remain unnamed. "We are waiting
for the results from the samples," he said of the 2 cases that have
spread panic in the east African nation. The disease, which is fatal
in 90 percent of cases, is spread by contact with body fluids,
primarily blood.

Meanwhile, epidemiologists and virologists are in Bundibugyo district
to try to trace backwards the source of the virus as part of a
campaign to avoid future outbreaks. Authorities say the outbreak was
an unknown strain, after analysis was done on tissue samples at the
laboratories of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Known Ebola sub-types usually attack capillaries and
blood vessel linings, draining the body of blood through openings,
leaving the patient to die in shock, doctors say. But the new Uganda
subtype, which provokes high fever, kills victims without much loss
of blood.

Medical workers in Bundibugyo District have fled their workplaces in
fear of contracting the deadly Ebola virus. Elias Byamungu, the Chief
Administrative Officer, on Friday [30 Nov 2007] said medical workers
had abandoned patients in health units for fear of being infected.
"The health workers are terribly afraid," he said. Byamungu put the
death toll at 28.

Health authorities, however, last night [1 Dec 2007] put the toll at
18, up from 16 registered by Thursday [29 Nov 2007]. "We have had 2
more deaths in the last 24 hours, and the disease continues to
spread," Dr. Sam Zaramba, the Director General of Health Services,
told Reuters. He said World Health Organisation (WHO) officials had
teamed up with local experts to draw up a strategy to contain the
outbreak. More than 50 people are also infected.

District health officials said 5 new cases were admitted to
Bundibugyo Hospital yesterday [1 Dec 2007]. "We have set up isolation
wards where all those who have been diagnosed with Ebola have been
quarantined and are being monitored closely," Zaramba said.

The 1st victim died in August 2007, but the cause of death was
referred to as a "mysterious illness." Until Wednesday [28 Nov 2007]
when the health ministry and the WHO confirmed it as being Ebola, the
disease, which has ravaged 14 villages in the district, was being
described as "mysterious and strange." Zaramba said the illness was
confirmed as being Ebola following tests at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, US.

Speaking on the phone, Byamungu said among the infected are 3 medical
workers, including a doctor whom he identified only as Ssesanga, who
he said was critically ill. He said the disease started in Kikyo
Parish, Kasitu Sub-county and later spread to Ngamba Parish,
Bundibugyo Town Council and Bubukwanga Sub-county. The 1st death
occurred after a group of residents of Kikyo feasted on a goat in
August 2007.

"There were accusations and counter-accusations of witchcraft. Some
people were even arrested until we discovered that the problem was
medical," Byamungu said. He expressed fear that the disease could be
incubating in the neighbouring districts of Kabarole and Kasese,
where infected people could have travelled. Residents of Kabarole are
in a state of panic, with many avoiding handshakes or being in crowed
places. Taxi drivers plying the Fort Portal-Bundibugyo route said
they were taking extra precautions. "We are not overloading our
vehicles so as to reduce body contact among passengers. We also do
not accept to transport visibly ill people," said one driver.

Ebola is spread through contact with the body fluids of infected
persons. This is the 2nd major Ebola outbreak in Uganda. The last one
occurred in 2000 in Bunyoro and in the north, killing over 140 people.

[More information about this new epidemic of Ebola fever is
unfolding. The 1st case dates back to August 2007 and has been
associated circumstantially with feasting on goat meat. Hemorrhage is
not a prominent feature of the disease. The outbreak in the
Bundibugyo District is extending and now involves at least 14
villages. The death toll now stands at 18, and the number of cases is
now 61. An as yet unconfirmed case has appeared at a location 160 km
to the south. The epidemic situation is fluid, and new cases may
begin to appear outside the Bundibugyo District.
