Brucellosis outbreak -- 40 people infected by goat bacteria
----------------------------------------------------------
About 40 people in Ratchaburi province are believed to have been infected
by a bacterial disease, brucellosis, from exposure to unpasteurized goat milk.
Livestock officials have killed more than 250 infected animals and were
carrying out further tests on livestock. Brucellosis has been spreading in
the western province since early September 2003. The bacteria are usually
passed among animals such as goats and cattle. Humans can be infected
through contact with the animals or by consuming their contaminated products.
Local veterinarian Manaschai Watanakul said infected animals would suffer
miscarriages, while infected humans would suffer flu symptoms such as high
temperature, headache, pain in the joints, and loss of weight.
He said livestock officials found 256 infected goats on 10 farms in Suan
Phung district. The animals were killed and buried on Monday and their
owners compensated. Thousands of goats are raised in Ratchaburi, mostly in
Suan Phung and Muang districts, and Ban Kha sub-district.
Dr Jaruthas Narischart, Ratchaburi public health chief, said the infection
was confirmed in 2 patients while 40 others were under observation. The
disease can be fatal if complications are not adequately treated.
Blood samples from over 3000 goats in Ratchaburi had been sent to
laboratories in Bangkok for tests, he said.

[Caprine brucellosis is usually _B. melitensis_, which is a significant
human zoonotic disease and can carry case fatality rates of around 30
percent. One of its more unpleasant aspects is its capacity to induce
florid psychotic periods in humans during convalescence. It was a major
source of illness among the Allies during the World War II fighting in
Italy. This is not a disease to regard lightly.
Checking the OIE statistics, Thailand has not reported this B-class disease
in its goats. However, they have reported sporadic _B. abortus_ outbreaks
in cattle in 2001, 1997, and 1996. Various caprine vaccines are available,
and a new 'RB' vaccine for melitensis is in development and has been
undergoing field trials in Argentina. When it will be available elsewhere I
am unsure, but it looks to be as successful as the RB51 vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]
[Brucellosis is another zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by
direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of
unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is
also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile
periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with
_B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle)
and _B. suis_ (swine).
The infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is
generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night
sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be
diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow
quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the
microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis. Localized
infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system
(1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). GU brucellosis may present
identically to GU tuberculosis.
As noted by Moderator MHJ, psychiatric manifestations such as depression
and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called
chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella
infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however,
include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).
