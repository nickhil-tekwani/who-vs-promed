One adult and 4 children were admitted last week [week of 18 Jun 2012] to hospitals in Bordeaux and Pau. They were suffering from symptoms of _E. coli_ infection. As of 25 Jun 2012, 3 are still in hospital in Bordeaux.

The studies carried out have "confirmed the presence of _E. coli O157 in 1 case and "the results are expected on 26 Jun 2012" for the others.

The 3 children were admitted to the hospital between 15-20 Jun 2012 and all 3 consumed hamburgers manufactured by the Societe des Viandes Elaborees d'Estillac in the Lot-et-Garonne. The direct link with the hamburgers is not confirmed.

For precaution, the Intermarche and Netto supermarkets, which have marketed these steaks, have asked their consumers to be vigilant. The affected stores have put information signs in place. 16 departments in the Southwest are affected, including the Gironde, Dordogne, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, and the Pyrenees-atlantiques.

The deadline for consumption of these hamburgers (15 Jun 2012) has already passed but for precaution, the distributor and the manufacturer are asking people who have retained these products in their freezer, "not to consume them and return them to where they were been purchased."

According to a statement released yesterday [25 Jun 2012] by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the manufacturer indicated that hamburgers with the trademarks Jean Roze, Netto, and Top Budget were affected. They were sold under the reference "fresh ground beef 15 percent fat" and "fresh ground beef 20 percent fat" with a deadline for consumption between 28 May 2012 and 15 Jun 2012.

[As of yet, no "smoking" ground beef has been found, that is, no EHEC O157 has been isolated from the ground beef.

Recently, Philip Tarr and colleagues have published (1) a multivariable analysis regarding the risk for hemolytic uremic syndrome in children infected with _E. coli_ O157. As previously reported more anecdotally, the group analyzed 259 children and found a higher rate of hemolytic uremic syndrome in those children who reviewed antimicrobial agents than those who did not (36 percent versus 12 percent, p=0.001). This observation continued during multivariable analysis. The higher rate of complications was observed across all antimicrobial classes used.

Also of note, it has also been recently recommended (2) that clinical laboratories should (regardless of patient age, season of the year, or presence or absence of blood in the stool) be cultured for _E. coli_ O157:H7 using sorbitol MacConkey agar AND test the stool for Shiga toxins to detect non-O157 EHEC.
