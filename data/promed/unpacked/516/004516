Subject: SARS, potential etiologic agent, Hamburg

This is a clarification note relating to a Reuter's report contained
in ProMED message SARS - WORLDWIDE (13): ETIOLOGY

In the morning of Tuesday 25 Mar 2003, we had identified coronavirus
sequences in supernatant of a culture of Vero cells showing a cytopathic
effect after having been inoculated with respiratory fluid from the
Frankfurt index patient [physician who had cared for SARS patients in
Singapore - Mod.MPP] with SARS.

This tissue culture was grown at the Virology department of the University
of Frankfurt (involved researchers: Wolfgang Preiser, Holger Rabenau, Marin
Stürmer, Annemarie Berger, Hans Wilhelm Doerr). On Monday, the colleagues
in Frankfurt found seroconversion in an immunofluorescence test on these
same cells using serum of the index patient after defeverescence.

The virus was detected in the supernatant by a random amplification
approach. 15 different pairs of primers directed to various parts of
viruses other than coronaviruses were used in a low stringency RT-PCR. The
random PCR products were sequenced, and 2 of the obtained sequences matched
at the protein level to known coronavirus sequences deposited in GenBank.
Both sequences (90 and 300 nucleotides in length) are located in the
polymerase gene but do not overlap with the sequence reported by CDC on 24
Mon 2003. Phylogenetic analysis of the larger fragment suggests that the
novel virus is not related closely to any of the known phylogenetic
lineages of coronaviruses (groups 1, 2, and 3). The sequence diverges by
50-60 percent from known coronavirus sequences and segregates
phylogenetically between bovine coronavirus (group 2) and avian infectious
bronchitis virus (group 3). Using primers specifically targeting the
sequence reported by CDC, coronavirus sequences were also found in clinical
specimens of the Frankfurt index patient. The sequence of this PCR fragment
matched exactly the sequence reported by CDC, indicating an epidemiological
link between the patient in Frankfurt (who came from Singapore) and the
patient(s) from whom the CDC sequence originates.

We are now setting up molecular diagnostic tests (RT-PCR, real-time
RT-PCR). The primers are communicated through the WHO network. An
international biotech company (Tib-Molbiol, Berlin) makes these oligos
rapidly available to the laboratories involved in the network.

[These data provided by Drosten and Stephan Günther of the Bernhard Nocht
Institute of Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, provide independent
support for the conclusion that a novel coronavirus, distinct from known
members of the genus _Coronavirus_ of the family _Coronaviridae_, is the
etiologic agent of SARS, and verifies the results reported from the CDC,
Atlanta. The molecular and seroconversion data from Hamburg are well-nigh
conclusive. - Mod.CP]

Correction: Virologists at Hong Kong University Responsible for Coronavirus
Identification
------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Jane Cardosa has pointed out an error in the Moderator's comment to the
ProMED-mail post "SARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758" in that
there are 2 universities in Hong Kong involved in the investigation of SARS
etiology.

These are (1) Hong Kong University and (2) the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. The announcement of a paramyxovirus seen by EM in throat specimens
was made by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The isolation and
identification of a coronavirus from lung tissue was from Hong Kong
University. Professor Malik Peiris is at Hong Kong University.

ProMED-mail regrets the misinterpretation of press reports, and the
Moderator (CP) apologies to those concerned for this error.

novel coronavirus as the etiologic agent of SARS, rather than an
unspecified paramyxovirus. - Mod.CP]
