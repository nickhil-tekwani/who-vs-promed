Ohio: 1st Probable Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in
2004
-----------------------------------------------
The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) today announced its 1st
probable case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in 2004. The
patient is a 79-year-old male from Scioto County. "With warm
weather in recent weeks, mosquitoes have become active," said
ODH Director J. Nick Baird, M.D. "Today's development should
remind us all of the importance of taking personal protection
measures and working to eliminate mosquito breeding sites on and
around our properties."
In 2003, Ohio reported 108 probable and confirmed human cases
of WNV and 8 WNV-related deaths; the 1st human case was
reported on 18 Jul 2003. In 2002, Ohio reported 441 human cases
and 31 deaths. Human WNV cases typically do not appear until
late summer in Ohio. ODH and the local health authorities are
working to determine where the patient may have been exposed to
the virus.
"West Nile virus and other vector-borne illnesses are preventable,"
Baird said. "By taking some simple steps, you can help ensure that
you and your loved ones remain healthy and safe when outside this
spring and summer." The tick and mosquito season in Ohio
generally runs from April through September.

West Nile virus testing begins Monday
-----------------------------
Another season of West Nile Virus monitoring begins Monday [12
Apr 2004], according to Crawford County General Health District
Environmental Health Director Jackie Ward, R.S. This is the date
the Ohio Department of Health will start allowing local health
departments to submit dead birds for testing of the virus.
This year [2004], bird testing is open to all song birds and crows.
Once 2 positive birds are found in the same county, the bird testing
will stop and other preventative measures will begin. It is important
that county residents contact the Crawford County General Health
District at 419-562-5871 to report dead birds.
Residents in Galion and Crestline should contact the Galion City
Health Department at 419-468-1075. Information should include
the type of bird found and the location. Wear gloves when handling
a dead bird and place the creature in a plastic bag and then into
another plastic bag. Put it on ice to prevent it from decomposing. If
the bird has been dead longer than 48 hours or shows signs of
decomposition, use the above information on handling the bird and
then dispose of it with your normal garbage.
The health district also will set out mosquito traps to catch
mosquitoes for testing.
To protect yourself and your family, Ward recommends the
following:
Try to avoid the peak exposure time, which is at dusk.
Wear light-colored clothing with long sleeves & long pants when you
cannot avoid being exposed to mosquitoes.
Use repellents carefully. More is not necessarily better, so read the
product label instructions and follow their recommendations. Certain
repellents may not be appropriate for younger children.
Be sure the screens in your house are 16-mesh or finer.
Mosquitoes need standing water to breed, so make sure there is no
stagnant water anywhere around your home. Empty bird baths at
least once a week. Any other containers that hold water should be
emptied and stored so that they will no longer hold water.
Remove, cover or store unused tires inside. If you are not using the
tires, take them to a recycling center.
If you have a septic system, make sure that it is working properly
and not causing wet areas in the yard that would allow mosquitoes
to breed.
Look around your neighborhood for streams or roadside ditches
that aren't flowing. Contact the appropriate individuals to try and
have the matter corrected.
