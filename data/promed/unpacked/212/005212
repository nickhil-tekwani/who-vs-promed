So far in October 2009, 22 people have died in the city of
Quilengues, [located] 140 kilometers [87 miles] north of Lubango, in
Huila province, victims of a diarrheal outbreak, according to
information provided to ANGOP by the Deputy Administrator, Abel Wandi
Andre. The official made it clear that the most recent cases occurred
in commune Dinde of the village Tchituli, where 16 people were
infected with the disease, 9 of whom died. Another 4 cases were
reported at headquarters, with one death.

The municipality of Impul is the most affected part of the district,
where 39 cases with 12 deaths were reported. The administrator
reported that in this constituency, cases occurred in the villages of
Vombo, Kandombe, Kavissaka and in the District headquarters.

At this point, according to the head of the Health Division, Gabriel
Adriano, there are technical staff working in the villages most
affected, in order to provide treatment to the existing cases and
conduct campaigns aimed at awareness and disease prevention.

The causes of the disease are still unknown, according to the deputy
administrator, they only know that it is not cholera. He said that
samples were taken by trained health technicians from Huila and were
sent to laboratories outside the country in order to diagnose [the
disease] and determine the etiology of the disease, a disease
considered "highly dangerous" by rapidly infecting people and causing
death within 24 hours.

Quilengues has an area of 4464 square kilometers and a population
estimated at 134 050 people who live mainly from agriculture and livestock.

[Although it is stated that "it is not cholera", a potentially
rapidly fatal diarrheal disease in an area where cholera has been
found in the no so distant past is likely to be cholera. Huila

A total of 5 people have died in a new cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe
where more than 4000 people were killed in the country's worst-ever
outbreak of the disease in 2008, media reported Tuesday [20 Oct 2009].

Health secretary Gerald Gwinji told the Herald newspaper that 117
cholera cases had been confirmed in several parts of Zimbabwe since
infections were reported in September 2009 in the country's east.

"Most of the cases were recorded in Gokwe north among religious
objectors who for a long time have been reluctant to seek medical
attention," Gwinji told the state-controlled newspaper.

The toll in a cholera outbreak in northern Nigeria rose to 149 Friday
[16 Oct 2009] with 52 more deaths, a provincial health official said.

"We have recorded 52 deaths from cholera outbreak in 4 local
government areas of the state while 1335 have been hospitalized," the
director of disease control in Borno State, Abdallah Sadiq, told AFP.
"The disease was 1st reported on 10 Sep 2009 in Gwoza local
government on the border with Cameroon from where it spread to 6
other districts", he said.

He said Biu local government on the border with Chad was the worst
affected area where 650 were infected, forcing health officials to
open a camp for the victims.

Cholera has claimed 77 lives in recent weeks in Adamawa State,
leaving nearly 1000 people hospitalized.

Late September 2009, officials in Jigawa State announced the death of
11 people in a cholera outbreak which affected 400 others at a
village outside the state capital.

In Taraba state, a neighbor of Adamawa, another cholera outbreak
killed 9 people and infected 120 others.

Some 300 people died and many more are hospitalized due to an
outbreak of cholera reported since mid-month in Adamawa State in
northern Nigeria, reported today sources told Efe, the local press.

The situation has worsened due to a strike of workers in the health
sector that happens in this state," said Shehu Dauda, a local
journalist assigned to cover the facts. The areas most affected, the
sources said, are bordering Cameroon in the north which also detected
an outbreak of cholera in recent weeks.

[5] Cholera - Cameroon (North, Extreme North provinces)

Cholera has killed at least 51 people in the past few weeks in
northern Cameroon, where health experts say safe water and proper
sanitation are sorely lacking. "The fight against cholera here will
be difficult because the hygiene conditions are awful," said a health
official who was not authorized to be quoted. He noted that most
people defecate in open areas.

The regions affected are Cameroon's North and Extreme North, with the
1st infections reported in September 2009, according to the Health
Ministry. As of 14 Oct 2009, 23 people had died in Extreme North, out
of 144 infected, according to a Health Ministry document that is
updated regularly; while in neighboring North region 28 people had
died, out of 152 infected.

This area of Cameroon is on the southern fringe of the Sahel and
water is scarce; existing boreholes and wells are insufficient to
meet the needs of the population, according to UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) in Cameroon.

Cholera epidemics are frequent in northern Cameroon but the current
outbreak is particularly severe, the health ministry official told
IRIN. The highest number of cholera deaths in recent years was in the
commercial capital Douala in 2004 when cholera killed 100 people.

Lae city in Papua New Guinea's Morobe Province has again been put on
red alert after 6 people were admitted to the cholera treatment
center in a single day late last week. The National newspaper reports
that on Thursday, 15 Oct 2009, 6 people were reported to have gone to
the centre with symptoms of cholera. Another person was admitted on
Friday, 16 Oct 2009.

Dr Likei Theo, chairman of the Morobe cholera outbreak task force,
says the emergence of a large number of cases in one day showed that
the people were returning to their old ways and were not as
fastidious over hygiene as they had been.

The development comes as most of the aid agencies and organizations
that were assisting the task force have left Morobe.

Recently the epidemiologic situation on cholera deteriorated in
Tajikistan, which is due to inadequate preventive activities due to
the lack resources.

A cholera outbreak was reported on 13 Oct 2009 and all 3 of the
patients died. On the next day, 4 other patients were admitted and
their condition remains serious. There was another outbreak of
cholera in July 2009 in the same place. The investigation showed that
the source of the infection was tap water from the city of Kublyar.
The water possibly got contaminated from the sewer system.

[10] Shigellosis - Russia (Novosibirsk)

The workers in a Novosibirsk factory making chemical concentrates
begun seeking medical care for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms over
the past week.

Valentina Varlamova, who is the head of 25th regional section of
Federal Medical-Biological Agency (an agency which deals with this
factory and current outbreak), reported that the number of cases
increased to 24 from 8 Oct to 14 Oct 2009. 15 people are in the
hospital and 9 people are being treated at home. She informed that
the tests conformed shigellosis caused by _S. sonnei_, the most
common one [found locally]. A commission has been called to
investigate the outbreak and soon the suspected source was identified
as the sour cream from the factory canteen. This product is produced
by a local producer but the contamination was felt to have taken
place in the canteen itself because the sour cream was sold in open
glasses allowing external contamination. The definite source and the
date of contamination are not yet clear.
