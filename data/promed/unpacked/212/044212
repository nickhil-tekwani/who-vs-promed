Date of confirmation of the event: 11 Aug 2015
Date event resolved: 19 Jun 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1963
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: duck hepatitis A virus

This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Shiso, Hyogo
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Jun 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (19 Jun 2015)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 330 / 251 / 251 / 0 / 79
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 76 / 76 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and / or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [12 Jun 2015], high mortality of ducklings was notified by the owners and the local veterinary officers visited the farm for inspection. Samples from the dead ducklings were sent to the local veterinary laboratory of Himeji Livestock Hygiene Centre in Hyogo prefecture for diagnosis including avian influenza and Newcastle disease. _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis was isolated on [22 Jun 2015]. As haemorrhagic lesion and proliferation of bile duct were observed in liver by pathological examination, the test for duck virus hepatitis was conducted. A virus was isolated with positive result for RT-PCR specific to duck hepatitis A virus 1. The allantoic fluid sample and the PCR products were sent to National Institute of Animal Health and confirmed as duck hepatitis A virus 1 on [11 Aug 2015]. The last recorded cases of duck virus hepatitis were between 1962 and 1963.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestation, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Himeji Livestock Hygiene Centre (local laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Aug 2015 / Positive
Himeji Livestock Hygiene Centre (local laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / 4 Aug 2015 / Positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Birds / gene sequencing / 11 Aug 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Hepatitis in ducks can be caused by at least 3 different viruses. The more common and internationally widespread is duck hepatitis virus (DHV) type I, a member of the _Picornaviridae_ in the new genus _Avihepatovirus_, which causes a highly lethal, acute, contagious infection in ducklings under 6 weeks of age and, frequently, under 3 weeks of age. It does not occur in older birds. This infection is often referred to simply as duck virus hepatitis. 3 genotypes that may also be serotypes of DHV type I have been identified and designated duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) types 1, 2, and 3.

"DHV type II has been reported in the United Kingdom only. It occurred in ducklings from 10 days to 6 weeks of age, and caused pathological changes similar to those of DHV type I. From electron microscopy and molecular studies, it is a member of the _Astroviridae_ and is known as duck astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-I).

"DHV type III has been reported only in the United States of America. It causes similar liver lesions in young ducklings, but is less virulent than DHV type I. From molecular investigations, it is a member of the _Astroviridae_ and designated duck astrovirus type II (DAstV-II). It is considered distinct from DAstV-I.

"Diagnosis of hepatitis in ducklings is based on the characteristic disease pattern in the flock, gross pathological changes, the recovery of virus from dead ducklings, and the reproduction of the disease in susceptible ducklings.

"DHV type I infections can be controlled by the use of live attenuated virus vaccines and an inactivated virus vaccine. They are administered to breeder ducks to confer passive immunity to ducklings. Live attenuated virus vaccines may also actively immunise DHV type-I-susceptible day-old ducklings.

"Ducklings susceptible to DHV type I may also be passively protected with a chicken egg yolk antibody preparation.

"DHV type III infections can be controlled by the use of a live attenuated virus vaccine given to breeder ducks to confer passive immunity to ducklings."
