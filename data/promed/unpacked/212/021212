The number of whooping cough cases across Greater Geelong has risen, prompting calls for adults to get their booster shots. There have been 55 cases in the Geelong region so far this year [2018], slightly more than the 51 recorded at the same time last year [2017].

Barwon Health says the booster vaccine can help stop the spread of the infection. Health officials say one in every 200 babies who contract whooping cough will die, and immunisation is the best way to reduce the risk.

Several cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in children from the Dungog and Clarence Town areas.

Dr Kat Taylor, a Hunter New England Health physician said while the local outbreak was not particularly unusual, it was a reminder for people to keep vigilant as the contagious bacterial disease can have severe implications. The disease, also known as pertussis, can be life threatening for babies.

"Whooping cough has been on the rise generally in NSW [New South Wales] for the past 10 years," she said. "There is always whooping cough about in the community and at times there is a bit more than others.

"The year [2018] to date [6 Jun 2018] figures for the Lower Hunter area show there have been 59 cases notified which is slightly up, with 18 more cases than this time last year [2017]." Whooping cough is a notifiable condition which means general practitioners, schools and day care centres must notify the public health unit when a case is diagnosed. "It's a reminder to check your vaccination status particularly if you are working with children and keep coughing children away from school or daycare," said Dr Taylor.

Almost 3 dozen Adams Elementary School students are staying home from school due to an outbreak of whooping cough.

The Register Guard reports that Adams is one of 8 schools in Eugene and Springfield to experience whooping cough outbreaks this spring. On [Tue 5 Jun 2018], Lane county health officials contacted 35 Adams' families to let them know their children are not allowed on campus during the outbreak because they don't meet immunization requirements against the highly contagious respiratory disease.

Lane County public health spokesman Jason Davis tells the Guard that "it's been the worst pertussis season in 5 years in the county and that 'we are absolutely not out of the clear yet.'" So far, the county has investigated 142 whooping cough cases. Positive lab tests have been returned in 108 of those. Usually, 20 confirmed cases are reported in the county in a typical year.

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced [Tue 17 Jul 2018] pertussis, better known as whooping cough, claimed the life of a San Bernardino county infant. This is the 1st confirmed infant death from the disease since 2016, when 2 deaths occurred.

"This baby's death is a tragedy for the family and for California as a community, as this is a preventable disease," said Dr Karen Smith, CDPH director and state public health officer. "This serves as a grim reminder that whooping cough is always present in our communities, and immunizations are the 1st line of defense."

Each year, 50-200 California infants are hospitalized with pertussis. CDPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that expectant mothers receive the whooping cough booster shot (also called Tdap, or tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine) at the earliest opportunity between 27 and 36 weeks of every pregnancy, even if previously immunized. Getting immunized during pregnancy boosts a mother's immunity and passes on protective antibodies directly to their babies before birth. This helps protect newborns until they are old enough to begin receiving their own whooping cough immunizations at 6 to 8 weeks of age.

"No baby should have to be hospitalized due to a vaccine-preventable disease, and certainly no baby should die," said Dr Smith. "To give babies the best protection, I urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated against whooping cough as early as possible during the 3rd trimester of every pregnancy."

To avoid the spread of whooping cough, CDPH also recommends that:
- parents immunize their babies against whooping cough as soon as possible. The 1st dose is recommended at 2 months of age, but can be given as early as 6 weeks of age;
- California 7th grade students [should] receive the whooping cough booster, Tdap;
- adults should receive a whooping cough booster once in their lives.

More information about pertussis is available on CDPH's website.

Confirmed cases of whooping cough have been identified in Powassan and surrounding area. The North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit says it has confirmed a few cases of pertussis -- commonly called whooping cough -- in the Powassan area.

Dr Jim Chirico, medical officer of health, is urging parents and guardians to check that their children have been vaccinated. Whooping cough vaccine's immunity drops substantially over time. If they haven't, he says, contact the health unit or a doctor.

Two children under 2 [years of age] died in the last week at the Robert Reid Cabral Children's Hospital because of whooping cough, a contagious and vaccine-preventable disease. The dead are a girl aged 15 months from the community of Cambita, San Cristóbal and another one of 3 months, who lived in La Romana.

Also, another 28 children have been admitted with this disease, which calls the attention of the pediatricians of the hospital, since the vaccine that immunizes is included in the Expanded Program of Immunizations (PAI).

The official website of the Ministry of Health, in the epidemiology component, defines pertussis as an endemic respiratory disease that commonly affects children under the age of 5, with infants under 6 months of age at the highest risk of complications, but also it can affect teenagers and adults. The use of the vaccination scheme with DPT [diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus] or pentavalent [diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib)] is the main prevention measure, while pertussis outbreaks tend to occur every 3 to 4 years, according to official information.

So far this year [2018], 29 probable cases of whooping cough have been reported, 7 in the last 4 epidemiological weeks. As many as 9 out of 10 cases correspond to children under 1 year of age. Santo Domingo Norte and Santiago are the demarcations that register the highest number of cases.

Faced with this situation, the Ministry of Health instructed the provincial directorates and corresponding health areas to ensure adequate research and response to preventable diseases.
