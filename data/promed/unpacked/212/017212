It should be unsettling to more than just anglers that unusual
numbers of young smallmouth bass are being found dead in sections of
the Susquehanna and Juniata rivers.
Specifically, biologists and anglers are finding large numbers of
dying or dead fish with skin lesions downstream from Lewistown in the
Juniata and downstream from Sunbury to below Harrisburg in the
Susquehanna.
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has attributed the problem
to a bacterial infection, but the source of those bacteria remains a
mystery. Fortunately, the commission says the bacteria -- columnaris,
which is [related to] environmental or nutritional factors -- [poses]
no threat to humans.
But it's nevertheless troubling that dead fish are turning up on some
of the best bass fishing waters in the United States, and waters used
for various recreational purposes and in some cases drinking water in
our backyard. And while the smallmouth are the afflicted at the
moment, the bacteria can be picked up by other freshwater species;
they have been found in smaller numbers on white suckers in the same
waters.
Officials haven't ruled out water pollution, but note that a single
event usually doesn't affect just one species or occur over an area
as large as that in question.
There's some thinking that high water temperatures and low water
levels are contributing to the bacterial infection, and that may be.
But this isn't the first summer that such conditions have existed, so
deeper exploration is needed.
The Fish and Boat Commission appears to be on top of the situation,
posting public information on its website and bringing in experts
from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Fish Health
Laboratory.

[If this were an issue of water quality, it is unlikely that it would
affect only one species. It appears from this article that there is
much reassuring of the public without definite answers to what is
really happening.
This article indicates that investigation is continuing. If indeed
only one species is affected, then perhaps people swimming in the
waters are not at great risk.
If the problem is columnaris, that disease is a caused by the
bacterium _Flexibacter columnaris_, other names for which include
_Cytophaga columnaris_ and _Bacillus columnaris_. The disease is also
known by such common names as Cotton-Wool or Cotton mouth disease
because of its white mold-like appearance when it forms skin lesions.
The bacteria enter through skin abrasions, the mouth, or the gills,
and is most often spread by contaminated nets or food sources. Most
often it affects fish that are stressed by poor water quality (high
water temperatures, low dissolved oxygen concentration, or inadequate
diet).
Fish that are commercially raised may suffer from the disease in
cases of overcrowding. In such contained areas they may be treated
with oxytetracycline (Terramycin) added to the feed or water.
However, this may be impractical in the case of large lakes or
free-flowing streams and rivers.- Mod.TG]
