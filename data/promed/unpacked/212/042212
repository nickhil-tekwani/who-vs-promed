Cholera in Zambia
Source: WHO Outbreak page 27 Jan 1999
The government of Zambia has informed WHO of a cholera outbreak in
Ndola, in the northern part of the country near the border with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. So far, a total of 66 cases has been
reported, with 4 deaths. In view of heavy rainfalls, the Ministry of
Health has already taken the necessary action and alerted the national
cholera task force. Control measures are being taken. Cholera
preparedness committees are on the alert in other surrounding areas
(Kitwe city and Chililabombwe), and are implementing prevention and
preparedness measures which include conducting hygiene education
campaigns, designating temporary cholera centres and establishing
emergency stocks of drugs. Zambia has been seriously affected by cholera
epidemics in the past, with 13 154 cases in 1991, 11 659 cases in 1992
and 6 766 cases in 1993. Since 1994, the total number of cases has
continued to decrease.

GENEVA, Jan 29 (AFP) - A cholera epidemic has claimed at least 30 lives
in western Rwanda, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday. WHO
experts confirmed more than 300 cases of cholera in the areas of Gisenyi
and Ruhengeri as of January 11, said spokesman Gregory Hartl. The toll
may have risen since, and some press reports mention about 50 dead, he
said. The situation can be brought under control as Rwanda has enough
cholera vaccine, the spokesman said.

MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - A further 18 deaths from cholera were
recorded in Mozambique over the past 48 hours, the deputy national
director of health, Avertino Barreto, told reporters on Wednesday. This
brings the death toll since September, when the current outbreak
started, to 1,346 out of the 27,225 cases diagnosed.
Fourteen of the deaths notified in the past two days came from the
western province of Tete, two from Cabo Delgado and two from Nampula
(both in the north). Barreto clarified that not all the Tete deaths were
recent - some had taken place earlier but had only now been reported to
the Health Ministry in Maputo because of difficulties in communication
with outlying districts in the province. Two of the country's 11
provinces now seem to be free of cholera. In Manica, in the centre of
the country, no cases have been diagnosed for the past two weeks, and
the southern province of Inhambane has so far remained completely
untouched by the epidemic.
Four suspected cases of cholera were reported from Inhambane last week,
but Barreto said laboratory analyses proved the patients were suffering
from another form of diarrhoeal disease and not cholera. Barreto said
the health authorities were bringing the mortality from this outbreak
under control. The lethality rate over the entire outbreak is 4.9
percent - but over the past fortnight the lethality rate was only 1.9
percent ''which is well within the best standards for cholera in
Africa,'' he said.
