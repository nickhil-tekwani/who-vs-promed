NANAIMO, B.C. -- There have been about 25 cases of _Cryptococcus
neoformans_ in the region during the past 30 months -- 5 times the normal
rate. 4 people have died from complications caused by the infection. Given
the population of Vancouver Island the number of cases being reported is
unprecedented, according to medical officials.
"We couldn't find any reports in the literature of any increases like this
anywhere else in the world," says Dr. Murray Fyfe of the B.C. Centre For
Disease Control. The fungus has been found in pigeon [and other bird
droppings, is found in some decomposing organic material in forests, on the
leaves and bark of certain exotic trees, and in some bird droppings.
Epidemiologists say many people are exposed to the fungus, either as
children or adults, but do not become ill. Those with weakened immune
systems [typically defects in cell-mediated immunity, however, are
vulnerable -- including people with HIV [infection.
But the province's Centre for Disease Control is now concerned that
otherwise healthy people are showing signs of _Cryptococcus neoformans_
infection. Symptoms include chest pains, a stubborn cough, severe
headaches, neck stiffness, and difficulty breathing. Doctors are not
certain how the fungus is spreading, but think organisms in dried pigeon
droppings are a possibility. Public health authorities are trying to figure
out what's behind the outbreak. In the meantime, they've warned people to
stay away from pigeons, tropical trees, and rotting bark and leaves.

[_Cryptococcus neoformans_ is a fungal organism with worldwide
distribution. There are several variations/strains of which the 2 most
common are _C. neoformans_ var. _neoformans_ and _C. neoformans_ var.
_gattii_. The var. _gattii_ is seen more frequently in tropical or
subtropical climates. The organism is found in soil and bird droppings
(including pigeons); the var. _gattii_ has also been isolated from foliage
and bark of certain species of eucalyptus trees.
Sporadic cases of cryptococcosis occur in all parts of the world.
Cell-mediated immunodeficiency and immunosuppression are predisposing
conditions for clinical disease.
Clinical disease includes a subacute or chronic meningitis, infection of
lungs, kidneys, prostate and bone; skin involvement such as acneiform
lesions, ulcers or subcutaneous nodules have also been described. Eye
infections have resulted in blindness.
According to GIDEON <http://www.gideononline.com/>: Cryptococcosis was
first described in 1894. Only 300 cases were reported in the world's
literature prior to 1955; however, rates increased dramatically with the
advent of immunosuppressive therapy -- and subsequently AIDS. Thus, 338
cases were confirmed in the United States alone in 1976. Mortality due to
cryptococcosis increased from 0.09/100,000 in 1980, to 0.12/100,000 in 1994.
80% to 90% of infections are AIDS-associated. Cryptococcosis exceeds
_Pneumocystis carinii_ as an opportunistic pathogen among AIDS patients in
parts of Central Africa. The disease is found in 30% of AIDS patients in
Africa and Southeast Asia, and in 6% to 10% in the United States. Over 50%
of cryptococcosis reported in the United States is AIDS-associated. _C.
neoformans_ infection is also documented in 2.8% of organ transplant
recipients.
This news article does not give information on the variant of organism
involved, albeit presumptively it is var. _neoformans_ given the
non-tropical geographical location of the outbreak. According to the CDC
website, the incidence of disease ranges from 0.2-0.9 cases per 100 000 in
the general population, while the annual incidence is 2-4 cases per 1000
among persons with AIDS
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cryptococcosis_t.htm>. The
estimated population of Vancouver Island in 2000 was 699 645
<http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/VI762000.htm> making the
reported incidence during the 30 months period mentioned in this news
article, 3.57 per 100 000 population and a reported mortality of 0.57 per
100 000 population. If one does an adjusted incidence rate (correcting for
the 30 month period cited here and assuming that the cases were equally
distributed during the time frame) the incidence rate would be 1.43 per 100
000 population. If all of the cases reported in the news article are
immunocompetent, this adjusted rate is still significantly above the rate
seen in the general population (as per the CDC statistics) and is cause for
concern.
More information on the current epidemiology, clinical spectrum of cases
and microbiology of the organism involved from official sources would be
very much appreciated by ProMED-mail.
