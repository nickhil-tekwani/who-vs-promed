Statement of the Supreme National Committee to Combat Bird Flu, 2 Jun 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The ministerial committee established to combat the spread of avian
flu, chaired by the Minister of Health, has been continuously
monitoring and reviewing developments as follows:
1st: 16 samples of humans from Meniya, Beheira and Sohag who had been
in contact with dead birds and were employed at farms where
infections had been detected or showed symptoms similar to that of
avian flu were tested yesterday [1 Jun 2006]. All samples tested
negative.
2nd: Daily report on the spread of bird flu among birds:
Sohag:
One positive case was detected in a farm in the districts of (El
Manshaa), an area that had previously reported infections. All fowl
at the site were culled, and all persons involved were tested. No
cases among the birds have tested positive for H5N1 in the rest of
the governorates so far.

Egypt receives H5N1 virus vaccine from Mexico, 25 May 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Some 7 tons of bird flu vaccine arrived at Cairo International
Airport for bird inoculation.
The veterinary quarantine authorities at the airport tested the
Mexican vaccines, coming via Paris, and handed them over to an
international company on vet trade cooperation for transferring [the
vaccines] to a number of Egyptian governorates.
According to Cairo airport quarantine sources, the shipment contains
H5N1 and H5N2 vaccines.

[FAO's table of avian influenza vaccines mentions 7 vaccines produced
in Mexico by 5 labs. All 7 vaccines include the subtype H5N2; one
laboratory provides also an H5N6 vaccine (which, similarly to H5N2,
can be used as a DIVA vaccine). No vaccine in the said published list
is said to include subtype H5N1.
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/vaccine_producers.htm>
It would be interesting to note whether H5N1 homologous vaccine has
been added to the list of vaccines produced in Mexico, and -- if
affirmative -- to obtain details on the vaccine.
According to the FAO table, H5N1 vaccines are currently produced only
by the Chinese lab at Harbin: an inactivated, low-pathogenicity
vaccine and an inactivated recombinant vaccine. Both include the
A/Goose/Guandong/1996, Subtype H5N1 strain.
Details of the Egyptian vaccination scheme and specification of the
vaccines certified for use there will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
