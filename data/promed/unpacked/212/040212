[Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and buffaloes occurring as catastrophic epizootics in many Asian and African countries, resulting in high mortality and morbidity. The disease has been recorded in wild mammals in several Asian and European countries. In many Asian countries, disease outbreaks mostly occur during the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high humidity and high temperatures).

The disease is caused by _Pasteurella multocida_, a Gram negative coccobacillus residing mostly as a commensal in the nasopharynx of animals. The Asian serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2 (Carter-Heddleston system), corresponding to 6:B and 6:E (Namioka-Carter system), are mainly responsible for the disease.

In wild ruminants, serotype B:2,5 is predominantly present while serotype B:3,4 also has been reported from fallow deer. The association of other serotypes, namely A:1, A:3 with a HS-like condition in cattle and buffaloes in India has been recorded. The geographical distribution of HS includes some areas of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe. It has never been confirmed in Mexico, Central or South America.

Clinically, HS caused by B:2 or E:2 strains is typified by fever, respiratory distress with nasal discharge, and frothing from the mouth, leading eventually to recumbency and death.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, chapter 2.4.12 "Haemorrhagic septicaemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.12_HAEMORRHAGIC_SEPTICAEMIA.pdf
(NB: Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

This is indeed a devastating blow on this species which is "critically endangered" (http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/19832/0).

According to the media: "Around 40 per cent of the Central Asian nation's population of the endangered saiga antelope have died in the past 2 weeks. Kazakhstan, the world's 9th-largest country by area, is home to around 90 per cent of the world's population of the saiga, recognizable by their lyre-shaped horns and bulbous nose. 'The death of the saiga antelope is a huge tragedy,' said zoology scientist Bibigul Sarsenova. 'Should this happen again next year, they may simply disappear.'" http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/27/us-kazakhstan-antelope-idUSKBN0OC1XL20150527

Although there are no reports of human infection with _P. multocida_ serotypes B:2 and E:2, other serotypes of this organism do infect humans, and precautions should be taken to avoid exposure (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf). - Mod.CRD
