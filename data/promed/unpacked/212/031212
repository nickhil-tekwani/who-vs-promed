H5N1 fears on smuggled chickens
-------------------------------
Smuggled chickens may have been the cause of the latest outbreak of the
bird flu virus. The suspicions arose after the farms that supplied the 3
stalls at the center of the H5N1 outbreak cleared preliminary checks.
Customs officials said yesterday [9 Jun 2008] they are treating reports of
smuggling seriously. Officers also said they would be stepping up
intelligence-gathering operations to prevent underground poultry shipments.

"We will collaborate with the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation
Department (AFCD) and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)
in investigating the reported problem of smuggling at both the wholesale
and retail levels," said Tam Yiu-keung, acting assistant commissioner of
intelligence and investigation at the Customs and Excise Department.

AFCD assistant director of inspection and quarantine Thomas Sit Hon-chung
added: "Invoices show the chickens that tested positive came from 3 local
and 6 mainland registered farms. But checks at the 3 local farms showed no
problems, and mainland inspection and quarantine authorities have also
confirmed there are no problems with the 6 farms on their side." Sit said
more than 70 samples taken from farms, wholesale, and retail markets all
tested negative for H5N1. More tests will be conducted at local and
mainland farms and the results will be out in a few days.

The FEHD has sent inspectors to mainland farms and processing plants.

Sales of around 4000 chickens left in the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary
Wholesale Poultry Market resume today [10 Jun 2008] after samples tested
negative.

Hong Kong Poultry Wholesalers' and Retailers' Association chairman Steven
Wong Wai-chuen said he had heard that chilled chickens were being smuggled
in by sea and land in air-conditioned carriers from Shenzhen. "The
wholesale price of such chickens is about HKD 7-8 [USD 0.9-1.02] a catty
[catty = about 1.3 lbs or 600g], while the usual price is about HKD 16 [USD
2.05] a catty," he said. All chickens were slaughtered and chilled in
yesterday's [9 Jun 2008] citywide cleanup -- earlier than the bi-monthly
routines on the 25th and 10th of every month. Wong expected the sector to
lose HKD 100 million [about USD 12.8 million] in sales during the 21-day
suspension of chicken imports.

Traders dropped a plan to free chickens at SAR [Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region] government headquarters and Government House
yesterday [9 Jun 2008] after meeting with officials on Sunday [8 Jun 2008].
That came after FEHD acting director of operations Chu Lan-ying said
compensation is being considered, with HKD 30 000 [USD 3842] and a 3-month
rent waiver planned for vendors in government markets and HKD 60 000 [USD
7684] for vendors in markets managed by The Link.

The scare erupted on Saturday [7 Jun 2008] after chickens at the Po On Road
market in Sham Shui Po tested positive. All 2700 chickens in the market's 9
stalls were culled.
