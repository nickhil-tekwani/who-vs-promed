Quarantine reform; two pills too far?
It is easy to confound quarantine with rabies control. Many people still
seem to be doing so. Some of them have doubtless been beguiled by the
shared potential for arbitrary regulations to be made and enforced,
ostensibly in the public interest. However, the real issues are rabies
control, not quarantine; and reform, not reinforcement.
When the Kennedy Committee (aka the Advisory Group on Quarantine) was
set up last year, it was asked inter alia whether the present quarantine
system should be retained as a barrier against the introduction of
exotic animal parasites. The short answer was, apparently, "No: it
should not". At this point, however, the Kennedy Committee, in hot
pursuit of the Precautionary Principle, opted to exceed its remit and
came up with a proposal for obligatory antiparasitic treatment of pets
before importation -- a sort of Quarantine Substitute Medication Scheme
-- for incorporation into any replacement for the present Rabies Order.
As pointed out earlier this year (Done 1998 a & b; Soulsby 1998), and as
the Kennedy Committee has recognized, the Rabies (Importation of Dogs,
Cats and other Mammals) Order 1974 is specifically, and only, concerned
with rabies control. New compulsory measures to prevent the introduction
of exotic animal parasites would require new legislation. It would be
difficult as well as improper to try bury them surreptitiously in a
Rabies Order. Such new UK laws would also need to be acceptable to the
EU; and particularly to Eire, with whom we share a land frontier and a
common policy on rabies.
Even if adopted, it is questionable whether the proposed medication
might not be better applied after landing in this country, possibly
without charge, rather than abroad. Checking that animals had, or had
not, been treated might prove difficult, as well as generating
frustration and discontent. And the ethics and acceptability of
compulsory treatment of many thousands of animals for diseases they
haven't got have yet to be seriously addressed. Once people come to
realize that effective immunization can provide at least as much
protection against rabies as six months [very expensive quarantine,
they may feel morally justified in evading regulations which they
perceive as both onerous and irrelevant. This could bring the law into
contempt and lead to an increase in smuggling -- hardly what the
authorities had in mind!
A pertinent and useful question: "How serious would it be if pet animals
were not all medicated before they came into Britain." If the answer is
"Not very serious", then let's not try to impose such a requirement with
the full force of law. Hopefully, Ministers will recognize that
recommendations 34 to 36 in the Kennedy Committee Report (MAFF 1998)
look like a bundle that might be better left on the shelf -- at least
until they have got the rabies policy sorted.
