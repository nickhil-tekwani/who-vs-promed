BLOOD, SCREENING FOR INFECTIOUS AGENTS
======================================

March 1, 1997 - From the Lancet
When should blood banks begin to routinely screen for an infectious agent?
Molecular evidence has linked human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) with Kaposi's
sarcoma, and serological studies have shown that the virus occurs [also] in
the healthy population. However, Blackbourn and colleagues' recovery of
infectious HHV-8 from a healthy blood donor is the first evidence that the
virus could be transmitted by blood transfusion (Lancet 1997; Vol 349, No.
9052: 609-11). Allain's commentary in the same issue of the Lancet (p 584)
discusses the issues surrounding when, or if, screening of donated blood for
newly discovered viruses should be introduced. Once transmissibility has
been established, the other important issues are whether the virus is found
commonly, whether the infection persists, and whether the virus causes a
serious disease (these criteria are fulfilled by hepatitis C virus, for
example). For HHV-8, the next step is confirmation that the virus is
transmitted; the other questions can then be addressed.
