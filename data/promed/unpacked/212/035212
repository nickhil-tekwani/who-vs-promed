Multiple microbial agents associated with a waterborne outbreak among
Scandinavian tourists in Turkey
An estimated 125 Danish and 13 Swedish tourists became ill while on holiday
or immediately on their return from the same hotel in Marmaris, Turkey.
Nine different microbial agents were isolated from the holidaymakers.
Within 24 hours of arriving at the hotel on Friday 11 September 1998, more
than 100 guests developed acute gastroenteritis: 75 were seen by the hotel
doctor and at least 20 holidaymakers were admitted to the local hospital
for observation and rehydration. The hotel doctor obtained water samples
from the drinking water system of the hotel and the swimming pool, on
Saturday 12 September, and the hotel's water tank was chlorinated as it was
suspected to be the source. Samples from the drinking water system yielded
Gram negative enteric bacteria (not further specified). The hotel manager
and travel agencies were informed of these results on Monday 14 September.
The guests were also informed and told not to drink the water in the hotel,
or to use it for toothbrushing.
A follow up investigation performed by the hotel's doctor and local public
health inspectors revealed that the hotel, which is normally supplied by
its own private water supply, had opened a shunt pipe to the public
community water system to supply its water tank about one week before the
incident. This pipe had been blocked at one end and out of use for four
years. The investigation also revealed that the kitchen staff had used tap
water for juices and for 'welcome drinks' on 11 and 12 September.
Nine potential aetiological agents were isolated from the tourists on their
return, most commonly _Cryptosporidium parvum_ and enterotoxigenic
_Escherichia coli_ (ETEC). Both agents need special techniques for
isolation and many routine clinical laboratories do not examine faecal
specimens from travellers with diarrhoea for these agents. The association
with ETEC can explain the short incubation period (hours) for some
tourists. Six patients were infected with two or more microbial agents...
Tourist destinations are often visited by people of many nationalities,
with a high turnover of individual travellers and groups. Outbreaks can be
difficult to identify, especially if the aetiological agent is common among
travellers in the region. Moreover, by the time an outbreak has been
identified, tourists have often departed and may be difficult to trace.
This outbreak and the source were easily identified because of the high
attack rate due to heavy contamination with many different microbial agents.
This report serves as a reminder that outbreaks among tourists can be
caused by multiple microbial agents and that multiple microbial agents
isolated from different patients can have a single source. The outbreak
described here is likely to have been caused by the introduction of four
year old water from a shunt pipe into the drinking water system, although
it must be acknowledged that the link with the contaminated water is
indirect. Even though the patients had all stayed at the hotel in the
outbreak period, the possibility cannot be excluded that one or more of the
patients acquired gastroenteritis from sources of food and drink outside
the hotel. A case control study would have established the cause of the
outbreak more firmly and classified the risk factors, including water
consumption, associated with developing illness. More resources are needed,
however, if outbreaks of this kind are to be investigated thoroughly.
