Legislators Issue Alert On Cattle Disease
-----------------------------------------
Members of Parliament (MPs) yesterday issued an alert over an outbreak
[see commentary] of brucellosis in different parts of the country. The
legislators, particularly from Mbarara District, raised fears that the
disease, which is transmitted from cattle to human beings, continues
to ravage different parts of the country, and they called on
government to intervene immediately.

"The disease is being transmitted from cattle to human beings through
consuming raw animal products. Let the ministry vaccinate our animals
before it is too late," MP for Mbarara, Ms Emma Boona, said yesterday
[7 Sep 2011].

Brucellosis is associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk,
ghee and cheese made from the milk of infected animals that include
cattle and goats infected with the bacteria _Brucella melitensis_.

Dr Francis Epatait (Ngora County) noted that the disease also causes
infertility and abortions among human beings. "The effects are really
grave and the government should act fast," he said.

Dr Medard Bitekyerezo (Mbarara Municipality) noted that so many people
suffering from the disease have been admitted into Mbarara hospitals
and clinics.

The Third Deputy Prime Minister, Gen. Moses Ali, promised to
investigate the matter and take action.

[The article included several inaccuracies and was therefore
considerably edited. The current situation is not an "outbreak" but
rather a continuing, concerning condition which is said to be
deteriorating.

The article mentions _B. melitensis_ as the causative agent in cattle;
the main cause of cattle brucellosis is _B. abortus_. In fact both _B.
abortus_ (mainly affecting cattle) and _B.melitensis_ (mainly in
goats, but also affecting cattle) are reported as endemic in Uganda
and both are zoonotic.

Earlier surveillance, carried out in Mbarara -- one of Uganda's most
important dairy-production areas -- mentioned herd prevalence for
brucellosis, in cattle, of 55.6 percent, individual-animal prevalence
of 15.8 percent and within-herd range of 1Â­90 percent (Ref 1).

Uganda's annual reports to the OIE (2005-2010) do not include
information on the number of outbreaks nor on the brucellosis
vaccination coverage; such information, as well as updated information
about the current prevailing control measures and human infection data
are requested.
