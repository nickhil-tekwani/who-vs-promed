[What is noteworthy about this report is the morbidity rate of 14 per cent and the case fatality rate of 50 per cent, which is highly unusual in cattle, and for BTV-4. It would be helpful if greater detail could be provided on the origin of the affected cattle, what specific clinical signs they showed, whether additional cases have occurred since this event in August of 2018, and whether or not there were concurrent infections.

Clinical cases of bluetongue occur mainly in sheep. Cattle and goats in endemic areas are sub-clinically infected; however:

"These species are more likely to be affected when a naive population is first exposed to bluetongue virus, such as during recent serotype 8 outbreaks in Europe.

"Clinical cases resemble the disease in sheep but tend to be milder. Reported signs in cattle include inappetence, lethargy, facial edema, submandibular edema, oral inflammation with vesicles or ulcers in the mouth, excess salivation, nasal discharge, an elevated respiratory rate, edema of the distal limbs, and hyperemia of the coronary band with lameness. The muzzle of some cattle was reported to have a 'burned', cracked appearance. Body temperature was sometimes normal. Cattle can also develop various skin lesions including vesicular and ulcerative dermatitis, periocular dermatitis, necrotic lesions, sloughing of affected skin and photodermatitis. In some cases, the skin may develop thick folds and cracks, particularly around the withers and neck. Udder and teat lesions, such as erythema, ulcers, cracking and necrotic lesions, have been reported in both cattle and goats, and milk production can be decreased. In some goats, a high fever and drop in milk production were reported to be the only sign. Abortions and stillbirths have been reported in both species, and congenital abnormalities including CNS lesions have been observed in newborn calves. Temporary sterility may be seen in bulls. Deaths are possible, but uncommon." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bluetongue.pdf. - Mods.CRD/AS
