a.
2 May 2009 -- The situation continues to evolve. As of 06:00 GMT, 2
May 2009, 15 countries have officially reported 615 cases of
influenza A(H1N1) infection.
-------------------
Mexico has reported 397 confirmed human cases of infection, including
16 deaths. The 241 rise in cases from Mexico compared to 23:30GMT of
[1 May 2009] reflects ongoing testing of previously collected
specimens. The United States Government has reported 141 laboratory
confirmed human cases, including one death.

The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with
no deaths - Austria (1), Canada (34), China, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (1), Denmark (1), France (1), Germany (4),
Israel (2), Netherlands (1), New Zealand (4), Republic of Korea (1),
Spain (13), Switzerland (1) and the United Kingdom (13).

Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO
website on a regular basis.

The WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of
borders. It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay
international travel and for people developing symptoms following
international travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance
from national authorities.

There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption
of well-cooked pork and pork products. Individuals are advised to
wash hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and
should seek medical attention if they develop any symptoms of
influenza-like illness.

a. Human to human transmission, Germany
Date: 2 May 2009
From: Oliver Schmetzer
<oliver.schmetzer@gmx.net>


According to the press release of the president Juerg Hacker of the
German health institute (Robert-Koch-Institute) from 2 May 2009:

The 2nd suspected human-to-human infection has been confirmed. In
addition to the 42-year-old nurse, the 38-year-old patient which
shared the room with the initial in Mexico infected 37-year-old man
has been tested positive for A/H1N1. Another traveler coming home
from Mexico has also tested positive.

This is now the 4th case in Bavaria, and the 6th in Germany. The
number of suspected cases rose to 30.
See <http://www.rki.de>

--
[It is clear that there are 2nd generation transmissions of the virus
in a number of the countries (Germany, UK, Canada, USA, Mexico). What
awaits to be seen is whether there will be sustained human to human
transmission in the northern hemisphere as the temperature/humidity
indices continue to increase with the change in season, or if
circulation of H1N1 virus appears to stop in the northern hemisphere.
It will also be interesting to see what evolves in the southern
hemisphere as the virus has been introduced into areas where
"seasonal influenza" is about to begin. - Mod.MPP]

b. ARI deaths Mexico
Date: 1 May 2009
From: Cowie, Benjamin
<Benjamin.Cowie@mh.org.au>


The information on the number of cases of suspected 2009 influenza A
(H1N1), and mortality attributed to this infection is concerning, and
national governments and the World Health Organisation are
necessarily treating the situation seriously.

However one cannot escape the fact that little or no information on
baseline acute upper respiratory infection and influenza morbidity
and mortality in Mexico has been presented in many of these
communications.

Searching for such information, we came across the Manual for
Epidemiological Surveillance for Influenza of the Mexican Ministry of
Health
(<http://www.dgepi.salud.gob.mx/infoepi/Manual%20Influenza-%20con%20anexos-feb%202007.pdf>)
- 2nd edition, 2007.

It would appear from this document (chart 7, page 23) that in the
years 1998-2004, between 13 151 and 17 167 people died of acute upper
respiratory tract infections and influenza annually.

From chart 10, page 26 it appears that 6.3 to 7.2 percent of acute
upper respiratory infections and influenza in the same period
occurred in the month of April. If this proportion can be
extrapolated to mortality, then baseline deaths due to upper
respiratory tract infections and influenza in Mexico (population ca.
111 000 000) in an average April would be estimated to be
approximately 1050.

Clearly differences in classification and diagnostic criteria make
direct comparisons between historical surveillance data and progress
reports of an evolving outbreak investigation difficult. However an
appreciation of baseline disease incidence and mortality helps put
the burden of this emergent strain of influenza in context.

Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Melbourne.

[The data discussed by Cowie, Looker and Kelly in the above
submission are important data to start looking at in evaluating the
"true" severity of the H1N1 virus activity in Mexico. In the absence
of looking at baseline influenza mortality (or pneumonia related
mortality during influenza season) in Mexico, one is hard pressed to
interpret the current reports of deaths associated with H1N1
infection as severe, etc. We still do not have pneumonia associated
mortality by month, which would be relevant as well, since the
original reports of suspected cases and deaths were based on
hospitalized cases of pneumonia reported to the Ministry of Health in
Mexico. We look forward to seeing further in depth analyses of the
current situation in Mexico and comparisons with prior year's
experience. - Mod.MPP]

c. Guadalajara personal report
Date: 1 May 2009
From: Andy Gardner
<apgardner@me.com>


In early March [2009], I attended the ICANN global conference with
hundreds of attendees from all over the world.
(<http://mex.icann.org/>)

Before leaving Guadalajara, I had mild flu symptoms [with body aches]
and these increased while there. Friends I met there report having
"nasty" flu sessions after returning home from Mexico City.

Now here is the interesting thing. Guadalajara, the 2nd largest city
in Mexico has no positive cases of the current virus. (see
<http://www.informador.com.mx/jalisco/2009/99195/6/la-ausencia-del-virus-en-jalisco-no-es-ilogica-ssj.htm>)

I'm wondering whether the flu virus that was circulating in
Guadalajara in Feb/Mar is part of the mix in the new version, and
that those that had the Guadalajara virus are immune from the current
one?

--
Andy Gardner
<apgardner@me.com>

[It is intriguing that while the PAHO reports from earlier days
mention that all 32 states in Mexico have reported cases, to date,
there have not been confirmed cases of H1N1 infection from Jalisco,
the state where Guadalajara is located. In a recent interview with
Dra. Celia Alpuche the head of the Instituto de Diagnostico y
Referencia Epidemiologicos (InDRE) in Mexico City, carried on
Science Magazine Science Insider blog (available at
<http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/05/exclusive-inter.html>),
there was mention of simultaneous circulation of seasonal influenza
including H3N2 and influenza B viruses in March, around the time the
outbreak of H1N1 was starting. Information on the above described
situation in Guadalajara is interesting and answers to the questions
raised may well await serologic studies once they are available. -

[6] USA - New York City community transmission
Date: 2 May 2009
Source: New York City Department of Health
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/2009/09md15.pdf>


Epidemiologic Updates New York City H1N1 (SO) Outbreak Update
-------------------------------------------------------------
Diagnostic testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has confirmed 49 cases of Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) (H1N1
[SO]) in New York City. Thirty-three probable cases have also been
identified. A cluster of influenza-like illness at Public School Q177
and St. Francis Preparatory School are epidemiologically related; the
2 schools are in close proximity to one another in Queens. Both
schools have been closed. All confirmed cases can be
epidemiologically linked either to exposure to an ill person
associated with the 2 schools or to travel to Mexico.

However, DOHMH has now identified 2 probable cases without apparent
epidemiologic links: a 14-year-old Queens resident, and a 20-year-old
visitor to New York City. These findings, along with other suggestive
surveillance data presented below, suggest that community
transmission of H1N1 (SO) is now occurring in New York City. The
guidance provided here reflects that new understanding.

To date, illness in New York City and the United States as a whole
continues to be similar to seasonal influenza, with the overwhelming
majority of diagnosed patients having had mild illness. No deaths
attributable to H1N1 (SO) have occurred in New York City. DOHMH is
actively conducting surveillance for cases of severe, febrile
respiratory illness due to H1N1 (SO) in order to determine its
frequency, risk factors for developing more severe illness, clinical
features and spectrum of illness. Only one confirmed and 4 probable
cases have been hospitalized; none have had critical illness (e.g.,
none have required ventilatory support) and all are recovering.

As part of its effort to understand the transmission and basic
epidemiology of H1N1 (SO) at the St. Francis Preparatory School, the
Health Department created an online questionnaire to survey students,
parents and staff at the school. The agency reported the findings in
an MMWR Dispatch (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0430a1.htm>). Of the
1996 St. Francis Preparatory students who responded to the survey,
659 (33 percent) reported being sick with flu-like symptoms at some
time since [8 Apr 2009]. Most (82 percent) became ill between
Wednesday and Saturday ([22-25 Apr 2009]), and 254 became ill on [23
Apr 2009]. Only 1 percent (27) reported being both sick and feeling
worse than the day before. Six of the ill persons reported traveling
to Mexico the week before, 1 traveled to California and none went to
Texas. Approximately 29 percent reported that at least one other
household member was sick, and a total of 462 household members were
reported by students to have been sick at the time of the survey (see
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/h1n1_stfrancis_survey.pdf>).

Several individual cases and at least one cluster of influenza in New
York City, including both a case of influenza in a student from Pace
University and a cluster of influenza at Manhattan's Ascension School
that were announced publicly, have now been diagnosed as Influenza A
(H3N2). These findings provide evidence that seasonal influenza
activity is ongoing in New York City. It is not known what proportion
of influenza-like illness in the community is due to H1N1 (SO) versus
H3N2 or other respiratory pathogens. Because both H1N1 (SO) and
influenza A (H3N2) are susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamavir,
empiric antiviral treatment and prophylaxis recommendations have not
been changed.

Syndromic surveillance data from hospital emergency room chief
complaints suggest that an increasing number of individuals are being
seen in emergency departments for influenza-like illness (ILI). The
largest increase has been seen in patients complaining of fever in
the 18-44 year old age group. It is not known whether this increase
reflects changes in care-seeking behavior or a true increase in
community ILI. No increase in mortality due to pneumonia or influenza
has been observed.

A total of 3 adverse events due to oseltamivir use have been reported
to the NYC Poison Control Center. Of those, 2 were dosage errors in
children resulting in vomiting. The 3rd was a rash attributed to an
allergic reaction. As a reminder, dosage recommendations for
antiviral medications are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/dosagetable.htm#table>.

Given the evolving epidemiology of H1N1 (SO) influenza in NYC and
elsewhere, the number of NYC cases is expected to continue to
increase in the coming days. We will continue to update case numbers
and guidance in subsequent alerts.

(compared with 397 cases and 16 deaths on 1 May 2009).

According to newswires, Italy has confirmed a case of H1N1 with a
history of travel to Mexico prior to onset of illness.

New York City has reported 2 cases in individuals not
epidemiologically linked to other confirmed cases suggesting
community based transmission of H1N1 in NYC. In addition, New York
City has confirmed cases of seasonal influenza H3N2, suggesting
continued circulation of H3N2 into April 2009. - Mod.MPP]
