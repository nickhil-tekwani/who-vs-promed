Norovirus outbreak hits Queen Elizabeth 2 world cruise
------------------------------------------------------
The Queen Elizabeth 2 has become the 1st cruise ship in 2007 to suffer a
serious outbreak of norovirus illness, with about 16 per cent of passengers
sickened since the ship left Southampton, England on Tue 2 Jan 2007.
Members of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
will board the ship on Fri 19 Jan 2007 in Acapulco, Mexico. So far, 263
passengers and 27 crew members have shown signs of norovirus infection, a
common ailment that causes vomiting and diarrhea for 48 to 72 hours.
The Cunard Line ship is on a 106-night world cruise that included a stop in
Fort Lauderdale last week. After a dockside meeting with Queen Mary 2, the
2 ships left Port Everglades on 10 Jan 2007 on separate itineraries.
Cunard spokesman Brian O'Connor said the norovirus outbreak began before
the ship reached Fort Lauderdale on its trans-Atlantic trip to New York.
Cases began declining after it left New York. Four passengers were still
sick on Thu 18 Jan 2007, he said. O'Connor said Cunard has no plans to
interrupt the QE2 world cruise for disinfection, although special cleaning
rules have been followed since the outbreak began.
"We have no requests from passengers to disembark based on the situation,"
O'Connor added.
