Stachybotrys and Hemorrhagic lung disease
I am confused by the literature on the relationship of _S. chartarum_
and HLD. Do we know the cause/effect relationship here? Are the
satratoxins really involved? Are there other fungi or toxins suspected
in this disease relationship?
Finally, I am interested in development of a rapid, quantitative test
for at least the satratoxins; are there any pure reference standards
available?
