Horse owners and veterinarians are growing concerned as the number of cases of _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_, commonly known as pigeon fever, appears to be on the rise in Iron County.

Pigeon fever is an equine disease that can cause external or internal abscesses and what is called lymphangitis in the legs, said veterinarian Leilani Wilson with the Parowan Valley Veterinarian Clinic.

While it is not always fatal, it is highly contagious, she noted, adding that although it is largely considered an equine disease, cattle can also get it.

Wilson said Wednesday [17 Sep 2014] she has treated quite a few horses recently in the area and has known of others that have come down with the disease.

Tina Minniear's horse is one of many Wilson has treated recently.

"The horses' chests bloat up like pigeons' chests; that's why it's called pigeon flu," Minniear said. "I knew as soon as I checked his stomach, though, because he had abscesses there."

Minniear said she knows of at least 50 horses in the area that have contracted pigeon fever recently.

For the horse to begin to heal from the disease, the sores have to actually be lanced, Wilson said.

Wilson does not recommend antibiotics except in rare cases. "They (antibiotics) actually can prolong it," she said. "And you don't want that to happen." The only time Wilson recommends using antibiotics is when the abscesses are internal. "This is a rare type of pigeon fever, but the antibiotics are needed with this type," she said.

Some horse owners opt to lance and drain the sores themselves, but Wilson recommends that before doing so, horse owners need to call a veterinarian.

"Right now, with this going around, if people find bumps or lumps on their horses, they need to contact a vet 1st before doing anything else," Wilson said. "Usually, they (bumps and lumps) are found on the abdomen and chest, but they can show up other places, like the legs."

Generally, the horse will not show any signs of having the disease for 3 to 4 weeks after contracting it, Wilson said.

Since the disease is primarily spread by flies, Wilson recommends horse owners do everything they can to keep those pesky flies away. "We really need an early freeze this year [2014] so we can get rid of the flies," Wilson said.

Minniear suggests using "Bute," which can be bought over the counter to reduce the pain caused by the abscesses. "It can be really painful," she said. "So I use Bute, which can be bought at Cal-Ranch or IFA."

In addition, hot packs can be used to help with pain and to reduce the swelling, she added.

All horses that have been diagnosed with pigeon fever should be isolated from other horses as well to help keep the disease from spreading, Wilson said.

Pigeon fever, pigeon breast, breastbone fever, dryland distemper, dryland strangles, false strangles, or false distemper are names by which this disease -- caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ -- is most frequently known. Geographically, it was at one time considered to be a disease of California, where it is regarded as endemic. However, it is much more widespread now, especially in the western states of the USA, but it has a worldwide distribution. It is a seasonal disease, usually appearing in late fall, but it can appear sporadically at any time of year.

The signs of pigeon fever can also initially resemble those of other diseases such as strangles. Sometimes the only initial signs are lameness and a reluctance to move. It can strike a horse of any age, sex, or breed, but usually attacks young adult animals. There is a low incidence in foals.

It has also been diagnosed in cattle, and a similar disease affects sheep and goats. The disease is not transmissible to humans, although humans can carry the infectious agent on shoes, clothing, hands, or barn tools and transfer it to other animals.

Clinical signs include lameness, fever, lethargy, and weight loss, usually accompanied by very deep abscesses and multiple sores along the chest, midline, and groin area, and, sometimes, the back. Abscesses also can develop internally.

The disease is called pigeon fever because infected animals often develop abscesses in their pectoral muscles, which swell to make it resemble a pigeon's chest. Although the disease is considered seasonal, with most cases occurring in early fall, a number of cases have been confirmed during winter months and other times of the year as well.

The causative bacteria live in the soil and can enter the animal's body through wounds, broken skin, or through mucous membranes. In addition, some researchers believe pigeon fever may be transmitted by flies.

Of the types of disease (external abscesses, internal abscesses, or limb infection [ulcerative lymphangitis]), ulcerative lymphangitis is the commonest form worldwide and rarely involves more than one leg at a time. Usually, multiple small, draining sores develop above the fetlock.

The commonest form of the disease in the United States is external abscessation, which often forms deep in the muscles and can be very large. Usually, it appears in the pectoral region, the ventral abdomen, and the groin area. After spontaneous rupture, or lancing, the wound will exude liquid, light tan-colored, malodorous pus.

The commonest forms are external abscess and lymphangitis, with the prognosis of a full recovery being generally good. Internal abscesses can occur and are very difficult to treat.

The contagious nature of the disease means an accurate diagnosis is imperative, and treatment should be initiated as well as control of insects and the rigid practice of biosecurity.

Horse owners should be aware of the clinical signs and understand that veterinary care must be timely. Infected horses should be isolated, the abscesses properly treated, and the drainage properly disposed of. The area where the infected horse is kept must be properly cleaned and completely disinfected because this is a very hardy bacterium. Bacteria in the pus draining from abscesses on infected horses can survive from one to 55 days in the environment. They have also been shown to survive from one to 8 days on surface contaminants and from 7 to 55 days within feces, hay, straw, or wood shavings. Lower temperatures prolong the survival time.

Pest control is extremely important. The bacteria may be transported between animals by flies.

Horses may become infected but not develop abscesses for weeks. The disease usually manifests in younger horses but can occur in any age, sex, and breed.

A different biotype of the organism is responsible for a chronic contagious disease of sheep and goats, caseous lymphadenitis (CL). Either biotype can occur in cattle.

Treatment in horses often consists of hot packs or poultices applied to abscesses to encourage opening. Open abscesses should be drained and regularly flushed with saline solution. Surgical or deep lancing may be required, depending on the depth of the abscess or the thickness of the capsule, and should be done by your veterinarian. Ultrasound can aid in locating deep abscesses so that drainage can be accomplished. External abscesses can be cleaned with a 0.1 per cent povidone-iodine solution. Antiseptic-soaked gauze may be packed into the open wound. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as phenylbutazone, can be used to control swelling and pain.

Antibiotics are controversial. Their use in these cases has sometimes been associated with chronic abscessation and, if inadequately used, may contribute to abscesses, according to one study. The most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of this condition are procaine penicillin G, administered intramuscularly, or trimethoprim-sulfa. In the case of internal abscesses, prolonged penicillin therapy is necessary.

Buckets or other containers should be used to collect pus from draining abscesses, and this infectious material should be disposed of properly. Consistent and careful disposal of infected bedding, hay, straw, or other material used in the stall is vitally important. Thoroughly clean and disinfect stalls, paddocks, all utensils, and tack. Pest control for insects is also very important.

With treatment, recovery usually takes place between 2 weeks and 77 days. Although some animals may have recurrences, recovery is generally complete, and the prognosis is good.
