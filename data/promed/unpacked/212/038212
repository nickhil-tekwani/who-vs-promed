We operate a number of beef processing plants in Queensland, Australia, and
recently have had pressure put on us by the state Government Workplace
Health and Safety Authority to perform manditory tests and subsequent
vaccinations on all employees prior to commencment of work.
The current demand means visitors and new employees will be required to wear
respirators. This will really help us instill a view of how safe our meat
is to overseas visitors (after anthrax and salmonella this is wonderful) and
be realy practical for people working hard in a very manual industry. We are
of course challenging this "interesting" plan.
I thought this information may be usefull to some readers and I am
interested in hearing what other States and Countries require or what other
companies do in relation to this issue.

[Having myself worked as a Meat Inspector in Calgary in the early '60s and
thus with first hand knowledge of how dangerous this work can be, even with
unobstructed vision, I referred Ross's statement to Bill Geering, Oz Deputy
CVO, and Mike Poidinger, University of Queensland, for comment. MHJ]

Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) is endemic in Australia, with the highest
prevalence probably being in the State of Queensland. Various hygiene
procedures are required to be carried out in abattoirs to reduce the level
of contamination, including restricting the opening of gravid uteri to
special rooms. Nevertheless, abattoir workers are at high occupational risk
of contracting _C. burnetii infection_. The Queensland Workplace Health and
Safety authorities have therefore established a policy which requires skin
testing and subsequent vaccination (where necessary) of new abattoir
employees; with a requirement that effective respirators (an approved face
mask) be worn by such employees in risk areas until two weeks after they
have been vaccinated, or testing has shown vaccination to be unnecessary.
Visitors are also required to wear respirators if going into risk areas of
abattoirs.

The following is lifted wholesale from
http://hna.ffh.vic.gov.au/comm_dis/cdu/qfever.html
I am currently trying to contact the responsible persons in both Queensland
and Victoria for more uptodate information. ps I dont mind being quoted,
and since this is an excerpt from a public Web page (date unknown), I am
sure quoting it is OK as well.
More to follow as I can get it (given the 4-5 day Easter break upon us).

Q fever - Update
Sheila Beaton
Q Fever is an acute illness with fever, chills and muscle pains and
occasional long term complications. The micro-organism responsible,
_Coxiella burnetii_, is carried by cattle, sheep and goats and is
transmitted by contact with animal faeces, urine, etc or by inhaling dust
from infected premises. It is and occupational hazard paticularly for
abattoir workers and meat inspectors, but also for shearers, wool sorters and
veterinarians. There is no endemic reservoir in Victoria, but the organism
is commonly introduced in stock from interstate.
Following a notification of illness in a female abattoir worker, the
Infectious Diseases Unit investigated an outbreak of Q fever at an abattoir
in northern Victoria. The abatoir has been operating for approximately two
years and a large number of staff are new to the industry. Prevaccination
screening showed approximately 80% of workers were non-immune to Q fever. At
the time of the outbreak, the abattoir was involved in an immunisation
program for the workers, however, some were already incubating the disease
at the time.
To date, there are 26 confirmed cases of Q Fever with a further 3 yet to be
confirmed from a workforce of approximately 100.
The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have prepared a vaccine, Q-Vax, which
gives a very high level of protection, except if given after a person has
already been infected. Q-Vax is different from other vaccines in that the
recipient must first be tested for immunity, since those persons already
immune may have severe reactions with the vaccine.
The details of the immunisation program are as follows:
Two visits to the workplace are required, one week apart. At the first visit
all employees who consent to be involved are given a skin test for Q Fever
by injecting a small dose of diluted vaccine into the skin. At the same time
5-10 mls of blood are taken and tested for Q Fever antibodies. Each employee
is given a short questionaire enquiring about their duration of employment,
past history of Q Fever, allergies, etc. A previous history of infection
with Q Fever vaccine is a contraindication to vaccination.
The skin test is read 7 days later. Training is required in both the
performance and reading / interpretation of the skin test. If both skin test
and blood test are negative and the person is not allergic to eggs, he/she
is offered the vaccine which is given by injection under the skin.
The object of the immunisation campaign is to avoid the possibility of a
major outbreak of Q Fever at any particular workplace. Preventing Q Fever
can lead to significant savings to the employer in avoiding Workcover costs.

I just talked to Dr David Smith, the Principal Medical Officer for the
Queensland government division of Workplace Health and Safety. He gave me
the following that you can quote:
A 1994 study showed the following Q fever refferrals in Queensland:
1990 235
1991 358
1992 301
1993 429
1994 286
The last death due to Q fever in Qld was 2 years ago.
About 50% of these were in meat workers, mostly abbatoir workers. The recent
policy decision sent to you regarding respirators and vaccination is a
result of these ongoing figures, and not a response to a specific outbreak
in Qld or indeed any other part of Australia.
As far as Dr Smith is aware, no other state has any similar regulations.
The vaccine costs $65/ampule, and given the tests required prior to
vaccination, can cost $120-$150/person.
Q fever currently costs the Qld meat industry about 1 million dollars/year
in terms of man hours lost.

[Although most cases of Q fever infection are mild, it can on occasion be
nasty, even lethal. While their preventive measures are possibly draconian,
the Health & Safety authorities are faced with a high attack rate in
slaughter house workers and the duty to take all possible preventive
measures; plus, workers compensation claims can be very high. But I would
still be frightened to work on the killing floor wearing a respirator.
Our thanks to all concerned - Ross, Bill, Mike, and David Smith.
