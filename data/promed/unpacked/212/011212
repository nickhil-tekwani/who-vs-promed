Two more people were confirmed as having cholera yesterday. The women,
aged 24 and 34, were in stable condition in Princess Margaret Hospital's
infectious diseases unit. A hospital spokesman said both patients had
recently travelled to Thailand. Health officials were last night trying to
discover whether the women had eaten seafood recently. A 46-year-old man,
who did not travel abroad during the disease's incubation period, is
suspected of infection.
The Department of Health said the source of contamination in Causeway Bay's
Tao Heung Restaurant - where three people caught the disease - might never
be tracked down. All samples taken from the restaurant proved negative.
A 37-year-old assistant restaurant captain, who was found to be a carrier
of the disease, was unlikely to be the source, said a department spokesman.
"He is not involved in food handling and we believe he is a victim because
the staff also have meals in the restaurant," said the spokesman.
Eight people have come down with cholera in the past fortnight.
