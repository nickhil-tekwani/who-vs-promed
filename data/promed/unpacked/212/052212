Use of beta-agonists in cattle production has received considerable national attention, and now, Texas Tech University veterinary epidemiologist Guy Loneragan has found that although there are significant societal benefits to the practice, an increase in death loss of cattle raises questions about welfare implications of its use.

In a peer-reviewed article published [12 Mar 2014] in PLOS ONE, Loneragan, professor of food safety and public health in Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources, adds to this ongoing national dialogue.

"Beta-agonists improve the efficiency of beef production, and this improvement provides important societal benefits," Loneragan said. "The beta-agonists approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cattle increase muscle growth and may reduce the amount of fat the cattle accumulate," he said. "This means cattle convert more of the feed it eats into beef, and it does this more efficiently."

The article is co-authored by Daniel Thomson and Morgan Scott of Kansas State University and is titled "Increased Mortality in Groups of Cattle Administered the B-adrenergic Agonists Ractopamine Hydrochloride & Zilpaterol Hydrochloride." The manuscript is freely available at http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091177.

With the use of beta-agonists, cattle require less feed and less water to produce the same amount of beef than if no beta-agonists were used. Less land would be used to grow the crops used to feed the animals and, therefore, less fuel to produce the same amount of beef. The improvement in the efficiency of production has meaningful societal benefits, the announcement said.

"However, through our extensive analysis, we found that the incidence of death among cattle administered beta-agonists was 75-90 percent greater than cattle not administered the beta-agonists," Loneragan said. "This increase in death loss raises critical animal welfare questions. We believe an inclusive dialogue is needed to explore the use of animal drugs solely to improve performance, yet have no offsetting health benefits for the animals to which they are administered. This is particularly needed for those drugs that appear to adversely impact animal welfare, such as beta-agonists."

Even with this difference in mortality, the number of overall deaths reported in the paper was quite low and similar to industry average death losses, regardless of cause, according to Elanco Animal Health, which manufactures ractopamine [Optaflexx].

Both Elanco and Merck Animal Health, manufacturer of zilpaterol [Zilmax], noted that their products have been evaluated and approved by the Food & Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities.

Elanco further pointed out that ongoing and continuous monitoring has been in place for the past decade to identify any potential adverse events to feeding ractopamine to cattle and any potential adverse events are reported to FDA and investigated appropriately. Merck added that "only a well-designed clinical study, in a real world setting, coupled with analysis of data by 3rd-party industry experts, can thoroughly confirm the safety profile and performance of a product." Merck explained that the new study was "based on observational information and we disagree with them. Using observational analyses where cattle are not randomized and where rigorous scientific procedures are not utilized, is not a respected scientific method to rigorously evaluate the safety and efficacy of any product."

"We certainly need to better understand the manner in which animals fed beta-agonist die at the feedlot and work out how to balance the societal benefits of beta-agonist use with societal expectations concerning the welfare of animals raised for food," Loneragan said.

The number of US cattle deaths that may be linked to the Merck & Co Inc feed additive Zilmax are much higher than the figures reported by the drug company to the federal government, according to a research study published on Wednesday [12 Mar 2014].

The findings by researchers from Texas Tech University and Kansas State University show that more than 3800 cattle in 10 feedlots that were fed Zilmax died in 2011 and 2012, with between 40 percent and 50 percent of the deaths likely attributable to Zilmax.

The numbers reported in the study, which was published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, would indicate a larger death toll than Reuters found late last year [2013] in a review of all deaths reported to the US Food and Drug Administration by Merck since Zilmax was introduced in 2007. Drug makers are required to report deaths and other adverse events associated with their drugs -- in this case based largely on what cattle and feedlot owners have told the company.

The Reuters review of federal records showed Merck reported 285 cattle had died unexpectedly or were destroyed in the United States after being fed Zilmax during the 6 years of Zilmax sales in the US.

Merck said it was confident in the "safety and performance" of Zilmax and criticized the methods used in the study. The findings were "based on observational information and we disagree with them," the company said in a statement. "Using observational analyses where cattle are not randomized and where rigorous scientific procedures are not utilized, is not a respected scientific method to rigorously evaluate the safety and efficacy of any product," Merck said.

The study could add to concerns about the safety of the drug, which has not been available in the US and Canada since Merck last August [2013] temporarily suspended sales after reports of cattle suffering lameness and mobility problems.

It could also fuel debate about whether there is enough regulatory oversight of feed supplements made from a class of drugs called beta-agonists. The FDA said it will review the new research data and add them to the agency's body of knowledge regarding Zilmax. The agency, which has deemed both drugs safe for animals and humans, can ask drug companies to make changes to product labels if it detects safety concerns.

The beef industry has used Zilmax and other beta-agonist drugs to bolster its bottom line for nearly a decade by creating heavier cattle. Zilmax can add up to 30 pounds [13.6 kg] of meat to a 1300-pound [590 kg] market steer.

Feedlots provided the data on cattle that were fed with Zilmax to the researchers and asked them to analyze it.

Death rates
-----------
The largest population of cattle reviewed by the researchers was a grouping of 722 704 animals in 2011-12 from 9 different US feedlots. Of 637 339 that were fed Zilmax, 0.53 percent died prior to slaughter, according to the report. That is well above a 0.3 percent death rate among the 85 365 cattle that were fed neither Zilmax nor a rival beta-agonist, Optaflexx.

A separate study of 149 636 cattle from one feedlot in those same years showed that 83 865 animals fed Zilmax had a 0.48 percent chance of dying before going to the slaughterhouse, according to the report. That compares to a 0.26 percent death rate among the 65 771 cattle that were fed neither drug.

The researchers reported that cattle fed with Eli Lilly & Co's Optaflexx showed a mortality rate of 0.35 percent among 39 890 cattle. That compares to a 0.18 percent death rate among 39 281 cattle fed neither drug. The Optaflexx data was based on animals at 4 cattle-feeding companies a few years earlier.

Both drugs "are most likely causally associated with increased cumulative incidence, incidence rate, and hazard of death when they are administered in accordance with the FDA-approved label directions," the study said. However, the researchers did warn that it is difficult to definitively establish a causal relationship between Zilmax and increased mortality because of the "observational nature" of the data. The study of Optaflexx use was not specifically focused on animal mortality, the researchers noted. Observational studies collect data on events observed in the field, as compared to randomized clinical trials, which use control groups to study the effects of a drug and are generally regarded as more rigorous.

"We do not believe the data is causally associated," Lilly's Elanco Animal Health unit said in a statement.

One factor that elevated the mortality of the group of cattle fed Optaflexx was the number of times the cattle were fed per day, Elanco said. But after adjustments to the feeding schedules the problem was eliminated, the company said.

Guy Loneragan, an author of the report and a food safety professor at Texas Tech, sits on an advisory board for Elanco, which provided seed funding for the study.

Merck is working to reintroduce Zilmax in the US and Canada, but meat packers and others have been reluctant to resume using it.

Ty Lawrence, an associate professor of animal science at West Texas A&M University and a consultant for Merck, said at an industry meeting in Texas last month [February 2014] that data from controlled studies supported drug company claims that beta-agonists are safe.

Loneragan told Reuters that Merck may not reliably receive Zilmax-related death reports from its customers, who fatten up cattle prior to slaughter, because the feeders may not always recognize that the animals' deaths may be related to Zilmax.

"It's taken a huge amount of observation to start to piece together some of these side effects, or adverse drug events if you will," he said.

[Zilpaterol (Zilmax) and ractopamine (Optaflexx) are both beta-agonists directing the body to be more efficient in its feed conversion and thereby adding more muscle.

Although both drugs are approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), the issue of cattle deaths related to these products is not new. There have been numerous reports of issues of deaths, lameness, and other health effects, but not necessarily a study such as this one.

The controversy over the animal deaths resulted in Merck withdrawing zilpaterol from the market in August 2013. It may or may not be a temporary withdrawal. It is noteworthy that it was a withdrawal, not a recall. In other words, product that was bought prior to the withdrawal remains available for use. Furthermore, if the product is withdrawn then it may be subject to being compounded.

However, there are many markets outside the US that have banned meat with zilpaterol. This may be an incentive for not using the product.

These drugs (zilpaterol, ractopamne, and clenbuterol) are all in the same class (beta-agonists) with similar effects but each has a slightly different mode of action. While zilpaterol, and ractopamine are beta agonists they have not yet been shown to have the human health effects that clenbuterol does.

The drug companies refute the study as being observational but the comment: "only a well-designed clinical study, in a real world setting, coupled with analysis of data by 3rd-party industry experts, can thoroughly confirm the safety profile and performance of a product" seems rather disingenuous. Having a 3rd party analyze results seems reasonable, but to include industry seems like a way of skewing the results.

Both sides of the controversy have good points, none of which will be resolved as of this writing. The controversy, the health effects on the animals, the possible animal welfare issues, and the increase in marketable beef for less forage and water will not likely be resolved anytime soon. We can expect to see more studies this subject. - Mod.TG
