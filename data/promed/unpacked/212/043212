A horse that was illegally imported from Iraq to Iran was confirmed
positive for glanders, according to a 13 Nov 2007 release from the
Office International des Epizooties/World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE).

The disease was found during a routine screening test. The horse --
which did not show clinical signs of the disease -- was euthanized.

Glanders was last reported in Iran in 2001.

The OIE report was submitted by Mojtaba Noorouzi, head of the Iran
Veterinary Organization.

Glanders is caused by the bacteria _Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) mallei_.

The contagious disease is characterized by nodules, abscesses, and
ulcers in the respiratory tract and skin. Affected horses can die
within a few days.

According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, Glanders is one of the
oldest diseases known. It used to be prevalent worldwide. Glanders is
considered a foreign animal disease in the United States. The disease
has been eradicated from many countries, including the United States,
Canada, and Western Europe.

It is transmissible to people and is often fatal.

[This is a belated publication: according to the official
notification of Iran to the OIE, submitted on 13 Nov 2007, the case
had been confirmed on 27 Sep 2007, when the affected horse was
detected during screening tests carried out in a horse racing club in
Sanandaj city, Kordestan. The brown male horse had been illegally
imported from Iraq; it was the only horse found positive, among the
36 on which the mallein test was applied. Subsequently, it was
destroyed. The OIE report, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6455>.


The mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for
glanders. Mallein, a protein fraction of the organism, is injected
intradermo-palpebrally or given by eye-drop. In infected animals, the
eyelid swells markedly in 1-2 days.

It could have been useful to confirm the diagnosis by laboratory
tests; OIE's Manual mentions complement fixation test (CFT) and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). - Mod.AS]
