Update on respiratory illness among passengers on the Fair Princess cruise
that left Sydney on 28 Aug 2000
--------------------------------
This is a summary of NSW Health's investigation of the outbreak of flu-like
illness on the Fair Princess in early September 2000. Available evidence
indicates that the cause of the outbreak was likely to be influenza.
On Thursday 7 Sep 2000, NSW Health received a report from P&O that a
person from the Fair Princess cruise ship had been diagnosed with
Legionnaires disease. The ship had left Sydney for a routine cruise on 28
Aug 2000 bound for Noumea and other islands. Five people had been taken
off the ship with illness in Noumea. One of the patients subsequently died.
Two others were diagnosed by doctors in Noumea with Legionnaires disease.
The ship was due to arrive back in Sydney on Saturday 9 Sep 2000.
NSW Health immediately assembled a team to investigate this problem. We
asked the doctors in Noumea to send additional specimens to Sydney for
further testing. In the meantime, NSW Health provided information for the
ship's passengers and crew, and organised for a team of 5 experts in
epidemiology (including 2 doctors) and environmental health to meet the
ship 10 hours before it docked in Sydney. (The ship docked at 3:30 am on
Sunday 10 Sep 2000.)
The team undertook an investigation on board the ship that included a
review of medical records, and a study of some 50 passengers who had
attended the ship's clinic because of flu-like illness and a study of 50
other passengers and 50 crew members as comparison groups. Throat, urine
and blood samples were collected from most of these passengers. The team
also evaluated any environmental risks on board. Interviews with passengers
and crew indicate that there was a peak in onset of illness about 2-3 days
into the cruise from Sydney.
When the ship disembarked in Sydney, 7 passengers were taken to
hospital, some of whom had chest infections. All have since been
discharged. Subsequently, we have had reports that 8 other passengers
with chest infections were admitted to hospital. One of these has died (of
heart disease), 6 others have been discharged and one remains in hospital.
The investigation by NSW Health is continuing. The environmental evaluation
of the ship found no likely source of Legionnaires disease. All water
samples taken on board the ship have been negative for the bacteria that
causes Legionnaires disease. As an added precaution, the ship's water
supply was disinfected.
So far no person who was on the ship has tested positive for Legionnaires
disease from our tests. However, a significant number of passengers and
some crew have tested positive for influenza virus. Further tests are being
undertaken in the 2 persons initially thought to have Legionnaires
disease. Due to the nature of these and other tests, results are unlikely
to be finalised for some weeks.
The evidence indicates that Legionnaires disease is not the cause of the
outbreak of illness among the passengers. The most likely explanation is
influenza (the flu) brought onto the ship by people boarding in Sydney.
Influenza is caused by a virus that is easily passed from person-to-person
(rather than from the environment) by coughing and sneezing. Older persons,
and people with other underlying medical conditions (especially of the
chest or heart or immune system) are at increased risk of severe
complications such as pneumonia or heart failure if they catch influenza.
There was a high proportion of these people on the ship. Influenza has been
common in many parts of Australia in August and September.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. McAnulty for his rapid response to our
RFI on the above mentioned outbreak. Additional newswires had carried the
title of a legionnaire's disease outbreak as he stated in this very
comprehensive report. In addition there had been extensive newswire
coverage of concerns re: influenza activity during the Olympics for the 2
weeks preceding the onset. As Dr. McAnulty has pointed out in his report,
August and September have been months with significant influenza activity
noted in Australia. Unless there are additional findings different from
those mentioned above, this thread is now closed. - Mod.MPP
