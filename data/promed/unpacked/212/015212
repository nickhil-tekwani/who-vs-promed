Re: PRO/IN, RABIES (16): ASIA (QATAR ex NEPAL) HUMAN, SYLVATIC EXPOSURE SUSPECTED

The utmost disturbing issue in this post is not so much the uncertainty regarding the species of the exposing animal but rather the incredible fact, that "he (the patient) was counseled that he was late for vaccination" when seeking for PEP. This is a widespread fatal misconception in medical professionals that should be disposed once and for all: throughout the usually long incubation period of rabies it is NEVER too late for a successful PEP unless the patient shows symptoms of the disease or, more precisely, unless the virus has gained entrance to the peripheral nervous system. These time points are very close anyway, i.e. few days apart from each other at most. Another crux of the matter is the total lack of any possible exposure diagnosis during the incubation period (call it eclipse!), which leads to hazardous loss of time before initiation of PEP. These crucial points of rabies as a truly indecent infectious disease cannot be overemphasized and should be brought to the knowledge of any single medical professional in the context of rabies as a neglected disease.

[Prof. Zanoni's grave concerns deserve being brought to the attention of all those involved or potentially involved in rabies PEP, be it in Nepal or elsewhere. Even a single case is one too many; human death from rabies is fully preventable.

Subscribers are reminded that the patient, from Nepal's Nuwakot district (map at http://tinyurl.com/y3v8ghoe), reportedly went to a "nearby medical shop" 3 days after being bitten by a wild animal (considered, at the time, to be a raccoon) "for antirabies vaccine and counseling". He returned home untreated since being regarded as "late for vaccination". This advice was, apparently given in spite the fact that according to WHO's criteria the case was clearly "Category III", which means it is "carrying a risk of developing rabies". According to WHO, this risk is increased even more, if:

"1. the biting mammal is a known rabies reservoir or vector species;
2. the exposure occurs in a geographical area where rabies is still present;
3. the animal looks sick or displays abnormal behavior;
4. a wound or mucous membrane was contaminated by the animal's saliva;
5. the bite was unprovoked;
6. the animal has not been vaccinated".
(See "Recommended PEP" at https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies).

Remaining untreated, the victim died about 6 months later, in Qatar, where the case is still to be officially confirmed as rabies.

While Nepal has officially reported at least 10 human rabies cases for each of the recent years (OIE data), no locally acquired rabies case in the local human population of the entire Arab Peninsula (including Qatar) have been reported for at least 15 years.

An earlier case of highly suspected rabies, involving a foreigner who was hospitalized in the same Hamad General Hospital, Qatar and died there, was described in a recent paper. The patient, a 26 year old Indian, had a history of an unprovoked bite by a dog one month earlier, in India. Reportedly, the dog had also bitten several others, appeared frantic and died within a few days. The patient had decided not to undergo treatment due to the long waiting period at a nearby hospital.
