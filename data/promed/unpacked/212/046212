[C] Update 36 - Situation in Singapore and China 22 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_22/en/>
Singapore
Singaporean officials closed a large wholesale fruit and vegetable market
on Sunday following detection of a small cluster of 3 cases linked to the
market. To date, 8 probable and 14 suspect SARS cases have been linked to
the market.
The first case in the cluster, a 64 year old worker at the market, died on
12 Apr 2003. His illness has been linked to a 31 Mar 2003 visit to a
relative in hospital at Singapore General Hospital. Other probable cases in
this cluster include 2 other workers at the market, a taxi driver who
carried the first patient from his home to the market, and 4 relatives,
including 3 grandchildren of market workers.
Rigorous contact tracing has linked all 14 suspected SARS cases, associated
with the market, to workers, visitors, and family members.
In an effort to contain the outbreak, health authorities have issued some
1200 home quarantine orders. Visitors to the market during the period of 5
to 19 Apr 2003 have been urged to watch for symptoms and call a hotline for
immediate medical assistance should symptoms arise.
Data available to WHO indicate that early diagnosis and prompt supportive
care improve clinical prognosis. As of today, Singapore has reported 186
probable SARS cases, with 16 deaths. Tracing and follow up of contacts and
isolation of patients in designated wards of a single SARS hospital have
been key features of the government's response to SARS.
China
Chinese authorities have now reported a cumulative total of 2001 SARS
cases, with 92 deaths. Of the 482 cases reported in Beijing, 78 are said to
be health care workers. In the first reports of atypical pneumonia in China
submitted in mid-February [2003], about 30 per cent of cases were said to
be among health care workers.
Recent reports indicate that SARS has now spread to some of China's poorest
provinces, including western Guangxi, northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia.
Chinese authorities have announced plans to send SARS prevention teams to
Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan, and Ningxia, where cases have also been
recently reported, as well as to Guangdong.
A WHO team is in Shanghai investigating the extent of the SARS outbreak in
the country's largest city. Officials from Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
Macau will meet tomorrow in Beijing to coordinate policies for responding
to SARS. The meeting underscores the international dimensions of the SARS
outbreak, which is increasingly being viewed as a problem beyond the
control of any single government acting alone.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3947 probable cases with 228 deaths have
been reported to WHO from 25 countries. The 11 new deaths were reported in
China (6) and Hong Kong SAR (5).

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 22 Apr 2003 (issued jointly by the
Department of Health and the Hospital Authority)
As of 1 PM 22 Apr 2003, there are an additional 32 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 10 health care workers (3 from United Christian Hospital, 2
from Prince of Wales Hospital, 2 from Tai Po Hospital, one from Princess
Margaret Hospital, one from Yan Chai Hospital, and one from Tuen Mun
Hospital). The remaining 22 are other patients and contacts of patients
with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 461 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 25 were discharged today.
109 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care units.
5 patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH), Prince of
Wales Hospital (PWH), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH), and Princess Margaret
Hospital (PMH). This brought to 99 the total number of deaths relating to
atypical pneumonia. The 5 deceased, aged from 66 to 88, include 4 men who
have a history of chronic disease and an elderly woman.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths *
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 331 / 122 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1103 / 339 / ?
Total: 1434 / 461 / 99
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.

SARS situation update 22 Apr 2003
---------------------------------
As of 22 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 110.
60 SARS patients remain in hospital; 19 are in intensive care.
SARS Cases
Two more SARS cases have been reported today. One is the 41 year old
daughter of the 72 year old man who was admitted as a suspected SARS case
on 19 Apr 2003 and who works in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market. The
other case is a 39 year old inpatient of Singapore General Hospital (SGH)
ward 57.
Update on Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM)
To date 8 probable SARS cases have been linked to the Pasir Panjang
Wholesale Market:
Patient 1: 64 year old man who works at the PPWM. He had visited his
brother at SGH Ward 58 on 31 Mar 2003. He became unwell on 5 Apr 2003, was
admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH) on 8 Apr 2003 and died
at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) on 12 Apr 2003 [index case from PPWM
related to SGH cluster/transmission? - Mod.MPP].
Patient 2: 54 year old taxi driver who ferried patient 1 from his home to
PPWM on 5 Apr 2003. He became unwell on 14 Apr 2003 and was admitted to
TTSH on 18 Apr 2003.
Patient 3: 45 year old man who works at PPWM. He became unwell on 8 Apr
2003 and was admitted to TTSH on 16 Apr 2003.
Patient 4: 45 year old who works at PPWM. He became unwell on 20 Apr 2003
and was admitted on 21 Apr 2003.
Patients 5-7: The 3 grandchildren (aged 4, 8, and 9 years) of a 72 year old
man who was admitted as a suspect SARS case on 19 Apr 03 and who works at
the PPWM. The 3 children became unwell on 15 and 16 Apr 2003 and were
admitted to TTSH on 19 Apr 2003.
Patient 8: 41 year old daughter of a 72 year old man who was admitted as a
suspect SARS case on 19 April 03 and who works at the PPWM.
Cases 2 to 7 are in a stable condition; patient 1 who died on 12 Apr 2003.
In addition to the 8 probable cases, 14 suspected SARS cases linked to the
market have been admitted: 8 people with direct links to the PPWM (3
workers and 5 visitors) and 6 of their family members. Among the family
members are 2 children, aged 18 months and 10 years, respectively. So far,
1204 home quarantine orders have been issued.
Kandang Kerbau Hospital Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH): a 16 month
old toddler admitted to KKH for severe asthma died on Tuesday, 15 Apr 2003.
The child died from severe asthma and lung infection, leading to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Postmortem findings confirm that this
child died from ARDS. To date, tests for coronavirus are negative. A
specimen taken from the child's airway showed the presence of adenovirus.
Siblings of the toddler were admitted to TTSH for observation. A child who
shared a cubicle with toddler at KKH was admitted to TTSH for observation
of pneumonia. All 3 children have been discharged well from TTSH. The older
sibling of the toddler was also found to have adenovirus.
Adenovirus is not a new virus, but neither is it a common respiratory
virus. It is one of several causes of community-acquired pneumonia. People
infected with adenovirus usually have symptoms such as cough, high fever,
and red eyes. ARDS is also not new. KKH sees about 6 cases a year. The
usual causes of ARDS include viral infection, severe pneumonia, near
drowning, and aspiration pneumonia (choking). The mortality rate for ARDS
is up to 80 per cent.
Summary of SARS cases
Discharged: 110
Hospitalised: 60 (including 19 in intensive care)
Deaths: 14 + 2 (pending postmortem findings)
Total: 186
Suspected: 87 (including 5 children under 18 years)
Under home quarantine: 1798
[The identification of adenovirus infection in the infant death related to
ARDS serves as a reminder that other causes of ARDS continue to occur
during the current outbreak of SARS. This also serves as a reminder that
SARS is still a diagnosis of exclusion, after other etiologies have been
ruled out. We still do not have laboratory diagnostic tests to confirm
SARS. - Mod.MPP]

Taiwan SARS update(22 Apr 2003)
-------------------------------
Premier Yu announced yesterday that beginning on 23 Apr 2003, all
passengers will be required to have their temperature checked before
departure. He reminds the public to follow the precautionary measures to
protect themselves and others from SARS infection.
[The] Department of Health, Hong Kong announced that a flight attendant who
had been on duty for the flight CX714 from Singapore to Hong Kong was
identified as a probable case of SARS. Taiwan CDC urges those who were on
the same flight to contact their local health authorities for further
evaluation.
As of 9:00 AM 22 Apr 2003, there were 196 possible SARS cases reported: 28
probable, 46 suspected, 87 excluded, and 35 pending. In accordance with WHO
guidelines, 20 of the 28 probable cases and 31 of the 46 suspected cases
have been discharged to home quarantine, while the remaining 8 probable
cases and 15 suspected cases are still being cared for in negative pressure
rooms. A total of 103 possible SARS cases have been discharged from hospitals.
Since the Taiwan SARS Advisory Committee meeting is re-scheduled to be 3
times per week, it is anticipated that the update information may be
released at the same frequency.
As of 21 Apr 2003, a total of 1909 close contacts of probable SARS cases
had been given home quarantine notifications; 1579 of them have completed
their quarantines [330 are still under quarantine - Mod.MPP].
On 21 Apr 2003, 7 passengers at CKS International Airport [Taiwan
International Airport] had fever, but they were not required [to undergo]
further evaluation. A total of 27 passengers had fever since 10 Apr 2003,
and 5 of them were reported as possible cases: 2 suspected, 2 pending, and
1 excluded.

Canadian SARS update 21 Apr 2003 5:00 PM
----------------------------------------
As of 21 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 316 probable or
suspect cases of SARS in Canada, with 14 deaths. To date, transmission has
been limited to specific transmission settings such as households,
hospitals, and specific community settings. The details of the cases to
date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 135 probable and 124 suspect cases.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 41 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 129 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases. These numbers
are accurate as of 1:00 pm. Eastern Daylight Saving Time, 21 Apr 2003. For
specific information on the provincial numbers, please contact the
appropriate provincial health department.
The World Health Organization has concluded that the coronavirus is the
cause of SARS. Health Canada's data are still unable to allow us to come to
that conclusion; however, national and international laboratory testing and
collaboration are ongoing.
[CDC added an interim travel advisory to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to the
website on 21 Apr 2003, which can be read at

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Karami for this additional background information.
As Mod. CP pointed out on 21 April (in SARS - worldwide (61): cases
20030421.0977), the route of transmission of a virus will affect the
duration of survival of infectious material in the environment, and in the
case of the SARS virus, there may well be more than one route of
transmission. The SARS virus is not closely related to the 2
well-characterized human coronaviruses, which differ in stability. The SARS
virus may well differ from both of them. - Mod.MPP]

[A] China from the NY Times 22 Apr 2003
<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/22/international/asia/22CND-SARS.html>
Reported cases in Beijing of the dangerous new respiratory disease have
increased sharply again in the past 2 days, climbing by 249 to 588, as the
government has continued its belated campaign to provide honest figures and
earn public trust. The number of confirmed cases in Beijing as of 8 PM on
Monday rose to 588, including 28 deaths, according to the New China News
Agency in a dispatch on Monday afternoon.
The sudden increase in official figures did not reflect a major surge in
illness, but the confirmation of suspected cases "after further
examination," the agency reported. [There were reports of 402 suspected
cases in the first report from China, with increased case numbers from
Beijing -- see ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (60): cases
20030420.0972 - Mod.MPP] The number of patients in the city labeled as
suspect cases, meanwhile, rose to more than 600 due to "improved
surveillance and reporting efforts," the news agency said.
The national total of diagnosed SARS cases -- as of 9:20 PM on Monday,
according to another report by the official news agency -- was 2158, with
another 918 suspect cases. 97 patients had died. Apart from Guangdong and
Beijing, a few cases have now been reported in each of 14 other provinces
or municipalities.
[B] India from the International Herald Tribune 22 Apr 2003
<http://www.iht.com/articles/94037.html>
In India, a bride infected with SARS, who insisted on celebrating her
wedding against the advice of doctors, may have infected guests along with
the groom and the priest, health officials in the state of Maharashtra
said. That the Indian wedding took place with a SARS infected bride showed
how ill-prepared the country remains for combatting the disease, said
Sanjeev Malik, secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association.
Following the ceremony at a Methodist Church in Pune, about 160 kilometers
(100 miles) southeast of Bombay, the bride was immediately sent to join her
mother and brother in a hospital isolation unit while health officials
quarantined 25 members of the wedding party. The bride and her mother had
tested positive for the disease after coming in contact with the bride's
brother, the second confirmed case of SARS in India. He had traveled for
the wedding from Jakarta via Singapore, health officials said.

[Today's worldwide update from WHO gives a cumulative total of 3947
probable cases with 228 deaths, reported from 25 countries. Noteworthy is
the mention/discussion of multilateral meetings between health officials
from Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau scheduled for 23 Apr 2003 in
Beijing to coordinate policies for responding to SARS. Taking into account
prior political impediments, such a meeting is a sign of the seriousness of
the countries in the region towards developing a coordinated effort for
disease control measures.
The lay press have been covering the apparent increases in case fatality
rates observed during the course of this outbreak. Some have commented on
how unusual this is, as the usual situation is a decrease in the case
fatality rate as increasing numbers of cases are reported, including milder
clinical presentations. The Health Canada data presented in [5] above are
worth a comment. With 14 deaths reported, the case fatality rate is 4.4 per
cent if one uses all suspected and probable cases reported as the
denominator (316); but is 10.1 per cent if one uses only probable cases
reported (129) as the denominator. A key distinction between a suspected
case and a probable case is the presence of pneumonia on chest radiograph
in the definition of a probable case. This factor alone makes the
denominator of probable cases likely to be those with a more serious
clinical presentation, and eliminates potential milder clinical
presentations from the "pool of cases" used as the denominator for the
calculation of the case fatality rate.
Keeping this in mind, until we are able to confirm cases of SARS with
certainty -- and until we are able to confirm milder clinical presentations
as due to the same etiologic agent as the one responsible for the more
severe cases of pneumonia that meet the clinical and epidemiological
criteria for probable case of SARS -- we may continue to show apparently
higher case fatality rates. Another point to keep in mind is that at
present, the denominators in use are "all cases", not just cases whose
final outcomes are known; hence the denominator contains many cases whose
final outcomes are unknown. The proportions of these cases who will recover
or die is presently unknown -- another caution in current interpretations
of reported case fatality rates.
In the news briefs section, the numbers of reported cases in China is
greater than the number contained in today's WHO update, which probably
reflects reporting after official reports were sent to WHO for 22 Apr 2003
(one of the challenges in presenting "real-time data" when dealing with a
worldwide outbreak involving all time zones of the world - (see [7][A]).
The last sentence mentions cases reported from 14 provinces within China.
Given the size of the country and its population, it would be of interest
to see regular official reports giving disease occurrence by province where
cases have been reported/identified. To date, we do have information that
cases have been occurring in the north and the west of the country, in
provinces that border other countries where cases have not as yet been
reported.
Additional information on the reported cases from India in the news briefs
suggests local transmission, as the newer cases had close contact with
another suspected case with a history of travel through Singapore. None of
these additional cases in India (3) has been reported to WHO as probable
cases in today's update. - Mod.MPP]
