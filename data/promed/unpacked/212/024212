[1] Long COVID and nerve damage

A retrospective study of 17 COVID-19 survivors with lingering symptoms reveals that 10 (59%) had nerve damage, which the researchers said could have been triggered by potentially treatable infection-related immune dysfunction.

In the study, published yesterday [Tue 2 Mar 2022] in Neurology: Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) researchers analyzed data from long COVID patients with no history of neuropathy or risks of neuropathy who were referred for evaluation of peripheral neuropathy, meaning nerve damage not involving the brain or spinal cord.

Patients were from 10 states and territories, and all but one had mild infections. The study period was [21 Feb 2020 to 19 Jan 2021], and participants were tracked for, on average, 1.4 years. Average participant age was 43.3 years, 69% were female, 94% were White, and 19% were Latino.

Ten had at least one test confirming neuropathy, including 63% of skin biopsies, 17% of electrodiagnostic tests, and 50% of autonomic function tests. The critically ill patient was diagnosed as having axonal neuropathy, while another had multifocal demyelinating neuropathy 3 weeks after mild illness, and more than 10 had small-fiber neuropathy (SFN). Common neuropathy symptoms were weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the hands and feet, and many patients reported fatigue.

A total of 35% percent of patients were given corticosteroids or intravenous immune globulins. The 5 patients who received immunoglobulin G appeared to derive a benefit. Over time, 52% of participants improved, but none experienced total resolution.

"This report strengthens evidence linking several idiopathic multisymptom conditions--including SFN and fibromyalgia--with dysimmunity, sometimes incident to infections or vaccinations," the study authors wrote.

While rigorous clinical trials evaluating specific post-COVID neuropathy treatments haven't been conducted, lead author Mary Louise Oaklander, MD, PhD, said in an MGH press release that COVID survivors with lingering nerve-related symptoms might want to see their primary care physician, neurologist, or neuromuscular specialist. "Research from our team and others is clarifying what the different types of post-COVID neuropathy are, and how best to diagnose and treat them," she said. "Some patients seem to improve from standard treatments for other immune-related neuropathies."

[2] In hospital cardiac arrest: outcome

Adult COVID-19 patients who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) were 35% less likely to receive potentially life-saving defibrillation without delay and survive to hospital release, according to a study today in JAMA Network Open.

University of Iowa at Iowa City researchers led the study of 24 915 patients with IHCA from 286 US hospitals, of whom 5916 (23.7%) had COVID-19, from March to December 2020.

The research team analyzed data from the American Heart Association's Get With the Guidelines Registry (GWTG-R), which compiles information on patients who have IHCA at participating US hospitals. Among the 24 915 patients with IHCA, average age was 64.7â€‰years, 39.5% were women, 24.8% were Black, 61.1% were White, 3.8% were of other races, and 10.3% were of unknown race.

The 5916 COVID-19 patients were younger and more often men and of Black race; more likely to have an initial nonshockable rhythm, pneumonia, respiratory insufficiency, or sepsis; and be receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to treat low blood pressure at the time of IHCA.

Relative to uninfected patients, those with COVID-19 had lower rates of survival to hospital release after IHCA (11.9% vs 23.5%; adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.65) and return of spontaneous circulation (53.7% vs 63.6%; adjusted RR, 0.86). They were also more likely to experience delays in defibrillation (27.7% vs 36.6%; RR, 1.30) but not epinephrine administration.

The link between COVID-19 and worse survival after IHCA held true for patients with nonsurgical diagnoses, those in an intensive care unit, and those who received timely defibrillation or epinephrine administration. The authors noted that studies from early in the pandemic reported survival rates of less than 3% among COVID-19 patients who had an IHCA. "However, these results were from single-center studies that comprised only 295 patients with COVID-19 in hospitals that were overwhelmed early during the pandemic," the authors wrote.

Noting that roughly 1 in 4 patients who experienced IHCA in the study had COVID-19. "This observation underscores the sizable effect of the pandemic on in-hospital resuscitation," they wrote.

The study findings, the authors said, are relevant to healthcare providers and hospitals amid the continuing pandemic. "Because IHCA survival among patients with COVID-19 in this study was not as poor as reported previously, we believe that COVID-19 infection alone should not be used as a criterion for withholding resuscitation care from hospitalized patients," they wrote.

"As new variants emerge, future studies will be needed to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 infection on IHCA survival."

"The absolute survival rate we observed for US patients with IHCA and COVID-19 (11.9%) was higher than the survival rates reported initially (0%,1 2.9%,2 and 3.0%3), which likely represented the isolated experience of health systems overwhelmed early during the pandemic. Our findings are consistent with those of Hayek et al (12.0% survival in 400 patients with COVID-19 in 68 ICUs) and Mitchell et al (11.9% survival in 260 patients with COVID-19 at 11 hospitals) and extend the previous findings by adding a comparison group of patients without COVID and including non-ICU patients from a larger group of hospitals. We believe that these data will be relevant to health care providers and hospital administrators as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Because IHCA survival among patients with COVID-19 in this study was not as poor as reported previously, we believe that COVID-19 infection alone should not be used as a criterion for withholding resuscitation care from hospitalized patients. ..."

[3] Ivermectin: paper withdrawn
Date: Fri 4 Feb 2022

https://socopen.org/tag/covid-19/


On withdrawing "Ivermectin and the odds of hospitalization due to COVID-19," by Merino et al

... there remains insufficient evidence that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID-19; the study is of minimal scientific value at best; the paper is part of an unethical program by the government of Mexico City to dispense hundreds of thousands of doses of an inappropriate medication to people who were sick with COVID-19, which possibly continues to the present; the authors of the paper have promoted it as evidence that their medical intervention is effective. This review is intended to help the SocArXiv Steering Committee reach a decision on the request to remove the paper (we set aside the question of banning the authors from future submissions, which is reserved for people who repeatedly violate our rules). The statement below followed from this review.

SocArXiv Steering Committee statement on withdrawing the paper by Merino et al. (10.31235/osf.io/r93g4).
This is the first time we have used our prerogative as service administrators to withdraw a paper from SocArXiv. Although we reject many papers, according to our moderation policy, we don't have a policy for unilaterally withdrawing papers after they have been posted. We don't want to make policy around a single case, but we do want to respond to this situation.

We are withdrawing the paper, and replacing it with a "tombstone" that includes the paper's metadata. We are doing this to prevent the paper from causing additional harm, and taking this incident as an impetus to develop a more comprehensive policy for future situations. The metadata will serve as a reference for people who follow citations to the paper to our site.

Our grounds for this decision are several:
1. The paper is spreading misinformation, promoting an unproved medical treatment in the midst of a global pandemic.
2. The paper is part of, and justification for, a government program that unethically dispenses (or did dispense) unproven medication apparently without proper consent or appropriate ethical protections according to the standards of human subjects research.
3. The paper is medical research - purporting to study the effects of a medication on a disease outcome - and is not properly within the subject scope of SocArXiv.
4. The authors did not properly disclose their conflicts of interest.

We appreciate that of the thousands of papers we have accepted and now host on our platform, there may be others that have serious flaws as well.

We are taking this unprecedented action because this particular bad paper appears to be more important, and therefore potentially more harmful, than other flawed work. In administering SocArXiv, we generally err on the side of inclusivity, and do not provide peer review or substantive vetting of the papers we host. Taking such an approach suits us philosophically, and also practically, since we don't have staff to review every paper fully. But this approach comes with the responsibility to respond when something truly harmful gets through. In light of demonstrable harms like those associated with this paper, and in response to a community groundswell beseeching us to act, we are withdrawing this paper. ...-more

[It is recommended to read full report at URL above. Multiple studies have been unable to demonstrate a clear benefit to the patient from ivermectin to treat COVID. Therefore, the drug should not be used as a "treatment or preventative for COVID-19 outside of carefully controlled clinical studies. These are some of those statements, reflecting current guidance as of 3 Feb 2022.
- World Health Organization: "We recommend not to use ivermectin, except in the context of a clinical trial."
- US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: "ivermectin has not been proven as a way to prevent or treat COVID-19."
- US National Institutes of Health: "There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19."
- European Medicines Agency: "use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 cannot currently be recommended outside controlled clinical trials."
- US Food and Drug Administration: "The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19 in humans or animals. ... Currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19."

[4] India: return to normalcy
Date: Wed 2 Mar 2022

Nearly 2 years after India went into the world's biggest lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, students are heading back to school across the vast country - a sign of normal life resuming as infection rates fall. India's daily coronavirus infections rose by less than 10 000 for a 3rd straight day on [Wed 2 Mar 2022], a level last seen in late December [2021] before the rapid spread of the omicron variant, data from the health ministry showed.

Last week, Maharashtra State Minister Aaditya Thackeray said schools in the state's largest city, Mumbai, would resume pre-COVID attendance, reinstating all activities in view of declining cases.

India has fully vaccinated more than 765 million of its 940 million adult population and about 28 million teenagers aged 15 -- 18, but has not started vaccinating children younger than 15.

In Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, markets were back in full swing after a long hiatus.

Patrons streamed in to enjoy dinner and late-night snacks following the lifting of a curfew last week at Ahmedabad's popular Manek Chowk, a market that transforms into a hawker centre after dusk.

Similar signs of life resuming its normal pace abound across the country.

Roads and trains are congested again as people return to offices, movie theatres are reporting a surge in foot traffic, and restaurants and gaming parlours are packed.

["There is hope that people will continue maintaining social distancing and wearing masks as much as possible," said Rijo John, a health economist at the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences in Kochi.

"There is absolutely no reason to keep the economy under any kind of lockdown or restrictions - it is just the behavioral aspect of the people that needs to be observed and enforced as much as possible," he said. (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-years-after-worlds-biggest-lockdown-india-surges-back-normal-life-2022-03-02/)

With the lifting of restrictions in many countries, it will be interesting to see whether cases continue to drop in those locations. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 31 countries including South Korea (198 802), Germany (198 457), Vietnam (151 852), Russia (97 455), USA (72 680), Japan (71 570), France (57 697), Turkey (56 780), Hong Kong (55 353), The Netherlands (48 489), the UK (43 753), Indonesia (40 920), Austria (39 493), Italy (37 946), Australia (35 882), Brazil (30 995), Malaysia (27 500), Switzerland (23 645), Thailand (23 618), New Zealand (23 180), Norway (22 090), Chile (21 819), Denmark (19 357), Singapore (19 159), Spain (18 803), Greece (15 557), Poland (14 733), Slovakia (12 763), Mexico (12 342), Czech Republic (11 663), and Latvia (10 574), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8480 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 28 Feb 2022 to late 1 Mar 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 67 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 67 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 16.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 32.2% decrease in daily reported cases and 5.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.66 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 440.64 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.99 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA
