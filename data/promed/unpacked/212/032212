I thought it would be of interest to point out that the situation of fishermen contaminating oyster beds was documented 20 years ago. See: "Multistate Outbreak of Viral Gastroenteritis Related to Consumption of Oysters - Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Carolina, 1993" (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00023009.htm). In the 1993 investigation, ill fishermen were reported to have been vomiting and having bowel movements over the side of the boats as they harvested oysters.

In a follow-up MMWR report "Viral Gastroenteritis Associated with Eating Oysters - Louisiana, December 1996-January 1997" (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049999.htm), it was reported that in that outbreak, a harvester with a high level of immunoglobulin A to Norwalk virus [the type of norovirus] reported having been ill before the outbreak and admitted to dumping sewage directly into harvest waters. The findings of the investigation of that outbreak suggested that one ill harvester could contaminate large quantities of oysters in a relatively large oyster bed.

While I'm a native of New Orleans, I do not eat raw oysters!

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Dassey for his contribution explaining how the oyster beds may have been contaminated, and is asking for a response to Dr. Simunich's question as to whether norovirus was identified directly in the oysters. - Mod.MPP]
