Authorities have recorded a spate of new outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu [HPAI].

HPAI of the H5N1 subtype was confirmed in commercial poultry at a farm near Redgrave, Suffolk, on Tuesday (1 Mar 2022); in birds at a premises near Elmswell, Suffolk, on Saturday (26 Feb 2022); and at a site near Ledbury, Herefordshire, on Friday (25 Feb 2022).

All birds on the infected premises have been humanely culled and a 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone and 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone put in place around the infected premises, Defra said in an update on the UK's bird flu situation.

The government has confirmed a total of 83 [outbreaks] of HPAI H5N1 avian influenza H5N1 in England alone since the start of the season, in late October 2021.

Last week, Wales recorded cases of HPAI on 2 separate farms in Powys.

The chief veterinary officer for Wales, Professor Christianne Glossop, said the outbreaks were a 'cause for concern.'

"Keepers of birds must be vigilant and ensure they have the very highest levels of biosecurity in place," she said. "I urge everyone to leave no stone unturned. Once again review all the measures in place and identify any areas for improvement."

Defra Secretary George Eustice said in December [2021] that the UK was seeing its worst-ever outbreak of avian influenza.

Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease, leading to cases in poultry and other captive birds.

Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low, and food standards bodies advise that it poses a very low food safety risk for consumers.

[The 1st detection of HPAI H5N1 virus this HPAI season was in rescued wild swans and captive poultry at a swan sanctuary in Worcester (England) on 15 Oct 2021. Since then, there have been, in England alone, 83 further confirmed outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in poultry and captive birds. There have been also sporadic outbreaks in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

For details of all HPAI H5N1 events in UK's poultry and captive birds during the current season, as well as a list of the wild bird species found infected, please refer to DEFRA's guidance at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation.

According to the continuously updated data from EU's reference laboratory for avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, IZSVe), based upon information from 31 European countries (UK not included), the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent. A table including all HPAI-positive events (poultry, captive and wild birds) reported between 8 Oct 2021 and 2 Mar 2022, and a graphic presenting weekly totals is available at https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf. - Mod.AS
