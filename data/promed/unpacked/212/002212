A Sauk County [Wisconsin] horse has tested positive for West Nile virus, the Health Department reported. The test result confirms there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the virus that can transmit it to people and animals.

The Sauk County Health Department announced the test result in a news release late [Fri 1 Sep 2017]. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported the positive test result to the state Division of Public Health.

Humans, horses, birds, and other animals get the virus when bitten by infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not transmitted person to person or directly between animals, or between animals and humans.

In 2002, the state documented its 1st human infections and 52 cases were reported. In 2016, 13 cases of West Nile virus were reported among Wisconsin residents. The state Division of Public Health will continue surveillance for West Nile virus until the end of the mosquito season.

Most people infected with the virus do not have symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1 in 5 people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms. About one out of 150 infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness.

A Dodge County horse tested positive for West Nile virus last week [week of 28 Aug 2017]. Because West Nile virus is circulating, health officials urged Wisconsin residents and visitors to be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites. Anyone suspecting they have an illness stemming from the virus is advised to contact a health care provider.

Health officials reminded horse owners to contact their veterinarians about vaccinating their animals. In addition to vaccination, owners can protect their horses by eliminating standing water and keeping animals inside from dusk to dawn.

The best way to avoid mosquito-borne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate their breeding sites. When cold weather arrives, the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then people are urged to take measures to protect themselves.

The Sauk County Health Department recommends the following steps:
- limit time spent outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active;
- apply an Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellant to clothing as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes may bite through clothing;
- make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry;
- properly dispose of items that hold water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires;
- clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage;
- turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use;
- change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every three days;
- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.
- trim tall grass, weeds and vines -- mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours;
- landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas.

A dead bird was already reported to the Sauk County Health Department on [2 Jun 2017]. Further reporting of dead birds in Sauk County is not necessary. To report a sick or dead crow, blue jay or raven, call 800-433-1610.

The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office has announced that a horse from Metcalfe County has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 6th equine WNV case confirmed in the commonwealth this year [2017].

In a 9 Sep 2017 statement Kentucky Equine Programs manager ES "Rusty" Ford said the case was confirmed 8 Sep 2017.

Ford said the 13-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse gelding began exhibiting signs of disease on [2 Sep 2017], including a head tilt, front-limb proprioceptive (a horse's awareness of where his feet are) deficits, and some ataxia (incoordination). On [8 Sep 2017], the attending veterinarian said the horse was stable with some motor improvement noted. The horse has no WNV vaccination history, Ford said.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening), using fans to disrupt mosquitoes' flight patterns, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

Rains, flooding, and mosquitoes will contribute to arboviral disease. Hurricanes may blow mosquitoes over long distances. It is advisable for all horse owners to revaccinate their animals against West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis. The vaccines for these diseases are combined in one vaccine, but for the vaccine to work, the animal must be vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
