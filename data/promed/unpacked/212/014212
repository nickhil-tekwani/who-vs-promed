Just 10 weeks after the first case of cholera was confirmed in
Luanda, some 20 000 people have been infected, around 900 people have
died, and the disease has spread throughout most of the country.
Tue, 25 Apr 2006, saw the highest daily toll to date, with 929 new
cases and 25 deaths. Yet measures put in place for halting the
outbreak remain grossly insufficient. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
urges the Angolan government and international relief organisations
to increase their efforts for stemming the epidemic.?
This week, MSF saw an average of 30 newly infected people and 1 death
every hour. In one of MSF's treatment centers in Luanda alone, 240
new patients came in over a 24-hour period. The team quickly erected
2 new tents to expand the capacity of the already overcrowded facility.
The majority of cases of cholera are usually detected after an
outbreak has peaked (the peak being the period in which the number of
new cases per day is highest). "Today we have not yet reached the
peak of this epidemic. Even based on conservative estimates, the toll
of this epidemic will be extremely high," says Veerman.
MSF has 10 cholera treatment centers in Angola: 6 in Luanda, one in
Benguela, one in Malanje, one in 'Ndalatando, and one in Caxito. The
organization has 55 international staff and 330 national staff
working on its cholera projects. To date 11 700 have been treated in
MSF's centers.

So far 3 residents of Maracha County in Arua, Uganda have reportedly
died of cholera, 2 weeks after the epidemic was first registered in
the locality.
The Daily Monitor has learnt that the abdominal infection has caused
64 people to be admitted to Ovujjo Health Centre III, which has been
evacuated to make room for victims of the contagious disease. Some
of the patients are said to be in a critical state. Specimen test
results from the Entebbe-based Uganda Virus Research Institute show
that the type of cholera that has so far ravaged 6 parishes in 4
different sub-counties of Maracha County is the Inaba variety.

A recent outbreak of cholera near the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde
has killed at least 10 people, Cameroonian health authorities said on
Fri, 21 Apr 2006. Since the latest resurgence of the disease in
Bafoussam, 300 km northwest of Yaounde several weeks ago, more than
50 people had contracted the disease, suffering from vomiting and
diarrhea, health officials said.
The beginning of the year as well as Apr and May are the rainy
seasons in the West African country, during which cholera is most active.
In Feb 2006, an outbreak of cholera in Akonolinga, 40 km east of
Yaounde, claimed 8 lives. In the 15 months between Jan 2004 and Apr
2006, up to 8500 people nationwide contracted the disease, with 174
of them dead.

[13] Diarrhea, fatal - Indonesia (Irian Jaya)

Health workers are treating hundreds of villagers in Papua(Irian
Jaya)'s Jayawijaya regency to prevent the further spread of an
outbreak of a diarrheal disease that has claimed 100 lives since it
was declared an outbreak [in March 2006].
In Wamena Hospital alone, 2 more people died late Mon, 24 Apr 2006,
bringing the total number of deaths in the hospital since the
outbreak on 16 Mar 2006 to 10. Meanwhile, Jayawijaya Regency Health
Office put the number of fatalities in the villages at 90 people in a
report Tue, 25 Apr 2006. The outbreak has affected the regency's 5
districts -- Assologaima, Hubi Kosi, Kurulu, Musatfat and Wamena --
but it is feared to have spread to other regencies, such as Yahukimo
and Tolikara.
"The number of victims who died in the hospital and those reported in
remote villages, has risen to 100," said head of Jayawijaya's Health
Office, Perry Jigibalom, who earlier put the number of fatalities at 58.
In Assologaima district, where the number of people who have died of
the diarrheal disease has reached 26, 4 health workers from the
district's community health center started the mass treatment Mon, 24
Apr 2006, with 639 people treated on the first day. Treatment
continued until all of the village's 1200 residents were treated.
The 4 health workers treated each resident coming to the health post
in Muliama village office Tue, 25 Apr 2006. "Some of the residents
were suffering from diarrhea but there were those who were given
medicine as a preventive measure," said nurse Regina Tabuni. The
residents were given a tetracycline injection and provided with other
drugs, including penicillin.
The outbreak reportedly started after residents consumed contaminated
pork during a ceremony [during March 2006] in Abusa village in Kurulu
district, where hundreds of pigs had died of cholera earlier [see
below - Mod.LL]. The meat was reportedly diseased and undercooked.
Government health officials, however, have not named the
disease. Many other residents attending the ceremony were from
different districts, thus spreading the outbreak.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Jeremijenko for this submission. The severity of
the illness suggests cholera and, in the next post, this is
revealed. It is important to note that hog cholera is not the same
infection as that caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ in man. The preferred
term for hog cholera is classical swine fever, but it also been
referred to as peste du porc, colera porcina, and virusschweinepest.
Classical swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease of swine
that occurs in an acute, subacute, chronic, or persistent form. In
the acute form, the disease is characterized by high fever, severe
depression, multiple superficial and internal hemorrhages, and high
morbidity and mortality. In the chronic form, the signs of
depression, anorexia, and fever are less severe than in the acute
form, and recovery is occasionally seen in mature animals.

Test results on victims of an acute diarrheal disease in Papua's
Jayawijaya regency have confirmed that the disease, which has spread
to 2 districts in nearby Yahukimo regency, was cholera.
According to Berry Wopari of the Papua Health Office, who was
assigned to assist Jayawijaya regency in dealing with the outbreak,
cholera has killed 178 Jayawijaya residents alone since it was
declared an outbreak on 16 Mar 2006. It was previously reported as a
diarrheal disease before laboratory tests confirmed it was cholera.
In the nearby Yahukimo regency, another 33 residents had died of the disease.
Berry said the latest figure in Jayawijaya, which put the number of
fatalities at 126 on Wed, 26 Apr 2006, was based on the latest report
coming in from health posts set up across the regency. He said
laboratory tests on stool specimens conducted by the health agency's
laboratory in Surabaya early this month confirmed that the disease
was caused by the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacillus. He said the bacteria
spread through people-to-people contact and would further spread due
to poor sanitation.
The disease has reportedly spread to nearby Yahukimo regency. The
regency health office head Jacobus Mario told The Jakarta Post the
disease has killed 33 residents in Kurima and Mugi districts since 7 Apr 2006.
