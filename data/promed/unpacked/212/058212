Tree cutters are fighting a last-ditch battle to contain a Miami-area
outbreak of citrus canker before it spreads to prime central Florida
groves, threatening the state's $8.5 billion citrus industry.
State agriculture officials expanded a quarantine zone this week in order
to erect a "fire wall" north of Fort Lauderdale against the disease caused
by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. citri, now endangering many
of south Florida's three million citrus trees in commercial groves, and
backyard orange and grapefruit trees. Central Florida became the state's
major citrus region as the industry, shaken by deep freezes that damaged
northern Florida trees in the late 80s and early 90s, moved south.
"There is a fear in our industry that if the spread is not checked it could
potentially wipe out our industry," said Wendy Bourland, spokeswoman for
the 12 000-member Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers
association. Citrus canker is a threat to all citrus, in a yard or in a
grove; infected or suspect trees have to be burned or "no one will have
citrus", she said.
Citrus canker, a well-known scourge that first appeared in Florida 90 years
ago, disfigures citrus fruit and weakens trees, causing them to drop fruit
prematurely and leaving them susceptible to other diseases. Canker can
infect grapefruit, oranges, tangelos, pomelos, limes, lemons, tangerines
and other citrus fruits. Oranges and grapefruits are Florida's major citrus
crops, with 90 percent of production used for juice.
The only way to stop spread of the disease, experts say, is to eradicate
diseased trees. Eradication programs are controversial in Florida, where
homeowners have great affection for backyard fruit trees. Citrus is
Florida's second-leading business, surpassed only by tourism.
The latest outbreak of canker in the Miami area, which originated in 1995
near Miami International Airport, has already claimed some 200 000
backyard trees and more than 300 000 in commercial groves, agriculture
officials said.
For years, inspectors thought the outbreak was contained to south
Miami-Dade County groves, only to find recently that it had spread north
into neighboring Broward County. About 795 square miles (2059 sq km) of
Miami-Dade and Broward counties were now under quarantine, preventing the
transport of fruit, trees or plant material out of the affected areas,
state officials said. Officials said that hurricanes Floyd and Irene last
year may have enhanced spread of the pathogen.
About 750 pathologists, surveyors and tree cutters were attacking the
disease, concentrating on new outbreaks in the Broward towns of Coral
Springs and Margate. They hoped to erect a barrier at the Broward-Palm
Beach County line to keep canker out of rich citrus production regions of
Palm Beach County and north into the large production areas in Martin, St.
Lucie, and Indian River, according to Mark Fagan, spokesman for the Florida
Department of Agriculture's Citrus Eradication Program. The task is labor
intensive. Every tree must be cut down, chipped or sawn into logs and
hauled to an incinerator. Leaves and sawdust must be raked up and burned.
So great is the threat, cutters attacking the outbreaks in Broward will use
a new and controversial guideline. Every citrus tree within 1900 feet (579
metres) of an infected tree will be cut down, even apparently healthy ones,
to help stop the spread.
If the method proves effective, it may be used across south Florida.

[The fact that all citrus trees within 579 m of an infected tree must be
eradicated is startling testimony to the need to prevent spread of the
pathogen. It's also important to monitor areas from which trees have been
eradicated for the presence of citrus sprouts and seedlings. - Mod.DH
