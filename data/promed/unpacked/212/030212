YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (11)
=========================
I have finally given in to the temptation to join this debate.
It seems surprising to me that nobody has realised that yellow
fever virus is in Asia - and elsewhere! It has simply changed its
names and its coats! This is known as EVOLUTION.
The new names are dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Kunjin, West Nile,
Murray Valley etc. Take a look at Virology vol 206, 1133-1139 and
Proc Nat Acad Sci vol 93 548-553. Yellow fever is the ancestral
virus of these viruses. They are far more able to stabilise in the
conditions imposed in Asia for example, many of these viruses have
adapted to birds for their spread (not a characteristic of yellow
fever as far as we know) and others have chosen humans (ie the
dengue viruses seem to be able to perpetuate without the need for
a wildlife reservoir).
In the case of yellow fever in the Americas, this was presumably a
significant input into a naive population (wildlife and human) but
note that St Louis encephalitis virus and many other closely
related viruses also made it to the Americas (not the other way
round -and not evolved from American yellow fever - see the trees
in the cited papers). St Louis encephalitis virus is so close
(genetically) to Japanese encephalitis virus and the others in this
complex, that they must have evolved from a common ancestor, i.e.,
yellow fever in Africa.
Another angle to this is that there are still many relatives of
yellow fever in Africa such as Saboya and the bat flaviviruses
which have apparently remained there. Moreover, why don't JE and
many of the other Asian flaviviruses move into Africa in the way
that they are spreading to other parts of the world? It's the same
argument: the right vectors and hosts need to be in the right
place, at the right time.
It probably isn't really necessary to invoke immunity as a barrier
to yellow fever in Asia but if one does, the immunity would need to
be broad spectrum as would be seen in Asians that had been exposed
to several different flaviviruses and probably re-exposed to some
flaviviruses thus broadening their immunity. This would equally
apply to animals.
The fact that a single shot yellow fever vaccine doesn't protect a
human against dengue 3 virus isn't an argument against immunity as
a barrier for yellow fever in Asia. However, I bet that John
Aaskov is now immune to more flaviviruses than he was before his
infection by dengue 3 virus!
See you all in Israel?
