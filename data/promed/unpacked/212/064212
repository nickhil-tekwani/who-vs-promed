Severe bird flu causes several human deaths, officials begin
disease control measures
------------------------------------
Recently, many people died of avian influenza in Qinghai province.
The affected localities reveal that, as of early April 2005, there have
been several deaths of migratory birds. Because of lack of
reporting, the news has not traveled widely. Toward the end of April
2005, cases of human infection started to emerge. After 1 May
2005, some tourists who visited the areas were severely affected,
and 6 of them died.

During the month of April 2005, a large-scale dissemination of the
infection took place involving both humans and domesticated
animals. The affected area is vast but sparsely populated. Thus,
the problem of large-scale of infection involving both humans and
domesticated animals is relatively unnoticeable. The feral birds
migrate freely and so expand the area of transmission. The
Chinese authorities have admitted the outbreaks and started to seal
off the affected area.

Because of this, Mrs. Yi Wu (Chinese Minister of Health) has cut
short her visit to Japan and returned home. According to the local
news in the affected locality, the number of human casualties is
higher than 6.

The deceased persons are all foreign tourists (i.e. not local
residents): 2 (a man and a woman) from Chengdu, and one man
from Chongqing, Sichuang province. It is unknown from where the
remaining casualties come.

The information was provided by someone who has visited the area
of the outbreaks.
