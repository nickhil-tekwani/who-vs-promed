LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE AND LEGIONELLOSIS (04)
============================================

Regarding person-to-person transmission of _Legionella_, the original 1976
investigation in Pennsylvania included the systematic collection of paired
serum samples from household contacts of cases and controls. No instances
of pneumonia or seroconversion were found in case- or control-contacts who
had not themselves attended the American Legion convention in Philadelphia.
Such evidence does not exclude the possibility of occasional person-to-person
spread but it is good evidence that person-to-person spread is not typical.
