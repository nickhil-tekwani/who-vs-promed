A case of anthrax has been confirmed in the Odessa region in Ukraine, reports RIA News with reference to the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

It is noted that on [3 Aug 2020], a man who buys animals for subsequent resale had a fever, and a boil which then turned into an ulcer appeared on his lower leg. The patient asked for medical help only on [7 Aug 2020]. On [11 Aug 2020], the reference laboratory of the Center for Public Health of Ukraine isolated anthrax DNA by PCR.

The Ministry of Health also stressed that measures are now being taken to prevent the spread of this disease. Doctors monitor contact persons and carry out a full range of anti-epidemic and preventive measures.

The department also clarified that anthrax is not transmitted from person to person. The causative agent of this disease penetrates through mucous membranes or damaged skin. Infection can occur through contact with a sick animal, when eating the meat of a sick animal, and through insect bites.

Earlier it was reported that 8 people were hospitalized with suspected anthrax in Kyrgyzstan.

[This report of a human case of cutaneous anthrax in a cattle dealer carefully does not mention a\where he might have been exposed. That the lesion was on a lower leg is not recorded often -- it is usually on the hands, forearms, and face -- which suggested that the exposure might have been to an infected bovine carcass - since he is a cattle dealer. It will be interesting to see what the field investigation reveals. By the way, anthrax is not contagious; you have to have cutaneous contact with infected blood, eaten under-cooked contaminated meat, and on rare occasions be exposed to a spore aerosol.

But note, they quote the recent outbreak in Kyrgyzstan indicating that they monitor ProMEDmail. - Mod.MHJ]
