Undiagnosed outbreak of febrile illness - Sikkim
----------------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious fever that's stalking Jorethang town, Sikkim, near the
West Bengal border has affected over 1000 people. According to
reports here, the 1st outbreak of this disease, which the medical
fraternity has termed Jorethang Fever, was reported on 15 Aug 2004.
Since then more than 1000 people have been struck by this mysterious
virus, whose origin and identity have baffled the local health
authorities here. According to health officials, the disease [has]
symptoms of high fever and body ache accompanied by repeated vomiting.
Senior health officials from the state government including the state
health minister, Mr Hishey Lachungpa, who visited the affected area
recently, ruled out the possibility of the mysterious fever being
caused by known viral diseases like Dengue or Enteric fever, which
were at first held liable for the outbreak. A statement released by
the health department here stated that blood and other samples
collected from the infected patients have been sent to the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi and that the test
reports are awaited. Health workers and doctors monitoring the crisis
have asked the affected localities to maintain proper hygiene and
cleanliness.
The disease epicentre, which the authorities believe is the Majhigaon
locality of Jorethang, is reporting 200 new infected cases with
similar symptoms daily. The state government has issued detailed
instructions to the district administration to increase medical
facilities in the area. An additional team of doctors has been
dispatched from Gangtok, to monitor and manage the situation.
There has been only one reported death due to the Jorethang Fever.
However, the doctors feel that liver failure was the more likely
cause of death.
Health officials here, speaking to The Statesman correspondent, said
that identification of the cause of the outbreak was pertinent to its
cure, and only after the laboratories deliver a final report would an
effective treatment for the disease be possible.

[The rapid spread of the disease and the very low mortality (if any)
exclude a number of serious infections like Japanese encephalitis and
malaria. Fever, general body pains, and vomiting are unspecific
symptoms but point towards a viral infection. The high number of new
cases daily points to air- or waterborne transmission. The absence of
diarrhoea, if accurate, excludes with a high probability enteric
pathogenic bacteria. The absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms
makes influenza and common cold less likely. Other viruses like
enterovirus and adenovirus could be candidates, but it should be
emphasized that this is just an educated guess, based on very sparse
information. There have been numerous reports over the past few years
of outbreaks of unknown illnesses from India, and further information
on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
