[Since the new policy on alcohol excise taxes was introduced,
production companies have switched from using technical alcohol to
isopropyl alcohol that is 1000 times more poisonous. The 2nd thing
that has contributed to a rise in the epidemic was the prohibition of
imports of Georgian and Ukrainian wines to Russia. - Corr.VM]
