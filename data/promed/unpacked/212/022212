[In the past week, 6 countries have documented poliovirus circulation in their countries, either through acute flaccid paralysis cases with documented poliovirus isolation, or through positive environmental samples -- with indication there are infected individuals in the environmental catchment area. Poliovirus isolates during the past week included 3 wild poliovirus type 1 isolates in environmental samples in Pakistan. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was isolated in AFP cases in Algeria and the DR Congo, and in environmental samples in Madagascar. And cVDPV2 has been isolated in AFP cases in the DR Congo and in ESs in Sudan. Note that all of the AFP cases and positive ESs occurred in 2022.

There was no further information available on the wastewater samples positive for VDPV2 in Canada (see Poliomyelitis update (01): (Canada) VDPV2, wastewater, RFI 20230102.8707576).

A map showing the location of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan: violence
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2023
Source: Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/attackers-wound-5-pakistani-policemen-guarding-polio-workers/2023/01/05/b84bd168-8cff-11ed-b86a-2e3a77336b8e_story.html


Attackers armed with guns and hand grenades ambushed a police van assigned to guard polio workers in northwestern Pakistan, wounding 5 policemen, authorities said. Police returned fire after coming under attack near a bridge in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to local police chief Aman Ullah.

The police chief, who was traveling with the convoy to a nearby vaccination site, said between 6 to 8 suspected militants ambushed them, opened fire and threw hand grenades at the police van.

No group claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic militants often target polio teams and police protecting them, falsely claiming the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. The latest anti-polio campaign started this week, the 1st in 2023. In late November [2022], a Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up near a truck carrying police officers on their way to protect polio workers in the southwestern city of Quetta. A police officer in the truck was killed, as were 3 members of a family traveling in another car next to the truck. The Pakistani Taliban claimed the 30 Nov 2022 attack. A month earlier, in October [2022], gunmen riding on a motorcycle shot and killed a police officer assigned to guard a polio vaccination team in southwestern Baluchistan province.

Pakistan, which along with neighboring Afghanistan [are] the only [countries] where polio remains endemic, regularly launches vaccination campaigns. The latest, 5-day campaign started this week in northwestern Pakistan and is the 1st in 2023.

Since last April [2022], Pakistan has registered 20 new polio cases -- all in the northwest, where parents often refuse to inoculate children. The outbreak has been a blow to the government efforts aimed at eradicating the disease.

[The violence against polio vaccination workers including police officers protecting the actual vaccination teams is hard to fathom. In addition to the injured and killed individuals, in the long run the children suffer as seen by the increase in AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection during 2022.
