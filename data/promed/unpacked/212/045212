A dog with rabies in Nimes, France
The Bulletin Epidemiologique Mensuel de la Rage Animale en France recently
reported the case of a dog with rabies in the southern city of Nimes, which
included a description of the control measures and a discussion of the
case's epidemiological implications (1). On 26 May 1998 a young woman,
accompanied by two children, took a German Shepherd dog to the clinic of a
veterinarian surgeon in Nimes. The woman reported having found the dog
attached to a bench by a chain, in direct sunlight, without food or drink,
and apparently abandoned. The dog appeared calm but had a fixed stare and
vomited in the waiting room. Despite the heat, the dog did not drink. He
scratched at his dish of water, and knocked it against the wall of his
cage. The dog vomited a little the next morning, and bit the veterinarian's
hand, making it bleed. The dog was calm while being taken to the local
Society for the Protection of Animals. The veterinarian noticed that the
dog had an unusual gait, but that he was able to leap into the car. At the
animal refuge, the dog remained calm, neither drinking nor eating, and died
during the night. Congestion in all pulmonary lobes was seen at necropsy.
The dog was sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where rabies virus from
a canine source, similar to an isolate from Egypt, was identified.
The director of Gard veterinary services started an investigation and
proceeded to slaughter domestic carnivores that had been in contact with
the rabid dog at the veterinary clinic and the refuge. The director general
de l'alimentation reacted swiftly and demanded that the following measures
be taken:
to find the young woman with the two children who took the dog to the clinic;
to find all human and animal contacts of the dog in the preceding month;
to find the owner of this dog and establish its origin;
to remind doctors of the risks of humans contracting rabies following
contact, bite, or scratch by a dog or cat.
On 5 June, after the diagnosis had been made, a hazard warning about the
risk of infection was issued in Nimes and surrounding areas. On 8 June the
ministry declared that a rabies case had been confirmed at Gard. The
declaration entailed a number of measures:
all dogs and cats must be vaccinated against rabies within a month, and
marked with a tattoo;

all dogs and cats who have bitten, scratched any person or animal must be
put under veterinary surveillance by their owner;
all stray dogs and cats must be taken to the refuge or, if impossible to
capture, killed by special agents;
the owners of dogs or cats must be able to present a valid anti-rabies
vaccination certificate. The number of vaccinations must be shown by tattoo
on the animal.
The department of health and social services and the director of veterinary
services appealed for the young woman and her two children who took the dog
to the veterinary clinic, the owners of the dog, and those who had come
into contact with the dog to seek medical advice. So far these appeals have
been in vain.
Following these events, the director general de l'alimentation reiterated
the importance of veterinary controls when domestic carnivores arrive in
countries where rabies is not endemic and the necessity to vaccinate
domestic carnivores against rabies, especially in holiday camps and camping
grounds. She advised members of the public to inform the authorities or the
police or an animal refuge if they came across a stray or abandoned animal.
This case raises several epidemiological questions. Was the dog imported
from Africa or was it infected directly or indirectly by an imported dog?
It was not an African breed, so it may have been infected in Europe. If so,
are these infections unique to France? The location where the dog was found
suggests that it may have been abandoned by a traveller. Where did this
traveller come from?
The authors express surprise at the disparity between the registers of dogs
or cats infected with rabies imported into France (18 importations in 32
years) and the lack of reports in other European countries. With the
liberalisation of frontiers to carnivores with uncertain vaccination
status, they suggest that such incidents could happen elsewhere in Europe.
The advent of free movement of people and animals in the European Union
makes surveillance of rabies vital.
