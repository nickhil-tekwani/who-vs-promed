Foot and mouth disease strikes additional Vietnamese locality: report
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's central Phu Yen province has been hit by foot and mouth disease
[FMD] in the last few days, according to local newspaper Labor on Friday
[19 Jan 2007].
The disease was spotted in the 3 districts of Phu Hoa, Tuy An, and Dong
Xuan, and Tuy Hoa city in the province, affecting some 200 buffalos, bulls
and pigs. Local veterinary agencies have decontaminated affected farms,
banned the transport of cattle in affected areas to other areas, and
vaccinated healthy cattle against the disease.
Local media have recently reported outbreaks of FMD in northern Yen Bai
province. However, the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has yet to announce the
outbreaks in Yen Bai and Phu Yen.
Now, the disease is present in 13 communes in 9 districts in southern Can
Tho city and in 5 provinces, namely Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang, and Phu Tho in
the northern region, and Soc Trang and Dong Thap in the southern regions,
affecting 551 bulls and buffaloes as well as 163 pigs, said the department.
Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the government in
2005, Viet Nam will, by 2010, have 35-40 million pigs, 6.5-6.7 million
bulls and cows, 2.8-3 million buffaloes, and 380-390 million poultry.

[According to the above newswire, there are currently 8 FMD infected
provinces in Viet Nam. They are the following (in parentheses are their
respective numbers shown on the administrative map, available at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>): North Viet Nam: Cao Bang
(19), Tuyen Quang (58), Phu Tho (43) and Yen Bai (61; yet to be officially
announced); South Viet Nam: Can Tho (18), Soc Trang (50), Dong Thap (22)
and Phu Yen (44; yet to be officially announced).
Viet Nam's last FMD update to the Office International des Epizooties was
sent on 24 May 2006 (archived as 20060530.1510). It included information on
the evolution of a massive FMD epizootic: FMDV serotype O was reported to
affect cattle, buffaloes and swine in 330 communes, situated in 114
districts within 32 provinces. In addition, FMDV serotype Asia 1 reportedly
infected the same animal species in 19 communes situated in 6 districts
within the province of Ha Giang.
Since May 2006, the disease remained active, but the number of affected
provinces allegedly decreased. On 30 Dec 2006, a Vietnamese newswire said
that 5 provinces were still affected (see 20061231.3664).
In the absence of an official report since May 2006, the FMD situation in
Viet Nam remains unclear. This refers both to its geography as well as to
its epidemiology, including the identity (serotypes) of the circulating
virus. - Mod.AS]
