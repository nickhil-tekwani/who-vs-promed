Fresh fears arose yesterday that the ban on local fish exports to the
European Union (EU) market could be extended indefinitely after revelations
of raw sewer being discharged into Lake Victoria.
Health and fisheries experts in Western Kenya also warned the practice
could lead to a major environmental disaster in the lake region.
Experts told the East African Standard raw effluent contains pathogens
responsible for water-borne diseases, including cholera and typhoid fever.
Informed sources also confirmed the Kisumu Municipal Council was
discharging up to 50 milligrams of bi-carbonate oxygen demand (BOD) instead
of the stipulated maximum of 50 BOD.
And because of this massive pollution, fish exports to the EU were banned.
Following the revelations of how the lake is being polluted,
environmentalists and local leaders have demanded an immediate probe of the
council's involvement in the pollution saga.
In a separate interview, Nyanza Provincial Medical Officer (PMO), Dr.
Ambrose Misore, said although water pollution was not a major issue before,
"the quality of local fish now remains on the spotlight". A fisheries
official who preferred anonymity said reports of contamination of the lake
water had brought fresh worries over the quality of local fish. "The
reports are distressing and we are worried the EU might extend its ban on
fish exports indefinitely," said the source who declined to be named.
The EU lifted its ban on Tanzanian fish last January leaving Kenya and
Uganda still battling to have their ban reviewed.
International scholars attending an environmental workshop last week in
Kisumu expressed shock that the Government had allowed raw sewer to be
pumped into the lake. Professor Jon-Olof Drangert, a hydrologist, said the
situation puts at risk the lives of over 30 million residents of the lake
region. "What do you expect when the lake water is contaminated? The health
of the people and the lake ecosystem are at risk," said Dr. Misore. He said
samples of the lake water have been taken to the Government Chemist for
testing. "If we find that the water is highly contaminated, then we might
be forced to take legal action against the council for putting people's
lives at risk," he said.
And the East African Standard established studies done on the water samples
last month had shown a high level of contamination. Our investigations also
established that the pumping sewer stations at Railway, SunSet and Kisat
had broken down.
