Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out in eastern Uganda
---------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan government on Friday [18 Feb 2005] announced that
quarantine restrictions are imposed on the eastern district of
Sironko following the outbreak of foot & mouth disease in
Bunambutya sub-county of the district.
A press release from the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries was quoted by Radio Uganda as saying that "following the
outbreak of foot & mouth disease in Bunalwere, Buyaka, Buwasieba
and Marakaru, Bwikhonge parish, Bunambutya sub-county, quarantine
restrictions are imposed on the entire district of Sironko."
"Movement of livestock, livestock products and by-products from, to
and within Sironko district is prohibited with immediate effect until
further notice," the ministry said. It said that "consequently, all
livestock markets within the district have been closed with immediate
effect."
The ministry called on all veterinary staff, local councils, chiefs,
enforcement personnel and the general public "to enforce quarantine
restrictions so that the disease is brought under control."

[According to OIE's epizootiological data, 35 outbreaks of FMD were
officially reported by Uganda to the OIE during 2003. During January
- November 2004, a total of 24 outbreaks were reported, caused by
FMDV serotypes O, SAT 1, and SAT 2. No later data are available. See:
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/zi_pays_mald.asp?c_pays=194&c_mald=2>.
Official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the recent suspected
cases, as well as a fresh update (a basic requirement of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code) will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
