CDC Telebriefing: Update on Ebola Response Tool
-----------------------------------------------
Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

"What we're releasing today is a useful tool. It comes with an online spreadsheet so that planners in countries as well as in international organizations can model what might happen in different circumstances. The tool was created several weeks ago with data that was available several weeks ago and a lot has happened since then ...

"[The] bottom line here is, and I think what's really important in this tool, is that the model shows -- and I don't think this has been shown by other modeling tools out there -- that a surge now can break the back of the epidemic. It also shows that there are severe costs of delay. And that the importance of implementing effective programs rapidly can't be overemphasized. It's definitely still possible to reverse the epidemic ..."

Ms. Gayle Smith, special assistant to the President of the United States and Senior Director of the National Security Council:

"[Some] of the projections that you will be seeing don't take into account something that Tom just referred to, which is the tremendous surge in resources and response, even in the last few weeks. As you know, President Obama announced that we would be sending in a joint force command, which has been stood up in Monrovia to support the regional civilian effort. They have provided more personnel on the ground since the force commander deployed last week. They are calling in assets and capabilities to rapidly get to scale a response that will provide more treatment units, training at scale and logistics to support what is a complex region wide operation ...

"We are also continuing to build out our civilian response ... The 3rd line of effort is work very aggressively with countries all over the world to urge and urge them to ramp up their responses ... [We] think it's imperative that we keep the pressure on the international community to respond as quickly as possible. So we can get ahead of this and get ahead of it quickly."

[2] CDC Ebola Safety Training Courses: travel grants
Date: Wed 24 Sep 2014
Source: International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) [edited]
http://www.isid.org/grants/grant_ebola_training_travel.shtml


In response to the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa, ISID has searched for ways to assist the people most affected. We are pleased to announce that we are sponsoring a limited number of travel grants to individuals who are attending one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Ebola Safety Training Courses. The courses will help prepare healthcare personnel to provide medical care to Ebola patients in an established Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU).

The 1st CDC Ebola Safety Training Course starts on 6 Oct 2014 and the schedule currently extends through the end of this year [2014]. The courses are open to healthcare workers from all over the world and are being offered free of charge, but participants are responsible for paying for their own travel to the course in Alabama. Full information on the CDC course: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/safety-training-course/index.html

Only individuals who have been accepted to the CDC Ebola Safety Training Course and who will deploy to West Africa after completion of the course will be eligible for ISID funding. Travel grants of USD 500 each will be awarded to US residents and USD 1000 to residents of other countries.

For more information on the ISID CDC Ebola Safety Training travel grant, please go to: http://www.isid.org/grants/grant_ebola_training_travel.shtm.

[3] Sierra Leone: deaths undercounted?

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/africa/23ebola.html


Fresh graves point to undercount of EVD toll
--------------------------------------------
The gravedigger hacked at the cemetery's dense undergrowth, clearing space for the day's EVD victims. A burial team, in protective suits torn with gaping holes, arrived with fresh bodies. The backs of the battered secondhand vans carrying the dead were closed with twisted, rusting wire. Bodies were dumped in new graves, and a worker in a short-sleeve shirt carried away the stretcher, wearing only plastic bags over his hands as protection. The outlook for the day at King Tom Cemetery was busy. "We will need much more space," said James C. O. Hamilton, the chief gravedigger, as a colleague cleared the bush with his machete ...

Since the beginning of the outbreak more than 6 months ago, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry reported only 10 confirmed EVD deaths here in Freetown, the capital of more than one million people, and its suburbs as of Sunday [21 Sep 2014] -- a hopeful sign that this city, unlike the capital of neighboring Liberia, had been relatively spared the ravages of the outbreak. But the bodies pouring in to the graveyard tell a different story. In the last 8 days alone, 110 EVD victims have been buried at King Tom Cemetery, according to the supervisor, Abdul Rahman Parker, suggesting an outbreak that is much more deadly than either the government or international health officials have announced. "I'm working with the burial team, and the 1st question I ask them is, 'Are they Ebola-positive?'" said Mr. Parker, adding that the figures were based on medical certificates that he had seen himself. The deaths are carefully recorded by name and date in a notebook headed "Ebola Burials." ...

The majority of the recent deaths recorded at the cemetery were young people -- young adults, people in early middle age, or children -- with very few elderly people on the list. Several of the deaths also occurred in a concentrated area, sometimes in the same house, suggesting that a virulent infection had struck ...

Other houses in Wilberforce Barracks, the village-like compound surrounding the hospital, were on the list of the dead and placed under quarantine, marked off from the surrounding jumble of shacks and cinder-block houses by a thin line of red or blue string. In one of them, ... the residents said that a total of 5 people who lived there had died of EVD -- yet 4 of them did not even appear on the cemetery list ...
At another 6 households on the cemetery supervisor's list of the dead, residents gave similar accounts. One family said the victim had definitely died of EVD, while 5 others described EVD-like symptoms -- vomiting, diarrhea, fever -- though none had been given an official cause of death.

International health experts here had no explanation for the striking discrepancy between the government's tally of the dead in the capital and the cemetery crew's statistics. Several of them noted the general confusion surrounding official statistics here from the beginning, with one leading international health official saying: "We don't know exactly what is going on." But nobody disputed that things appear to be getting worse. The WHO has shown a sharp increase in new cases in Freetown in recent weeks, rising from almost none early in the summer to more than 50 during the week of 14 Sep 2014 ... But the exhaustion of the EVD gravediggers at King Tom Cemetery, who dig as many as 16 graves a day, indicated that the disease was far from being contained ... [more]

[4] New drug field trials

Health officials will begin 1st EVD treatment trials in West Africa
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Although experimental treatments for ebolavirus have already been administered to westerners who contracted the disease, scientists in London, with the help of international aid groups, plan on bringing clinical trials for those treatments to West Africa for the 1st time. The trials could begin in a matter of months.

Wellcome Trust's USD 5 million initiative will include drugs from Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Sarepta and Tekmira, according to Reuters. Mapp makes zMapp, the experimental cocktail administered to 2 Americans who contracted the disease in Liberia. And Tekmira recently gained the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration to use its TKM-Ebola treatment on confirmed or suspected cases of the disease ... [more]

[I can't find anything in the Reuters source to say the trials could [only] begin in a matter of months -- every week counts now. There is a standard protocol for clinical trials; surely a trial can begin in a dedicated West African hospital on rapid authorization by a national government without waiting for UK government or US FDA clearance, provided the African government agrees in advance not to claim damages from the pharmaceutical companies if serious side effects are found? ProMED would welcome clarification of the reasons for delay. - Mod.JW]

[5] Prevention & false alarms


Australia: EVD scares at Perth hospital
---------------------------------------
23 Sep 2014 (News Limited): A woman in Western Australia has been cleared of the deadly ebolavirus, it has emerged. The woman had recently arrived in the country from West Africa and was currently being treated at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. She was transported to the facility, the state's quarantine hospital, after suffering EVD-like symptoms, which include fever. The woman instead could be suffering from malaria, which was the diagnosis for a man who presented at the hospital last week with flu-like symptoms after working in west Africa.

Canada: Edmonton (Alberta) false alarm
--------------------------------------
22 Sep 2014 (Edmonton Sun): The threat of Ebola led to the temporary closure of the Royal Alexandra Hospital emergency department on Monday [22 Sep 2014]. Alberta Health Services (AHS) took extraordinary precautions due to the threat of the deadly ebolavirus. "We did have a patient there who gave a travel history and had a clinical condition that was suggestive that he might have EVD but on further assessment we've ruled [it] out," said AHS senior medical officer of health, Dr. Gerry Predy ...

CDC guidelines for aircrew
--------------------------
22 Sep 2014 (Daily Mail): [On Fri 19 Sep 2014] the [US CDC] stressed that airlines may 'deny boarding to air travelers with serious contagious diseases that could spread during flight'
- The rule applies to all US airlines and to foreign airlines flying directly in or out of the USA
- Ebola has infected at least [5800] people in West Africa and has killed [over 2800] of them
- Thousands of US soldiers are slated to enter Africa to help stem the out-of-control outbreak over the next 30 days
The new guidance stresses that flight crews should 'treat any body fluid as though it is infectious' ... [more]

Ghana: suspect cases
--------------------
23 Sep 2014 (Modern Ghana): [A] man who was on board a Kumasi-Bolga bound mini bus ... allegedly complained of some ailment and started having a running stomach [diarrhea] and vomiting blood when the vehicle got to Kintampo Sunday [21 Sep 2014] morning. He died some few minutes later. Eyewitnesses told Daily Guide that the development created panic among both the passengers and the residents around the lorry park where he passed on, as medical personnel, dressed in their full EVD apparel, stormed the scene to convey the body to prevent people from contacting it ... the body had since been buried, whilst the blood sample had been taken to the Noguchi Medical Research Centre in Accra for testing ... the deceased was among a group of students from the Upper East Region who went to the Wassa area in the Western Region to embark on galamsey (illegal mining) during the holidays to earn some money to pay their fees ... the cause of death could be mercury poisoning ... a similar incident happened recently at the Goaso area where a galamseyer died vomiting blood as a result of mercury poisoning [mercury is used during gold mining].

Ebola scare hits Dominase, Ghana; 1 dead, 2 hospital staff quarantined
----------------------------------------------------------------------
24 Sep 2014 (Modern Ghana): An EVD scare at the Dominase SDA Hospital in the Ashanti Regional has created panic in the area. A man believed to be in his late twenties died in the hospital with the symptoms of EVD Tuesday [23 Sep 2014]. He was left unattended to by frightened hospital staff who did not have basic protective equipment with which to handle the patient. According to the Medical Superintendent of the hospital, Prince Kwakye Afriyie, the deceased reported to the hospital 3 days ago with fever. He was treated and discharged. But the Pusiga native returned to the hospital, this time with blood oozing out of his orifices, Dr Afriyie said. Frightened hospital, suspecting the victim to be suffering from the deadly Ebola which has killed over 2000 across West Africa, called the District health authorities for Personal Protective Equipment. There was none there.

Guinea-Bissau: Community radios and televisions join to prevent epidemic
------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 Sep 2014 (Observador): 32 radio stations and 4 community television of Guinea-Bissau will broadcast from Monday [22 Sep 2014] a campaign to prevent Ebola epidemic, which the country remains free, said the association Action for Development (AD). The nongovernmental organization (NGO) aims to put the issue on the agenda "with communities" with which it works across the country, announced today in a statement. The messages to send over the National Network of Radios and Televisions Guinea-Bissau Community (RENARC), coordinated by AD, will be complemented with a newsletter distributed in the neighborhood of Quelele in Bissau, plays and music broadcast in public spaces. At the same time, the NGO has involved nearly 200 associations and organizations receiving shares of AD in rural and urban areas and regions of Bissau and Cacheu Cubucare such as schools, health facilities and communities. The campaign also provides for intervention in community spokespersons information, responsible for making it reach the most isolated households ... [more]

23 Sep 2014 (Times of India): A 22-year-old man who returned from Nigeria on Monday [22 Sep 2014] with a high fever was being closely monitored at an isolated ward in the Government General Hospital [GH in Chennai) for symptoms of EVD. The patient ... has been working at a private hospital in Nigeria. [He] was on vacation, arrived at Chennai airport via Abu Dhabi on Monday night with a high fever. He was immediately screened at the airport and sent to the GH where he was quarantined ... after starting the 1st course of treatment, the patient's fever had subsided considerably but nothing was certain as yet and they would continue to monitor him at an isolated ward ...

Madagascar: 10 false alarms
---------------------------
20 Sep 2014 (L'Express de Madagascar): Since August [2014], we have analyzed 10 cases of people suspected of being infected with EVD. All tests were negative. "It is in these terms that Professor Christophe Rogier, director of the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM), wanted to reassure the public in face of the threat of this deadly virus ... They were suspected of being infected following the detection of a rise in their temperature after traveling abroad, according to Herlyne Ramihantaniarivo, Director General of the Ministry of Public Health.

Sierra Leone: seals borders
---------------------------
23 Sep 2014 (Reuters): Sierra Leone's army has "sealed off" the borders with Liberia and Guinea in a bid to halt the spread of EVD, the army spokesman said on Tuesday [23 Sep 2014]. The spokesman told Reuters that troops had been sent to all border crossing points.

Switzerland: Guinean refugee an EVD contact
-------------------------------------------
23 Sep 2014 (AFP): A Guinean asylum seeker has been hospitalized in Switzerland with suspected EVD, health authorities announced in Bern on Tuesday [23 Sep 2014]. "The individual fulfils the criteria for a suspected case of EVD," the Federal Office of Public Health said in a statement. He was being monitored under tightly controlled conditions at the university hospital (CHUV) in Lausanne in the canton of Vaud, the office said. "He is undergoing medical examinations in order to determine whether he is indeed suffering from the disease," it added. The office said that the man had arrived at an asylum centre in the western town of Vallorbe on 17 Sep 2014, and had told officials that he had left Guinea for France 2 days earlier. Officials at the centre acted fast because the man said he had lost a family member to EVD, placing him in quarantine under watch from physicians. After he began showing feverish symptoms on Tuesday [23 Sep 2014], the authorities decided to transfer him immediately to Lausanne amid tight security. The office stressed that the disease does not spread until the symptoms appear, and that there was no risk to the local population, saying the swift handling of the case showed the effectiveness of EVD monitoring in the country.

[6] Survivors: availability as health workers?
Date: Wed 24 Sep 2014
From: Michael Barza, MD <Michael.Barza@steward.org> [edited]


Apart from buying the blood of EVD survivors, I wonder why I have heard no discussion of having the more able-bodied of these survivors work in the effort to contain EVD. Presumably they would be immune -- at least to the strain in their own geographic area.

[ProMED would be interested to hear the reasons. I think it's probably because of stigma -- nobody wants contact with survivors; husbands are reportedly even rejecting recovered wives. But survivors could work with cleanup in treatment centers, and on burial crews -- saving PPE (personal protective equipment). They would unfortunately probably not be welcomed into households as contact tracers. I'm amazed to see CDC personnel going out into the bush tracing contacts -- see one in a sleeveless top trekking into the jungle in the CDC photo gallery at: http://www.cdc.gov/24-7/protectingpeople/disease-detectives/index.html. Maybe she has PPE in her backpack?
