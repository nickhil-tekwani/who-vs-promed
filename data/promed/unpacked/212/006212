Regional health officials notified Cleburne late today [Wed 30 Nov 2016] of confirmed cases of mumps at Wheat Middle School and Cleburne High School.

This followed Keene ISD [Independent School District]'s announcement of several suspected cases in their district earlier today. [See below.]

Parents of all CISD students were notified of the situation through district email Wed [30 Nov 2016] evening. The message included an advisory letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services.

"We do not want parents to be alarmed, but rather aware of the situation and informed of the disease and its symptoms," Superintendent Kyle Heath said. "The health and welfare of our students is of the utmost importance to our district. Working with our nursing staff and regional and state health officials, we will continue to monitor the situation."

Protection against the disease is addressed by 2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is among the state immunization requirements for Texas public schools.

Parents were encouraged to contact their family physician if they had any questions or concerns regarding the disease.

Mumps outbreak at Texas elementary school
-----------------------------------------
A once-dormant contagious disease has sprouted up in a North Texas town, causing a school district to issue a health warning.

At least 10 cases of mumps have been confirmed by health authorities in Johnson County.

Of the cases, 7 involve students within Keene ISD.

"I think the parents have to be very careful," said MV, a parent.

Parents like MV want to know what the district and county health department are doing about mumps.

Doctors think the outbreak originated from a family who traveled to Arkansas over the Thanksgiving holiday [around 24 Nov 2016].

"My kids have already the immunization and I think that will cover," said MV.

Not every parent within the district feels the shots are necessary.

"You definitely don't want 7 or 10 cases to turn into 40 and that can easily happen," said Ricky Stephens, the superintendent for Keene ISD.

Stephens said the 34 students, who are not vaccinated or are under-vaccinated, will not be able to attend school for the next 26 days.

"You can't just do one campus and assume you're safe," said Stephens.

[Last] week, Dallas County issued a health advisory regarding 1 confirmed case with the possibility of several others.

"Mumps is almost unheard of in this day in age," said Dr. Elvin Adams with the Johnson County Health Department.

Dr. Adams said patients usually feel tired and weak. Then a fever is possible and that is when the glands in a person start swelling.

"So you look like a chipmunk that has a mouthful of nuts," said Dr. Adams.

While Dr. Adams said it is not considered a lethal disease, it can be painful and easily spread if nothing is done.

The state health department plans to be on Keene ISD property on Thu [1 Dec 2016] to give out vaccines to students who need shots.

KTVT reports that any students who choose not to get vaccinated, must wait the 26 days because the disease can incubate for 25 days.

Yale reports 2 suspected cases of mumps
---------------------------------------
Two suspected cases of mumps have been reported at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut], one in an undergraduate living on campus and one in a graduate student living off campus, Yale Health Director, Paul Genecin, M.D. wrote yesterday [30 Nov 2016].

Over 90 percent of Yale undergraduates have received mumps vaccine, but it is still possible for students or other members of the campus community to contract the disease.

Mumps is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is spread through indirect or direct contact with an infected person's nose or throat droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is best known for the puffy cheeks and swollen jaw that it causes because of inflammation of the salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. Other common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. Some people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and often they do not know they have the disease.

Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause severe complications, especially in adults. Treatment includes rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicine to reduce fever and discomfort. Since mumps is caused by a virus, antibiotics are not used as a treatment.

People with mumps can spread the infection for up to 2 days before, and 5 days after, symptoms develop, so those infected can spread the disease before they feel sick. Symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12 to 25 days after infection.

Students who have mumps or mumps-like symptoms will be asked to go home if they live close enough to New Haven or if their parent or guardian is able to pick them up. Students who are not able to go home will be cared for at Yale Health until they are no longer contagious. Faculty and staff with symptoms should consult their health care providers; they should not come to work.

King County Mumps Outbreak Grows to 22
--------------------------------------
King County Public Health said Fri [2 Dec 2016] afternoon that the number of mumps cases in the county has grown from 9 to 22 since Wed [30 Nov 2016]. Of those 22 cases, 5 are confirmed and 17 are probable.

Health officials are warning anyone with mumps symptoms to stay away from others, and they are urging everyone to get vaccinated.

The county said that all of the cases are in Auburn [Washington], and 15 of the cases are in children ages 5 to 17. When the county reported the initial outbreak earlier this week, all of the mumps cases were confined to a single family.

The MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective, King County Health Officer Dr. Jeffrey Duchin has said. Even still, everyone should get the vaccine, he said.

"Because some people do not respond to the vaccine and mumps spreads easily from person to person, outbreaks can still occur in vaccinated populations. But, if unvaccinated, many, many more people would become ill," Duchin said in a statement Fri [2 Dec 2016].

[In an earlier report (30 Nov 2016) (http://patch.com/washington/seattle/mumps-outbreak-emerging-south-king-county-health-officials) by Neal McNamara (Seattle Patch), Duchin described this current outbreak as a "blip." In a typical year, there are between 0 and 7 cases total in King County. All but one of the people infected this year with mumps is under age 18.
