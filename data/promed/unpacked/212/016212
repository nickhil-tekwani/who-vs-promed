Acute Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in livestock dromedaries, Dubai, 2014.

----------------------------------
1. Abstract

Camels carry Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS CoV], but little is known about infection age or prevalence. We studied more than 800 dromedaries of all ages and 15 mother-calf pairs. This syndrome constitutes an acute, epidemic, and time-limited infection in camels above the age of 4 years, particularly calves. Delayed social separation of calves might reduce human infection risk.

2. Conclusions [For the omitted references, please see the complete paper at the above URL].

Our findings provide evidence of infection of camel flocks in Dubai with MERS-CoV of contiguous virus clade. Similar to findings from earlier studies, we found evidence of new introductions of virus in flocks, such as the flock that temporally grazed in Saudi Arabia and was infected with a virus strain typical for Saudi Arabia. Acute MERS-CoV infection, rather than the long-term presence of virus in the dromedaries, was supported by testing mother-calf pairs. Because cows were not acutely infected before their calves, perennial persistence of MERS-CoV in adult dromedaries is unlikely. Titration and longitudinal serologic studies might have shown increased antibody titers in adult dromedaries after calves were infected. However, such studies were not possible for technical and logistical reasons, which is a clear limitation of our study.

Although we did not design our study to cover the duration of virus shedding in young dromedaries, our results suggest excretion to be short lived in individual camels. Of the 11 virus-positive calves, 5 had high virus RNA concentrations in their 1st samples (cycle threshold values exceeding 25) but no RNA in samples tested 8 days later. An infection experiment in adult dromedaries showed shedding occurred for more than 35 days after virus inoculation, which seems longer than the length of virus shedding observed for young camels in our study. However, detection sensitivity in the defined conditions of a laboratory trial might have been higher than in our study. Both studies agreed in their finding of short-lived infectivity of excreted virus: in our study, we did not detect virus in any calf on day 8, and none were detected beyond day 7 in the study by Adney et al. Nevertheless, virus can be maintained in flocks over several weeks or months, as exemplified by the detection of the same virus clade in March and June 2014 on 1 dairy farm.

The restricted and highly compartmentalized social structure of livestock camels would provide population niches in which viruses can differentiate in isolation after bottleneck-type transmission events. This situation holds promise for control of the spread of MERS-CoV through flock management practices, and it also suggests a rather simple way of avoiding camel-to-human transmission by avoiding camels older than 2 years of age. Camel calves are not easily accessible by humans and instinctually avoid humans. They are generally separated from their mothers after 12 months of age (i.e., at an age when they are still likely to be infected with MERS-CoV). Humans normally come into contact with calves only after the animals have been separated from their mothers. A change in this practice (i.e., postponing separation until the calves are older) might reduce the risk for camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission.

[Further investigations into the animal source of human infections with MERS-CoV in the Arab peninsula and neighbouring countries, such as Jordan, are required. This should include bats; so far, the evidence of bat involvement is based upon molecular findings in a single specimen (see 20140720.2623848).

Earlier in 2015, it was revealed that the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI), Israel, in collaboration with the Erasmus University Medical Center (Erasmus MC) in Rotterdam, Netherlands, have undertaken a serosurvey in dromedary camels in Israel. The sera were collected during 2013-2014. Most samples were collected in southern Israel (see 20150210.3156453). Preliminary results were yet to be validated before their official publication. These results are anticipated with interest, since Israel borders Jordan, where the 1st MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in April 2012, involving a cluster of patients in a public hospital in Zarqa (ref 1), 2 months before the detection of the 1st human case in Saudi Arabia. Within a serosurvey conducted in Jordan between June and September 2013, neutralising MERS-CoV antibodies were found in all (11) camel sera tested, while sera from goats and cattle tested negative (ref 2).

Jordan's total camel population, as reported to the OIE, is estimated at nearly 11 000. Israel's total camel population is estimated at 3000-4000, most of them kept in the south (Negev).

In a recent letter to EID (ref 3), co-authored by researchers from the University of Bonn Medical Centre, Germany, the University of Cordoba, Spain and the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, UAE, it was suggested that equids be included among the potential MERS-CoV reservoir animals to be investigated. The authors did not find evidence for equid infections but demonstrated in vitro the susceptibility of primary horse cells, showing production of viral RNA and also of infectious virus progeny "which is a prerequisite for transmission." They refer to earlier findings, according to which MERS-CoV replication levels in horse cells were found comparable to those in bat cells.
