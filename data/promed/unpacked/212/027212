An Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] outbreak in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo's (Congo DR) Kasai Occidental Province is now under
control, according to a UN official. "The epidemic has stabilized,
but we cannot say it is over. There is still a likelihood of it
spreading; there are more new cases," Matthieu Kamwa, the UN World
Health Organization (WHO) resident representative in the Congo DR,
said, adding that there was a need for increased vigilance.

According to an epidemiologist with the WHO, Adolphe Kongolo, at
least 50 people have been affected, with 15 deaths reported since 29
Nov 2008, when the outbreak began. The last positive case was
confirmed on 18 Jan 2009. According to Kongolo, the National
Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa as well as laboratories
in Gabon and South Africa confirmed 10 cases of Ebola from collected
samples. However, some people had died and were buried before samples
could be obtained, he said. Most of the cases were in the village of
Kalwamba in Kasai Occidental Province.

A case alert has been reported in nearby Tshikapa. A WHO health team
and other partners are yet to collect samples and conduct other
medical examinations in the area.

Meanwhile, awareness raising about Ebola is continuing, said
provincial health inspector Edmond Mulumba, with the population being
encouraged to report those with symptoms such as bleeding, fatigue,
vomiting and diarrhea. "The population should continue adhering to
hygiene measures, wash their hands regularly, use latrines and avoid
eating bats or animals found dead in the bush because this is a
source of contamination," Mulumba said.

[Since the Medecins sans Frontieres report of 24 Jan 2009, the number
of laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever has
increased from 7 to 10. The number of fatalities has risen from 12 to
15, only 2 of whom have been laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever. The suspicion remains that more than a single
etiologic agent may be involved in this outbreak. The village of
Kalwamba in Kasai Occidental is now given as the focus of the epidemic.
