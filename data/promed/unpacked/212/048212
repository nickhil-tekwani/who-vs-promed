Vesicular stomatitis update: 100 premises quarantined in 3 states
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This year [2019], the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) outbreak began on 21 Jun 2019, when the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa confirmed the 1st VSV-positive premises in Kinney County, Texas.

According to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, since then, VSV-positive premises have been confirmed to date in 3 states: Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

Since the start of the outbreak, Colorado has identified 56 affected premises (31 confirmed positive, 25 suspect) in 6 counties (Adams, Boulder, Broomfield, La Plata, Larimer, and Weld counties). New Mexico has identified 30 affected premises (27 confirmed positive, 3 suspect) in 6 counties (Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe, Taos, and Valencia counties). Texas has identified 22 affected premises (20 confirmed positive, 2 suspect) located in 12 counties (Bastrop, Coleman, Hays, Hood, Johnson, Kerr, Kinney, Shackelford, Taylor, Tom Green, Val Verde, and Wichita counties).

Currently, 101 premises in these 3 states are under quarantine, with half in Colorado. 7 have been released from quarantine.

VSV can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually will heal in 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the contagious nature of VSV and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) Executive Director, Dr Andy Schwartz warns livestock owners, "Known competent vectors for transmission of VSV include black flies, sand flies, and biting midges.

"Livestock owners should implement best practices to limit livestock exposure to insects."

Since the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) made its last vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) update on [Fri 12 Jul 2019], the state has received reports of 11 new confirmed VSV cases. Equine premises with confirmed cases since 12 July 2019 include:

- 3 in Bastrop County;
- 1 in Hays County;
- 3 in Hood County;
- 1 in Johnson County;
- 1 in Shackelford County;
- 1 in Tom Green County; and
- 1 in Wichita County.

The TAHC has place the newly confirmed premises under quarantine. Regulatory and authorized veterinarians will monitor the affected horses until the premises are eligible for quarantine release 14 days after clinical VSV signs are observed.

To date, 20 premises in 12 Texas counties have confirmed cases of VSV. Of those premises, 2 have been released from quarantine. Currently affected counties include Bastrop, Coleman, Hays, Hood, Johnson, Shackelford, Taylor, Tom Green, Val Verde, and Wichita counties.

The TAHC will send VSV updates every Friday and report all cases to the Equine Disease Communication Center.

What Texas veterinarians need to know
-------------------------------------
Several states are imposing enhanced entry requirements on Texas livestock due to the VSV cases. For information, contact the state of destination. If you suspect your client's horse has VSV, contact your TAHC region office for paperwork and procedures.

What equine and cattle owners need to know
------------------------------------------
VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle. In the past decade, the southwestern and western United States have experienced several VSV outbreaks, which usually occur during the warmer months and often along waterways. VSV normally has an incubation period of 2 to 8 days before the infected animal develops blisters that swell and burst, leaving painful sores. Animals can transmit the virus through direct contact with infected animals; blood-feeding insects can also spread VSV from animal to animal.

If VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent animal movement and disease spread to other premises, fairs, or markets.

VSV preventive strategies
-------------------------
Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd. However, these tips might help protect livestock:
- control biting flies;
- keep equids stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies;
- keep stalls clean;
- feed and water animals from their individual buckets; and
- don't visit a ranch that's under VSV quarantine.

[Vesicular stomatitis does not appear every year. This is also the 1st time in many years we have the Indiana strain in circulation. In several previous outbreaks it has been the New Jersey strain.

Vesicular stomatitis causes a bit of stir because in addition to horses, it can affect cattle. The vesicles caused by this virus resemble the vesicles of food-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has been successfully eradicated from the USA.

Most articles mention control of biting flies and mosquitoes, but it is worth noting some research indicates bats may play a role in this disease as well. (see ProMED-mail Vesicular stomatitis: possible vector 20190715.6569128). - Mod.TG
