Health officials confirm indigenous cholera case
------------------------------------------------
The Center for Disease Control, under the [auspices of the?] Health
Department, confirmed yesterday, 23 Jun 2005, the 1st indigenous case of
cholera in Taiwan since 2000, noting that it had immediately reported the
case to the WHO.
The lab test results on the patient showed positive for cholera toxin, said
Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the CDC. The result indicates that the
patient is able to transmit the disease to other people via specific routes
of infection, he said.
The patient was identified as a 72 year old woman resident of Tainan
County, Chou said. Because of comprehensive upgrades of Taiwan's household
water supply and improved sanitation, the nation has managed to keep the
disease at bay for the past 5 years -- discounting a few imported cases in
which people had fallen ill after returning from trips to Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand.
"We have reported the case to the WHO and its agency in the west-Pacific
region, observing our duty as a member of the international community,"
Chou told a news briefing in the DOH.
The case was reported to the CDC by Tainan's Chi-Mei Hospital on Mon, 20
Jun 2005. The woman fell ill last Wed, 15 Jun 2005 and sought medical
treatment at a branch of the Chi-Mei hospital in Tainan County the next
day. She was later transferred to Chi-Mei Hospital's headquarters in Tainan
City.
The woman who has developed cholera lives in Hsinying City, Tainan County
with her husband, who has been confined to bed for years, and their
youngest son. She has been on a simple diet of rice porridge and salted
fish every day. Before falling ill, she sampled an assortment of steamed
eggs displayed in a local market, investigators from the county's health
department discovered. They have procured some of the eggs for testing to
determine whether that was the source of the illness. Chou said the CDC
would obtain the results in 5 days.
Heath officials have speculated that the cholera patient, in sampling the
steamed eggs, could have touched the food after she touched raw seafood
containing _Vibrio cholerae_.

Suspected cholera kills 50 in northeast Nigeria
-----------------------------------------------
At least 50 people have died in an outbreak of suspected cholera in the
remote north eastern Nigerian state of Borno, lawmakers said on Wed, 22
Jun 2005.
Kaka Adam Mustafa, a member of the Borno House of Assembly, said the
victims died last week of vomiting and diarrhea in 4 local government areas
located near Chad and Cameroon.
"As of Fri, 17 Jun 2005, when the report was made to me ... more than 14
people had already died in the village," Mustafa said on the floor of the
regional parliament, referring to Abare village, about 60 miles (100 km)
from the state capital, Maiduguri.
"Subsequent reports indicate that many more had also died from the epidemic
in neighboring villages and so far more than 50 people have died," said
Mustafa, whose report was corroborated by another lawmaker representing one
of the affected areas. The WHO in Abuja confirmed the outbreak, but said it
had no casualty figures and was unable to confirm it was cholera. "We have
collected samples and are doing laboratory tests to know what we are
dealing with," said a WHO official.
At least 150 people have died of cholera in 2 other states since Mar 2005,
according to officials and residents.

Cholera resurfaces in Senegal, with 8 deaths among 783 cases
------------------------------------------------------------
Cholera has resurfaced in Senegal, the health ministry said, with 8 deaths
reported among 783 cases in early Jun 2005. This is the 3rd outbreak in
Senegal in less than a year of the deadly waterborne illness transmitted
through poor hygiene in food preparation and sanitation.
A health ministry statement said the affected areas were in the north and
center-west of the west African state, as well as in the capital Dakar, and
that control measures were already in place to stem the progression of the
disease.
Senegal saw a sharp rise in cases in late March and early April 2005
following the annual pilgrimage to the Muslim holy city of Touba. More than
100 deaths were recorded from nearly 8000 cases from the period of 28 Mar
and 24 Apr 2005.
There had been a tapering off of infections by cholera, which causes
serious diarrhea and vomiting, over the last several months. The country
reported another outbreak in Oct and Nov 2004, with 6 deaths from 763 cases
primarily centered around Diourbel in the center-west and Louga in the
north, 2 areas noted as prime spots for infection in this latest outbreak,
according to the health ministry.

7 die in cholera outbreak in capital
------------------------------------
Nearly 300 cases of cholera have been reported in the capital of
Guinea-Bissau over the past 2 weeks, and 7 people have died from the
infectious water-borne disease, Tome Ca, the government's Director General
of Health, said on Thu, 23 Jun 2005.
Ca said the first cases of cholera were detected in the outer suburbs of
Bissau city on 11 Jun 2005, and all but 2 of the 290 cases registered so
far had occurred in the capital.
Ca noted that the latest cholera epidemic coincided with the onset of the
rainy season, when Bissau's water supply becomes particularly prone to
pollution. The city's water pipes are old and leaky and piles of rubbish
litter the streets.
This is the 1st cholera epidemic to hit Bissau, a city of 300 000 people,
in 3 years. In 2004, there was a cholera outbreak in the Bijagos islands
offshore, which affected about 100 people and resulted in 1 death, but it
did not spread to other parts of this small West African country.
Ca said the government was trying to prevent the cholera epidemic spreading
to the interior of this former Portuguese colony. The only cases so far
recorded outside Bissau were in Safim and Bula, 2 small towns situated
north of the capital on the main road to the Senegalese frontier.

Pabbo IDP camp gets cholera treatment centre
--------------------------------------------
District health authorities have opened a cholera treatment center in the
Pabbo internally displaced persons (IDP) camp, the most strongly affected
area since the epidemic broke out on 1 Apr 2005. 5 people have died of the
disease, the latest being a child who died in the camp last week, according
to local leaders.
"We are moving in very fast. We have set up a cholera treatment center in
the camp," said Mr Latim Baltaza, the district Secretary for Health in Gulu
district administration on Sat, 11 Jun 2005. The 50-bed center was opened
by Medicines sans Frontiers, an international non-governmental organization
which provides healthcare especially to underprivileged people. Gulu
district administration health staff have commenced work at the center.
Pabbo is the largest and most congested IDP camp in the region, with about
60 000 people lacking adequate health and food supplies. The district
cholera task force visited the camp recently and discovered that drinking
water there was contaminated with human feces due to poor sanitation,
according to Baltaza.
Dr Justine Onen, who heads the medical team at the Pabbo cholera treatment
center, said that by Mon evening, 13 Jun 2005, 249 cases had been reported
while 27 were admitted.

Fayette shigellosis cases reach 55
----------------------------------
Some Lexington day care centers are still experiencing new cases of
shigellosis, a form of dysentery that causes diarrhea, vomiting, and fever,
the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department reported yesterday, 21 Jun
2005. As of Mon, 20 Jun 2005, 55 cases had been confirmed in the county.
As of 2 Jun 2005, there were 22 cases. The 33 new cases have occurred
mostly among children ages 4 and under. 49 of the cases have been
associated with 10 day care facilities in Fayette County.
"I don't think we're out of the woods yet," said TJ Sugg, regional
epidemiologist for the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department, who has
been investigating the outbreak. Initially the number of cases seemed to
taper off, but there's been a recent surge in new cases, Sugg said.
