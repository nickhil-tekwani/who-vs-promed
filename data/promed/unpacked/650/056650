Wild animals have become infected with bluetongue in Bulgaria, resulting in deaths to deer and wild sheep. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports 25 fatalities in mouflon -- a wild mountain sheep -- and one western roe deer in the south west of the country. A red deer population of 20 head is at risk from the outbreak in Pazardzhik. Mouflon cases are slightly further north east in Plovdiv.

No other confirmed cases of live animals have been reported, although 183 wild animals are classed as "susceptible".

This comes as the virus continues to cover the Balkan regions through November [2014]. To date, 11 countries have been confirmed positive, with Turkey summoning a major vaccination campaign to halt the spread from the west. The virus strain, serotype 1, has been confirmed elsewhere in Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Montenegro, and Croatia.

In northern Bulgaria, 317 sheep fatalities have been confirmed.

Greece, where the virus spread from this summer [2014], has seen a further 15 000 sheep die over the month of November [2014]. Case fatality for sheep and goats was 46 per cent and 43 per cent respectively. Mortality rates stand at 6.7 per cent for sheep, according to the OIE's latest update.

Around 400 more animals have died in Macedonia, mostly in northern and northern eastern regions, particularly Kriva Palanka.

Hungary has had fewer cases, 11 in cattle and 2 in sheep, focused in the southern districts.

A separate virus strain continues to plague Italian farmers, killing a further 177 sheep this month.

Serotype 1 of the virus has continued spreading east, from its initial stronghold on the western half of Italy to engulf many east coast districts. Lazio, Calabria, Campania, Puglia, and Molise all had multiple cases. In the north, Emilia Romagna was confirmed with the virus, although the extreme northern regions have remained infection free, according to OIE updates. The 1st cases appeared in Lazio in October 2013 on a west coast holding.

Vaccination procedures are to be applied in response to the latest outbreaks.

[Bluetongue (BT) is a vector-borne viral disease of ruminants that causes high socio-economic and sanitary consequences. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is belongs to the genus _Orbivirus_ of the family _Reoviridae_. BTV causes high morbidity and mortality rates in naive sheep [sheep which have never previously experienced infection. - Mod.JW] and some wild ungulates. Transmission of BTV is predominantly mediated by midge vectors (_Culicoides_ spp; Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), but it can also be transmitted by other vectors or vertically [to offspring].

In Europe, wild ungulates are considered as important for the eco-epidemiology of bluetongue virus, based on the wide range of deer that can become infected, the long lasting viremia documented in red deer, and the ongoing outbreaks in Mediterranean countries (see Ruiz-Fons et al 2014, Virus Res 182: 50-8; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213004772).

Before 2014, BTV in Bulgaria was previously reported in 1999 (serotype 9). - Mod.PMB

Since its start, reportedly 4 Jul 2014, the accumulated number of BTV-1 outbreaks in Bulgaria has become 1353.

Accumulated OIE statistics on the affected species:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 36 998 / 86 / 2 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 335 493 / 20 022 / 6552 / 54 / 0
Cattle / 46 468 / 191 / 16 / 0 / 0
Mouflon / 446 / 46 / 44 / 0 / 0
Red deer / 20 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Western roe deer / 60 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
