[It is now 4 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report there are 3 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 2 in Shandong and 1 in Guangdong. In the past week there have been a total of 6 locally transmitted infections confirmed in Guangdong. It is now 1 week since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong... Is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? There were a total of 62 newly confirmed cases of which 59 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 802 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3333 deaths, representing an increase of 62 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (6 Apr 2020) report was prepared, and 2 newly reported deaths (1 in Shanghai, 1 in Hubei). An additional 12 suspected cases were newly reported, 11 in imported cases, 1 in Guangdong. 21 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases for the past 3 days.

A total of 59 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1042. There are an additional 82 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine translated report above, there were 137 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 102 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1095. 358 of these are importations from abroad. There were 11 originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours -- all were imported cases.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and ended it in Wuhan today, 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 53 cases and 8 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (6-7 Apr 2020) when there were 47 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 384 confirmed cases, including 200 deaths were reported today, up from 10 331 cases and 192 deaths yesterday [6 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 15 consecutive days and around 50 for 3 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 65.5% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.7% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 17.0% of the total newly confirmed cases, while Seoul represented 20.8% of the newly confirmed cases, and Gyeonggi represented 11.3%. Quarantined imported cases represented 26.4% of the newly confirmed cases, with 14 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. 8 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases.

The English language update of 7 Apr 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has interesting tables and graphs providing epidemiologic details of the outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea. One table focuses on the chain of transmission clusters by province, recognizing that every single case and their contacts were tested and studied. In the age distribution table, one sees that the case fatality ratio for over 80 years old was 20.0% and that 48.4% of all deaths were in the over 80-year-old age group in keeping with figures elsewhere in the world, but they represented only 4.5% of all cases. The age group with the most representation was the 20-29-year-olds making up 27.3% of the cases, but 0 deaths. There is also a statement that the Korean CDC's NIH (national Institute of Health) is doing research on antibody testing and vaccine development.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 338 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Also as in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 135 586 cases, including 17 127 deaths, up from 132 547 cases and 16 523 deaths reported on 5 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 6 and 7 Apr 2020 was 3039 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3599 newly confirmed cases between 5 Apr 2020 and 6 Apr 2020, decreasing from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (52 325), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (17 825), Veneto (11 925), and Piedmont (13 343). These 4 provinces combined account for 59.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Piedmont, with 13.8% of the newly confirmed cases reported, is seeing more activity than Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

Today's news is a continued cautious ray of sunshine with respect to the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy. The reduction in daily newly confirmed cases and deaths continues.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 29 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 27 days since the countrywide lockdown.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 400 412, including 33 408 deaths, an increase from 367 004 cases, and 10 871 deaths. New York state, with 142 384 (35.6%) cumulative case reports and 10 468 (31.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website reported 74 601 cases and 3544 deaths as of 5 pm on 7 Apr 2020. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (3326 newly confirmed cases 10.0%), Georgia (1842 newly confirmed cases 5.5%), Pennsylvania (1818 newly confirmed cases 5.4%), Michigan (1749 newly confirmed cases 5.2%), and California (1518 newly confirmed cases 4.5%).

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s. As of today [7 Apr 2020] , totals of 140 510 cases and 13 798 deaths have been reported, up from 135 032 cases and 13 055 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 214.4. It is 1st in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 140 510 cases, 63 093 (44.9%) have been hospitalized and 7069 (5.0%) admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate is 9.8%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions. Both the proportion of cases hospitalized and the proportion of cases in ICU have shown slight decreases over the past few days.

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
