Report of _Iris yellow spot virus_ on onion in Germany
------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Germany recently
informed the EPPO secretariat of the 1st detection of _Iris yellow
spot virus_ (_Tospovirus_, IYSV - EPPO Alert List) in Rheinland-Pfalz
on onions (_Allium cepa_ and _Allium fistulosum_). In
Rheinland-Pfalz, symptoms resembling those of IYSV had already been
observed in 2003 on onion crops. In summer 2007, as typical symptoms
of IYSV were observed again in the same onion-growing area, a survey
was initiated and 25 sites were visually inspected. As a result, 9
symptomatic lots were tested in the laboratory and found to be
infected by ISYV.

In the field, infected onion plants often showed white to
straw-coloured oval, necrotic lesions on the leaves. At a later stage
of the disease, the number of lesions increased and led to decay of
the leaves. These symptoms could be confused with those caused by
thrips infestations, hailstorms, herbicide phytotoxicity, or early
infections by various fungal diseases. While at the beginning of the
vegetation period, only isolated plants or small groups of plants
appeared to be infected, onion plots were evenly infected at a later
stage. So far, yield reduction could not be quantified but was
considered moderate. Because _Thrips tabaci_ is thought to be the
main vector of the disease, insecticide treatments were applied to
control thrips populations.

[IYSV has only recently been confirmed as a member of the genus
_Tospovirus_ by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV). It has been included in the Alert List of the
European Plant Pathology Organisation (EPPO). Known hosts include
onion, leek, iris, amaryllis, lisianthus, and weeds including wild
relatives of onion (_Allium_ species). IYSV has been reported from a
number of locations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, South Africa, and
Australia. The economic impact is low in some areas, but up to 100
percent loss has been observed in onion crops, for example, in Brazil.

The virus is transmitted by the onion thrips, _Thrips tabaci_. Thrips
are the most common and serious insect pest of onions. High
populations of thrips can reduce both yield and keeping quality of
crops. Thrips are most damaging when they feed during the early
bulbing stage of plant development. Both adults and nymphs cause
damage. Severe scarring also creates an entry point for foliar leaf diseases.

Spread of IYSV occurs with infected plant material and viruliferous
vector insects. Ornamentals and weeds may serve as pathogen
reservoirs since thrips may also feed on them. The virus appears not
to be seed transmitted. Tospovirus epidemiology is complex and
natural resistance appears to be rare amongst their plant hosts.
Management of IYSV and its vector includes the use of clean
propagative material, cultural practices, and pesticides.

It is reported above that symptoms were noticed for the 1st time in
Rheinland-Pfalz in 2003, but no action seems to have been taken then.
While the current outbreak may be due to a new incursion, IYSV may
well have persisted locally at low levels or in non-commercial hosts
until finally being diagnosed in samples from the 2007 onion crop.
