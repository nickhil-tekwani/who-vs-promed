Regarding the recent ProMED-mail post Panama disease, banana - China
(Southeast), I have 2 comments.
1. One of the URLs suggested by a moderator may require a
subscription for access. Articles at the following URLs are freely available:
<http://www.apsnet.org/online/feature/panama/>
and
<http://www.apsnet.org/online/feature/panama2/>
2. The outbreak in China is of tropical race 4 (refer to article at
2nd URL provided above), and is more serious than the Chinese article
might suggest.
