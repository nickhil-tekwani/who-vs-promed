[The article cited in the previous posting [20040525.1400] contained the
statement: "The cow in San Angelo was taken a rendering plant where the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates rendering plants,
approved it for use in swine feed. Swine are thought not to be susceptible
to mad cow disease." - Mod.TG]
This newspaper article makes the statement that 'Swine are not thought to
be susceptible to mad cow disease.' I would like to point out that swine
are not likely to become infected with BSE via oral exposure, but they are
susceptible to the agent via parenteral inoculation. The following study
describes this:
Studies of the transmissibility of the agent of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy to pigs. Gerald A. H. Wells, Stephen A. C. Hawkins, Anthony
R. Austin, Stephen J. Ryder, Stanley H. Done, Robert B. Green, Ian Dexter,
Michael Dawson and Richard H. Kimberlin
(<http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/4/1021>)
"Studies to test the transmissibility of the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) agent to pigs began in 1989. Parenteral inoculation of
the agent by 3 routes simultaneously (intracranially, intravenously, and
intraperitoneally) produced disease with an incubation period range of 69
and 150 weeks. Preclinical pathological changes were detected in 2 pigs
killed electively at 105 and 106 weeks post-inoculation.
Infectivity was detected by bioassay in inbred mice in the CNS of those
pigs that developed spongiform encephalopathy. Infectivity was also found
in the stomach, jejunum, distal ileum, and pancreas of terminally affected
pigs. These findings show that pigs are susceptible to BSE. In contrast,
disease did not occur in pigs retained for 7 years after exposure by
feeding BSE-affected brain on 3 separate days, at 1- and 2-week intervals.
The amounts fed each day were equivalent to the maximum daily intake of
meat and bone meal in rations for pigs aged 8 weeks. No infectivity was
found in tissues assayed from the pigs exposed orally. This included
tissues of the alimentary tract. It is suggested that these pigs did not
become infected. The relatively high oral exposure used in these
experiments compared with feed-borne exposure in the field may explain the
absence of an epidemic of spongiform encephalopathy in domestic pigs
concurrent with the BSE epidemic in the UK."
According to Matthews (cited below), the report of the 1st pig shown to be
infected with BSE in the above study led to immediate changes in rules in
the UK to exclude specified risk materials from the food of all domestic
livestock and pets.

While the questionable cow in San Angelo may have been approved for use in
swine feed, I would hazard a guess that this was after specified risk
material (brain, spinal cord, tonsil, thymus, spleen, and intestine) were
removed. I have no first-hand knowledge of the case, however.

[BSE can be experimentally produced in cattle -- and in this case in swine
-- by inoculating infected material into the brain, the peritoneal cavity,
and by intravenous injection. Swine develop a spongiform encephalopathy
from this type of agent introduction. However, swine fed the infected
material did not develop the clinical signs of the disease, but on assay
their tissues indicated the possibility of a prion disease. Therefore,
specified risk material was excluded from all animal and pet feeds in the
UK as a result of this experiment.
The cow in San Angelo, Texas, did not enter the human food chain. However,
the decision to incorporate the products into swine feed may not have been
scientifically justified.
Perhaps these studies will prompt FDA and USDA to re-evaluate current
rules. - Mod.TG]
