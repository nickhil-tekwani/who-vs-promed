Risk of HPAI H5N1 from Migratory Birds in the Pacific: Fiji
-----------------------------------------------
Below is a list of migratory birds that visit Fiji. Of the 4 abundant
species that visit annually, 3 over-winter while the bar-tailed
godwit passes through, mainly to New Zealand. These 4 species are all
shorebirds or waders and are considered a much lower risk for the
spread of avian influenza (HPAI) than migratory waterfowl (ducks,
geese and swans), which have been implicated in the recent spread of
HPAI H5N1 westwards across Central Asia and into Southern Europe.
There are no migratory waterfowl visiting Fiji's shores, which
indicates a relatively low risk of the introduction of HPAI by this
route.
I would like to request any similar information that may exist on
migratory bird species in other Pacific Island Countries and
Territories to give us a regional picture on the risk associated with
migratory birds.

[By posting the above data (for which Drs. Angus and Watling are
gratefully acknowledged), ProMED-mail does not imply that the
mentioned avian species are suspected as influenza virus carriers.
Recent responses, received mainly from bird-watchers, expressed
apprehension from postings relating to the possible role of migratory
birds in the spread of the current avian influenza panzootic and fear
that unjust damage to the image, or even to the very welfare of
wildlife, may follow. We feel that a lack of scientifically-based
data on the subject will cause more damage than responsibly and
objectively tackling the issue, keeping minds open. As recently
commented (see 20051031.3181), the precise identity of wild birds in
which avian influenza viruses are detected, their migratory patterns
and behavior are crucial to help direct surveillance activities in
wild birds and understand the epidemiology of influenza. It has also
been indicated (20051103.3211) that the spectrum of avian species to
be covered by the enhanced surveillance should be broad, not
restricted to _Anatidae_. All this could be done only if the gap
between virologists, epidemiologists and ornithologists is bridged,
leading to intensified interdisciplinary surveillance and research
activities while taking the welfare of wildlife and nature
preservation into consideration. - Mod.AS]

Malaysia rules out bird flu in 2nd health scare
-----------------------------------------------
Malaysian authorities on Wednesday [9 Nov 2005] ruled out bird flu in
a 2nd health scare involving the mysterious death of pigeons in the
country's northwest.
Flocks of pigeons have been found dead in 2 towns in neighboring
states over the past few days, raising fears of an outbreak of the
deadly H5N1 avian flu virus, which has killed 64 people in 4 nearby
Asian countries.
"It's all negative," Hawari Hussein, chief of veterinary services,
told Reuters, after his department ran tests for avian flu on samples
from some of a dozen birds found dead in Kedah state. He said they
still did not know what killed the birds.
Tests had already ruled out bird flu as the cause of death in the 1st
flock, found over the weekend [5-6 Nov 2005] in Perak state.
Malaysia last reported the H5N1 virus in an animal in northern
Kelantan state on 22 Nov 2004. No human cases have so far been
reported in Malaysia.
In January 2005, Malaysia declared itself free of bird flu.
The virus is already endemic in poultry in much of Asia and has
killed 42 people in Viet Nam, 13 in Thailand, 5 in Indonesia -- where
a 6th is suspected -- and 4 in Cambodia.
