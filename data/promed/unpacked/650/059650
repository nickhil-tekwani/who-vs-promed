Sindh banana crop under virus attack
-----------------------------------
Banana crops on thousands of acres in Sindh are under a severe virus
attack, and growers fear output might decline by up to 50 percent,
resulting in an increase in prices during Ramadan. Growers said the banana
bunchy top virus disease (BBTD) has damaged almost 70 percent of the banana
crop, and the situation is worsening daily.
"The whole of lower Sindh is under BBTD attack," said Qamar-uz-Zaman Shah,
chairman of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA). "The most recent attack
was witnessed on 650 acres of land in Sanghar, which produced 60 000 pieces
of banana per acre."
He said about 25 000 acres of land in Sindh produces quality bananas year
round. They are being sold at reasonable prices, but the virus attack would
cause a decline in production and a rise in prices. The recent outbreak was
not the 1st of its kind in the province, but this time it had hit the crop
exceptionally hard.
Shah immediately reported the outbreak to the authorities concerned,
including the Horticulture Research Institute in Mirpurkhas. Sindh has one
of the best banana producing lands, which cultivates 210 000 tons of the
fruit on over 25 000 hectares of land every year. Major banana production
districts in Sindh include Thatta, Hyderabad, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Sangar,
and Nawabshah. Cultivation has been extended recently from Kairpur to
Sakkur. The Basrai variety (Cavendish dwarf) and William Hybrid are grown
in Khairpur. According to growers, BBTD has affected all varieties, and
most farmers are losing hope and have even stopped spraying pesticides on
the standing crop.
"The current BBTD outbreak was not serious in Pakistan compared to other
parts of the world, such as Australia, Panama, Surinam, Central America,
India, and Colombia," said Shah. He said the disease was reported in 1988
from the Thatta district at Gorabari and Mirpur Sakro. Authorities appear
helpless, and they said BBTD damages banana crops annually, but the
research institutes so far have been unable to suggest any cure for the
disease.
"We have been experiencing BBTD for over a decade," said Arif Mustafa
Jatoi, Sindh minister for food and agriculture. "Unfortunately, there is no
cure or treatment for this disease, but Shah said our research institutes
are still working to solve the problem."
He said the ministry has received reports of crop damage from different
areas and taken every possible step to avoid further losses. But, the
minister said the banana-producing areas in lower Sindh faced more damage
than others.
Because of BBTD, consumers may have to pay more, as traders said the fruit,
which is 100 percent consumed locally, may see more than a 50 percent rise
in prices. They fear local crop damage would result in expensive bananas
particularly during Ramadan.

[The causal virus, banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), was 1st reported in
banana (_Musa_ spp.) in Fiji in 1879. It has subsequently spread throughout
the South Pacific, Asia (including north-eastern Australia), and Africa,
but has not appeared in Central or South America or in Western Australia.
BBTV is vectored by the banana aphid (_Pentalonia nigronervosa_). Disease
management is predicated on integrated pest management (IPM). Strategies
include long-term aphid control (killing of weed hosts for aphid control,
use of predators and parasites, control of aphids on alternate hosts),
frequent scouting for diseased plants, and destruction of diseased trees.
