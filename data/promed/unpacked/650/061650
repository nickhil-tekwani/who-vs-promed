Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, commonly referred to as Congo fever has claimed another life in Multan district of Punjab.

The Congo fever had claimed 2 lives in Multan, earlier this month [May 2018]. According to media reports, 6 patients affected by the dangerous virus were brought to Nishtar Hospital, one of them is dead and 2 others are under treatment.

All patients carrying Congo virus were kept in an isolated ward of Nishtar Hospital and their blood samples were sent to Islamabad's health laboratory for tests which identified the Congo virus attack.

Congo fever is a tick-borne viral disease which is mainly transferred to humans from pets. Its symptoms include fever, flu, bloody urine, vomiting, and nose bleeding.

[The fatal case numbers reported above do not tally as 2 fatal cases reported earlier from Nishtar Hospital, Multan (Punjab) which had tested negative for CCHF on laboratory testing (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (03): (Punjab), update 20180427.5771053). Taking into account the last reported fatal CCHF case from Karachi on 4 May 2018 (Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (04): (Sindh) 20180506.5783130), the total number of fatal cases confirmed for CCHF would be one.

According to information available from National Institute of Health, only one case of CCHF was confirmed over the last 10 days and the positive case was reported back as stable. It is important to share the information on patient outcome with clear reference to positive/negative laboratory confirmation so that pertinent epidemiological linkages can be established and appropriate response measures instituted in timely manner. - Mod.UBA
