A Canadian outbreak investigation revolves around salmonellosis linked to contact with pet bearded dragons. Public Health Agency of Canada says since January 2012, there have been 9 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Cotham reported in Canada.

The current investigation is focused on 4 recent cases of human illness in Alberta (2) and Ontario (2); 3 of 4 cases were children under 2 years of age. Of these 4 cases, 2 individuals were hospitalized and have recovered. No deaths have been reported. All 4 cases had direct or indirect contact with reptiles prior to becoming ill; 3 cases specifically reported exposure to pet bearded dragons. A similar outbreak is being investigated in the United States, where 132 people from 31 states have been infected.

Health officials advise the public the risk to Canadians is low, but reptile owners and anyone who is around these types of pets could be at risk if they don't take proper precautions.

Reptiles can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria but appear healthy and clean and show no signs of illness. Even having indirect contact with these animals or their environments can put you at risk for developing salmonellosis (for example, children playing in a room where a reptile was previously allowed to roam).

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk. Previously, the UK and the USA have reported human salmonellosis associated with bearded dragon exposures. The recently reported American outbreak was related to the same serotype, but the serotype was not mentioned in the Scottish cluster.

Pogona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.

And yes, owners let them out of their solariums to roam indoors like they do for their pet hamsters and parrots! A family I know had one and I saw it at their house. They are quite tame. - Mod.JW
