2 more cases of dengue fever have been reported in Townsville in the past 2
weeks, bringing the total number of people affected this summer [2004] to
26. They latest 2 cases were in Currajong; Heatley and Cranbrook are also
affected.
The Tropical Public Health Unit said while most people understood the
threat potted plant bases, old tyres, and containers held as potential
dengue breeding sites, it was bromeliad plants that were now emerging as a
catalyst to perpetuate the city's growing outbreak. "...Significant amounts
of breeding have been found in things like bromeliads," environmental
health director John Piispanen said. The [type of] plant is considered a
dengue danger because its sturdy leaves and flowers easily capture and
retain water. Mr Piispanen said the threat of dengue mosquitoes breeding in
the plant could be reduced by using repellent tablets, which were available
at [plant] nurseries, using surface spray on the plant, or simply regularly
rinsing it out with water.

Dengue fever cases up sharply in Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Viet Nam say the number of people diagnosed with dengue
fever has almost doubled this year [2004].
At least 5300 people have been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne infection
and 10 have died since the beginning of 2004, the Vietnam News Service
reports. Officials say that is a 91 percent increase over 2003, and most of
the cases have been reported from the southern part of the country.

[An APWire of 26 Mar 2004 reported that the Thanh Nien (Young People)
newspaper said that, according to the Ministry of Health, 5371 people
had contracted the disease so far in 2004, including 10 deaths, and that
more than 90 percent of the patients live in southern Vietnam, including
nearly 1500 cases in the southern commercial hub Ho Chi Minh City. - Mod.JW]

'No dengue epidemic in Delhi'
------------------------------------
Allaying fears of a dengue epidemic after some cases of the mosquito-borne
disease were reported from the capital, health officials said Thursday that
there was no cause for panic or alarm. "These are stray cases lingering
from the November-December period," said K N Tiwari, chief health officer,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).
Senior health officials were closeted with Delhi government officials
Thursday as reports of a possible dengue outbreak caused panic in the city.
This is the first time in 5 years that dengue cases are being reported from
Delhi in the February-March period. However, Tiwari sought to pacify the
residents of Delhi, saying that 4 cases did not in any way signal the onset
of a dengue epidemic. Officials added it was too hot for the female
_Aedes_ mosquito -- [which transmits] the disease -- to breed, leading
civic agencies like the MCD to go slow on their anti-larvae drives.
Dengue cases are [usually] reported in Delhi after June, just after the
onset of monsoons [rains] in the capital.

<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_29/en/>

From 1 Jan to 22 Mar 2004, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of
40 337 cases, including 507 deaths, mainly from provinces in Java, with 35
percent of the cases being reported from DKI Jakarta. ( see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_05/en/>).
Based on data received to date, it appears that the outbreak may have
peaked in Jakarta, Jawa Tenggah, and Nusa Tenggara Timur provinces.
However, in Jawa Barat, Bali, Sumatera Selatan, Lampung, Kalimantan Timur,
Sulawesi Seltan, and Nusa Tenggara Barat provinces, the number of monthly
reported cases still appears to be on the rise.
The local health authorities are conducting intensive vector control
activities including larviciding, space spraying, and mobilizing the
communities to reduce the _Aedes_ breeding containers. The Ministry of
Health is providing free hospital care to those patients presenting with
symptoms of dengue and without adequate financial resources.
WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and providing support with
laboratory diagnostics.
