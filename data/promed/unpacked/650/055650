The result of tests carried out in Eldorado consistent with the clinical
history of the patient, did not correspond to the cinical characteristics
of yellow fever [virus infection] said the director of the Epidemiology
Department of Public Health, Julio Estevez.

The official explained that not every fulminating death indicates that the
cause was the yellow fever [virus infection]. Estevez said that in the case
of the woman who died on 12 Jan [2009] after passing several hours
hospitalized in the Madariaga, there was a notification of a nonspecific
febrile case, which could be classified as yellow fever. He added that the
official record form did not indicate that she had a history of vaccination
or a history of travel, which is why they could not draw any conclusions
[concerning acquisition or etiology of the infection] on that basis.

Estevez said: "It [this case] was recognized as an acute fever that could
be compatible with multiple pathogens." The health official added that
"Once the official report was activated, work was done in the field, the
home of the victim was visited and [the officials] did not find any family
members. However environmental [mosquito vector] controls were done, and it
was found that the clinical history [indicated that] the patient was not
suffering from fever and it was not a nonspecific febrile syndrome."

He said, "However, the sample was processed as a probable case of yellow
fever in the reference laboratory for dengue and yellow fever, and there
was a negative result." In turn, the official said that was also sent to
the Institute Maiztegui Buenos Aires.

As for prevention, Estevez said that prevention begins with the yellow
fever vaccination, because no one is exempt in a risk area such as the one
where we are. Estevez noted that "yellow fever is a severe illness and the
patient's life is at risk." Also, the official noted that there may be the
coexistence of 2 diseases such as yellow fever and another disease, but
said that is not the most frequent situation.

Regarding the security measures that were taken with the suspected case,
Estevez said that "in the victim's house there were no family members but
no reservoirs [mosquito vectors] were found, also spraying [with
insecticide] was done in and around the home and a survey of fever cases in
the area was negative and therefore the case will be closed when [negative]
results are obtained from the Maiztegui [laboratory].

With regard to prevention, Estevez said it was continuing with vaccination,
cleanup operations and the elimination of all reservoirs [_Aedes_ mosquito
breeding sites] in the province. [Elimination of all _Aedes_ breeding sites
in the province would be a difficult challenge, indeed. - Mod. TY]

Monkeys
-------
More than 60 primates that died from yellow fever [virus infection] were
found from October 2008 with [issuance of] an alert in Soberbio, said Julio
Estevez. At the same time, he predicted that "[infected monkeys] will
continue to appear, or the chain of transmission will be cut because they
[the monkeys] die or because they survive the infection [and become immune]."

The epidemiology official said: "The risk zone runs to Corrientes,
including the cases in Itat√≠, a few kilometers from the capital of the
province."

He added that "we are coordinating with the various tasks comprising the
provinces and Argentine Nea-Noa [Argentine pastoral north west and north
east regions. - Mod.TY] bordering Argentina and Paraguay, Bolivia, and
Brazil which have had confirmed [yellow fever] cases."

[This report eliminates the possibility that this was a case of urban
acquired yellow fever virus infection (ProMED-mail archive no. 20081231.4119).
