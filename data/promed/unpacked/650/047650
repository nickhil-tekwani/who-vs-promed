A pair of sick swans at Boston's Charles River Esplanade were euthanized this week [last of June 2022], and 5 baby swans were later taken to a wildlife center to be evaluated, according to the city. The sick swans had avian flu, the city said, which has been blamed for other bird kills around the country this year [2022].

The Charles River Esplanade cases were reported by multiple people to Boston's Animal Care & Control Division, which investigated Monday [27 Jun 2022] and was able to capture the birds with help from the Boston Fire Department, a city representative said.

The birds were "quite ill," the representative said in a statement, and were euthanized.

On Wednesday [29 Jun 2022] morning, 5 cygnets -- the baby swans -- were rescued by animal control officials and taken to Cape Wildlife Center to be evaluated.

A new strain of bird flu has been alarming animal experts nationwide, killing wild birds, including bald eagles, and resulting in the culling of tens of millions of farm-raised chickens and turkeys since February [2022].

Earlier this month [June 2022], animal control officials on Tisbury in Martha's Vineyard issued an "avian influenza warning" after hundreds of dead cormorants washed up around the island. Bird flu was suspected and being tested for; the officials said a new strain of the virus could be a major issue that may take years to recover from.

Officials in Maine have issued a warning about the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Wildlife disease specialists have confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic Eurasian H5N1 avian influenza in 3 wild birds found in Colusa and Glenn counties.

The birds were collected by the US Fish and Wildlife Service on 5 Jul [2022] during a mortality event at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex and submitted to the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center for preliminary testing.

The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the detection of avian influenza H5N1 in 2 Canada geese and one American white pelican on 13 Jul [2022] and notified the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's (CDFW) Wildlife Health Laboratory.

These are the 1st detections of avian influenza H5N1 in wild birds in California. Although avian influenza viruses naturally circulate among waterbirds, the strain of H5N1 currently in circulation in the US and Canada has been causing illness and death in a higher diversity of wild bird species than during previous avian influenza outbreaks.

The virus also remains highly contagious for domestic poultry. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of avian influenza in domestic poultry in California.

According to data compiled by the USDA, avian influenza H5N1 has been detected in at least 1825 individual wild birds in 42 states and the District of Columbia since January 2022. Additionally, infection has been confirmed in 386 commercial and backyard domestic poultry and mixed-species flocks in 37 states.

Prior to its detection in North America, avian influenza H5N1 activity had been on the rise across Europe since October 2021.

Avian predators and scavengers may be exposed to avian influenza viruses when feeding on infected waterbirds. Infection with avian influenza viruses among songbirds, including many common backyard birds, appears to be rare. However, feeding and providing water to wild birds is discouraged, especially in the vicinity of backyard poultry or other captive birds such as ducks, geese, pigeons, doves, and parrots. Increased concentration of wild birds at feeders and bird baths may lead to fecal contamination of the local environment, which may aid in disease transmission.

Wild birds should be excluded from entering enclosures for domestic and pet birds, and food and water should not be shared between wild birds and domestic or pet birds.

CDFW's Wildlife Health Laboratory, in coordination with partners, is continuing to monitor wild bird populations for signs of illness and investigating mortality events. The public may report dead wild birds using CDFW's mortality reporting form.

For guidance on orphaned or injured live wild birds, contact the nearest wildlife rehabilitation center.

An informational flyer addressing frequently asked questions is available on CDFW's website.

Currently, the Center for Disease Control considers the transmission risk of avian influenza to people to be low but recommends taking basic protective measures such as wearing gloves and face masks and handwashing if contact with wild birds or domestic poultry cannot be avoided.

Practicing biosecurity is the most effective way to keep domestic poultry and pet birds healthy.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. - Mod.PMB]
