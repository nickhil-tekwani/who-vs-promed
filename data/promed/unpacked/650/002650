[1] Cholera, diarrhea - Somalia

Acute watery diarrhea in Somalia has killed hundreds of people in
2007, the Minister of Health said on Tue 20 Mar 2007, as aid agencies
warned the nation was in the midst of a cholera outbreak.
"The death toll is in the hundreds (but) we don't believe there is
cholera in the country," Health Minister Qamar Adan Ali told Reuters
by telephone from Baidoa in southern Somalia.
The WHO (World Health Organization), however, said in a report this
week that acute watery diarrhoea has killed 251 people and infected
5602 since January 2007. Aid agencies say there is an epidemic of
cholera -- a bacterial disease spread mainly through contaminated
water -- in the Horn of Africa nation. Late in 2006, Somalia was
ravaged by the worst flooding in decades.
"There has been a continued increase in cholera cases reported in and
around Mogadishu. Over 200 cases have been reported by one hospital,"
said David Gilmour, Somalia country director for the aid agency CARE
International. "More worryingly, until there is unrestricted
humanitarian access across Somalia it is difficult to know the true
scale of this and other problems which are going unreported," he said.
Insecurity after a war between Islamists and government troops backed
by Ethiopian armour has made humanitarian missions all but impossible
-- never the easiest work in a nation in anarchy since a 1991 coup
ended central rule.
Floods, insecurity and a war-damaged infrastructure combine to raise
the risk of cholera in Africa. The disease has infected some 12 000
people already in 2007, mainly in a belt spreading from Angola to Congo.

[2] Cholera - Somalia (Gedo, Banadir, Nugaal)

An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea in and around the town of
Bardhere, southwestern Somalia, has killed at least 80 people in the
past 3 weeks, medical sources said on Tue 20 Mar 2007. "Fifteen
people have died in hospital and over 70 died in the town and the
villages around it," Bashir Usman, a doctor in the town, said.
The Bardhere hospital, which has not functioned properly for the past
10 years, is being used as a treatment center for Bardhere and
surrounding villages, Usman said.
A cholera task force was set up by the authorities 2 weeks ago to
deal with the outbreak, according to Abdifatah Muhammad Ali, of
Himilo Relief and Development Association, a local non-governmental
agency and part of the task force.
Usman said since the registration began 10 days ago, the hospital had
recorded 630 cases. "That, however, does not necessarily reflect the
real numbers," he said. "Our information is that many more people,
who are unable to get to the treatment center, are dying around
Bardhere and in the villages."
Usman blamed the outbreak on contaminated water drawn from wells. "We
suspect the problem is the water people are drinking," he said.
Floods, mostly in late 2006, displaced thousands of people in the
region, with large tracts of farmland and water points submerged.
Usman said they had enough oral rehydration salts, "but if the
situation does not improve soon, we will need to get more resources
to contain the outbreak". He said they had noticed a drop in the
cases coming into the hospital. "In the last 24 hours we have
recorded 17 cases, as compared to 30-40 cases in the past."
In a report last week, the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs for Somalia said: "Between 1 Jan and 10 Mar
2007, the number of acute watery diarrhea cases registered in
south/central was 5542, with 252 deaths." It said fatalities were
decreasing in most regions, but the capital, Mogadishu, "remains an
area of serious concern, due to difficulties in accessing affected
populations".
The self-declared autonomous area of Puntland, in northeastern
Somalia, is also experiencing an increase in cases of acute watery
diarrhea, "with 504 cases and 19 deaths reported between 26 Feb and
14 Mar 2007", OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs) said.

[3] Cholera - Somalia (Banadir, Gedo, Lower Shabelle)

Doctors reported that as many as 22 people died in the past 24 (19-20
Mar 2007) hours in southern Somalia from a suspected cholera outbreak.
Doctors in Mogadishu and the southern Somalia towns of Afgoye and
Bardhere reported that 22 people died of cholera in their
jurisdictions or neighboring villages in the past 24 hours. A doctor,
Muse Shaikh Aden, reported that another 60 people have been admitted
to Bardhere's main hospital for treatment in the past 24 hours.
It is difficult to establish the full extent of the suspected cholera
outbreak because Somalia has not had a central medical authority for
16 years to coordinate a response to any disease outbreak or provide
details. The Horn of Africa nation has been mired in anarchy since
1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and then
turned on one another.

Senegalese authorities have recently disclosed a reoccurrence of an
outbreak of cholera, commonly known as "dirty hands disease."
Speaking on the outbreak, Professor Salif Sow, head of the Infectious
Diseases Service of the Fann Teaching Hospital in Dakar, disclosed
that 15 established cases of people affected by the cholera bacterium
have been registered in Dakar, one having since died.
Professor Sow, however, added that of the registered cases, 11 people
have already been treated and only 4 are still undergoing treatment
at the hospital. All the cases were confirmed after analysis made by
the laboratory of the bacteriology and infectious diseases clinic of
Fann Hospital in Dakar, said Professor Sow.
He pointed out that the cholera outbreak has also been noted in some
[other] areas -- Mbour, Bambey, Mbacke, and Touba, adding that all
the cases have been proved to [have originated in] Touba, where they
attended the grand Magal on 8 Mar 2007.
Health officials in the districts of Mbacke and Touba said the
outbreak of cholera is mainly caused by water consumption, which
[takes on great importance] every year as a result of the need of
millions of pilgrims who attend the grand Magal. This happens when
the water gets contaminated with germs and consumed by people. [The
officials noted] that the 1st cases of cholera in Senegal were
registered in Touba and Mbacke.
The Information and Education Health National Service has advised
people to be more cautious in matters of hygiene and to be vigilant
before the forthcoming Mauloud [when Senegalese Muslims celebrate the
birth of the prophet Mahomet. - CopyEd.MJ], scheduled for 31 Mar
2007, during which thousands of people are expected to gather to celebrate.

Addressing district leaders last week, Alfred Yayi, in charge of
community health in the district, said 2 people have died out of 7
cases reported since 5 Mar 2007 in what appears to be a fresh wave of
the cholera epidemic in the district.
Dr Yayi said tests were being done to ascertain the disease. He said
the district task force was investigating the outbreak of the
epidemic to find ways of combating it. Dr Yayi said among the victims
was a 50-year-old woman who died in Yei Hospital in South Sudan but
the body was returned to Yumbe.

Department of Public Health and Control of Diseases, Razao Simao, on
Fri 17 Mar 2007.
Speaking to ANGOP, the source stated that, although the rains
continue hitting the region, the hospitalization cases tend to
[decrease], a sign that the population is using hygiene and
prevention measures.
About 1485 cholera cases, from which 19 resulted in deaths, have been
reported since January 2007 in the whole province. "4 de Fevereiro"
ward is the most affected zone with 364 cases, Simao explained.
