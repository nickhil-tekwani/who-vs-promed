Dengue Fever in Bangladesh
--------------------------
DHAKA: Dengue, the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease has resurfaced
in Bangladesh again, claiming the lives of 12 persons over the last
fortnight, according to government health department officials here.
Confirming the deaths of at least 10 persons in the last 14 days, concerned
officials of the government health directorate and expert entomologists said
they expected the threat of the disease to continue at least till the end of
November. But Kanak Ranjan Talukder, the director of the Institute of
Communicable Disease Control, begs to differ. "It was predicted that the
dengue prevalence would continue during the post-monsoon season. If you look
at it from an epidemiological point of view, there is no need to worry," he
said. Dengue is primarily a disease of the tropics and is spread by _Aedes
aegypti_, a domestic day-biting mosquito, which prefers to feed on humans.
According to a directorate assessment, 77 people have died and the disease
has afflicted 4127 so far this year. Currently 239 people are receiving
treatment in different hospitals in the country. The disease first appeared
in July this year. An expert ascribed re-emergence of dengue to the failure
to cut off the transmission of the virus. He asserted that a substantial
section of the country's population is now exposed to more than one of the
four types of dengue virus. A country-wide survey conducted recently
indicated that in some places in the interior of Bangladesh, the density of
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito population was still quite high.

As Dengue Epidemics in the Americas Continue, PAHO Urges Preventive Efforts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON, DC: The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is asking people
all over the Americas to get rid of mosquito breeding sites to help reduce
the epidemics of dengue and its more serious form, dengue hemorrhagic fever,
that have broken out in many countries. "If people eliminate breeding sites
for mosquitoes, such as water containers, old tires, and other recipients,
the incidence of the disease will be reduced. Schoolchildren and adolescents
can help make these actions sustainable", said Dr. Stephen Corber, Director
of the Division of Communicable Diseases of the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO). "With little or no expenditure, members of every family
can easily eliminate mosquito breeding sites without using chemical
products" by emptying containers, cleaning up trash sites, and keeping water
storage jugs covered, he added.
Worldwide, dengue is a growing public health problem affecting more than 100
countries, with over 50 million cases reported each year, including 500 000
hospitalizations and around 20 000 deaths. Four types of dengue, or
serotypes, are now circulating in the Americas, where cases skyrocketed from
66 000 in 1980 to more than 717 000 in 1998. According to the latest PAHO
figures, 282 643 cases of dengue have been reported in the Americas so far
this year, including 2960 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be
fatal. There have been 51 deaths.
The countries of Latin America that have reported dengue cases, and their
incidence, or cases per 100 000 population, include: Argentina, with 565
cases, incidence 1.53; Bolivia, 73 cases, incidence 0.88; Brazil, 184 226
cases, incidence 108.29; Colombia, 10 934, incidence 25.84; Costa Rica,
2313, incidence 57.49; Dominican Republic, 1437 cases, incidence 16.92;
Ecuador, 21 031, incidence 166.31; El Salvador, 2787 cases, incidence
44.41; Guatemala, 6660 cases, incidence 58.50; Honduras, 5037 cases,
incidence 77.67; Mexico, 1324 cases, incidence 1.34; Nicaragua, 5,232
cases, incidence 103.11; Panama, 221 cases, incidence 7.74; Paraguay,
24 282, incidence 441.81; Peru, 1103 cases, incidence 4.30, and Venezuela,
11,801 cases, incidence 48.82. Cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Brazil (37), Colombia (803), Dominican Republic (27), El
Salvador (278), Guatemala (18), Honduras (81), Mexico (15), Nicaragua (403),
and Venezuela, (1298).
The dengue situation in Central America is getting progressively worse,
according to Dr. Jorge R. Arias, PAHO's Regional Advisor on Communicable
Diseases, and the rainy season, which lasts through the end of November, is
adding to the number of mosquito breeding sites. "There is a risk that this
epidemic will extend to other countries, due to the high mobility of people
through these countries and the high indices of vector infestation," Dr.
Arias said. "All countries should strengthen their epidemiological
surveillance and take all available measures to reduce infestation by _Aedes
aegypti_," he added.
In the Caribbean, the countries that have reported dengue cases, and their
incidence, are: Anguilla, 3 cases, incidence 37.50; Barbados, 372 cases,
incidence 137.78; Belize, 3 cases, incidence 1.24; British Virgin Islands, 2
cases, incidence 9.52; Curacao, 10 cases, incidence 4.62; Dominica, 1 case,
incidence 1.41; French Guiana, 74 cases, incidence 42.53; Grenada, 20 cases,
incidence 21.51; Guadaloupe, 8 cases, incidence 1.75; Guyana, 19 cases,
incidence 2.21; Jamaica, 8 cases, incidence 0.31; Martinique, 70 cases,
incidence 17.72
Dengue is transmitted when the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ bites an infected
person, and after 8 to 12 days of incubation, the infected mosquito bites
another person and transmits the virus. Infected people suffer high fever,
severe headaches, muscular and joint pains, and skin rashes. PAHO experts
say that anyone who presents one or more of the following symptoms after
having suffered dengue should go immediately to a hospital or health center
because they are at risk of having dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be
fatal: Intense and continuous stomach pain, vomiting, restlessness,
lethargy, a sharp drop in temperature, cold skin, or fainting.

Dengue fever confirmed in Montserrat?
-------------------------------------
Although I'm not a health professional (I'm a physicist) I've been reading
the ProMED-mail list for years now. Another of my interests is the small,
volcano
ravaged Caribbean island of Montserrat. The two interests coincided today.
In the Radio Montserrat (ZJB) web cast
[<http://www.mratgov.com/newsradio.htm> for 16 Oct 2000, a statement from
the Acting Health Officer, Franklin Perkins, indicated that dengue fever had
been confirmed on the island by the Caribbean Epidemiology Center on
Trinidad [<http://www.carec.org>.
I have checked The Montserrat Reporter
[<http://www.montserratreporter.org/> the only newspaper (weekly), and the
CEC site, but have not found a written report yet, so all I have to go on is
the audio stream from Radio Montserrat. I guess this would have to be
counted as a unconfirmed and detail-less "head's up."

51 Cases, Two Deaths Due to Hemorrhagic Dengue Fever Reported In Honduras
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: Honduran health authorities are looking into the first 2
deaths apparently caused by an outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever, of
which 51 cases have been reported throughout the country, spokesmen said
Friday. One of the victims, a 68-year-old man from Moroceli, in eastern
Honduras, died Thu 12 Oct 2000 at Tegucigalpa's Teaching Hospital,
exhibiting all of the symptoms of the disease.
Though the Forensic Medicine Unit of the Attorney General's Office concluded
the victim died of [dengue hemorrhagic fever, Health Ministry laboratories
have not confirmed the diagnosis. Officials are also looking into the death
of a child also attributed to the disease. Honduras' Health Ministry has
declared a preventive state of emergency in response to the dengue outbreak,
which is not yet officially considered an epidemic. The incidence of the
disease, which primarily affects children, is growing, as is that of the
less dangerous classic dengue, of which 5037 cases have been reported.
Metropolitan Health Area chief Nerza Paz said in Tegucigalpa, where
hemorrhagic dengue is most prevalent, that 36 cases have been confirmed and
89 are under study.
