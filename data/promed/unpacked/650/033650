Abstract
Assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 6068 hierarchically coded NPIs implemented in 79 â€‰territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We propose a modelling approach that combines 4 computational techniques merging statistical, inference and artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with 2 external datasets recording 42 151 additional NPIs from 226 countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown). Using country-specific what-if scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.

[Globally, many countries have implemented a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as we wait for an effective vaccine. Bo et al reported that any type of NPI, namely mandatory face masks in public, isolation or quarantine, social distancing and traffic restrictions, may reduce the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing seemed more effective than the other 3 types of NPIs. The simultaneous implementation of 2 or more types of NPIs may be more effective for containing the spread of COVID-19 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322700]. Still others have compared interventions such as school and business closures to have somewhat variable impact, showing that closing schools and universities was highly effective, as was banning gatherings and closing high-risk businesses, but closing most other businesses had limited further benefit, and that many countries may have been able to reduce R below 1 without issuing a strict curfew or stay-at-home order [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101 /2020.05.28.20116129v4].

Given that effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and global availability of vaccines is not likely for months, NPIs are essential components of the public health response to ongoing outbreaks. Early detection and isolation of cases is one of the most effective response measures to prevent more infections, better than travel restrictions and contact reductions alone, but integrated NPI strategies in the local or country context can help achieve the strongest and most rapid impact. - Mod.UBA]

[2] COVID-19 Vaccine effectiveness
Date: 18 Nov 2020

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/early-trial-results-show-sinovac-vaccine-triggers-immune-response


Sinovac Biotech's experimental COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered a quick immune response, but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease, early trial results showed on Wed 18 Nov 2020. While the early to mid-stage trials were not designed to assess the efficacy of CoronaVac, researchers said it could provide sufficient protection, based on their experience with other vaccines and data from preclinical studies with macaques.

CoronaVac and 4 other experimental vaccines developed in China are currently undergoing late-stage trials to determine their effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.

The Sinovac findings, published in a peer-reviewed paper in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, came from results in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in China involving more than 700 participants. "Our findings show that CoronaVac is capable of inducing a quick antibody response within 4 weeks of immunisation by giving 2 doses of the vaccine at a 14-day interval," said Zhu Fengcai of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Nanjing and one of the authors of the paper.

CoronaVac is one of 3 experimental COVID-19 vaccines China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under its emergency use programme. "We believe that this makes the vaccine suitable for emergency use during the pandemic," Zhu said in a statement published alongside the paper. Among the Phase II trials limitations, the researchers noted that only healthy adults were involved and that the study did not include individuals from groups known to be more susceptible to COVID-19 including people of 60 years of age or more, or with other underlying diseases.

It also did not assess T-cell responses, which they said would form part of the Phase III trials in Brazil. Phase III trials are also under way in Indonesia and Brazil, which has reported the most coronavirus cases in the world after the United States and India. Findings from those large, late-stage studies would be crucial to determine whether the immune response generated by CoronaVac was sufficient to protect people from the coronavirus infection, the scientists said.

Naor Bar-Zeev from Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study, said the results must be interpreted with caution until Phase III results are published. "But even then, after Phase III trial completion and after licensure, we should prudently remain cautious," he said.

The 2 other vaccines in China's emergency programme, both developed by institutes linked to Sinopharm, and another vaccine from CanSino Biologics, were also shown to be safe and triggered immune responses in early and mid-stage trials, according to peer-reviewed papers.

Gang Zeng, a Sinovac researcher involved in the CoronaVac study, said the vaccine could be an attractive option because it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of between 2-8 C (36-46 F) and may remain stable for up to 3 years. "It would offer some advantages for distribution to regions where access to refrigeration is challenging," Gang said.

Sinovac is running late stage, large-scale trials of its experimental vaccines in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey. By contrast, vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus and require far colder storage. Pfizer's vaccine must be stored and transported at -70 C [-94 F], though it can be kept in a normal fridge for up to 5 days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. Moderna's candidate is expected to be stable at normal fridge temperatures for 30 days, but for storage of up to 6 months it needs to be kept at -20 C [-4 F].

CoronaVac is also being considered by Brazil and Indonesia for inoculations in the coming months. Indonesia has sought emergency authorisation to start a mass vaccination campaign by the end of the year [2020], and vaccines produced by Sinovac and China's Sinopharm are slated to be used in the early stages of the campaign. Brazil's Sao Paulo is set to begin importing the 1st of 46 million doses of China's Sinovac vaccine against COVID-19 this week and plans to roll out CoronaVac as early as January [2021].

[The actual impact of the various vaccines in affected and susceptible populations can only be fully understood once they are implemented in various countries and across various population groups. The great achievement that has emerged in this pandemic is the whole range of vaccines that have been explored and are finally being put through emergency evaluations before being rolled out. The way the situation looks like right now, the sooner the better, and definitely the safer the better! - Mod.UBA]

[3] Specificity of lateral flow tests
Date: 11 Nov 2020
Source: Live Science [edited]
https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-show-high-specificity-and-are


Extensive clinical evaluation from Public Health England [PHE] and the University of Oxford show lateral flow tests are accurate and sensitive enough to be used in the community, including for asymptomatic people. Lateral flow tests are rapid turnaround tests that can process COVID-19 samples on site without the need for laboratory equipment, with most generating results in under half an hour. These new tests are being piloted across England, including a 2-week whole-city pilot in Liverpool, which was launched last week.

The swabbing and processing of these tests must currently be conducted at a dedicated testing site by trained personnel. The devices are designed to be intuitive and require minimal training to operate, and PHE and the University of Oxford are now looking at how this test could be self-administered.

PHE's Porton Down lab and University of Oxford undertook this work and have since been putting a number of tests through a 4-phase assessment process. This includes the test being used in Liverpool and those that are being sent to directors of public health across the country to use for their local communities. They are also being used in schools, universities, and workplace settings.

A total of 40 different lateral flow devices were put forward, of which 9 met the criteria to continue to full evaluation. Six made it to the 3rd phase, and the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, the test being used in the Liverpool pilot, is nearing completion of the 4-stage process.

PHE Porton Down's labs have shown 4 lateral flow tests to have a sensitivity of more than 70% of all PCR positive cases but importantly catch all those with high viral loads, meaning they are effective in identifying the cases who are infectious and are most likely to transmit the disease. The fast turnaround also allows positive people to isolate quickly also reducing spread.

The evaluation published today [11 Nov 2020] concludes that the Innova and other tests that meet PHE and Oxford's standards should be used in asymptomatic persons, as they offer the advantage of reducing risk and increasing capacity in addition to Lighthouse and NHS labs.

The results of the Innova evaluation published today show:
- The specificity of the test was recorded as 99.68%; the overall false positive rate was 0.32%, although this was lowered to 0.06% in a lab setting.
- It has an overall sensitivity of 76.8% for all PCR positive individuals but detects over 95% of individuals with high viral loads and minimal difference between the ability of the test to pick up viral antigens in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

Sensitivity means the proportion of people with a disease that have a positive test, whereas specificity means the proportion of people without the disease that have a negative test.

Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said: "The data in this validation report demonstrate that these inexpensive, easy to use tests can play a major role in our fight against COVID-19. They identify those who are likely to spread the disease and when used systematically in mass testing could reduce transmissions by 90%. They will be detecting disease in large numbers of people who have never previously even received a test."

[The antigen testing kits offer distinct advantages to improve the testing capacity in countries that have limited resources and diverse availability of molecular testing capacity.

Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection. Antigen tests are currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens placed directly into the assay's extraction buffer or reagent. The currently authorized antigen tests have many advantages; they are not restricted to use on persons of a certain age, are relatively inexpensive, and can be used at the point-of-care. The currently available devices return results in approximately 15-20 minutes.

However, the antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than viral tests that detect nucleic acid using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Proper interpretation of antigen test results is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of potentially infected persons when used for screening for asymptomatic COVID-19.

As for using the antigen tests for screening for asymptomatic individuals, there are limited data to guide the use of rapid antigen tests as screening tests on asymptomatic persons to detect or exclude COVID-19 or to determine whether a previously confirmed case is still infectious, and the current WHO and CDC recommendations do not advise antigen testing in these cases. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 18 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov18_1605788404.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 36.6% of daily case numbers and 21.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 23.5 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Other countries/territories reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica and Panama. And countries reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 45.7% of daily case numbers and 59.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 15.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (18 Nov 2020) include Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, UK, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Ukraine.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.9% of daily case numbers and 9.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.6 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Tunisia, and UAE. Libya, Palestinian Authority, and Kuwait each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia has not reported any cases in the last few days.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.41 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Congo Republic (Brazzaville), Cabo Verde, Mayotte, Angola, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.84% of daily case numbers and 0.51% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.81 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, Guam, China, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 8.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.1 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: There is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region with combined reports from these 2 regions representing over 82% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (173 768), India (45 439), Brazil (35 645), Italy (34 283) and France (28 383) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 977 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (17-18 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, India, Brazil, Italy, France, Russia (20 985), Germany (20 801), Poland (19 883), UK (19 609), Sweden (0 report), Iran (13 421), Ukraine (12 496), Spain (11 064), Argentina (10 332) and Romania (10 269). A total of 60 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 60 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 36.5%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase. This appears to have slowed down with reduced reporting over the weekend although there is an increase today (18 Nov 2020), especially in reported deaths. as the non-reporting countries begin to report. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.UBA
