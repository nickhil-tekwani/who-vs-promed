300 cases of measles have been recorded in the area of the Idiofa Health zone in the course of a month. This was announced by the Director of the Idifa Health Zone, Dr Willy Musantu on Sat 24 Nov 2013 at a meeting of committee members held last weekend in this city of the province of Bandundu.

5 of the 39 areas that make up this Health Zone have been affected by measles. These areas are: Bujimbila, Mbangi, Ingundu-Impini, Kimpata-Nkoy, and St. Lwanga. Bujimbila is the hardest hit of the 5.

The Surgeon General of the Idiofa Health Zone deplored the lack of medicines to support the sick. "The Health Zone had provided a small quantity of drugs already, and these have been made available cost-free for patients in the area most affected, the Bujimbila district. This was inadequate, however, and insufficient to cover the whole district. A team from Medecins sans Frontieres has also distributed drugs free of charge. According to WHO figures, this outbreak is 60-fold greater than expected.

[Previously, in Measles update (47) [5], regarding measles cases in Alberta, the moderator commented: "Curiously, the above press report announces that the number of measles cases in South Alberta has risen to 32 and simultaneously says that the medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services in the Calgary area tells 660 News that not one case of measles has been reported here since the outbreak began a month ago. Clarification of the situation would be appreciated." Maureen Kano has provided the following comment. - Mod.CP]:

The 32 cases of measles have all occurred in the Alberta South Zone, which is separate from the Calgary Zone, so the statement of no cases in Calgary may well be accurate. The Medical Officer of Health for the South Zone is Dr. Vivien Suttorp. The highest concentration of the specific non-immunizing group currently affected by the measles outbreak is in the south, hence, the focus and concern specifically in this area.

It's been just over 5 weeks since local Alberta Health Services' officials opened a measles assessment centre outside Chinook Regional Hospital to help deal with an outbreak of the disease in southern Alberta that was discovered in early October 2013. Since the 1st case was identified, more than 40 people have been confirmed as having measles in our local area. In that time, dozens of others have been assessed, and hundreds more have been immunized.

A massive public education campaign is ongoing; mobile assessment teams of paramedics and registered nurses were sent out into the community to help identify cases and offer care instruction. The measles assessment centre is closed but can reopen immediately should numbers begin to climb again.

Officials are cautiously optimistic that we've seen the worst of the outbreak, but they're also monitoring the situation 24 hours a day and are ready to move at a moment's notice.

I would like to thank all the local people involved in containing this measles outbreak and safeguarding the health of all southern Albertans. This area was "ground zero" of the outbreak and I am extremely impressed with the way it's been dealt with, not just in terms of the outbreak itself but also in helping folks understand measles and the benefits of vaccination. I know this has caused a lot of sleepless nights for a lot of health-care professionals, and I want them all to know that their efforts are appreciated. On behalf of all southern Albertans and the Alberta government, thank you and keep up the good work!

Southern NSW (New South Wales) Local Health District's (SNSWLHD) Director of Public Health, Tracey Oakman, said that a woman with measles in Eden had spent some time in the community without knowing she had the disease and that she was infectious.

"The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is typically around 10 days but can be as long as 21 days. There may be other cases in the community now or people who will be developing symptoms over the next few weeks. Measles is highly infectious and is spread through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough and sore red eyes, which usually last for several days before a red, blotchy rash appears. Complications can range from an ear infection and diarrhoea to pneumonia or swelling of the brain," Ms Oakman said.

She advised parents of infants, or other people who aren't fully vaccinated against measles, to be on the lookout for symptoms. "Anyone with measles should not to go school, work or go out in public. If you think you might be infected, you should see a doctor, but call ahead to make sure you don't infect others at the doctor's surgery," Ms Oakman said.

"Measles is now a rare disease, but it is important to emphasise it is currently circulating in the community and that people who have not had 2 doses of vaccine may be at risk. We encourage anyone who has not previously been vaccinated to do so. Children should receive 2 doses of vaccine, one at 12 months and the 2nd at 18 months. Children over 18 months who have not had their 2nd dose of measles vaccine can be vaccinated now. Anyone born after 1966 should have 2 doses of vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. If you haven't already been immunised, NSW Health offers free MMR (measles mumps and rubella) vaccine through GPs for people up to 47 years of age," said Tracey Oakman.

South Australia (SA) has been hit with an unexpected spike in influenza numbers as well as highly contagious measles, spread by people who caught these infections on holidays in Bali [Indonesia].

SA Health says there have been 156 cases of flu reported this week compared with 124 the previous week, and there now are 10 cases of measles in the past month linked to Bali holiday-makers. SA Health has put out an alert for people to check their [measles] vaccination status before travelling overseas, following the reports linked to the Indonesian island of Bali.

SA Health Chief Medical Officer Professor Paddy Phillips said 3 more cases of the highly infectious virus [measles], linked to cases from earlier this month [November 2013], have been confirmed. "Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing and is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised," Professor Phillips said. "Immunisation provides the best protection against measles, and it's vital that everyone born after 1966 makes sure they've had 2 doses of the measles vaccine to protect themselves and the community. We are encouraging everyone in this age group to check their vaccination records and request the vaccine if there is no record of them receiving 2 doses. In SA, children receive their 1st measles vaccination at 12 months and a 2nd one at either 18 months old or 4 years old."

The latest 3 cases have reported visiting places in the Adelaide CBD [central business district], southern suburbs, and McLaren Vale during their infectious periods. "Given that we are seeing an increased number of cases and that the possible exposures may not have occurred in just these areas, it is important that everyone is alert for symptoms," Prof. Phillips said.

"The illness begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body. Complications of measles can be severe. If anyone develops these symptoms, they should go call their doctor for advice, to organise assessment, and, if necessary, for laboratory testing. SA Health has contacted a number of other people known to have been exposed to the cases during the infectious period.
