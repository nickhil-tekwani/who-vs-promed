[My comment today is essentially the same as yesterday's except with an updating of the numbers of cases reported. Hence, with today's addition of 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection all from Riyadh it raises the total number of confirmed cases reported from Riyadh since the beginning of August 2015 to 81 (out of 84 cases reported from all of Saudi Arabia during this period) and the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 1141, including 487 deaths. One of the cases reported today (no. 6) is in a healthcare worker. Another one of the cases (no. 1) did not give a history of contact with other known case(s) -- like yesterday, the question that arises is whether this is a case reported from another hospital that did not have contact with the King Abdulaziz Medical City hospital in the 14 days prior to onset of his illness. Presumably this information will be available in future update reports from WHO.

Remembering the media report in yesterday's update that mentioned there were an additional 20 suspected cases pending confirmation and possibly additional healthcare workers, if true, we should expect to continue to have more cases reported on a daily basis over the coming days. With the closure of the implicated emergency room and outpatient facilities at the affected hospital, we should start seeing a tapering off of reported cases after an incubation period (14 days) has passed from the time of closure of the facilities.

A map showing the location of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL above. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3596073,131. - Mod.MPP]

Two Pinay nurses in Riyadh hospital's ICU due to MERS-CoV
---------------------------------------------------------
Two Filipino nurses have been confined at the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in Saudi Arabia after contracting the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Department of Foreign Affairs [edited] confirmed on Friday [21 Aug 2015].

DFA spokesman Charles Jose told GMA News Online that the Philippine Embassy received an assurance from the hospital in Riyadh that the 2 nurses were receiving the "best medical treatment possible."

"[The] hospital is well-equipped with comprehensive treatment and facilities for MERS cases," Jose said in a text message.

Earlier in August [2015], the DFA confirmed that 5 Filipino paramedics who were reported to have contracted MERS-CoV were "doing well and recovering" while in isolation.

A study published on Wednesday [19 Aug 2015] claimed that a DNA vaccine for MERS-CoV is in the works and may be ready for human trials by the end of 2015. [See section [4] below for details. - Mod.MPP]

[Since June 2015, when this outbreak began according to the MOH press release of several days ago, there have been a total of 8 laboratory confirmed cases in healthcare workers in Riyadh. Of these 8 cases reported to date (all reported since 21 Jul 2015, the starting date I've been using for the marked increase in cases reported from Riyadh), 6 were reported to have been expat healthcare workers. During this same period there was an additional healthcare worker confirmed as having a MERS-CoV infection in Najran. These may be the 7 healthcare workers referred to in the above media reports. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Saudi Arabia, WHO expert to arrive for assessment - media report

WHO official coming to assess MERS outbreak
-------------------------------------------
An expert from the World Health Organization (WHO) will arrive in Riyadh next week [week of 24 Aug 2015] to assess the latest spike in infections and deaths from the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

This is according to Izz Al-Din Muhseini, the Kingdom's WHO representative, who also issued assurances that the Ministry of Health has made every effort to contain the virus inside the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, the health facility at the center of the surge in cases over the past week.

The WHO expert would evaluate the measures taken by the ministry, and participate in meetings held by ministry officials, Muhseini was quoted as saying by a local publication on Friday [21 Aug 2015].

Muhseini said the ministry is dealing with the WHO in a transparent manner, which should see a fall in MERS cases. He said the virus, like any other, must be countered with preventive measures.

He urged the public to follow the health guidelines issued by the ministry, which includes avoiding infected camels. He said breeders must boil camel milk properly before consumption.

Muhseini said the Health Ministry has been able to contain the MERS virus, and the latest infections and deaths were isolated cases. The concern now is to ensure the virus does not spread in health facilities, which would place patients and older people with respiratory problems at risk.

He said ministry officials have been taking "strict" measures inside hospitals to curb the virus, including providing specific training for health professionals.

[4] Saudi Arabia, increasing cases and the Hajj - media report

MERS Cases Increasing in Saudi Arabia, And The Hajj Is Coming
-------------------------------------------------------------
When last we checked in on the elusive disease MERS -- Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a virus related to the cause of the worldwide SARS epidemic in 2003 -- it had been brewing in the Gulf states for 3 years, but was triggering international alarm because of an outbreak in Korea.

That was in June [2015]. There has not been a case of MERS in Korea since July [2015]. But rather suddenly, the virus has picked up activity in the country where it got started, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And that's a concern, because in a month, Saudi Arabia will host millions of temporary visitors from all over the world, making the obligatory pilgrimage known as the hajj. [The Hajj is estimated to be during the period 21-26 Sep 2015.]

Earlier in the MERS outbreak, there was international criticism (some of it written by me [Maryn McKenna]) that the Kingdom's government was being parsimonious with information about where the infection was going. As a result, the Saudi Ministry of Health now makes near-daily online reports of any MERS cases. Beginning in June [2015], things had been quiet, with no new cases reported, or at most, one per week. And then, in mid-July [2015], the numbers began to tick up again: 2 cases on [13 Jul 2015], 1 on [16 Jul 2015], 1 on [21 Jul 2015], 2 on [22 Jul 2015], 2 on [23 Jul 2015], and so on. There has been at least one case every day since [3 Aug 2015], usually more -- altogether, 76 new confirmed cases this month [August 2015].

[There were screenshots from http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx?PageIndex=1 inserted in the text to show the daily numbers of newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

The new run of cases is centered in one city and one hospital: King Abdulaziz Medical City, in Riyadh, the capital. This is important because, in the original MERS cases, and also in the recent Korean outbreak, hospitals were the nexus of infection, the place where the virus was exchanged between sick people, healthy companions and family members, and healthcare workers. Dr. Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director general of the WHO, said of the Korean outbreak in June [2015]: "In some instances there was close and prolonged contact between people who had infection and people who did not have infection, so for example other patients, visitors, healthcare workers in emergency rooms, so under crowded conditions and for prolonged periods of time."

According to Agence France Presse earlier this week [link to article provided: http://news.yahoo.com/saudi-mers-infections-soar-ahead-hajj-pilgrimage-100219590.html], the hospital has closed its emergency department, hoping to prevent cycling of the illness from infected to uninfected people. But, according to the daily records on the Ministry site, most of the people becoming infected are not hospital personnel. The Ministry doesn't specify where it thinks people got infected, other that to indicate Yes or No in a category headed "Contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the community or hospitals," as in this tally from Monday [17 Aug 2015]:

[A screenshot of the 17 Aug 2015 MOH update available at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2015-08-17-001.aspx - Mod.MPP]

Whether the source of the infection is the community or the hospital, neither is good news. If the hospital: Saudi Arabia has been experiencing MERS cases since mid-2012; by now, it ought to understand how healthcare transmission can be prevented. (For history, here's my original post, with an explanation of the troubling echoes of the SARS epidemic -- available at: http://www.wired.com/2012/09/coronavirus-memory-sars/.) If the community: The hajj brings an estimated 2 million people to the Kingdom, mixing in very close quarters. The government pours enormous resources into maintaining pilgrims' health, screening travelers and setting up temporary hospitals near the holy sites, but the hajj nevertheless represents prime conditions for the spread of a respiratory disease.

The fretting about possible MERS transmission during the hajj is not new: It has been a concern every year since the disease was 1st identified. For the 1st 3 of those years, the world has been fortunate, and we can hope that will be true this year as well. But there is still no specific treatment for MERS and no rapid test, and a potential vaccine is in the earliest stages of research. For those of us outside Saudi Arabia, there isn't much to do except keep watching the numbers, and hope.

[An excellent assessment and overview of the current situation, and raises valid points and concerns moving forward. Prior to the outbreak in South Korea, importations of active MERS-CoV infected individuals into countries resulted in a few close contact cases, but did not result in ongoing transmission in the countries where the cases were imported. But the South Korea experience, with 186 total confirmed cases including 36 deaths, was a reminder of the SARS-CoV importations and resultant outbreaks in areas where the importations occurred during 2003.

Of note is a media report in which there is mention that Saudi Arabia is going to ban the slaughter of camels as part of the Hajj rituals this year as part of MERS-CoV prevention activities (see http://www.albawaba.com/editorchoice/keep-camel-alive-if-you-want-survive-saudi-ban-sacrificing-camels-during-hajj-prevent-s). - Mod.MPP]

[5] Experimental vaccine - NIAID press release

NIH Scientists and Colleagues Successfully Test MERS Vaccine in Monkeys and Camels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and colleagues report that an experimental vaccine given 6 weeks before exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) fully protects rhesus macaques from disease. The vaccine also generated potentially protective MERS-CoV antibodies in blood drawn from vaccinated camels. A study detailing the synthetic DNA vaccine appears in the [19 Aug 2015] Science Translational Medicine. MERS-CoV, which causes pneumonia deep in the lungs, emerged in 2012 and has sickened more than 1400 people and killed 500, mostly in the Middle East and Asia.

Led by NIH-funded University of Pennsylvania scientists, the research team developed the investigational MERS vaccine by learning from previous vaccine studies of another coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS sickened more than 8000 people and killed more than 700 in 2003. The experimental MERS vaccine uses the S spike protein to generate immunity; because MERS-CoV undergoes mutations, the scientists created a "consensus" S protein by comparing all available MERS-CoV protein sequences. This synthetic protein has shown broad protection against different MERS-CoV types, the scientists report. Collaborators included researchers from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of Intramural Research; Public Health Agency of Canada; Inovio Pharmaceuticals; the University of Washington; and the University of South Florida.

The rhesus macaques received low or high doses of the vaccine, although results showed no significant differences between the groups and antibody responses appeared after 1 or 2 immunizations regardless of dose. Next, the group plans to explore how to condense the 6-week timeframe to establish protection, and they are hopeful the vaccine will become a candidate for use in camels and people.

[The published results on this new DNA vaccine are promising. The questions to be addressed in the future include safety issues for use in humans and dromedary camels, and will the same results seen in nonhuman primates be seen in humans and in camels. Reviewing the cycles of outbreaks occurring in the Middle East -- there are the sporadic cases (presumed to be associated with contact with dromedary camels that are actively infected with the MERS-CoV and perhaps with other mammal infections such as bats) and then once a human is infected, household contacts are infected, and those seeking medical care become index cases for nosocomial outbreaks. Hence, the need for both dromedary camel vaccines as well as human vaccines is there.

"Abstract
First identified in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by an emerging human coronavirus, which is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and represents a novel member of the lineage C betacoronoviruses. Since its identification, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been linked to more than 1372 infections manifesting with severe morbidity and, often, mortality (about 495 deaths) in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and, most recently, the United States. Human-to-human transmission has been documented, with nosocomial transmission appearing to be an important route of infection. The recent increase in cases of MERS in the Middle East coupled with the lack of approved antiviral therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent this infection are causes for concern. We report on the development of a synthetic DNA vaccine against MERS-CoV. An optimized DNA vaccine encoding the MERS spike protein induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, macaques, and camels. Vaccinated rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly and exhibited high levels of virus-neutralizing activity. Upon MERS viral challenge, all of the monkeys in the control-vaccinated group developed characteristic disease, including pneumonia. Vaccinated macaques were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia. These studies demonstrate that a consensus MERS spike protein synthetic DNA vaccine can induce protective responses against viral challenge, indicating that this strategy may have value as a possible vaccine modality against this emerging pathogen." - Mod.MPP]
