Indonesia: Another Human Avian Influenza Death Suspected
-----------------------------------------------
A 25-year-old Indonesian woman who died has tested positive for avian
influenza, a senior researcher at the Health Ministry said on Wed 30 Nov
2005. Endang Mamahit said the woman had been treated at the Sulianto Saroso
Hospital, Jakarta's hospital for treating avian influenza patients. She
died on Tue 29 Nov 2005. "We have conducted [a] test and the [result is]
positive," Mamahit told Reuters, adding that [the result] had to be
confirmed by a laboratory in Hong Kong affiliated with the World Health
Organization. Ilham Patu, a spokesman for the hospital, said the woman had
been in contact with dead chickens before being admitted to the hospital on
Thu 24 Nov 2005. "When we admitted her, the condition was already bad," he
told Reuters.
Indonesia has had 7 deaths from avian influenza confirmed by the Hong Kong
laboratory. Another 5 people have been confirmed to have contracted the
virus but have survived.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain is endemic in poultry in some parts of
Asia, where it has killed 68 people [69 people if this death is confirmed
by the WHO-designated reference laboratory in Hong Kong. - Mod.CP] since
late 2003. Experts fear H5N1 could mutate into a form that passes easily
among people, just like human influenza. If it does, millions could die,
because they would have no immunity. Most human bird flu cases in Asia have
been blamed on direct or indirect contact with infected poultry.
