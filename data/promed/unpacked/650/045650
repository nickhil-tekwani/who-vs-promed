There have been more than three times the number of viral meningitis cases
in Calgary so far this year, compared with last year, according to the
city's deputy medical officer of health. Officials have been notified of
88 cases to the end of last month, compared with 24 in 1997. Seventy-five
of those have occurred since May but public health officials are not unduly
alarmed. Although 80% of cases in Calgary were hospitalized, this version
of the disease is rarely fatal.
The Provincial director of communicable disease control said Calgary was
the first to notice the recent increase but figures increased across the
province. It was also stated that there are periodic dramatic increases in
virus activity and that one must go back a number of years to see anything
comparable to this year. Because it is mainly a summer infection, Alberta
may not have seen the worst.
I will check to see what the isolated viruses have been and let you know.

Idaho is also reporting an apparent increase in aseptic meningitis cases
throughout the lower [southern counties. During all of 1997 8 viral
meningitis cases were reported. Since mid-July 1998 more than 35 cases have
been reported to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. New cases are
continuing to occur throughout southern and central Idaho. Although the
etiologic agent remains unknown for the majority of cases, two unique stool
samples were presumptive for echovirus-30. A third echovirus isolate was
grown from CSF, typing is pending. Sample testing and verification
continues within Idaho and also at CDC.

[Good to hear from Leslie. I refuse to ask what a unique stool sample is.

[Although we had requested information about aseptic meningitis cases in
North America, I post this from Japan because of its emphasis on echovirus
30, which appears to be very common this years in North America. - Mod.CHC

In response to previous postings on ProMED-mail, I would like to post
following information from Japan.
Recently, we have released an article on echovirus 30 infections in Japan
entitled "A nationwide epidemic of aseptic meningitis due to echovirus 30
in Japan, 1997-1998" on our publication [IASR: Infectious Agents
Surveillance Reports. This article is also available in English on our web
site <http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/index.html>.

[CDC keeps detailed records of aseptic meningitis cases in the U.S. Perhaps
someone there would be so kind as to send us a year-to-date summary of
aseptic meningitis activity and etiologic agents. Until then, there is
little point in continuing to post messages from one location at a time.
