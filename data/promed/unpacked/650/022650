For the 4th year in a row, Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo (NIID) has reported more than 5000 syphilis cases in the country. In 2020, 5784 syphilis cases were reported in Japan, with 1550 reported in Tokyo (26.8%) and 889 (15.4%) in Osaka.

Syphilis was a major issue in Japan until shortly after the end of World War II, but the total reported cases declined to several hundred annually until 2011, when a rebound began. In 2014, more than 1600 cases were reported, as worldwide numbers also increased. In 2015, the number of syphilis cases topped 2000, a 4-fold increase from just 5 years earlier.

In 2016, Japan saw a 77 % increase from 2015, topping 4000 cases, and up by more than 7-fold from a decade ago. 2017, 2018, and 2019 saw more than 5000 cases and 6000 cases.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications if not treated correctly. Symptoms of syphilis in adults include a painless sore that will go away without treatment followed by a non-itchy body rash. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to damage through the body, including neurological and cardiovascular complications. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection and, for women, can cause problems during pregnancy and for the newborn.

[Although not stated above, the number of cases of syphilis each year reported above are total cases, which include cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the most contagious forms of syphilis, latent ("asymptomatic") syphilis, tertiary ("late symptomatic") syphilis, and congenital syphilis (as shown in a table from Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif). In recent years, about 70% of total cases each year in Japan are cases of primary and secondary syphilis.

The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis that initially involved mainly men who have sex with men has more recently involved women in their 20s and 30s. (See ProMED posts: Syphilis - Japan (02): rising incidence, heterosexual women & men, urban 20181202.6175741 and Syphilis - Japan: more cases, heterosexual women, congenital 20191127.6800502).

The increase in the incidence of syphilis in women of childbearing age has been associated with a rising incidence of congenital syphilis in Japan, according to data compiled by Japan's NIID (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif), with 10 cases in 2014, 13 in 2015, 15 in 2016, 9 in 2017, 17 in 2018, and 9 cases reported by the 42nd week of 2019 (week ending 19 Oct 2019) (https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191125/p2a/00m/0na/015000c). - Mod.ML

To clarify the third paragraph in the source article, these are the annual total number of syphilis cases for each year, as reported in the following articles:
4259 in 2016 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-syphilis-cases-double-2016/),
5770 in 2017 (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/01/29/reference/japans-dramatic-surge-syphilis-cases-particularly-high-incidence-tokyo-puzzles-experts/),
6923 in 2018 (https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190112/p2a/00m/0na/010000c), and
6577 in 2019 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-reports-more-than-6500-syphilis-cases-in-2019/). - Mod.LXL
