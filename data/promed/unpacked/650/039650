Chronic wasting disease in deer continues its march westward from Saskatchewan, bolstering scientific predictions the animal affliction will reach the outskirts of Calgary and Edmonton within the decade.

Even the current low levels of chronic wasting disease (CWD) are painstakingly monitored by the Alberta government because of its relation to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the neurodegenerative prion disease in cattle, and concern CWD found in deer, elk and moose may someday spread to humans.

The most recent provincial data, published Thursday in Sustainable Resource Development's annual report, indicates CWD was discovered in 33 of 3,194 tested deer in southeastern Alberta last year, the highest number ever found.

The wasting disease is also spreading to new parts of the province.

Hunters say the government needs to bolster its CWD testing programs to include all of Alberta.

"The major concern is it's spreading into the animals and I don't think anyone knows whether it can be transferred to humans or not, like BSE," said Alberta Fish and Game Association president Conrad Fennema.

The numbers are going up, incrementally.

Only 4 deer with CWD were found in 2005, the first year the disease was detected in the province. More recently, 13 infected deer were discovered in 2009, and 20 in 2010. The annual report said since the government halted a winter cull program in areas where sick deer were found, "CWD has steadily increased in prevalence and geographic distribution, including resurgence in areas where previous disease control had reduced its occurrence."

The report said Sustainable Resource Development, which has been merged with the Environment department, will undertake an extensive program review and prepare new plans for managing CWD.

"We'll be looking at what we need to do for the coming season," said a spokesman, Dave Ealey. "We don't want to see it spread."

University of Alberta biologist David Coltman, who studies the disease in deer, said it's not the increased numbers he's worried about, but the spread of it. Last year, Coltman said the disease was already "at the gates of Calgary" and predicted CWD would likely be found just outside the province's two biggest cities in five to 10 years.

"If you look at a map, you start to realize that this is getting to be quite a large geographic area where the disease is found," Coltman said Thursday. "There are no geographic barriers. And we know the deer aren't fussy about which direction they seem to move."

CWD is an emerging disease first found on a Colorado game ranch in the late 1960s, but is now encountered in 15 U.S. states and Saskatchewan and Alberta. Although scientists don't fully understand the way the disease spreads, it flares when deer populations are high and animals are crowded together.

In 2008, the province axed its program of culling deer in areas where the disease was found. Coltman said keeping the disease out of Alberta completely was never a strong likelihood and CWD is now too widespread for culling measures to be effective.
Today, the Alberta government relies mostly on hunters to kill infected animals and gather data about CWD. Many more hunting licenses are granted and hunters must give government staff the heads of the deer they kill in areas where the disease has been discovered. Coltman said it's important the province's surveillance system is maintained. "We don't know what the future is going to hold so let's just make sure we know where it is."

At the Alberta Fish and Game Association, Fennema said he believes the government should require hunters to turn in deer heads - in every part of the province. "Doing nothing is not an option," Fennema said.

[The disease has been around since the 1960's. Yet there is no known transfer to humans. If nothing were done, would the disease reach a steady state, like many other diseases in nature? There has been some work done at looking at wolf population in regard to maintaining disease in cervids. Perhaps the answer is to let nature establish its balance between the wolf and the cervid?

The highest rate discovered, according to this article, is only 1 percent of those animals sampled. Yet the article does not seem to indicate how many animals would have been harvested if the disease had not been present. How much has the overall herd numbers suffered because of the management of taking more animals to test for the disease?

Of course, another answer is to provide the passive surveillance and hunter-kill surveillance that has been occurring. Funds for disease research are continuing to shrink. Increasing technology has promise in many areas, but the funding to support such research is not available.

A way prevent the disease would be an ideal situation, especially if it were in feed. But that seems to be another research funding need.
