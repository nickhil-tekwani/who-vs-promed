African Horse Sickness Outbreak
-------------------------------
A total of 12 cases of African horse sickness (AHS) have been
confirmed in the Western Cape region of South Africa, according to a
report from the South African-based news website Eye Witness News.

The cases in the Western Cape follow an outbreak of more than 90
cases in other regions of South Africa. Movement into the Western Cape
had been restricted in an attempt to control disease spread.

On 4 Mar 2011, authorities halted the transportation of all horses,
ponies, donkeys, mules, and zebras in the Western Cape district of
Malmesbury, where the cases were suspected and later confirmed,
according to Eye Witness News.

African horse sickness is a fatal viral disease spread by Culicoides
-- tiny, blood-sucking insects -- that can affect horses, mules, and
donkeys, as well as dogs and camels. Horses are most susceptible to
AHS, with a 75-90 per cent mortality rate. A vaccine is available, but
no effective treatment methods exist for infected horses. For
survivors, recovery is slow.

[AHS is endemic in South Africa. Transmitted, like other orbivirus
diseases, by culicoides midges, its occurrence is seasonal and
geographically proscribed. It was last reported from South Africa in
2009; according to the annual OIE report for that year, 281 new
outbreaks were recorded. No semiannual or annual reports for 2010 are
yet available.

Information on the serotype involved in the current outbreaks has
been requested in ProMED-mail's previous posting, 3 Mar 2011. -
