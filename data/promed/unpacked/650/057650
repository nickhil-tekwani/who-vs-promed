The actual vaccination rate of Taiwan hogs against foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) could be much lower than the official estimate of between 30 percent
and 40 percent, Taiwan Bayer Co. said on Friday.
The Germany-based pharmaceutical giant made the remarks following reports
of a re-emergence of FMD cases after a major Taiwan outbreak two years ago.
Several cases were recently reported in Penghu, an island county off the
southwestern Taiwan coast, and in southwestern Yunlin County.
Bayer, one of the major providers of FMD vaccines for the Taiwan hog
industry, said that the inoculation rate could be as low as 15 percent, a
rate which would make it difficult for Taiwan to eradicate the highly
contagious disease.
Along with Bayer, French and Argentinian companies also provide FMD
vaccines to Taiwan, at prices averaging between NT$20 and NT$25
(US$0.58-US$0.73) per dose.
The Council of Agriculture (COA) requires that piglets be inoculated
against FMD, in two doses four weeks apart, between the ages of 6 and 14
weeks. Calculated on this basis, Taiwan needs 800,000 doses of FMD vaccine
per month.
An official from Bayer, which provides 100,000 doses of the vaccine on
average per month, said that as long as farmers inoculate their hogs
properly, the FMD can be effectively kept under control.
Meanwhile, COA officials denied that the vaccination rate is as low as the
Bayer estimate, adding that in some hog farms in southern Pingtung County,
the rate is between 70 and 80 percent.
Lee Chin-lung, the COA's director-general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the government will rigorously
monitor hog farms to make sure inoculations are being carried out.
