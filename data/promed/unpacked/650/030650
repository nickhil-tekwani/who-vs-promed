The number of people with measles in Ottawa has climbed to 5 as city
public health officials urge those who have not been immunized to get
a shot as soon as possible. Dr. Vera Etches, the city's associate
medical officer of health, said the 5 incidents of measles have been
confirmed with one more potential case currently being examined. Most
of the confirmed cases are the result of one family member who
travelled from the Philippines spreading it to others in the family.

"If you were born after 1970 and you didn't have 2 doses of the
measles vaccine after your 1st birthday, then you could get measles,"
Etches said.

Measles is spread when a person comes in contact with an infected
person who is coughing, sneezing or talking through droplets from the
nose, mouth or throat. A person may develop symptoms 7-18 days after
being in contact with an infected person. The patient may develop a
high fever. After 2-3 days, tiny white spots may appear in the mouth.
Then, over the next few days, a characteristic red blotchy rash
begins to appear on the face and spreads down the body to the arms and legs.

[As 1st reported in early December 2010, Ottawa Public Health alerted
all local physicians about a middle-aged woman who had contracted
measles while in the Philippines; see: Measles - Canada (06): (ON) ex
Philippines 20101219.447. Subsequently, a 2nd person was diagnosed
with measles virus infection on 17 Dec 2010. Prior to these cases,
the city of Ottawa had not seen any case of measles since 2002, and
this was the 1st time measles has been transmitted locally in 15 years.

The number of cases has now risen to 5, plus one suspected case. It
is unclear from the text whether all or only some of the confirmed
secondary cases are family members. Further information is awaited.
