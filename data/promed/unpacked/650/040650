A comment from Dr Steve Berger
------------------------------
The paucity of available clinical data on this outbreak precludes any
meaningful diagnosis; this cluster of fever and severe joint pain is
reminiscent of the current outbreak of Chikungunya in Reunion.
The following background information on Chikungunya in India is abstracted
from the GIDEON database:
Chikungunya is common, and periodic epidemics are reported. Outbreaks have
been described in Madras and Vellore. 2.9 per cent of people living in the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands are seropositive. Infected mosquitoes have been
documented in Pune District (Maharashtra State).
Notable outbreaks include the following:
1963 to 1965 - an outbreak was reported in Calcutta. 4.4 per cent of the
population were later found to be seropositive.
1973 - an outbreak in Barsi (Sholapur district), Maharashtra state involved
37.5 per cent of the population.

Comment from Professor T Jacob John
-----------------------------------
This comment refers to the ProMED-mail report of 27 Feb 2006 on an outbreak
of fever with severe limb pain and joint swelling in Karnataka State in
southern India [see: Undiagnosed disease - India (Karnakata): RFI
20060227.0635]. The clinical picture sounds very much like Chikungunya
virus disease.
On 20 Feb 2006, ProMED-mail had reported on Chikungunya in Andhra Pradesh
State, which is adjacent to Karnataka [see: Chikungunya - India (AP): susp.
20060220.0551]. On 30 Jan 2006, I saw one patient with typical
Chikungunya-like illness from which he had recovered, but who continued to
have swelling of the feet and large-joint pain going on for several days
after recovery from fever. That was in Hyderabad, capital city of Andhra
Pradesh State. I would strongly suggest Chikungunya in Karnataka also, but
virological studies are necessary to check this out.

Comment from Wojtek Kalman
--------------------------
I'm probably not the only one who will make a similar comment, but I'd like
to draw attention to ProMED-mail posting "Chikungunya - India (AP): susp.
20060220.0551" of 20 Feb 2006, referring to a probable Chikungunya outbreak
in 5 districts of Andhra Pradesh province. It doesn't report more precisely
where (in which districts) the outbreak has been discovered in Andhra
Pradesh, but Karnataka province borders Andhra Pradesh, and Bellary
district, mentioned in the current RFI, is located very close to the border
between both provinces.

[The same suggestion was contributed by Patricia Doyle. ProMED-mail would
welcome verification from a local source that Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is
indeed the etiologic agent of this outbreak of febrile disease in the
province of Karnataka.
CHIKV is a mosquito-transmitted virus 1st isolated during an epidemic in
Tanzania in 1952/53 from both patients and mosquitoes. Since 1954, it has
been isolated frequently from humans and mosquitoes in tropical Africa, the
India subcontinent, and South East Asia (the Philippines, Thailand,
Cambodia, Viet Nam, Burma, and Sri Lanka). CHIKV is classified in the genus
_Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridaae_. It is closely related
phylogenetically to O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), and the 2 viruses are
associated with clinically indistinguishable disease, but ONNV has a
restricted distribution in the African continent.
Non-human reservoir species of CHIKV have not been identified
unequivocally. Migrants and travelers have been blamed frequently for
spread of infection; for example, for the comparatively recent introduction
of the disease into Malaysia and the recent (2005-2006) widespread CHIKV
outbreaks around Comoros island.
The largest epidemics of CHIKV infection in recent years have occurred in
India and Indonesia. CHIKV fever is characterized by sudden onset of chills
and fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and rash. Arthralgia
(the joints of the extremities in particular become swollen and painful to
the touch) is the most typical sign of CHIKV infection, occurring in around
70 per cent of cases. The acute phase of the disease lasts for 2 to 4 days,
with recovery in 5 to 7 days. - Mods.RY/CP]
