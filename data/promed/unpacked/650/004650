More cases of measles may be tied to PATH system
------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak has reared its ugly head in Toronto again, with 4
new cases reported to Public Health in the past few days. Initial
reports of the illness surfaced in early spring [2008]. Since the
start of the investigation into the sudden breakout 9 cases have now
been reported. Outbreaks have also been noted in other parts of
Ontario, as well as in Europe and the United States.

But these new cases are more worrisome for authorities. 2 of them
were traced back to patients who had been at the Scotia and TD
Towers, potentially leaving those who frequent the underground PATH
system [a 27-kilometre (17-mi) network of pedestrian tunnels beneath
the office towers of downtown Toronto. - Mod.CP] exposed. "All of the
new cases either live or work downtown," reveals Dr Barbara Yaffe,
director of Communicable Disease Control for Toronto Public Health.
"Anyone born before 1970 likely had measles in childhood, and is
therefore protected. Everyone else should ensure they have had 2
doses of measles vaccine for full protection, especially as we know
measles is circulating in Toronto."

Measles is rare in Canada, and only about 3 cases are seen in Toronto
each year, so the increase is significant. CityNews Medical
Specialist Dr Karl Kabasele explains the disease is easily
transmitted from one person to another, increasing the concern. "If
you come by someone who is infected, if they cough or sneeze they can
leave droplets in the air, which you can theoretically come into
contact with. I should hasten to add that Public Health is working
with the people who have likely come into contact but they're putting
out the word that people who may not be fully vaccinated should check
their records."

Toronto Public Health is recommending that those who received a
single vaccination as children consider getting a 2nd dose. "Complete
and up-to-date vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself
and your family from communicable diseases like measles," Dr Yaffe
added. "Prior to universal immunization in the 1970s, Canada saw
thousands of cases of measles each year."

[PATH is downtown Toronto's underground walkway linking 27 kilometres
(17 miles) of shopping, services, and entertainment. PATH provides an
important contribution to the economic viability of the city's
downtown core. The system facilitates pedestrian linkages to public
transit, accommodating more than 100 000 daily commuters, and
thousands of additional tourists and residents on route to sports and
cultural events. Its underground location provides pedestrians with a
safe haven from the winter cold and snow, and the summer heat.

The Toronto Public Health authorities are concerned that the PATH
system may provide a unique environment for the transmission of the
highly contagious measles virus from a few infected people to
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, and the subsequent
dispersion of measles infection over a wide area of the city. Time
will tell whether their fears are justified.
