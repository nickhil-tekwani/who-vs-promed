DENGUE - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Neville Clynes <ndc1@columbia.edu>

In the past week I have seen two patients with rather classic dengue fever
both with recent travel to Santo Domingo. I have been seeing all the
infectious disease patients hospitalised at the Allen Pavilion of Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital for the past 10 years and this is clearly unusual. We
"draw" from a population with a large number of immigrants and return
travelers from the Dominican Republic. Although I don't have serology
results, I am quite convinced these were dengue infections. The "uptick"
is clear to me. Is there anyone from Santo Domingo that can comment? Is
anyone else serving this population in the U.S. seeing a rise?

[Of course, this is simply a clinical diagnosis with no laboratory
confirmation as yet. However, we post this with the request that if anyone
has any information (one way or the other) on dengue in the Dominican
Republic, we would be grateful if you would share it with ProMED-mail.
What with the way Sammy Sosa is hitting, I wouldn't be at all surprised to
find that everyone in the D.R. is feverish. - Mod.CHC]
