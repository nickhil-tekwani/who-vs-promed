[1] Liberia: Antiviral treatment
Date: Sat 17 Jan 2015

An Oxford University team of researchers has begun a trial of a potential treatment for Ebola infection. The team is investigating brincidofovir, developed by private American healthcare company Chimerix. The trial, run by volunteers from Doctors Without Borders [MSF] and the University of Oxford, and funded by the Wellcome Trust, will test the effectiveness of the drug by comparing the fatality rate of 140 patients in Monrovia with previous Ebola fatality rates in the hospitalized Ebola patients in Monrovia, Liberia.

The 1st Ebola patient received the study drug on 2 Jan 2015. If this ongoing trial is considered successful, there will be a 2nd, larger trial in one of the 3 countries most affected by the epidemic, Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone. If that also has positive results, brincidofovir will be released on a wider scale. ... - more

[2] UK costs spiraling
Date: 18 Jan 2015

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ebola-outbreak-britains-bill-for-tackling-virus-in-sierra-leone-spirals-to-330m-due-to-cuts-in-aid-9985776.html


Britain's bill for tackling the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone has spiralled by at least GBP 100 million, to GBP 330 million [USD 151-500 million].

The Government expects to spend nearly 50 per cent more than the GBP 230 million previously allocated, which will go towards treatment centres and safe burials and "urgent needs." More expenditure is expected to follow, officials admit, as more NHS staff are deployed to the country.

Critics partly blame the growing bill on the coalition slashing the amount of aid allocated to Sierra Leonean health projects in recent years, leaving the country ill-prepared, with an acute shortage of doctors. Without an effective health system, Sierra Leone was easily overwhelmed by the outbreak.

The UK is Sierra Leone's biggest donor, but, while increasing the overall aid budget to the West African country, the Department for International Development (DfID) reduced dedicated health aid from GBP 22 m in 2010-11 to GBP 12 m, GBP 16 m and GBP 14 m over the following 3 years.

MPs from both the Labour and Conservative benches argue that the cuts were financially counterproductive. The UK will spend hundreds of millions of pounds on expensive emergency measures to subdue an outbreak which has already killed more than 3000 people in Sierra Leone and thousands more in Guinea and Liberia. ... - more

[3] Mali: Ebola-free
Date: Sun 18 Jan 2015

http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/01/18/uk-health-ebola-mali-idUKKBN0KR0XM20150118


Mali's health minister declared the West African nation free of Ebola on Sun [18 Jan 2015] following a 42-day period without a new case of the deadly virus. Mali recorded 6 deaths from Ebola. Mali's last infected patient recovered and left hospital early last month [December 2014]. At one point health officials had been monitoring more than 300 contact cases.

Mali became the 6th West African country to record a case of Ebola when a 2-year-old girl from Guinea died in October 2014. It was close to being declared Ebola free in November [2014] before a 2nd wave of infections.

[4] Modeling comment
Date: 17 Jan 2015
From: Gregory Kelly <gka25@sfu.ca> [excerpted, edited]


Regarding ProMED post "Ebola update (16): vaccine, models, slowing, transmission, nurse, malaria, susp 20150117.3098295, I very respectfully disagree with Mod.JW's comments about the futility of modeling Ebola due to inaccurate data. True, there is a lot of basis for "garbage in, garbage out," but mathematical and computational modeling is more than just predictions and numbers. What modeling can reveal are patterns and relationships within the system well in advance of statistical analysis done after the fact.

One key element in mathematical models known as "compartmental models" (also known as "S-I-R" models) is the ability to calculate algebraically the location of the "transcritical bifurcation," or tipping point from where the "disease-free equilibrium" is no longer stable and an epidemic would likely occur with the introduction of an infected host into the community. This algebraic point does not need absolute numbers but rather variables that reflect parameters in the model. This allows us to examine in advance the influence of the individual parameters, which may occur non-linearly, something that often troubles statistical analysis based on linear regression. This tipping point is usually the square of R0 (the number of secondary infections from a single infection introduced into an entirely susceptible community), which means we can directly calculate R0 if we do have accurate numbers, and if we don't, we can feed in a range of parameter values to get some expectation of how bad the epidemic might be... From what I can tell, the data on HCW [health care workers] illnesses and outcomes are likely to be the most accurate; the rest can be modeled over a range of possibilities...

Another aspect of compartmental models is that with some effort, we can get numerical solutions for how the system is likely to decay back to the disease-free equilibrium... There are some challenges to compartmental models; they are deterministic, they can have biases that might not reflect the true dynamics of the system, and in order to make them manageable mathematically, they may contain simplifications that diminish their accuracy (biases and simplifications are not the same thing)... Over tens of thousands or even millions of simulated runs, patterns can emerge that can help inform resource allocation.

I would not dispute that some of the Ebola projections now seem overly pessimistic, but we have to keep in mind that those projections were based on a fairly static system - i.e., what would have happened if nothing was done. Mathematical and computational modeling can help disprove the negative in policy decision-making (if we had done nothing, it wouldn't have been bad anyways, so allocating resources for prevention is a waste of money)...

But: "If we don't (have accurate numbers), we can feed in a range of parameter values..." And come up with what? guesses? We won't even be able to put confidence intervals on the results, or they would be so wide as to be meaningless. - Mod.JW]
