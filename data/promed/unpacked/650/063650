Hepatitis kills 4 more
----------------------
The number of people killed by hepatitis E in Kitgum district has
increased to 35 from 31 in the past one week, reports Chris Ocowun.
The dead are mainly pregnant women, while the total number of those
infected is 1797.

"The virus, thought to have been brought from South Sudan, was first
detected in Lamwo County. It spread to Agoro, Mucwini, Paloga,
Potika, Padibe, and Lukung sub-counties and is now threatening Kitgum
town council," the deputy resident district commissioner, Sylvester
Opira, said on Tuesday [27 May 2008]. "We are urging people to visit
health centres if they feel feverish. We are also advising couples to
delay conception."

[The number of cases of hepatitis E reported in the initial account
of the outbreak in the region of Uganda bordering Sudan (see
reference below) has increased now from 314 cases and 11 deaths to
the current 1797 cases and 35 deaths.

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV),
which is transmitted in much the same way as other enteric viruses.
HEV is found in the faeces of people and animals with hepatitis E.
HEV is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or water.
Transmission from person to person may occur.

Hepatitis E outbreaks have occurred worldwide in recent years and may
be increasing in frequency. The signs and symptoms of HEV infection
are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, discoloured urine, jaundice,
and abdominal pain. There is, however, no chronic (long term)
infection. Hepatitis E is more severe among pregnant women,
especially in the 3rd trimester.
