Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF): Clinical cases have been reported from dairy farms throughout the Jordan Valley, the Northern Galilee Valley ("Hula Valley") and the Golan Heights. A suspected outbreak has been reported from one location in southwest Israel.

Mortality is low; morbidity varies between sporadic cases and more than 50% per herd.

[According to the 2 previous weekly reports from the head veterinarian at "Hachaklait" (Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services and Livestock Insurance, catering for about 90% of Israel's dairy farms), the event started 2 to 3 weeks ago, gradually spreading from the Golan Heights and the Jordan Valley. The main observed symptoms were an abrupt reduction of milk production, recumbency in some cases, salivation and lameness.

BEF ("3-day sickness") is an insect-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo that is seen in Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. The BEF virus (BEFV) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea or dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness and lameness, as well as a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed from 8 hours to more than one week. Morbidity may be high, and the mortality rate low. BEF causes considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries.

In Israel, the disease has been reported in previous years from dairy and beef cattle farms in various parts of the country; it is characterized by seasonal patterns related to vector activity. A countrywide BEF epizootic took place in 2014; the current event is the largest since then.

An evaluation of a BEF vaccine applied in Israel was reported in Reference 1. BEF is not zoonotic and is not listed by the OIE; it is, however, included in Israel's list of reportable animal diseases.

In 2002, Tajikistan reported an epizootic of BEF to the OIE (20020814.5055). This exceptional report was probably submitted due to the considerable size and the severity of recorded or expected economic implications.

BEF may be currently circulating in other Middle Eastern countries sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem. When infection occurs in tandem with other (seasonal) bovine diseases, such as lumpy skin disease (currently spreading in Egypt) and bluetongue, this could lead to aggravated disease signs in the affected animals. - Mod.AS
