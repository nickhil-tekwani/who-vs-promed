[MERS-CoV transmission continues in Saudi Arabia. With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, there have now been a total of 83 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 16 deaths (reported case fatality rate, 19.3%), since 1 Jan 2019, 50 of whom were reported from Wadi Aldawasir. Noteworthy is that the most recent case reported from Wadi Aldawasir was reported on 25 Feb 2019 -- 4 days ago -- too soon to be confident that transmission has been interrupted, but encouraging.

The 2 newly confirmed cases were both from Riyadh region -- one from Sajir city, one from Afeef city. Checking distances, Sajir city is 378.4 km (235.1 miles) from Riyadh city and 278 km (172.7 miles) from Afeef city, and Afeef city is 478.6 km (297.4 miles) from Riyadh city.
