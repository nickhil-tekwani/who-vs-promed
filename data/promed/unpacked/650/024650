Botulism breaks out at 4 farms
------------------------------
4 farms on the Devon and Somerset border are being investigated after
a suspected botulism outbreak.
It is believed that up to 40 cattle have died as a result of the
infection in the Hemyock area. [See map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=50.9114&lon=-3.2278&scale=1000000&icon=x>].

Steps are being taken to contain the illness, which affects the
muscles and causes lameness and poor coordination in the animals.
A spokeswoman for Defra said the source of the outbreak appears to
have been poultry litter sold to the farms.
"We believe the poultry litter was sold to a number of farms in the
area for manure and that it contained dead chicken carcasses," she said.
"The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ensured that there is no risk to
human health in this particular instance, because no milk from the
infected cows went into the human food chain."
John Dole, from the National Farmers Union, said he believed 40 cows
had died so far.
"Accidents do happen, even with the best will in the world, but I
would assess it's a totally isolated outbreak," he said.
