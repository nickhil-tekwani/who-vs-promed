[Thanks Martin for collecting the tidbits below. I am less worried about
the consumption of squirrel brains than the squirreliness of university
publicist (see [2] below) and/or faculty members who feel that emerging
diseases issues should be promoted with all the latest media buzzwords.
The issue of emerging diseases lives in a complex environment which
includes the public, media, government officials as well scientists,
physicians and veterinarians. Using "media hype" type language does
nothing to help increase credibility and the presumption of objectivity
when navigating a new emerging disease idea among those different sectors.

Dr. Joeseph R Berger, head of Neurology at U Kentucky, jrbneuro@pop.uky.edu,
apparently has something on the old issue of whether eating squirrel brains
might be associated with CJD. He wrote today that something should be
coming out as a research correspondence in Lancet "in the upcoming months."
He made a presentation at a meeting on June 27.

UK College of Medicine Brings Together U.S. "Virus Hunters" to Discuss
Emerging Infectious Diseases
More than 250 health care professionals including physicians, nurses, and
veterinarians attended the June 27-28 "Hot Zone 1997" conference sponsored
by the University of Kentucky College of Medicine on June 27 and 28 at the
Hyatt Regency in Lexington.
Dr. Joseph Berger, UK chair of neurology, presented new information "Mad
Squirrel-Mad Cow-Jacob Crueutzfeldt Disease." Berger talked about
discovering a common medical link in squirrel-meat consumption in Kentucky,
"mad cow" disease in England and a disease that affects cannibals in New
Guinea.

Dr. Eric Weisman (a behavior neurologist) and myself have recently noted at
least three patients who suddenly contracted CJD, and who admittedly had
consumed the brains of squirrels. The findings were so revelent, that the
University of Ky has requested the brains of 100 squirrels be submitted for
examination and research. I had a patient that died secondarily of CJD - she
was super productive weeks prior to her diagnosis, then vegitated for less
than a month before her demise. A sad situation!!!
