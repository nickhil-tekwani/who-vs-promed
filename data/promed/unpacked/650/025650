Date submitted to OIE: 2 Sep 2010
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: serotype 6
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

Summary of outbreaks
New outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: (EHD971-1) Capesterre, Guadeloupe
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 May 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Species: cattle
Susceptible: 10
Cases: 3
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: the 10 cattle were introduced in Guadeloupe from
mainland France (which is free from epizootic haemorrhagic disease).
They served thus as sentinels.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: enzootic

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type ANSES (National Food Security Agency)
(national laboratory)

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has met the OIE criteria for
listing as an emerging disease due to the frequency of reports from
countries previously free of the disease. In 2008, OIE listed EHD as
an emerging disease because of outbreaks in 2006 in 4 previously free
countries in the Mediterranean -- Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and
Israel. For further details, see Mod.AS comments in ProMED-mail
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, bovine: emerging, listed, OIE 20080604.1786

This appears to be the 1st time it has been reported from Guadeloupe,
although there is some indication in the Epidemiology section of the
report above that the disease is enzootic. We can only speculate that
the disease is enzootic in deer and this is the 1st occurrence in
cattle in Guadeloupe. Given that only the United States and Canada
have reported any EHD to OIE WAHID's database, the claim of the
disease being enzootic in Guadeloupe is surprising.

Finally, another noteworthy aspect of this report is that there was a
reported outbreak in 2009 in Reunion, another small island that, as
Guadeloupe, is a department of France. Reunion however is located off
the East Coast of Africa, east of Madagascar, while Guadeloupe is
located in the Eastern Leeward Islands, Lesser Antilles in the
Caribbean, just off of South America. France has not reported EHD yet
to the OIE WAHID database and ProMED-mail has not carried any reports
of EHD from Europe yet.

The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University
reports the occurrence of EHD as follows: Epizootic hemorrhagic
disease occurs in North America, Australia, Asia, and Africa.
Seropositive animals have been found in South America. Of the 10
serotypes known worldwide, the only 2 serotypes currently endemic in
North America are EHDV-1 and EHDV-2. Ibaraki disease has been
reported from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Seropositive animals have
also been found in Australia and Indonesia (see
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/epizootic_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf>).
The geographic distribution of this disease and closely related
viruses bluetongue and Ibaraki, are of considerable epidemiologic interest.

The location of the Guadeloupe outbreak can be seen appended to the
OIE report referenced above or on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
