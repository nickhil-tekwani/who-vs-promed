[This is the 2nd case of HPAI subtype H5N8 reported in domestic poultry.

The following press release was published on 30 Nov 2020 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (the information has been translated and edited from Polish to English):

A research conducted by scientists from the State Veterinary Institute - The State Research Institute in Pulawy confirms that the H5N8 virus strain detected in Poland is not dangerous for consumers and does not endanger public health.

The analysis of the entire genome of the H5N8 influenza virus strain detected in Poland indicates its high degree of similarity to the HPAI H5N8 virus strains currently present in Europe, indicating their common origin and lack of risk to human health.

Studies on the identification of molecular markers of human health risks have not shown that the H5N8 virus detected in the country has characteristics indicating increased infectivity and pathogenicity for humans, and in this respect is no different from other viruses currently detected in Europe.

However, the results do not allow for precise identification of the geographical area from which the virus came to Polish, as the same level of genetic similarity occurs both in virus sequences detected in countries west of Poland (that is, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom) and east of our country (Russia). In view of the numerous cases of infections in wild birds in Europe, they should be considered as the most likely vector for the introduction of the virus into Poland. The results of the studies also indicate that the current situation is unrelated to the HPAI H5N8 epidemic in Europe in the 2019/2020 season.
