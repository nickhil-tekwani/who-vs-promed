A case of flea-borne typhus was confirmed in Burbank [California] by Los Angeles County Vector Control. The case is the 1st in Burbank of 2014. One case was reported in 2013; 2 cases were reported in 2012 in Burbank, according to the Burbank Police Department. Details of the 2014 case were not released.

Flea-borne typhus, also known as endemic typhus fever or murine typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria. Endemic typhus is not directly spread from person to person.

People become infected when they come into contact with fleas infected with the bacteria. Fleas defecate as they feed, and infection occurs when flea feces containing the bacteria are scratched into the bite site or transferred to other openings such as the eyes, nose, or mouth.

The Environmental Health Vector Management Department has advised Animal Shelter officials that the number of confirmed cases in Burbank is not out of the ordinary, but people should still be vigilant and follow the recommended steps for prevention:
- Do not feed wildlife or feral cats, as they contribute to the flea population;
- Keep your pets on a monthly flea control program. There are products available that kill fleas on pets on contact;
- Use flea combs to check for flea fecal matter on your pets and bathe them regularly to eliminate flea fecal matter;
- Keep your cats indoors and register them with Animal Control;
- Trim brush, pick up fallen fruit, and seal off crawl spaces to discourage wildlife from establishing residency on your property;
- Wear protective equipment such as a mask, goggles, and gloves when cleaning possible wildlife nesting areas.

For additional information on the disease, symptoms and prevention, please review the Endemic Typhus Fever Pamphlet at: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/bullmurinetyph.pdf.

A case of endemic typhus fever was reported in a neighborhood around Polliwog Park in Manhattan Beach [California], police announced Thursday [27 Feb 2014]. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health contacted the Manhattan Beach Police Department about the case on Thursday.

County health officials posted information about precautions when dealing with wildlife and domestic pets.

Typhus fever is a bacterial infection generally transmitted by fleas, ticks, lice and mites, or by inhaling infected dust. It's prevalent in port cities and coastal regions with rodents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], as well as in tropical and subtropical areas.

Symptoms usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after becoming infected. Fever, headache, malaise, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms. A rash may develop at the site of a flea or tick bite, according to the CDC.

According to Los Angeles County Department of Health, the disease is readily treatable with the appropriate antibiotic therapy.

For further information regarding this incident, contact the Environmental Health Vector Management Program at (626) 430-5450, or the Acute Communicable Disease Unit (213) 240-7941.

[Manhattan Beach, with a population of 35 135 in 2010, is a Pacific coastal city in Los Angeles (LA) County, California, USA, located about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of downtown LA. Residential prices in Manhattan Beach are among the highest in the state of California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach,_California). Burbank, with a population of 103 340 in 2010, is also a city in LA County 12 miles (19 km) north of downtown LA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California).

Murine typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a flea-borne rickettsial disease caused by the _Rickettsia typhi_ bacterium. In the USA, murine typhus has been reported in southern Texas, southern California, and Hawaii.

The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA: (TX) 20110607.1734:

"Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al: Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

"Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces, either by inoculation into excoriated fleabites, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea, myalgias, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even if untreated. However some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and up to 4 percent of hospitalized patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs."
