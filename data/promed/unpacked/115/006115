The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 2 Oct 2018:
- a total of 162 cases of haemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region, 130 confirmed and 32 probable;
- of the 130 confirmed, 74 died and 46 have recovered;
- 17 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 1 new case confirmed in Beni;
- 1 new person healed in Beni;
- no new deaths.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- The case confirmed in Komanda [Ituri] was finally transferred to Beni's [North Kivu] Ebola treatment center (ETC) for better management. His wife and child were vaccinated and isolated in the same ETC.

Vaccination
-----------
- The 2 vaccination belts in Bunia [Ituri] have been closed. Vaccination continues in 6 belts distributed in the Beni, Tchomia, Komanda, and Mabalako health zones.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 13 750 people have been vaccinated, including 4375 in Beni [North Kivu], 4254 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 1283 in Katwa [North Kivu], 944 in Butembo [North Kivu], 307 in Bunia [Ituri], 307 in Tchomia [Ituri], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 192 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).
- The governor of North Kivu province, Julien Paluku, has just joined the long list of local and provincial leaders who have agreed to be vaccinated against Ebola to raise awareness. 9 provincial deputies from North Kivu were also vaccinated in Butembo on Wed 3 Oct 2018. The local press was invited, which allowed them to widely disseminate the messages of awareness.
- The Ebola vaccine remains the most effective way to preventively protect people at risk. Unfortunately, because of rumors and misinformation, some people at risk continue to be suspicious of the vaccine. Thus, the involvement of local leaders who lead by example is important to deconstruct preconceptions.
- The effectiveness of the vaccine is optimal when administered within the 1st 48 hours after exposure to a confirmed case. If the vaccine is administered late and the person is already at an advanced stage of the 21-day incubation period, the risk of developing the disease, even after vaccination, is still present. Hence the importance for people at risk of getting vaccinated early and respecting the days of follow-up by vaccination teams.

[2] Volunteers attacked

Three International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] volunteers helping with the burial of an Ebola victim in eastern Congo were injured in an attack by villagers, prompting the ICRC to suspend burials in the area, health officials said on [Wed 3 Oct 2018]. The attack on an ambulance transporting the body to a cemetery in North Kivu province's Beni region is the latest disruption to efforts to control the current outbreak, which is believed to have killed 106 people since July [2018].

The World Health Organization (WHO) last week raised its assessment of the risk of the disease spreading within the region to "very high" after a case was confirmed near a lakeside border crossing point with Uganda.

Community resistance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been one of the main problems facing healthcare workers, in addition to armed attacks by militia groups. Serge Thierry, a regional ICRC representative, told Reuters that 3 local Red Cross volunteers were wounded, 2 seriously, in the attack by angry residents. "Security measures were taken immediately. Burials are suspended until further notice," he said by telephone, referring to ICRC activity in and around Butembo city in Beni region.

Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. Robert Kahumula, a spokesman for the local Ebola response team, said the health workers "were wounded during an attack by young people, skeptical of the presence of Ebola in the region. The burial did not take place because the young people ambushed the response team and vandalised the ambulance that was transporting the body," he said.

Last [Thu 27 Sep 2018], WHO warned of a build-up of mistrust towards Ebola response efforts in certain communities in eastern Congo as a result of rumours, misinformation, and a preference for traditional medical practices.

[According to https://www.matininfos.net/butembo-nord-kivu-agression-contre-lequipe-de-riposte-a-lenterrement-dune-dame-morte-debola/, the 2 Red Cross members escaped from their attackers and took refuge in a health center just meters from the cemetery. But young people also attacked this health facility. Police sources say the altercations resulted in 2 injured DRC Red Cross workers, an aid vehicle and a health center ransacked.

On the morning of Wed 3 Oct 2018, a delegation of family members and relatives of the dead woman arrived at the ETC. A compromise with the response team was reached for the woman to be buried with dignity.

The burial work, as well as all the other work volunteers are doing is dangerous enough from a health perspective that these individuals should not have to be put deeper in harm's way by members of the same communities they are trying to help. The community's focus should be on stopping this disease. How to make them understand this in the face of rumors and misinformation is the challenge. Working through authoritative figures from the community and traditional practitioners of medicine is the best approach to reach resistant individuals. - Mod.LK]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
West and Central Africa are experiencing explosive growth in urban populations, economic activities, and connectivity. The recent Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa demonstrated the vulnerability of the local health care infrastructure to newly emerging infectious diseases. 2 key factors contributing to the epidemic's unprecedented size were growth-related: large urban populations that overwhelmed the public health infrastructure of these resource-poor countries and the extensive spatial and technological connectivity of the population. These factors portend an increased risk in Central Africa of emerging infectious diseases caused by both known and unknown pathogens. Such unwelcome side effects of rapid growth can be mitigated only by strengthening the health care infrastructure, including diagnostic and clinical capacity, to meet the health care needs of the population; investment in the training of health care workers and African scientists; expansion of research capacity; development of disease-surveillance programs focused on humans, livestock, and wildlife; and rapid deployment of control measures when outbreaks occur.

A review of past outbreaks of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus, EBOV) in Central Africa (Gabon, Republic of the Congo [ROC], and Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC]) is instructive.

Central Africa is rapidly approaching a tipping point. Africa's economic development is a positive change that cannot and should not be stopped. At the same time, rapid economic and demographic transitions bring the challenges of emerging infectious disease outbreaks of increased frequency, size, and global impact. Yet there is an alternative to this foreboding narrative of development-associated infectious diseases: rather than pose a risk, continuing population growth and increasing income and education levels can help spur greater demand for infrastructure to support sustainable economic development, including implementation of basic health services.
