A 34-year-old man has been diagnosed with St. Louis encephalitis,
a sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease. The Venice man had
been battling what he thought was the flu. After days of high fever,
chills, disorientation and extreme weakness, he went to Sarasota
Memorial Hospital for tests. On Friday, the results returned from a
state laboratory in Tallahassee, and the man's diagnosis was St.
Louis encephalitis [SLE.
The Sarasota County health department has not issued an alert.
St. Louis encephalitis virus is much more common than West Nile
virus, the [exotic, for the USA virus that has killed several people in
New York recently, but it can be just as deadly, especially to
children and the elderly. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, both viruses are transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds. The disease is not
transmitted through human contact.
Dr. Keith Johnson, the Venice man's physician, said he sent a
sample of his patient's spinal fluid to New York City's public health
department to be compared with samples taken from the patients
there who contracted the West Nile virus.
"When I first saw him, I thought it was either meningitis or
encephalitis,'' Johnson said Saturday. "The clue was that he's an
incredible athlete that could [now barely walk 10 feet.'' The man, a
state tennis champion, was in extremely good shape for someone
in his mid-30s, Johnson said.
A Bonita Springs man died from the disease in March 1999.

[There is nothing highly unusual about finding a case of SLE in
Florida at this time of year. However, it will be interesting to have
the results of tests for West Nile virus. Whether a single spinal
fluid will be useful in making even a provisional diagnosis remains
to be seen, unless viral RNA is detected in that sample. - Mod.
