[Earlier this year (2013), Russia reported a FMD serotype O event in the Zabaykalsky Krai (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140213.2275582. An update and map for this event can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014987_20140326_112944.pdf.

In the outbreaks reported in Primorsky Krai (also caused by serotype O) in 2012 only bovines and ovines/caprines were affected. No affected swine were reported. The comment in the epidemiological section for this report indicated: "According to nucleotide sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis, the isolate belongs to type O PanAsia genetic lineage and is genetically close to the isolates involved in the FMD outbreaks in China and Eastern Kazakhstan in 2011." No information on the vaccinated animals and type of vaccine used was provided (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=11712).

According to information found on the WRLFMD (Pirbright) web page, samples obtained from the Zabaykalsky Krai during July and August 2010, and during February 2014, FMDV type O - topotype SE, and FMDV type O - topotype ME-SA were isolated respectively (see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/rus.htm).

For this latest event, authorities are indicating that they are applying "vaccination as a response to the outbreak." The details on the type of vaccine used would be useful, and hopefully will be provided in any follow-up reports. - Mod.CRD
