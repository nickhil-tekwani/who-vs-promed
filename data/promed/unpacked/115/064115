Summary

Background

The 2013-16 Ebola virus disease epidemic in west Africa caused international alarm due to its rapid and extensive spread resulting in a significant death toll and social unrest within the affected region. The large number of cases provided an opportunity to study the long-term kinetics of Zaire ebolavirus-specific immune response of survivors in addition to known contacts of those infected with the virus.

Methods

In this observational cohort study, we worked with leaders of Ebola virus disease survivor associations in 2 regions of Guinea, Gueckedou and Coyah, to recruit survivors of Ebola virus disease, contacts from households of individuals known to have had Ebola virus disease, and individuals who were not knowingly associated with infected individuals or had not had Ebola virus disease symptoms to serve as negative controls. We did Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific T-cell analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on location in Guinea and transported plasma and PBMCs back to Europe for antibody quantification by ELISA, functional neutralising antibody analysis using live Zaire ebolavirus, and T-cell phenotype studies. We report on the longitudinal cellular and humoral response among Ebola virus disease survivors and highlight potentially paucisymptomatic infection.

Findings

We recruited 117 survivors of Ebola virus disease, 66 contacts, and 23 negative controls. The mean neutralising antibody titre among the Ebola virus disease survivors 3-14 months after infection was 1/174 (95% CI 1/136-1/223). Individual results varied greatly from 1/10 to more than 1/1000 but were on average 10 times greater than that induced after one month by single-dose Ebola virus vaccines. Following reactivation with glycoprotein peptide, the mean T-cell responses among 116 Ebola virus disease survivors as measured by ELISpot was 305 spot-forming units (95% CI 257-353). The dominant CD8+ polyfunctional T-cell phenotype, as measured among 53 Ebola virus disease survivors, was interferon gamma+, tumour necrosis factor+, interleukin-2-, and the mean response was 0.046% of total CD8+ T cells (95% CI 0.021-0.071). Additionally, both neutralising antibody and T-cell responses were detected in 6 (9%) of 66 Ebola virus disease contacts. We also noted that 4 (3%) of 117 individuals with Ebola virus disease infections did not have circulating Ebola virus-specific antibodies 3 months after infection.

Interpretation

The continuous high titre of neutralising antibodies and increased T-cell response might support the concept of long-term protective immunity in survivors. The existence of antibody and T-cell responses in contacts of individuals with Ebola virus disease adds further evidence to the existence of sub-clinical Ebola virus infection.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched the PubMed database with MESH terms "Ebola," "immunity," "sero-prevalence," "paucisymptomatic," and for articles published between database inception and 15 Apr 2020, in any language. There was one report on long-term antibody and T-cell responses in 11 survivors split across 2 small Sudan ebolavirus outbreaks. Neutralisation assays revealed titres of 0-1/80, and T-cell proliferation and kinetics analyses clearly showed CD8+ T-cell activation, but quantification by ELISpot was not done. A comprehensive analysis of ELISA responses in survivors from the 1995 Kikwit outbreak showed antibody titres plateaued at 3 weeks to one year after onset of symptoms. A report by Leroy and colleagues revealed the existence of paucisymptomatic individuals with Ebola virus infections. Additionally, work by Glynn and colleagues further demonstrates the presence of asymptomatic Ebola virus infection. Several reports showed persistence of Ebola virus in immune privileged sites, and an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the B cell response among 4 Ebola virus disease survivors has also been done. We found no other studies reporting the longitudinal analysis of cellular and humoral immunity among survivors over 3 consecutive years.

Added value of this study

This unique study reports an in-depth analysis of naturally acquired immunity to Ebola virus and enables a comprehensive comparison between naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity to Ebola virus both at the antibody and T-cell level. The study also provides supporting evidence for the existence of paucisymptomatic Ebola virus disease and suggests that true incidence of Ebola virus infection in the west African outbreak was greater than recorded. Additionally, T-cell phenotyping results support the preclinical findings of a potential correlate of protection to Ebola virus.

Implications of all the available evidence

We suggest that up to 9% of individuals with Ebola virus disease will present with mild symptoms, which will have implications with regard to monitoring and responding to future outbreaks. Additionally, the work here shows that T-cell responses are relevant and long lasting among survivors of Ebola virus disease; therefore, future vaccine developers might wish to consider the T-cell response in more depth. The evaluation of convalescent plasma showed varying titres of anti-Ebola virus IgG, so pre-screening of IgG and neutralising titres before administration of convalescent plasma should be considered in future outbreaks.

[This is exactly the type of study that should be conducted following diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2, just as has been done now following Ebola infections. Determining long-term kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses of cases would be highly informative. Both the humoral and cellular immune responses need to be measured over time, as was done here. - Mod.LK]

In the Lancet Infectious Diseases, Ruth Thom and colleagues report substantial information concerning naturally acquired immunity following an infection with Zaire ebolavirus.

Their report shows strong and stable humoral and cellular responses among the majority of 117 Ebola survivors enrolled in Guinea. Between 3 and 14 months after infection, 113 (96%) of the 117 survivors had detectable titres of neutralising IgG antibodies to Ebola virus Mayinga and 101 (87%) of 116 produced interferon gamma after re-stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with glycoprotein. In a longitudinal analysis done on a subgroup of 96 (82%) of the survivors, these responses were stable for up to 3 years after discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. These results are consistent with the immune profile of a subgroup of 35 individuals from the Postebogui Guinean survivors' cohort, in which all participants had Ebola virus-specific IgG antibodies and showed robust specific T-cell memory responses up to 25 months after discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. In these studies, none of the unexposed people or healthy donors tested positive for Ebola virus-specific antibodies. Thom and colleagues did not test the hypothesis that long-term persistence of the immune responses in survivors could be due to re-exposure from immune privileged sites; however, the presence of Ebola virus RNA in semen long after discharge from Ebola treatment centre is now well documented.

The authors argue that the mean neutralising titre assessed in survivors is much higher than the immune response observed one month after one dose of the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine (rVSV[delta]G-ZEBOV-GP) in a phase 1 trial. This comparison is challenged by a vaccine study in Guinea where 83% of 1053 frontline workers express a seroresponse one month after vaccination, with a 9-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres from baseline. In the same study, seroresponse persisted 180 days after vaccination in 84.2% (95% CI 74.4-90.7) of individuals who seroresponded after 28 days. By contrast, the cellular response after a natural infection appears much higher than after vaccination. Another study in Guinea, which compared immune responses between 10 rVSV-ZEBOV vaccinees and 25 survivors, found high and equivalent antibody titres 6 months after vaccination or natural infection. Overall, these studies of vaccine immunogenicity implemented in operational conditions are consistent with the results generated by early vaccine trials done in healthy adults in the USA, Canada, and Spain.

The report by Thom and colleagues also provides useful information regarding the immune responses in contacts of Ebola virus disease cases. Although no distinction between asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic presentations of the infection can be made, both neutralising antibodies and cellular responses were identified in 6 (9%) of the 66 contacts. This figure compares well with the seropositivity observed in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic contacts in Guinea (3.3% vs 8.3%) and Sierra Leone (2.6% vs 12.0%).

In summary, on the one hand, we have accumulated sufficient clinical and immunological data from survivors of the 2013-16 west African Ebola epidemic in favour of acquired immunity to Ebola virus lasting at least a few years after a natural infection. On the other hand, studies of correlates of protection for Ebola vaccines that support an induced immunity have, so far, only followed patients for up to 6 months. Natural acquired immunity could provide protection to people who have been exposed to and infected with Ebola virus for at least a few years, even if antibody concentrations decrease with time, owing to backup memory B cells and cellular immunity.

[2] FDA approves monoclonal antibody cocktail
- Wed 14 Oct 2020
[FDA (abridged, edited)]
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-ebola-virus

Today Wed 14 Oct 2020], the US Food and Drug Administration approved Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn), a mixture of 3 monoclonal antibodies, as the 1st FDA-approved treatment for Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus) infection in adult and pediatric patients.

"Today's action demonstrates the FDA's ongoing commitment to responding to public health threats -- both domestically and abroad -- on the basis of science and data," said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, MD. "This approval was made possible because of our steadfast dedication to facilitate the development of safe and effective treatments for infectious diseases as part of our vital public health mission."

Zaire ebolavirus, commonly known as Ebola virus, is one of 4 _Ebolavirus_ species that can cause a potentially fatal human disease. Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected people or wild animals, as well as with surfaces and materials, such as bedding and clothing, contaminated with these fluids. Individuals who provide care for people with Ebola virus, including healthcare workers who do not use correct infection-control precautions, are at the highest risk for infection.

Inmazeb targets the glycoprotein that is on the surface of Ebola virus. Glycoprotein attaches to the cell receptor and fuses the viral and host cell membranes, allowing the virus to enter the cell. The 3 antibodies that make up Inmazeb can bind to this glycoprotein simultaneously and block attachment and entry of the virus.

Inmazeb was evaluated in 382 adult and pediatric patients with confirmed Zaire ebolavirus infection in one clinical trial (the PALM trial) and as part of an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during an Ebola virus outbreak in 2018-2019. The PALM trial was led by the US National Institutes of Health and the DRC's Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale with contributions from several other international organizations and agencies.

"Today's [14 Oct 2020] approval highlights the importance of international collaboration in the fight against Ebola virus," said John Farley, MD, MPH, director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "The urgent need for advanced therapies to combat this infectious disease is clear, and today's action is a significant step forward in that effort."

In the PALM trial, the safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, in which 154 patients received Inmazeb (50 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenously as a single infusion, and 168 patients received an investigational control. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day mortality. The primary analysis population was all patients who were randomized and concurrently eligible to receive either Inmazeb or the investigational control during the same time period of the trial. Of the 154 patients who received Inmazeb, 33.8% died after 28 days, compared to 51% of the 153 patients who received a control. In the expanded access program, an additional 228 patients received Inmazeb.

The most common symptoms experienced while receiving Inmazeb included fever, chills, tachycardia (fast heart rate), tachypnea (fast breathing), and vomiting; however, these are also common symptoms of Ebola virus infection. Patients who receive Inmazeb should avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine due to the treatment's potential to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Ebola virus infection and possibly reduce the vaccine's efficacy.

Hypersensitivity, including infusion-related events, can occur in patients taking Inmazeb, and treatment should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Inmazeb received an Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. The Orphan Drug designation provides incentives to assist and encourage drug development for rare diseases. Additionally, the agency granted Inmazeb a Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of Zaire ebolavirus infection.

The FDA is granting the approval to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

The FDA approved Ervebo, the 1st vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease, in December 2019, with support from a study conducted in Guinea during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak.
