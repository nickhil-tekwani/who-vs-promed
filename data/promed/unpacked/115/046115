The Western Cape department of agriculture has confirmed the outbreak of
Newcastle disease among poultry at an informal settlement near Knysna.
Agricultural MEC Cobus Dowry said tests conducted on samples submitted to
the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute also confirmed that the virus
responsible for the outbreak was identical to the virus responsible for
mortalities in poultry in other parts of the country.
An estimated 200 chickens have since died of the disease in the Knysna area.
However, arrangements have already been made to assist people in the area
with obtaining vaccines and to vaccinate their poultry.
Secretions and excretions from infected birds can pollute the environment
in general, thus pass on the disease to susceptible birds. Symptoms include
respiratory stress, with slimy eyes and nose secretions accompanied by
diarrhoea and nerve symptoms such as twisted necks, among birds. Sudden
mortality occurs, increasing every hour.
Mr Dowry said that although the province had been fortunate thus far in not
having to cope with the high number of mortalities experienced in other
areas, it remained important that poultry farmers vaccinate their poultry
and to ensure that they did not buy unvaccinated poultry or day-old chickens.
The Director of Veterinary Services, Dr Gideon Bruckner, said that the last
outbreak in the province was in 1998 on a smallholding near Albertinia.
He confirmed that the disease did not affect humans but ostriches were
susceptible. Ostrich owners should therefore also ensure that their animals
are vaccinated.

[An official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the above outbreak and of
the alleged other recent outbreaks in South Africa will be useful. South
Africa's last notification to the OIE on an outbreak of NCD was
received on 2 December 2004 (see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_16.HTM#Sec11>); a total of 4 outbreaks
were recorded during Oct-Dec 2004. - Mod.AS].
