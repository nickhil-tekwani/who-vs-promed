[According to the report above, a total of 82 971 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 4 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (20 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 4 new cases of confirmed infections -- 2 locally acquired cases (both in Jilin province) and 2 imported case (both in Sichuan province).

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 8 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1711 imported cases reported.

There were 35 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all 35 cases were locally acquired. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 365, and 26 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

- KCDC provided the following guidance for COVID-19 prevention and timely response in schools.
-- Students, teachers, and staff should check their symptoms in the morning and stay home if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. They should keep facemasks on at all time while in school and strictly follow personal hygiene measures such as hand washing and cough etiquette.
-- Students, teachers, and staff are urged to avoid karaoke rooms, PC cafes, nightclubs, and bars.
-- Schools should ensure that every student's body temperature is checked before the student enters classroom. If a student has temperature of 37.5 degrees or above or have other suspected symptoms, the school should have the student put on an MFDS-approved facemask (that is, KF80, KF94, or KF99) and wait in a separate location while the school contacts the student's parent or guardian.
-- If a confirmed case is found in a school, all students, teachers, and staff of the school will be instructed to put on an MFDS-approved facemask and return home. Local municipal government will conduct epidemiological investigation, disinfection, restriction of use of the affected facility, and other necessary infection control measures.

- Regarding public disclosure of travel routes of individual confirmed cases, KCDC requested municipal governments not to disclose personally identifiable information that is not essential for the purpose of preventing further spread of the infectious disease.
-- The revised protocols for information disclosure outlines that the purpose of infectious disease prevention and the protection of privacy of confirmed case-patients should be taken into consideration to ensure that the disclosure includes only the information that is relevant and necessary for the prevention of infectious diseases.
-- As per the revised protocols, "repeated mass exposure locations" are disclosed directly by KCDC and excluded from the travel routes of individual confirmed cases disclosed by municipal governments.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 20 cases with 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (20 to 21 May 2020) when there were 12 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 11 142 confirmed cases and 264 deaths were reported today (21 May 2020), up from 11 122 cases and 264 deaths yesterday (20 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 49 consecutive days and below 50 for 42 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 14 days. In today's (21 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 11 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 9 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (6) cases, Gyeongbuk (2) and 1 each in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeongnam Imported cases were in Quarantine (7), and 1 each in Seoul and Ulsan.

According to the English language update, the Itaewon nightclub cluster is now up to 206 cases, 95 club attendees and 111 contacts (family, co-workers, friends) involving 11 provinces/cities in the country: Seoul City (101), Gyeonggi Province (45), Incheon City (40), Chungbuk Province (9), Busan City (4), Jeonbuk Province (2), Daejeon City (1), Chungnam Province (1), Gyeongnam Province (1), Gangwon Province (1), and Jeju Province (1).

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus. And the Korean CDC is encouraging no club, bars or Karaoke visits.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 228 006 cases, including 32 486 deaths, up from 227 364 cases and 32 330 deaths reported on 20 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 20 and 21 May 2020 was 642 newly confirmed cases, compared with 665 newly confirmed cases between 19 and 20 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 75.1% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 49.2% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 13 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (Bolzano and Calabria provinces reported no new cases), and another 4 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Liguria and Emilia-Romagna were the only provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 66 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 65 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 129 341 total cases, 7249 deaths
Date: Thu 21 May 2020
Source: Gulf Today / Reuters report [edited]
https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/05/21/10000-healthcare-workers-infected-with-virus-in-iran


Around 10 000 Iranian health workers have been infected with the new coronavirus, the semi-official ILNA news agency quoted a deputy health minister as saying on Thursday [21 May 2020].

Health services are stretched thin in Iran, the Middle East country hardest hit by the respiratory pandemic, with 7249 deaths and a total of 129 341 infections. The Health Ministry said in April [2020] that over 100 health workers had died of COVID-19. No more details on infections among health workers were immediately available.

Earlier on Thursday [21 May 2020], Health Minister Saeed Namaki appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during the Eid Al Fitr religious holiday [end of Ramadan] later this month [24 May 2020] to avoid the risk of a new surge of coronavirus infections, state TV reported. Iranians often travel to different cities around the country to mark the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, something Namaki said could lead to a disregard of social distancing rules and a fresh outbreak of COVID-19. "I am urging you not to travel during the Eid. Definitely, such trips mean new cases of infection... People should not travel to and from those high-risk red areas," Namaki was quoted by state television as saying.

"Some 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease. In the case of a new outbreak, it will be very difficult for me and my colleagues to control it." A report by parliament's research centre suggested that the actual tally of infections and deaths in Iran might be almost twice that announced by the health ministry. However, worried that measures to limit public activities could wreck an economy which has already been battered by US sanctions, the government has been easing most restrictions on normal life in late April 2020].

Infected cases have been on a rising trajectory for the past 2 weeks. However President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday [20 May 2020] that Iran was close to curbing the outbreak.

[In the 24 hours from 20 to 21 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 126 949 to 129 341 total cases, an increase of 2392 compared with 2346 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (20 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7183 to 7249, an increase of 66 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Brazil, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 21 May 2020; 21:54 EDT (GMT-4).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The cumulative antibody-confirmed cases is available just above Figure 3 and I am adding it to the PCR cases. There were 344 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 416 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 19 to 20 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 233 037 [280 117] cases as compared with 232 555 [279 524] confirmed cases on 20 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 940 deaths reported today (21 May 2020) and 27 888 deaths reported on 20 May 2020, an increase of 52 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 16.63, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 16.63 today (21 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd highest case count in Europe and is 4th globally (Brazil surpassed Spain in the past 48 hours) behind the USA, Russia, and Brazil in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 233 037 [280 117] cases, an additional 140 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 20 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
