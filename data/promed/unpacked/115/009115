Chikungunya is yet to subside in the city despite the onset of winter.
As against 70 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] reported in 2010,
100 people have tested positive for chikungunya fever this year. "Last
year we had 70 cases of chikungunya. But this year it is 100. We are
taking all precautionary steps to prevent mosquito breeding and we
have advised people to keep their surroundings clean," MCD's Public
Health Committee chairman VK Monga said.

[The number of chikungunya virus infections in Delhi has increased
slightly from 95 on 26 Nov 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111126.3455) to the 100 cases 6 days later reported above. It is
difficult to explain why dengue cases are declining yet chikungunya
virus infections continue, since the viruses are transmitted by the
same _Aedes_ mosquito vector. Perhaps a greater proportion of the
population is already immune to dengue viruses but has not had
previous chikungunya virus infections and would be susceptible. With
continuing colder weather, transmission of both viruses should slow or
perhaps stop.
