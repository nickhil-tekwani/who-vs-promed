3 Baltimore County Detention Center inmates test positive for Salmonella
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 inmates at the Baltimore County Detention Center have contracted salmonellosis, county officials confirmed Thursday, 25 Aug 2016. The Baltimore County Department of Health is now conducting an investigation with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The investigation will include inspections of the kitchen and common areas. All of the current kitchen workers have been replaced with temporary workers, officials announced.

"With due diligence and continued collaboration with the Department of Health, I am confident that this matter will resolve in a timely manner to prevent additional cases of this nature," said Deborah Richardson, Director of the Baltimore County Detention Center.

People can contract salmonellosis by consuming contaminated food or water, or coming in contact with the feces of infected people or animals.

[It would not be surprising if the number of cases of salmonellosis spikes higher, as in centers like this, the residents generally receive the same food. Although the food workers were replaced, it is likely that the workers were not the source but rather contamination of foods eaten without cooking (such as salads) or problems with kitchen hygiene caused the cases. - Mod.LL
