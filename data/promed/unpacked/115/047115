Scientists predict next Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
The next Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] outbreak should be expected to occur "in
northern Congo Brazzaville [Republic of Congo], towards Cameroon and the
Central African Republic," according to African scientists who have closely
studied the pattern of the deadly disease. They found that Ebola affects
many Central African mammals besides humans and that the disease fluctuates
with climate variables throughout the Gabon-Congo region, making
predictions possible.
Sally Lahm has led decade-long research into the roots and patterns of
Ebola outbreaks in Gabon and Congo Brazzaville. Working as a research
associate at the Institute for Research in Tropical Ecology in Makokou,
Gabon since 1982, she was originally conducting unrelated ecological
studies. But the outbreaks of Ebola virus in humans prompted her to explore
how the disease was affecting animal populations in the region.
Between 1994 and 2003, she and her team collected reports of animal illness
and deaths from wildlife survey teams, villagers, hunters, fishers,
loggers, miners, Ebola survivors and families of victims from across Gabon
and into northwestern Congo Brazzaville.
Despite the low probability of finding dead animals in the humid forests
that cover most of the region, due to the scavenging by animals and insects
and rapid decomposition, Ms. Lahm received and verified reports of 397 dead
animals. The carcasses, which were found at 35 different sites in Gabon and
Congo, included gorillas, chimpanzees, mandrills, bush pigs, porcupines and
4 species of antelope. Tests from 12 out of 35 sites proved sick or dying
animals with Ebola symptoms. In addition, 16 reported wildlife mortality
incidents coincided with known Ebola epidemics.
This had shown that "the transmission of Ebola within animal populations is
much more widespread than previously believed," explained Ms. Lahm. "Ebola
appears to spread both within species and between different species of
animals."
To determine the extent of human exposure to Ebola within Gabon, Ms. Lahm
collaborated with Maryvonne Kombila of the University of Health Sciences in
Libreville, Gabon and with Robert Swanepoel of the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases in Sandringham, South Africa. Robert Swanepoel tested
for antibodies to the Ebola virus in more than 1000 human blood samples
that had been collected by Ms. Kombila and her colleagues for other
research in Gabon between 1981 and 1997.
14 of the blood samples [less than 1.2 percent; titre unstated - Mod.CP]
tested positive for antibodies to Ebola. Some people had been exposed at
least 3 years before the 1st known Ebola outbreak in Gabon, while others
lived in regions where no known epidemics had occurred.
In 2003, Ms. Lahm was able to track down 6 of the people whose blood
samples indicated that they had been exposed to the Ebola virus. Life
history interviews revealed that some of the antibody-positive people had
never visited a region where known Ebola outbreaks occurred in humans.
"Therefore, people have been exposed to the Ebola virus where it has not
been recognized," the African scientist team concludes.
Based on their findings, the researchers were able to identify
relationships among previously documented Ebola outbreaks in humans and
wildlife in Gabon and Congo Brazzaville that initially seemed disparate and
unrelated. They proposed that the virus 1st spread southwest across Gabon.
It then looped back toward the northeast from sites in western or central
Gabon and caused the most recent outbreaks in Congo Brazzaville.
"If the spread of the Ebola virus follows its current northeastward path,
the next outbreak would be expected to occur in northern Congo Brazzaville
towards Cameroon and the Central African Republic," predicted Ms. Lahm
after assessing the team's findings.
However, according to the same findings, the spread of Ebola also depends
on climate factors. Illness and deaths among animals were most prevalent
during periods of prolonged drought-like conditions in the rainforest,
which had indicated that "severe environmental stress may facilitate
disease transmission," according to the team.
In the study, the researchers urge that "public education is needed" to
decrease human contact with potentially infected wildlife by discouraging
people from scavenging dead animals and by promoting safe hunting and
trapping practices, especially because the results show that outbreaks in
wildlife populations have been much more frequent than previously believed.
Ms. Lahm's team, therefore, does not go as far as non-African scientists,
who have called for a total ban on bushmeat.
They further emphasize that "monitoring wildlife in collaboration with
rural African residents" could provide information essential for protecting
public health as well as comprehending the ecology of the disease. Gabonese
and Congolese forest residents -- who the team spent much time with during
the last decade -- could be the most competent in detecting an Ebola
outbreak among forest mammals, thus alerting scientists before the disease
spreads to the human population.
Ms. Lahm points out that there remain many unanswered questions about
Ebola, including how the virus spreads within and between mammal species.
"Our study provides more pieces of the puzzle, but at the same time, it is
enlarging the puzzle," she modestly concludes.

[The above prediction is based on largely circumstantial evidence that
cannot be evaluated with certainty because the number of positive human
sera is small and the titres are not given in this report.

The data referred to in the above report is being published in the January
2007 issue of the Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2007 Jan;101(1):64-78, in a
paper entitled: "Morbidity and mortality of wild animals in relation to
outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gabon, 1994-2003; by Lahm SA,
Kombila M, Swanepoel R, Barnes RF.
The Abstract reads: "Antibody to Ebola virus was found in 14 (1.2 percent)
of 1147 human sera collected in Gabon in 1981-1997. Six seropositive
subjects were bled in the northeast in 1991, more than 3 years prior to
recognition of the 1st known outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF),
whilst 8 came from the southwest, where the disease has not been
recognized. It has been reported elsewhere that 98 carcasses of wild
animals were found in systematic studies in northeastern Gabon and
adjoining northwestern Republic of the Congo (RoC) during 5 EHF epidemics
in August 2001 to June 2003, with Ebola virus infection being confirmed in
14 carcasses. During the present opportunistic observations, reports were
investigated of a further 397 carcasses, mainly gorillas, chimpanzees,
mandrills and bush pigs, found by rural residents in 35 incidents in Gabon
and RoC during 1994-2003. 16 incidents had temporal and/or spatial
coincidence with confirmed EHF outbreaks, and the remaining 19 appeared to
represent extension of disease from such sites. There appeared to be
sustained Ebola virus activity in the northeast in 1994-1999, with
sequential spread from 1996 onwards, 1st westwards, then southerly, and
then northeastwards, reaching the Gabon-RoC border in 2001. This implies
that there was transmission of infection between wild mammals, but the
species involved are highly susceptible and unlikely to be natural hosts of
the virus."
It remains true that transmission of Ebola virus to the human population is
still a rare event. - Mod.CP]
