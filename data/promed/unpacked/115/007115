South Africa's tuberculosis [TB] epidemic has jumped from humans to pets,
zoo animals, and wildlife. The human strain of the disease has been found
in springbok, mongooses, baboons, chimpanzees and, most recently, a Maltese
poodle. Worldwide, the human strain of the disease, [_Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_], is rare in animals, who are more commonly infected with
another strain, _Mycobacterium bovis.

"While in most of the rest of the world animals are always regarded as a
potential source of TB, in this area we have to be worried about the
reverse situation," said veterinary pathologist Tertius Gous, who recently
diagnosed human TB in springbok near Cape Town, and a new TB strain in
dassies [according the Kruger National Park website, which has great
pictures of these undeniably engaging little animals, a dassie is a small,
plump, and tail-less guinea-pig-like animal, which is about as large as a
big rabbit and haunts rock outcrops, hillocks, and mountain cliffs. They
are the African elephants closest living relative. See website at

The risk of contaminating pets is highest in low-income areas such as
townships, according to Sven Parsons from the University of Stellenbosch,
who recently recorded South Africa's 1st case of human TB in a dog, a stray
Maltese cross.

There is concern that animals with human TB could infect people although
this still needs to be researched.

[As the article indicates, this is not the 1st time that zoonotic
infections moving from humans to animals have been identified in South
Africa. In 1998, Anita Michel identified transmission between a chronically
infected human and a marmoset. See Michel AL, Huchzermeyer HF. The zoonotic
importance of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_: transmission from human to
monkey. J S Afr Vet Assoc 1998; 69: 64-5. Abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9760401>.

Formerly, the zoonotic disease nomenclature was divided by the direction of
transmission into anthropozoonoses and zooanthropozoonoses. As indicated in
a very nice little article by Zdenak Hubalek, which explores some of the
nuances of the zoonotic disease nomenclature, the directionality
terminology was dropped in 1959 by a WHO Expert committee because it was
cumbersome and commonly misinterpreted. See Hubalek Z. Emerging human
infectious diseases: anthroponoses, zoonoses, and sapronoses. Emerg Infect
Dis [serial online] 2003 Mar [date cited]. Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no3/02-0208.htm>.

Similar human to animal zoonotic transmissions have been noticed around
ecotourist hubs in Uganda and other places. Such phenomena would benefit
from surveillance and active follow up to identify modes of transmission,
so that we can learn more about the epidemiology of these unusual
directions of infection diseases shared between mammals. - Mod.PC]
