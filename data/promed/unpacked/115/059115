Travelers to Asia and the Pacific have been warned to protect themselves from a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne illness that is described as "a major health threat" for Australia.

There were 127 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] among Australians in 2013, up from 19 in 2012, Department of Health's notifiable diseases surveillance system data analysed by comparison website finder.com.au shows.

This is a 568 per cent increase in the number of notified cases in 12 months, and is part of a sharp increase in recorded cases in recent years that have contributed to fears among public health experts that chikungunya [virus] could even reach Australia.

"This is a previously less common virus that is having a really good crack at spreading throughout the world," The Travel Doctor - TMVC national medical advisor Dr Tony Gherardin said.

"It's now much more prevalent in areas where Australians are going."Repeated epidemics over the past decade have seen chikungunya [virus] spread beyond its African origins to most of the world's tropical regions.

It is now prevalent in South East Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific, leading to a spike in cases among Australians travelling to these countries. Chikungunya [virus] is spread by 2 types of mosquitoes active during the day: the _Aedes aegypti_ and the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito - more commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito - which is typically found in heavily populated areas.

Similar to Ross River fever or dengue fever - both of which are present in Australia's north - chikungunya [virus infection] is most common during the tropical rainy season, has a short incubation period and symptoms that include high fever, rash and aching joints. "A classic sign is that people are struggling to walk around because they have such painful joints," he said.

While most cases of chikungunya [virus infection] will clear after about a week, in about 10 percent of cases it can become chronic and result in repeated flare-ups which are debilitating. "The issue around chronic disease is that there is no real understanding of
who does get chronic chikungunya [symptoms] and who doesn't," he said.

Dr Gherardin said there is no known cure or treatment for chikungunya [virus infections], so travellers must take precautions to stop themselves from being bitten. This includes wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers, applying repellent and visiting a doctor if you are unsure about your symptoms. "At the moment there is no vaccine and no prevention, so the core message is simple: don't get bitten," Dr Gherardin said.

"And if you are concerned, you are better off seeking advice, seeking treatment and seeking a diagnosis."

While chikungunya [fever] remains an issue that affects Australians travelling overseas, Dr Gherardin said there was also a danger that the virus could cross the Torres Strait and reach Australia. He said the short distance and regular population movements between Papua New Guinea and Cape York have heightened the risk.

"Public health people make a lot of effort here to keep the Asian tiger mosquito out of Australia, which is one of the reasons why they spray on planes," he said. "But like dengue [virus], there is the risk that there could be local transmission (of chikungunya [virus]) through the _Ae. aegypti_.

"It's a major public health threat for Australia."

[There has been local transmission of dengue viruses in northern Queensland after the viruses have been imported by viremic travelers from endemic countries. The risk of initiating a local outbreak following importation of chikungunya virus into these areas of Queensland where dengue virus transmission is occurring is real. In 2013, there were 13 documented imported cases of chikungunya virus infections diagnosed in Queensland (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130929.1974825).
