Alert as measles spreads
------------------------
A highly contagious measles outbreak has spread to a large mine west of
Cairns, where up to 300 workers may have to be vaccinated against the
virus. Two miners in their 20s fell ill with the disease last week [3-7 Mar
2008]. One was so sick he had to be put in isolation in Cairns Base
Hospital late Friday night. He was released from isolation yesterday [Mon
10 Mar 2008]. One of the men is believed to have picked up the disease from
an unknown carrier in mid-February when he visited a large Cairns shopping
centre.

The same carrier at the same time is believed to have passed on the virus
to an unrelated high school student, who then went on to infect 3 other
students from Cairns and Kuranda. The miner returned to the mine site,
about 4 hours' drive west of Cairns, and infected a fellow unvaccinated worker.

Tropical Population Health Network medical director Dr Jeffrey Hanna
yesterday said the shopping centre was the only common link between the 4
infected students and the 2 miners. He said it showed how contagious the
disease was. "Apparently, it's the most contagious virus known -- it's the
leader of the pack," Dr Hanna said. The discovery of the 1st 4
locally-acquired cases of the disease in 11 years last week prompted urgent
warnings from public health authorities for people to be on the lookout for
measles symptoms.

Although none of the students -- 2 girls and 2 boys aged between 12 and 15
-- had to be treated in hospital, Dr Hanna said 3 were "pretty crook". The
bigger concern was that they had been highly mobile while at their most
contagious, using public buses, visiting 2 of Cairns' biggest shopping
centres, a large popular Cairns restaurant, a swimming carnival, and a
large party in the Kuranda area.

Dr Hanna said the 2 miners had not interacted outside the mine site during
this early stage.

Measles starts as a vague fever and and a moist cough before developing
into an angry, red, blotchy rash that begins at the neck and works its way
down the trunk and limbs. See your GP if you think you have measles, but
ask to be seen away from the waiting room to avoid spreading the disease.

[This outbreak, although small, has the potential to spread widely due to
the mobility of the index cases. The extent of the amplification of the
outbreak will depend on the number of vaccinated or partially vaccinated
individuals living in or visiting the Cairns area.
