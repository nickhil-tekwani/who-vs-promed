Restoring veterinary services in Iraq
-------------------------------------
Veterinary services in Iraq have been severely damaged after years of
neglect and post-conflict upheavals, FAO said today.
The UN agency is currently working to restore urgently needed veterinary
services in the country to protect farm animals and humans from epidemic
diseases.
Iraq's herds include approximately 2.5 million cattle and 17 million sheep
and goats. Livestock production is extensive and herds migrate throughout
Iraq and neighbouring countries.
Meat, milk and eggs are the most important source of protein for the
population. Any increase in livestock diseases would have a negative effect
on the supply of protein-rich food such as milk, cheese, yoghurt, meat and
eggs and would have a severe impact on food security.
The country is facing a serious deficit in disease surveillance and
emergency preparedness, both crucial elements in fighting endemic and
exotic animal diseases, FAO said.
Transboundary animal diseases such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD),
screwworm and peste des petits ruminants (PPR) are especially threatening
in Iraq and in the region. Many other preventable diseases are of concern,
including hemorrhagic septicaemia, sheep and goat pox and many production
limiting diseases, such as mastitis. Brucellosis, Congo-Crimean
haemorrhagic fever and anthrax are also threats to humans and should be
controlled by a modern veterinary service.
"Iraqi veterinarians consider Brucellosis the most threatening disease
transmitted from animals to humans," said David Ward, FAO Senior Animal
Health expert. "Brucellosis is a bacterial disease passed to humans from
milk, causing recurring fever, joint pain and severe headaches. It is
estimated that over 1.5 million sheep are infected with the disease in the
country."
Under a USD 10-million project, FAO is closely working with veterinary
staff to upgrade the animal health infrastructure and to protect farm
animals from epidemic and endemic diseases and reduce public health risks.
Key elements of the project are:
- training of veterinary staff to improve its technical and management
skills in disease control and surveillance;
- improving the performance of veterinary field services in the country
through procurement of clinical supplies and equipment;
- restoring diagnostic and quality control laboratories;
- building and equipping 9 veterinary centres and 7 cold storage facilities;
- assisting senior veterinary staff in devising disease control and public
health strategies.
The project will benefit more than 4.5 million people. Up to 500 veterinary
service and laboratory staff in 15 provincial veterinary hospitals, 220
district clinics and 45 veterinary centres will receive professional training.
The project will also create opportunities for the private veterinary
sector. Essential government services will continue, but the role of the
private sector is expected to increase.
The FAO project is funded by the UN Development Group Iraq Trust Fund.

[The reactivation and upgrading of Iraq's veterinary infrastructure and
professional staff is long due. No detailed official data on the incidence
of animal diseases have been forthcoming for years, though Iraq is a member
of the OIE. There is also a concerning lack of information on the current
incidence of widespread, endemic zoonoses such as Brucellosis (mainly
caused by _Brucella melitensis_), anthrax, rabies, CCHF and Leishmaniasis.
The FAO initiative is timely and welcome; the budget mentioned in the press
release seems rather modest for the heavy task. On top of restoring the
national Iraqi veterinary services, support should become available for the
enhancement of regional, near-Eastern cooperation in studies and control of
epizootics and zoonotic diseases. - Mod.AS]
