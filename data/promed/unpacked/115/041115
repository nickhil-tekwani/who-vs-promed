Additional Suspected Clusters of Variant CJD Cases in Britain
------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists are investigating 6 new potential clusters of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) victims scattered throughout Britain. At
least 2 people have died from the human form of "mad cow" disease in each
of the 6 areas, and experts are examining links between the cases by
studying local butchery practices, medical records, and eating habits. So
far only one group of cases has been confirmed; namely, in the village of
Queniborough, Leicestershire, where 5 young people died.
Yesterday it emerged that a third victim of the disease had died in the
town of Eastleigh, Hampshire, one of the potential cluster sites. A 25
year-old man was diagnosed with vCJD 5 months ago. A preliminary
investigation was started earlier this year into the deaths of 2 other
people in the Eastleigh area. It found no obvious links between the cases,
but further investigations are to take place during the coming months.
Scientists from the government-funded CJD Surveillance Unit, based in
Edinburgh, are working in conjunction with local health authorities in an
effort to isolate common factors between cases.
The Department of Health refused to identify the areas being examined, but
last week local health authorities covering Stockton-on-Tees,
Chester-le-Street (Durham), and Glasgow, in addition to Eastleigh,
confirmed that they were assisting in investigations. The unit is believed
to be preparing to launch studies in 2 other unnamed areas. Studies have
already been conducted in Stockport and in Armthorpe, South Yorkshire, but
have failed to find any links between cases. Victims' families are being
interviewed and sent questionnaires which examine where they bought meat,
where children went to school, and where they had hospital or dental
treatment to ascertain if there was exposure to contaminated blood.
Research by the CJD Surveillance Unit and the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine found that the incidence of vCJD was twice as high in the
north of Britain as in the south. Dr Simon Cousens, who led the study,
confirmed that potential new clusters were being investigated. However,
experts warn that trying to find links between cases was extremely
difficult. In Armthorpe no direct links were found, even though the 2
victims of the disease were friends who lived in the same street. A 28-year
old woman, who died last September, was a friend of a 19-year-old man, who
died in 1997. Last week Doncaster Health Authority said investigations had
been hampered because many small abattoirs from the 1980s had closed. In
Stockport a 29-year-old man and a 34-year-old man who lived only 2 streets
apart both died of vCJD, but again no link has been found.
There have been 99 cases in total of "definite and probable" vCJD in Britain.
