In the state of Tocantins, in the Northern region of Brazil, officials are reporting an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar in the city of Tocantinópolis.

According to a G1 report (computer translated), the city is on alert after reporting more than 400 cases in dogs and 9 in humans since the beginning of the year [2017]. This year, so far, there are 50 suspicious notifications. A total of 5 cases were confirmed in adults and 4 in children younger than 10 years. There were 12 human cases in all of last year [2016].

But the biggest concern, according to the Epidemiological Surveillance Coordination is regarding the cases in animals, which are hosts of the disease. That's because the villagers do not want to hand over the animals to be sacrificed. Of the 407 who had a positive diagnosis, only 277 were sacrificed.

"The veterinarians say it has a cure and treatment, but it is very expensive. So we have very high dog positivity and the people do not want to give the dogs the treatment, "explained coordinator Maria Vandecy Soares Ribeiro.

According to the World Health Organization, over 90 percent of visceral leishmaniasis cases occur in 6 countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan and Sudan. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. Leishmaniasis has several different forms. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most serious manifestation, which affects some of the internal organs of the body (such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow).

VL is predominantly transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand fly, although congenital and parenteral transmission (through blood transfusions and needle sharing) have been reported.

[The most common Leishmania subspecies responsible for Visceral Leishmanaiasis in Brazil is _L. infantum_ with the dog, _Canis familiaris_ and other canines _Lycalopex vetulus_, _Cerdocyon thous_, _Didelphis albiventris_ as reservoirs (Alvar J, Vélez ID, Bern C, et al. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. 2012, PLoS ONE 7(5): e35671, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). The infection is transmitted to humans by the sandfly, different subspecies of _Lutzomyia_.

Tocantinópolis is located in the north eastern part of Brazil, and area with the highest incidence of VL in Brazil. An increase can be due to several factors like increasing density of household dogs, increase in the wild, canine or rodent reservoir and increasing density of the sandfly vector. Also, VL is an HIV-related infection and it is important to know that the new cases are not HIV related. - Mod.EP
