2000/132 Pepino mosaic potexvirus found in Spain [edited
-------------------------------------------------------------
Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PePV) (EPPO Alert List) [has been reported in
Spain on tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum_). [It was detected on tomato
samples from Murcia, AlmeriÂ­a and also from [the Canary islands (Santa
Cruz in Tenerife, Las Palmas in Gran Canaria). However, no details are
given on the extent of the disease in the field and the severity of
symptoms observed on tomato crops.
The status of pepino mosaic potexvirus in Spain can be described as:
Present: only in some areas.
It is [to be noted that "pepino dulce" (Solanum muricatum) is cultivated
on a small scale in Spain. This crop can be affected by various viruses
(the most serious being tomato mosaic tobamovirus), but [to date PePV has
not been found on Spanish S. muricatum crops. The origin of the
introduction of PePV into Spain is unknown. [Introduction of pepino into
Spain was always in small quantities under quarantine. [It is considered
more likely that PePV was introduced with tomato material from the
Netherlands which is subject to large volumes of trade.
In Europe, PePV was first found in January 1999 in the Netherlands (in
approximately 50 tomato glasshouses) and then in United Kingdom in 2 tomato
glasshouses (south of England). A total of 2 cases were reported in tomato
glasshouses in Germany in 1999. An isolated finding was reported in one
tomato glasshouse in Bretagne in France, in 2000 and was subsequently
eradicated. Within the EU, precautionary measures have been taken to
prevent any further spread of this virus (see EPPO RS 2000/003, 2000/062
and EPPO Technical Document No. 1037).
