The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has been notified by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of a confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) today [11 Jul 2015] affecting a 37 year old woman in Yunnan province. The patient presented with fever and cough with sputum beginning on [6 Jul 2015], was admitted to a local hospital on 9 Jul 2015, and died on 10 Jul 2015.

"All novel influenza A infections (including H5N6) are notifiable diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the DH said. "Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

"In view of cases confirmed on the mainland, members of the public should maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times during travel," the spokesman urged. "All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added...

[Avian influenza strain A(H5N6) causes a high death rate in infected chickens and geese and was 1st detected by authorities in China in April 2014 but has since spread to Laos and Viet Nam, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). While there are few human cases, the virus is highly virulent in poultry, with high mortality within 72 hours of becoming sick. The 1st fatal case in humans occurred in a 49 year old man from Nanbu county in Sichuan province. Since then, there have been at least 2 additional human infections (one in Guangdong Province survived).

The last (fatal) human infection was reported in Yunnan Province, the same province as this current case. A 44 year old male from Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province developed symptoms on 27 Jan 2015; he was admitted to hospital on 3 Feb 2015 and died on 6 Feb 2015. The patient had history of exposure to dead wild fowl.
