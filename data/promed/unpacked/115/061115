Several people who mysteriously became sick after camping on the west
side of Utah Lake might have contracted tularemia, officials at the
Utah Department of Health said. While they are still awaiting lab
confirmation of the diagnosis, officials issued an advisory to avoid
contracting the infectious bacterium, which commonly causes fever and
swollen lymph nodes. A treatable infection, tularemia usually spreads
through tick and deerfly bites, but it also can be contracted through
mosquitoes or by direct contact with an infected animal. Outdoor
enthusiasts are advised to wear long, light-colored pants tucked into
boots or socks and long-sleeved shirts, stay on marked trails, avoid
walking in tall grasses, use repellents containing DEET and avoid
direct contact with wild animals including their feces and carcasses.
Health officials advise those who believe they have infected bug
bites to contact their physician or local health departments and
mention tularemia. Treatments for the infection are different from
that typically used for skin infections.

[Although the clinical manifestations in campers in the Utah outbreak
are not described, they must have been characteristic enough of
tularemia to warrant a presumptive diagnosis, pending laboratory
confirmation. Fever, chills, drenching sweats, muscle aches, malaise,
nausea, vomiting, and weight loss usually appear 3 to 5 days after
exposure to _Francisella tularensis_, but can take as long as 14
days. Other manifestations usually are specific for the mode of
transmission. For example, open painful sores develop where the
bacteria entered the skin at the site of a scratch or abrasion,
usually on the hands and fingers of hunters, or in the groin, axilla,
and trunk in tick or deer fly-associated cases, accompanied by
swollen, painful regional lymphadenopathy. A sore, inflamed throat
and cervical swollen lymph nodes follow ingestion of undercooked
infected meat or contaminated water; abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally intestinal bleeding with swollen
abdominal lymph nodes may also occur. Pneumonia may follow inhalation
of infectious aerosols. Inhalation of an infectious aerosol is
believed to be the mode of transmission if _F. tularensis_ were to be
used as a bioweapon. A typhoidal type involves chills, high fever,
and abdominal pain due to blood stream infection with _F. tularensis_
in the absence of an ulcer or swollen lymph nodes. The animal source
is usually an infected rodent or rabbit. Diagnosis is usually made on
the basis of positive cultures of blood or other infected material or
serology.
Tularemia is usually treated with gentamicin or streptomycin for 7 to
14 days, although other antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g.,
ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or tetracyclines (minocyclne and
doxycycline) are also effective. If untreated, the overall death rate
is 5-15 percent; less than one percent of appropriately treated
patients die.

The Cape May County Department of Health was notified on 12 Jul 2007
that a 14-year-old county resident has contracted tularemia, also
known as "rabbit fever."
Tularemia is a rare, potentially serious illness caused by the
bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which occurs widely in nature and
can affect animals, particularly rodents and rabbits. Tularemia can
be acquired in multiple ways: such as being bitten by an infected
tick; handling infected animal carcasses; eating or drinking
contaminated food or water; or inhaling the bacteria. The signs and
symptoms people develop depend on how they are exposed to tularemia.
Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph
glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or
pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include abrupt
onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry
cough, and progressive weakness. Tularemia can be fatal if the person
is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.
To minimize risk of infection, Kevin Thomas, health officer, advises
residents "to cook food thoroughly and to drink water from a safe
source, use a DEET-containing insect repellent on the skin, and avoid
handling
animal carcasses. If contact with animal carcasses cannot be avoided,
persons should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly with soap and
water after removing gloves."
Fewer than 200 cases of tularemia are reported annually in the United
States, mainly in western and south central states. The last reported
New Jersey tularemia case occurred in September 2004 in a 31-year-old
Cape May County resident with extensive outdoor exposure history.
NJDHSS is working closely with the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection's (NJDEP) Division of Fish and Wildlife,
which has not identified unusual animal die-off activity in the state
to date.
The American dog tick and the Lone star tick, both found in Cape May
County, are known to carry tularemia. To protect against all
tick-borne disease, residents should follow these guidelines when
outside with known ticks: Wear light-colored, tightly woven clothing
to make it easier to spot ticks; tuck shirts into pants and pants
into socks; wear closed shoes/sneakers rather than open sandals. Use
a tick repellent as directed. Products should contain DEET (for
clothing or skin) or Permethrin (for clothing only). Remind children
to ask an adult to apply the tick repellent and do not apply to hands
or face. Use products with less than 10 percent DEET, and always
follow manufacturers' directions carefully. Do not use repellents on
children under 3 years of age. While outside, stay in the center of
trails, avoid low bushes and leafy brush, periodically check clothing
and skin for ticks and remove. Once inside, check clothing, skin, and
hair for ticks (take special note of a child's navel, underarm, groin
area and behind the ears). If a tick is found, remove it carefully
with tweezers.

[The instructions on use of DEET in the news release above are
somewhat confusing. DEET, a broad-spectrum insect repellant, should
be applied to exposed, unbroken skin of adults and children, avoiding
the eyes and mouth (see
<http://www.deet.com/content/htm/child.html>).
This is done by adults applying DEET to their hands and then
spreading over exposed areas of the face and body of themselves and
children. Do not allow children to apply the product themselves. Do
not apply to open wounds and scratches, and do not apply to the hands
of small children, since they frequently put their hands into their
mouths. Never spray DEET onto anyone's face, as it can cause eye
irritation.
The higher the DEET concentration, the longer the hours of protection
against insect bites, although concentrations exceeding about 30
percent DEET offer little additional advantage. While several lower
concentrations of DEET formulations (20 percent-34 percent) offer 3-6
hours of protection, an extended-release preparation of 35 percent
DEET offers up to 12 hours of protection, (see
<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).
The American Academy of Pediatrics found no difference in safety for
children between products containing 10 percent and 30 percent DEET
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm>)
when used as directed but is said to recommend that repellents used
on children should contain no more than 10 percent DEET
(<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931>).
The insect repellent products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus,
not DEET, should not be used on children less than 3 years of age.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that repellents with
DEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months old.
DEET also can be applied to clothing made of natural fibers and nylon
but may destroy other synthetic fibers and plastic (such as eyeglass
frames and watch crystals). Permethrin insect repellent can be
applied to clothing, tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, mosquito
netting, etc., as directed (see
<http://www.permethrin-repellent.com.permethrin-spray.htm>).
