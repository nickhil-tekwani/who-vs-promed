[3] French naval ship
Date: Sun 19 Apr 2020
Source: Dayton 24/7, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://dayton247now.com/news/nation-world/france-finds-more-than-1000-virus-cases-on-aircraft-carrier


The French navy is investigating how the coronavirus infected more than 1000 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, amid growing pressure on government leaders to explain how it could have happened. The ship, France's biggest carrier and the flagship of its navy, is undergoing a lengthy disinfection process since returning to its home base in Toulon 5 days ago.

One person remains in intensive care and some 20 others hospitalized, navy spokesman Cmdr. Eric Lavault told The Associated Press. 2 of 4 US sailors serving aboard the Charles de Gaulle as part of an exchange program also tested positive, according to a US Navy statement. A British sailor was aboard another vessel, Lavault said, refusing to reveal the sailor's health status.

Lavault insisted that the aircraft carrier's commander sought to increase the physical distance among the crew on the vessel, where there was no testing equipment and for most of its 3 months on operations, no masks. It is "very difficult to apply social distancing measures on a combat vessel," Lavault said. But "security of the crew is the 1st concern. A combat ship, especially an aircraft carrier, is nothing without its crew."

A similar outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt and a dispute about how the at-sea health crisis was handled led to the firing of its captain and the resignation this month [April 2020] of the acting US Navy secretary. The French navy has been spared major controversy so far, but the defense minister and the head of the French military's health service arm were questioned Friday [17 Apr 2020] about the infections at parliamentary hearings. Defense Minister Florence Parly told lawmakers that 1081 of the 2300 people aboard the Charles de Gaulle and its escort vessels have tested positive so far -- nearly half the overall personnel.

While the virus has immobilized the immense and important ship, Parly insisted that otherwise "our forces continue to assure the defense of our country at sea, under the sea, on land, and in the air." An investigation to retrace the paths of the personnel is in progress. Lavault noted that the aircraft carrier made a call in the French port of Brest, on the Atlantic Ocean, had been in the North Sea as part of a "naval diplomacy" mission with NATO partners, and had stopped in Cyprus during an operation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea to join in the fight against the Islamic State group.

Journalists had boarded the vessel at one point. "All hypotheses are on the table," Lavault said. So far, 350 crew members have been grilled about their movements on and off the vessel, according to Lavault. The defense minister defended the decision to allow the ship to stop in Brest in mid-March [2020], even though France had already ordered all schools closed to fight the virus and the government was preparing confinement measures. Hours after the ship left, President Emmanuel Macron announced a nationwide lockdown, among the strictest in Europe.

With nearly 2000 sailors on the aircraft carrier alone, there is a constant flow of people frequenting the infirmary. In the North Sea, temperatures sometimes dropped to -5 degrees Celsius (23 F), he said. The number of infections "rose exponentially" from about [4-5 Apr 2020], and lung scans were taken on suspected cases, Lavault said.

"It's from this date that the commander decided to alert Navy headquarters to propose ending the operation, a decision taken immediately by the (defense) minister," he said. The aircraft carrier was back in its home base at the Mediterranean port of Toulon on [12 Apr 2020]. "We are and will be transparent" about the health situation, the health director Maryline Gygax Genero told the parliamentary commission. Lavault said the carrier was being cleaned top to bottom, 1st with high-pressure water at 60 C (140 F), then with an anti-viral product, a process that could take weeks. He said the goal is to get the carrier back to sea sometime in May [2020].

France has been among the countries hardest hit by the virus, with more than 18 000 deaths confirmed as of Friday [17 Apr 2020] and more than 100 000 reported cases. As France heads into the 2nd month of confinement, the head of the national health agency said Friday [17 Apr 2020] that the country is seeing "a slow but regular decline" in the virus, with the number of hospitalizations and people in intensive care continuing to drop.

[A repeat of the Theodore Roosevelt incident a few days ago (see COVID-19 update (110): global, asymptomatic infections ship and shelter, WHO 20200418.7238904). According to a New York Times report, the majority of the positive individuals were asymptomatic. There's also mention of the stop in Brest from 13-16 Mar 2020, and a major increase in infirmary visits that began around 4-5 Apr 2020, allowing for some individuals getting infected off the ship and then returning to the ship, a perfect incubating vessel and the explosion following the 2nd wave of infection. (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/world/europe/france-navy-ship-coronavirus.html).

There is also an ongoing outbreak on a Taiwanese naval ship having stopped in Palau, where there are supposedly no confirmed cases (see https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004190009). Now that cruise ships are no longer cruising, it spears as though naval ships are taking their place as floating incubators.

Information on the proportion of asymptomatic positive infections that progress to symptomatic will be very helpful in learning more about the epidemiology of this virus. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 37 589 (46.3% of the total newly reported cases) new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 79.9%% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 8.7%, and Canada (4.6%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 43.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 23.0%, Mexico, and Chile both at 7.6%.

The European region newly confirmed 35 300 (43.5% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3737 (57.8%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. Russia accounted for 17.2% of newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK with 15.7%, Turkey with 10.7%, Spain with 10.4%, Italy 9.9%, France 7.2%, and Germany 7.0%. These 7 countries, accounting for 11.7% of the countries in the European region, reported 78.0% of the newly confirmed cases.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1374 new cases representing 34.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 28.2%, Pakistan at 12.8%, and Qatar at 8.6% (the United Arab Emirate did not report any cases in the past 24 hours).

In the African region, there were 25 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, South Africa reported 31.9% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana at 24.5%, Algeria at 14.7%, and Guinea at 4.9%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 39.3% of the newly reported cases, followed by Singapore at 36.3%, the Philippines 14.5%, and Malaysia and Australia each at 3.7%.

In South East Asia, India reported 65.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 16.0% and Bangladesh at 15.1%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 46.8% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh 44.1%, Thailand 4.6%, and Myanmar 1.9%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through [19 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends, but it hasn't really done so this weekend, although the America's region did not appear to drop.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE and Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 4 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
