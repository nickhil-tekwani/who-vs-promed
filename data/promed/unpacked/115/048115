Deadly disease breaks out at Nottinghamshire breeding farm
------------------------------------------------
Thousands of fish have now been culled at Calverton Fish Farm, after the
discovery of a virus that has been encountered only once before in England.
The centre is one of only 2 Environment Agency-run fish farms in the UK,
and restocks fish levels in polluted rivers across England and Wales. But
now the outbreak of the virus could damage national plans to improve the
river population for the next 2 years.
Operations at Calverton Fish Farm have been shut down since the discovery
of the tench rhabdovirus in some of the stock. The virus can cause skin
ulcers, hemorrhaging, and, eventually, death for the affected fish. Since
the disease was discovered, about 11 000 fish believed to have come into
contact with the virus have been killed. Large areas of the farm have also
been disinfected to try to save the remaining population.
The farm covers an area of 4 hectares and has 35 breeding ponds. These
range in size from 100 to 5000 square metres.
Although the deadly virus is linked to tench, it can also affect chub,
dace, bream, and rudd, which are all bred at Calverton. An Environment
Agency spokesman said: "There is no indication where the disease might have
come from. Our priority is to deal with it." The re-stocking of rivers
project run at the farm, which is funded by anglers' fishing licenses,
could be affected for 2 years. Research and development projects may also
be affected. "We haven't really yet been able to evaluate how it might be
affected," said the agency spokesman.
Jeff Dolby, Environment Agency area environment manager, said: "The
thousands of fish produced each year at Calverton make a significant
contribution to our work to regenerate many rivers recovering from historic
pollution. However, it is essential that we take whatever steps are
necessary, and demonstrate best practice, to eradicate the virus from the
site." More than 360 000 coarse fish bred at Calverton were released into
rivers across the country between April 2003 and March [presumably 2004. -
Mod.SH]. The coarse fish breeding program was begun in 1986, and has
contributed to an increase in fish catches in England and Wales.

[According to the Environment Agency, this is not a regulatory reportable
disease. The depopulation of fish, and the disinfection process at the
hatcheries, are quite extensive, time consuming, and expensive. It seems
that money generated from the sale of anglers' licenses is the source of
funding for controlling this virus. Anglers may have something to say if
the cost of the license increases too much. - Mod.TG]
