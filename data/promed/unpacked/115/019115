More than 2000 in Embu [county] people were yesterday [30 May 2014] given anti-anthrax medicine after they consumed meat of a hippopotamus suspected to have died of the disease. Embu county health director Dr Philip Masaulo said they are giving mass dosage of anti-anthrax medicine, after one person died while 40 others are recuperating at the Embu Level Five General hospital after eating the meat.

Masaulo said at first they targeted 500 people from Kalulu village, near Sagana River where the hippo died, but they went out of drugs after more people came for the same from Kirinyaga, Murang'a, and Machakos. Speaking at Makutano, Mbeere South sub-county, Masaulo said they managed to treat around 1000 people, but promised to go back to the area next week to ensure the remaining people also receive the dose.

"We are not taking any chances regarding the lives of all those people who took the meat, we have already lost one person while those with serious symptoms have been admitted," he said, adding that analysis on the blood samples to find out more about what killed the animal are being carried out. Masaulo played down the matter, saying once the dosage is given, the disease will be contained. Benta Wambui, a resident urged Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Embu, and Machakos to unite and ensure anyone who consumed the meat is treated, adding that the meat was shared in Kagio, Kerugoya, and other major towns in Murang'a.

She blamed the Kenya Wildlife Service [KWS] officers, for failing to advise the residents over the death of the animal and whether it was fit for human consumption. "We made a mistake to eat the meat without proper inspections, but KWS should have advised us accordingly, there is no way people could not have eaten the meat with the current hunger in the region," she said. Residents have urged the authorities to administer the dose particularly on the school going children to curb any calamity.

[To hand out treatment for more than 2000 implies that it had to be oral antibiotics, not vaccination as stated in the previous posting. And it reflects a significant stockpile on hand in the region.

I have not been able to locate all the towns but the listed counties are all on the western and southern borders of Embu; see http://www.guide2kenya.com/uploads/content/Kenya-County-Map.jpg.
Towns:
Murang'a: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/01/Muranga.html; Machakos: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/03/Machakos.html;
Kagio: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/01/Kagio.html;
Kerugoya: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/01/Keruguya.html.

This is patently a very large area for people eating meat salvaged from a single hippopotamus so one can suspect that there is a met demand for hippo meat in that area. Thus, any hippo stumbling and falling for whatever cause is at risk of being butchered. We look forward to hearing the results of the blood analysis. - Mod.MHJ]
