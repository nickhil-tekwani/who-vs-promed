[It is now 11 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 10 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 8 in Heilongjiang and 2 in Guangdong. It has now been 21 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 10 days or so... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 46 newly confirmed cases of which 36 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 82 295 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3342 deaths, representing an increase of 46 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (13 Apr 2020) report, and 1 newly reported death in Hubei province. An additional 11 suspected cases were newly reported, 10 in imported cases, 5 in Heilongjiang, 4 in Shanghai and 1 in Liaoning, and 1 locally acquired suspected case in Liaoning. 3 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but decreasing in numbers. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 36 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1500. There are an additional 72 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 57 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 3 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1023. 228 of these are importations from abroad. I believe they mention there were 7 asymptomatic cases who developed symptoms in the past 24 hours, 5 of whom were imported cases.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020 China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

How to approach voting on election day [15 Apr 2020]
----------------------------------------------------
KCDC asked voters to carefully follow the infection prevention guidelines when casting their votes for the general election tomorrow (15 Apr 2020).
- Voters should wash their hands thoroughly before and after going to polling places, wear a facemask at polling stations, and keep a distance of at least 1 meter from other voters.
- At the entrance to the polling station, voters will undergo temperature checks, disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer, and put on disposable gloves. Voters should comply with the instructions of poll workers.
- Marking one's hand or finger inside the polling booth with the stamp used to fill out the ballot (something many Korean voters have been doing in recent elections to casually display their pride in exercising their right to vote) is not recommended for this election due to infection prevention reasons.
- For the upcoming holiday (Election Day) tomorrow, KCDC asked people to continue to participate in the Enhanced Social Distancing and refrain from non-essential gatherings, dining out, or travel.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 27 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (13-14 Apr 2020) when there were 27 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 591 confirmed cases, including 225 deaths were reported today, up from 10 564 cases and 222 deaths yesterday (13 Apr 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 15 consecutive days and below 50 for 8 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 64.4% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.7% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Gyeonggi and Gyeongbuk each reported 6 (22.2%) newly confirmed cases, all 12 locally acquired; Seoul reported 5 newly confirmed cases, 3 imported, 2 locally acquired; Daegu reported only 1 newly confirmed case, imported. Quarantined imported cases represented 14.8% of the newly confirmed cases, with 4 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. Of interest is that 11 (40.7%) of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases and 16 (59.3%) were locally acquired. 9 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

From the English language update for 14 Apr 2020, imported cases have constituted 52.3% of newly confirmed cases during the last 2 weeks with a total number of imported cases now at 940.

Interesting information are the instructions on how to cast votes at the polls on election day. Many countries are having elections this year (2020) and the need for social distancing over a prolonged period is creating challenges for the election process. The efficacy of these measures will be seen if there isn't an uptick in newly confirmed cases over the 2 plus weeks following election day in Korea.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of now 3000s and today [14 Apr 2020] it is 3045 down from 3477 on 13 Apr 2020.

As of today [13 Apr 2020], totals of 172 541 cases and 18 056 deaths have been reported, up from 169 496 cases and 17 489 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 166.13, slowly decreasing over the past 7 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 166.13 today [14 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 172 541 cases, approximately 75 752 (43.9%) have been hospitalized and 7851 (4.6%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data Table 3 at the source URL shows the weekly evolution of daily increases in newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths from mid-March (2020) to this current week. Case confirmations have gone from daily increases of 20% to 2%, hospitalizations from 34% to 2%, ICU admissions from 40% to 2% and deaths from 38% to 3%. Clearly demonstrating decreasing cases, and impact on health services.

[7] Thailand: possible transmission to forensic physician

A medical examiner has died from coronavirus after catching it from a dead body in what is believed to be the 1st case of its kind. The forensic practitioner worked in the Thai capital of Bangkok, according to a letter published in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. Further details, including their name and age, were not provided. Won Sriwijitalai of Bangkok's RVT Medical Center and Viroj Wiwanitkit of India's DY Patil University, co-wrote the letter. "According to our best knowledge, this is the 1st report on COVID-19 infection and death among medical personnel in a forensic medicine unit," they wrote.

The letter was written on [20 Mar 2020], when there were 272 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand, including 2 medical personnel: the forensic medicine professional and a nursing assistant.

According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of confirmed cases in Thailand has since hit 2613. Worldwide, more than 1.9 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 120 000 have died and over 457 500 have recovered. As shown in the map by Statista below [available at the source URL], the coronavirus has reached almost every country in the world.

Sriwijitalai and Wiwanitkit said that when the forensic examiner caught the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, most cases in Thailand were imported and the bug was not spreading widely in the community. In addition, "there is low chance of forensic medicine professionals coming into contact with infected patients, but they can have contact with biological samples and corpses," they said. "At present, there is no data on the exact number of COVID-19 contaminated corpses since it is not a routine practice to examine for COVID-19 in dead bodies in Thailand. Nevertheless, infection control and universal precautions are necessary."

They advised forensic professionals to wear protective clothing, including a suit, gloves, goggles, cap and masks when working, and pathology and forensic units must follow disinfection procedures on corpses used in operating rooms. Angelique Corthals, professor of pathology at the City University of New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was not involved in the case, told BuzzFeed News: "Not just the medical examiners, but morgue technicians and the people in funeral homes need to take extra care."

Summer Johnson McGee, a health policy expert at the University of New Haven [Connecticut, USA] , also told BuzzFeed News that anyone coming into contact with a body that had tested positive for coronavirus, "dead or alive," should wear personal protective equipment to avoid spreading the virus. "Autopsies and subsequent investigations present real risks for coroners to acquire COVID-19," she said.

In interim guidance on how to safely manage the corpses of COVID-19 victims published in late March 2020, the World Health Organization said dead bodies are generally not infectious, except in cases of hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola and Marburg, or if the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza are not handled properly. "To date there is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to the bodies of persons who died from COVID-19," the WHO said. "These recommendations are subject to revision as new evidence becomes available," the UN agency said.

Wiwanitkit told Newsweek it remains unclear if the patient caught the virus from their work, as noted in the article. However, he said the case could be useful for those planning safety protocols for the management of dead bodies. Wiwanitkit said the potential spread of the coronavirus from corpses is "an important forgotten issue in [the] present crisis of COVID-19."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"COVID-19 is a new and emerging disease and its origin is in the Republic of China. 1/ In 2020, the disease spread rapidly worldwide resulting in it being classified as a pandemic. 2/ This new disease is a new challenge for the medical community since during the COVID-19 outbreak, medical personnel might get infected. Within Forensic Medicine Units, there has been no reported case of personnel suffering from the disease.

"Here, the authors would like to share their observations from Thailand, the 2nd county affected in the timelines of COVID-19 outbreak. At present ([20 Mar 2020]), the accumulated number of COVID-19 in Thailand is 272. Of this, one of the cases is a forensic practitioner working in Bangkok, capital of Thailand. Indeed, there are only 2 COVID-19 patients who are medical personnel (the forensic medicine professional and a nurse assistant 3/). Although patients may get the infection from workplace exposure or through spreading in the community, at the period of the occurrence of this case, the patients in Thailand are mostly imported cases and recording of local spreading in the community is limited. There is low chance of forensic medicine professionals coming into contact with infected patients, but they can have contact with biological samples and corpses. At present, there is no data on the exact number of COVID-19 contaminated corpses since it is not a routine practice to examine for COVID-19 in dead bodies in Thailand. Nevertheless, infection control and universal precautions are necessary. Forensic professionals have to wear protective devices including a protective suit, gloves, goggles, cap and mask. The disinfection procedure used in operation rooms might be applied in pathology/forensic units too. According to our best knowledge, this is the 1st report on COVID-19 infection and death among medical personnel in a Forensic Medicine unit."
