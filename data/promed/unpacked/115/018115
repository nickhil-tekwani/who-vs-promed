Mystery disease is bronchopneumonia: experts
---------------------------
The mystery fever that has claimed 32 children's lives in Murshidabad
district of West Bengal in the last week was on Friday diagnosed by a
team of medical experts as bronchopneumonia.
District acting CMOH Dr Pinaki Ghosh said that the team of experts
visiting the remote villages in Lalgola block, which has been
affected by the disease, had reported that the disease had been
identified on symptomatic observations.
"The team of epidemiologists, which has been collecting blood and
saliva samples at the villages, has identified the disease as
bronchopneumonia characterised by high fever, cough, and cold," Ghosh
said.
On why the disease had struck only children, he said that children
were generally more susceptible to any disease than adults. High
temperatures in the district could have aggravated matters, he said.
The epidemiologist team and another expert team from the National
Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) were still
verifying the reason and magnitude of the disease in the gram
panchayat areas of Kadamtala, Kochidanga, Ramchandrapur, Nasibpur,
Kurgachi and Notundiar under Lalgola block.
Ghosh said that the teams would submit their final report on Saturday.

State wakes up after one more death
------------------------
One more baby died of the mystery disease at Lalgola on Saturday,
taking the official death toll to 21, even as another 200 children
were in serious condition despite the efforts of a team of doctors
working around the clock.
State health secretary Asim Barman said director of state health
services Prabhakar Chatterjee had rushed to Lalgola earlier in the
day to make an on-the-spot review of the situation. He has been asked
to submit a report to the government within a day or 2. Barman,
however, claimed that no new deaths had taken place.
The health secretary said 2 more medical teams, one each from the
School of Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Cholera and
Enteric Diseases, had gone to the spot to support the ongoing
treatment of the babies fighting for life.
The fresh death was reported from the Natun Diya village. The
situation at Kadamtala, Natun Diyar, Kuchidanga, Raghunathpur and
Janardanpur is still serious.
"We have already checked about 3000 children. The cause of this
outbreak is still a mystery. We are trying our best to contain the
outbreak," said one of the doctors.
The villagers meanwhile face a Catch-22 situation, as all the doctors
were at the villages, with hardly anyone left at the hospitals to
take care of patients. The 4-member medical team from Krishnapur
rural hospital had to shuttle between 5 villages spread over 25 km.

[This latest series of newswire articles suggests that the etiology
of this outbreak is still unknown, with a variety of speculations
being ventured. In earlier postings there was a suggestion of
heat-related deaths, with the region undergoing a serious heat wave
over the past 2 weeks. A toxin has been proposed as a possible
etiology for the symptom complex described in the first posting. In
the above newswires there is mention of bronchopneumonia as a
diagnosis, and from the Bangladeshi newswire (the involved district
is a border district with Bangladesh) the possibility of encephalitis
or meningitis has been raised. The newswires mention involvement of
children less than 5 years of age; one of the postings submitted by
an infectious disease consultant in West Bengal did mention there
were 5 adult deaths, but further details were not given. More
details on the clinical presentation as well as the epidemiology of
this outbreak would be appreciated, in addition to results of
laboratory studies if available. - Mod.MPP]
