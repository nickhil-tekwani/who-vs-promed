Typhoid fever in Democratic Republic of the Congo
---------------------------------------------------
WHO has received reports of a significant ongoing outbreak of typhoid fever
in Kinshasa. The cases have occurred in the suburbs of Kimbanseke, Kikimi,
Masina and Ndjili, which had already been affected by an important outbreak
of _E. coli_ in May 2004.
As of 13 Dec 2004, a total of 13 400 cases were reported. Between 1 Oct and
10 Dec 2004, 615 severe cases with peritonitis, with or without
perforation, including 134 deaths (case fatality rate, 21.8 percent) have
occurred. 5 out of 32 samples tested positive for the typhoid bacillus.
Very poor sanitary conditions and a lack of drinking water have been
reported in these areas. A crisis committee has been established to contain
the outbreak, and this committee is carrying out health education
activities and distributing medicine.
