Here is food for thought for the state's powers-that-be. Due to lack of access to cheap protein, poor, backward and tribal districts in the state are turning to wild mushrooms and dead cattle/goat meat, which is leading to a rise in food poisoning and anthrax cases in Odisha.

Though the Odisha Government has launched with much fanfare the Odisha Food Security Act with an objective to ensure food security of 34 lakh [3 400 000] more families, a reality check reveals how many villages in the backward and tribal districts of the state for want of nutrition bank on wild mushrooms and dead cattle, which have even resulted in outbreaks of anthrax. According to the data available with the Integrated Disease Surveillance Centre, the state had reported until the end of July [2019], around 50 food poisoning cases and around half a dozen anthrax cases.

Though outbreaks have come from across the state, most have been reported from tribal and backward districts like Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Kalahandi and Sundergarh. The district disease surveillance centres declare a disease as an outbreak when it affects either an area (village/wards), or a community (SC/ST), or both.

An analysis of the reports at the nodal surveillance centre suggest how villages in districts like Koraput, Rayagada and Nabarangpur have witnessed outbreaks of food poisoning because of consumption of wild mushrooms collected from nearby jungles. Reports show how villages in the districts of Koraput and Sundergarh reported anthrax outbreaks in June-July this year [2019] linked to consumption of meat of dead cattle and goats. Even Subarnapur, grouped among 250 backward districts nationally in 2006, has reported food poisoning outbreak caused by consumption of castor fruits by children.

The disease outbreaks in such tribal and backward districts give some subtle hints to the policy planners of the state.

As almost all the districts are high in poverty, they can't afford the dals or meat when they need proteins in their diet, and they rely on wild mushrooms and dead cattle or goats to meet their needs. Lack of awareness regarding food hygiene and safety in the villages of such districts makes them vulnerable to bouts of food poisoning.

These districts, especially Kashipur in Rayagada, showed high rates of mango-kernel poisoning deaths in early 2000s. The tribes had depended on mango kernel for lack of staple food, which in turn led to food poisoning deaths. As mango seed kernels contain significant amount of tannins, it has a deleterious effect when consumed in large quantities.

The bouts of food poisoning in tribal and backward districts reveal very little change in nutritional security there. The neighbouring Chhattisgarh government supplies dal via the Public Distribution System to BPL [Below Poverty Line] card holders.

[For a description of Odisha and where it is in India, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha.

Worldwide, human anthrax is a function of rural poverty and malnutrition. And it would not be surprising to find it associated also with the consumption of toxic mushrooms, even toxic fish, fruit, and roots.

When the medical teams are investigating rural human cases of anthrax, they should remember that the source is a dead animal, usually a cow. So to control this problem, they must include their veterinary colleagues, and the sooner the better. - Mod.MHJ]

[There is no indication of the type of mushrooms collected. A number of mushrooms are toxic and capable of causing death or serious illness.

Tannins were mentioned in relation to the mango seed kernel, which are high in proteins. Tannins are responsible for the astringent taste we experience when we partake of wine or unripe fruits. Tannins are naturally occurring plant polyphenols. Their main characteristic is that they bind and precipitate proteins. They can have a large influence on the nutritive value of many foods eaten by humans and feedstuff eaten by animals. Tannins are common in fruits (grapes, persimmon, blueberry, etc), in tea, in chocolate, in legume trees (_Acacia_ spp., _Sesbania_ spp., etc), and in grasses (sorghum, corn, etc). High levels of tannins in a monogastric, such as a child or young goat or calf may cause depressed growth rates, low protein utilization, damage to the mucosal lining of the digestive tract, alteration in the excretion of certain cations, and increased excretion of proteins and essential amino acids.

So, in addition to consideration of unhealthy aspects of consuming an animal that may have died of anthrax or other disease or toxicity, these people are under food shortage stress and lack knowledge as to what they can safely eat, including native plants in their area. Likely there are other toxic plants aside from mushrooms and plants containing tannins. One also wonders about the quality and availability of safe drinking water in the area. - Mod.TG
