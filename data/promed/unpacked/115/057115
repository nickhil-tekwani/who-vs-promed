Patient at SGH tests positive for Sars virus
-----------------------
A patient at the Singapore General Hospital tested positive for the SARS
virus on Monday, triggering concern that the respiratory disease may have
resurfaced here.
Hospital staff asked visitors to leave wards 74 and 78 in the late afternoon.
The Straits Times learnt that more tests were done on the Singaporean man
to confirm if the preliminary test result was correct, or if it was a false
positive.
He worked in a virology laboratory at Kent Ridge, but apparently was not
working with the SARS virus.
A Health Ministry spokesman said that Acting Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan
will hold a press conference on Tuesday once the results are known.
She said that the man was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Monday.
The SGH has started tracing everyone who may have been in contact with him,
including those who were at the accident and emergency department when he
went there last week with a fever.
It is believed that the man, who has not been to China or Hong Kong
recently, was at the A&E [emergency] department for 2 hours.

Singapore man tests positive for SARS
----------------------------
A man in Singapore has tested positive for SARS, health officials said
Monday. It was the first reported new case of the disease in more than 5
months and came after health officials had warned the flu-like illness
could return.
The man, an ethnic Chinese Singapore citizen, tested positive for severe
acute respiratory syndrome when he tried to enter Singapore General
Hospital, Ministry of Health spokeswoman Bey Mui Leng said. Bey said
testing would be repeated to make sure the man had SARS.
The man was tested using a method approved by the World Health
Organization. Singapore has been on alert against a possible second
outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 800 people and sickened 7,900
after it was first recognized in China in November and then spread to more
than 30 other countries.
WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said he could not immediately comment. "We've
been getting information from Singapore," he said. "But we're going to need
a bit more."
The illness killed 33 people and sickened 328 in Singapore earlier this year.
Officials are trying to track down anyone who might have come into contact
with the man and will issue them quarantine orders, Bey said.
Earlier Monday, the director general of the World Health Organization
cautioned that SARS could return and warned against complacency.
"We have to prepare on the assumption that this will come back," Lee
Jong-wook told the 54th annual conference in Manila of the WHO's regional
committee for the Western Pacific region. "Our challenge now is to enhance
surveillance networks that will detect and deal with SARS if it does come
back."
In an interview with Channel NewsAsia which aired Friday, Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said the city-state's health care system is
"well-prepared" for a SARS resurgence.
"The second time around, if it comes around, we should know what to do to
protect ourselves," Lee said.
The World Health Organization estimates that about 15 percent of people who
contract SARS die, suggesting the illness is more deadly than influenza or
other common respiratory infections. For people over 65, the death rate is
about 50 percent, WHO estimates.

[The above newswire (and others currently available on the web) do not give
specifics on the clinical presentation of this current suspected cases of
SARS, nor does it mention the specific tests used to make the diagnosis of
SARS other than to mention WHO approved tests were used. At present there
is no official information available on either the Singapore Ministry of
Health or the WHO SARS website to clarify if the case matches the
pre-established case definition for SARS. Given the extensive experience
of the Singaporean health sector with SARS during the outbreak earlier this
year, the above taken measures described in these newswires seem highly
appropriate pending further information on this case. Until more
information is received, this report/posting is most appropriately titled
"suspected" with a request for more information from authoritative sources.
