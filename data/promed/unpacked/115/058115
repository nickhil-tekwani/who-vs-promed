The Health Ministry has admitted there was an outbreak after a 9-year-old girl from a village in the Nakaseke district tested positive for CCHF [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]. Now the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ugandan Ministry of Health have confirmed 9 cases of 2 strains of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). Of the cases confirmed, the Health Ministry said 4 have died from the disease, which can cause victims to bleed from their orifices -- including eyes, mouth, and anus.

Doctors from Nakaseke Hospital claim the death toll has risen to 11. In a press conference last week [week of 22 Jan 2018], Dr Diana Atwine, the Ministry's Permanent Secretary, reported additional cases of the serious viral infections. Speaking to the media alongside WHO officials, she said: "Since August 2017, when suspected cases were reported, 4 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been confirmed and 5 cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF). "Unfortunately, we have lost 3 cases of the RVF from Kiboga, Buikwe, and Mityana districts. "The latest cases were reported on [19 Jan 2018].

In total, 23 people have been struck down by the lethal disease [CCHF], 9 of whom received treatment at the hospital, Dr Okella said. One patient is currently being treated at the hospital, he said.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Daily Star Online officials are working with the Ugandan Ministry of Health to monitor the outbreak and provide technical assistance. He said 100 full sets of personal protective equipment have been sent to Ugandan authorities to support health facilities dealing with the outbreak.

Both Crimean-Congo fever and the Rift Valley fever are viral diseases that are found in livestock but can be transmitted to humans. The CCHF virus, first detected in the 1940s, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The onset of CCHF is sudden, with symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. In up to 75 percent of cases, signs of bleeding can appear within 3 to 5 days of the onset of illness.

Doctors from the Uganda Medical Association (UMA) accused the Ministry of Health of failing to handle the CCHF in Nakaseke district and putting the lives of health workers at risk. In an interview with Daily Star Online, Dr Mukuzi Muhereza, from the UMA, warned the disease will spread further unless action is taken quickly.

[According to the report above, the total number of fatal cases is 11, with 23 total cases, during the current outbreak. The key to limiting the transmission of the disease is early identification of the infected cases, and increasing awareness among the healthcare providers for protection against transmission.- Mod.UBA
