Trypanosomiasis in India?
-------------------------
Trypanosomiasis seems to have taken its 1st victim in India. A farmer in
Vidarbha is currently in a government hospital with this disease. The case
has attracted the interest of medical experts countrywide, and a World
Health Organization team is also expected to arrive. Being a first, the
specific drug used for treatment -- Melarsoprall -- is not available in
India. The dean of the hospital where the patient is being treated said
that sleeping sickness and the tse tse fly are not found in India. Indian
cattle and reptiles, however, have been known to suffer from the disease.

[The report mentions no symptoms or diagnostic procedures. African
trypanosomiasis is an encephalitis transmitted by tse tse flies alone and
is not found outside tropical Africa. South American trypanosomiasis --
Chagas disease -- is transmitted by triatomid bugs, which are not found
outside South America. Chagas disease has an acute and a chronic phase, and
the infection can be transmitted from chronic carriers by blood
transfusion. Diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis is by direct microscopy
of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, antibody analysis, and detection of
specific DNA. Diagnosis of Chagas disease relies mainly on detection with
specific analysis. Unless and until ProMED-mail receives further details on
the case, and the diagnostic results suggest trypanosomiasis, this
information should be regarded with scepticism and the diagnosis as highly
unlikely. - Mod.EP]
