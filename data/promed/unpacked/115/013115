FMD situation as of 21 May 2010
-------------------------------
As of 21 May 2010, the number of outbreaks has risen to 171 holdings
(cases/outbreaks), involving a total of 133 011 animals, of which 17
370 are cattle, 115 636 pigs and 5 goats. The disease has spread to 2
new municipalities, namely Saito [where the pedigree Miyazaki
breeding bull is among the infected animals; see item 2 further] and Kijo.

Currently, there are 5 municipalities with active cases: Kawaminami
town, Takanabe town, Shintomi town, Saito city and Kijo (or Kijou or
Kijoh, official name is Kijo) town, all in the Central Area of the
Miyazaki prefecture. [Central area; yellow in the map at

Stud bull confirmed infected with foot-and-mouth disease in Miyazaki
--------------------------------------------------------------------
One of 6 stud bulls that have been separated from other cattle after
the spread of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Miyazaki Prefecture has
been confirmed infected with the disease, sources close to the issue
said Friday [21 May 2010].

The development is expected to deal a devastating blow to the
livestock industry in the western Japan prefecture because the bulls
are used to breed the prefecture's prized Miyazaki beef. The
prefectural government plans to slaughter the bull which tested
positive for the virus under gene examination.

Miyazaki government officials said they will decide within Saturday
whether to kill the remaining 5 pedigree breeding bulls.

Local Farmers Agree To Foot-and-Mouth Vaccination
-------------------------------------------------
Municipalities in Miyazaki Prefecture hit by the outbreak of FMD have
agreed to get their cattle and pigs vaccinated from Saturday,
Miyazaki Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru said on Friday [21 May 2010].

"We have obtained consent from local communities," he said.

The central government had decided earlier to vaccinate some 200 000
pigs and heads of cattle within a 10km radius of the affected area.
But some farmers objected to the compensation offered by the
government. The animals will all have to be destroyed, resulting in a
heavy burden on farmers, but the vaccinations are expected to help
contain the outbreak.

The prefecture has already received vaccines for 200 000 animals.

The central government will cover costs for feed and other expenses
until the animals are destroyed. Farmers will also receive
compensation based on the market price of the livestock.

In the Diet [Japan's National Assembly], the opposition Liberal
Democratic Party and the New Komeito party are preparing to submit a
no-confidence vote against Farm Minister Hirotaka Akamatsu for the
government's slow response to the outbreak. They will make a final
decision after hearing Akamatsu's explanation.

[The progress of the Japanese epizootic is reminiscent of the 1st
stages of the 2001 FMD outbreak in the UK, including the political
and economical ramifications. However, in difference with the UK
situation, the disease is, so far, limited to one prefecture.
Hopefully, vaccination combined with strictly applied biosecurity
measures will prevent further spread.

From the published data, it is not clear if the authorities
consider, on top of their "vaccination to slaughter" policy (which
deserves discussion...), also preventive vaccination of selected
animals to be kept alive, such as vaccination of valuable breeding
stock, pedigree bulls and endangered species. It is worthwhile to
stress that FMD-vaccinated animals, and their products, are
absolutely fit for human consumption.

Japan's most recent follow-up report (No 5) was submitted to the OIE
on 19 May 2010; it includes the details of 55 (then) new outbreaks,
adding up to a total of 131 outbreaks since the start of the
outbreak, end March. The following data, pertaining to these 55
outbreaks, were included:
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Swine/ 36 083/ 31/ 0/ 36 083/ 0
Cattle/ 2682/ 76/ 0/ 2682/ 0
Goats/ 4/ 0/ 0/ 4/ 0

The temporary epizootic's summary of the OIE, including an
interactive map showing the 131 outbreaks reported as of 19 May 2010,
is available at

(zoom in). In the meantime, 40 additional outbreaks have occurred in
