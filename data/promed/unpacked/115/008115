Spike seen in county whooping cough cases
--------------------------------------------
Reported cases of whooping cough are on the rise in Pierce County,
quadrupling to an average of 12.3 a month in the past 8 months. The
spike, health officials say, puts the county and the state on track
to surpass last year's reported cases of whooping cough, also known
as pertussis. Pierce County had 68 reported cases as of the end of
May, the last month for which the health department has complete
data. Last year, the county had 84 cases and the state 575.
"We don't know where people are getting it, which tells me that it's in the
community, not in a particular setting" such as a school or hospital, said
Monica Raymond, an epidemiologist with the Tacoma/Pierce County Health
Department.
Other counties are reporting increases from recent years. That's
prompting renewed efforts to shed light on the disease and vaccinate
children who are particularly susceptible.
In Pierce County, an average of 2.9 people each month were diagnosed
with the infectious disease from Nov 1998 through Sep 2002. From Oct
2002 to May 2003, the monthly average rose to 12.3, according to the
health department. King County has recorded 113 cases of whooping
cough, compared with 155 in 2002 and 39 in 2001.
This year, as many as 600 cases of whooping cough may be reported statewide.
That would exceed last year's 575 cases and far outstrip the 184 reported in
2001. The worst recent year was in 1996, when 830 cases were reported. The
lowest recent year was in 1993, with fewer than 100 cases.
Part of the problem, heath officials say, is that parents are not
having their children vaccinated for the disease. Health officials
recommend children get four shots before age 2 to build up
immunization to whooping cough. Most children get the first 3, but
the number drops to about 80 percent for the fourth shot, said Cindy
Gleason, a health educator with the state Department of Health
immunization program.
"The real danger with pertussis is that it tends to be very severe in
small kids, particularly those under 6 months of age," said Marcia
Patrick, a registered nurse for MultiCare Health Systems, which
includes Mary Bridge, Tacoma General and Allenmore hospitals.
Though children are most susceptible to whooping cough, health
officials note adults can be afflicted as well. Last year, several
staff members at Mary Bridge's Children's Hospital and Health Center
and its sister facility, Tacoma General Hospital, caught pertussis.
The hospitals treated nearly 1,000 workers with antibiotics to make
sure the disease didn't spread to patients.

Officials warn of pertussis outbreak
------------------------------------
Albany County reports 19 cases of the contagious illness that is also
known as whooping cough. County health officials issued an alert
about a pertussis outbreak Wed, Jun 18 after 19 cases of the
contagious illness have been reported this year, many in recent weeks.

[Even in developed countries such as the USA, pertussis clusters continue to
occur. The demographics of the cases are not given in the posting to assess
whether the reasons behind the clusters were nonvaccination of children,
incomplete vaccination of children, primary vaccine failure, waning immunity in
adolescence and adults, improved reporting of cases, or, most likely,
a combination of factors. The change in DTP (which contained killed,
whole cell pertussis organisms and was quite reactogenic) to DTaP
(which contains several toxoids of _B. pertussis_) has decreased the
reactogenicity but does not appear to greatly increase
immunogenicity. The addition of aP to the Td booster (which should
be given to adults every decade) can assist in diminishing cases.
Unlike the whole cell product, acellular pertussis vaccine is well
tolerated in adults. - Mod. LL]
