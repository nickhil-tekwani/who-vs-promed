A total of 10 human H7N9 bird flu cases were newly reported in China on Friday [24 Jan 2014], including 1 in Beijing, 1 in Guangdong Province, 1 in Fujian Province and 7 in Zhejiang Province, forcing cities in Zhejiang to close their live poultry markets. In the 1st case reported in the city this year [2014], a man in Beijing was confirmed to have contracted H7N9 on Thursday night [23 Jan 2014], according to the Chinese capital's disease control and prevention center. He is receiving treatment at Ditan Hospital. The center said the patient had bought pigeons and ate them before being admitted to the hospital.

The health and family planning committee of south China's Guangdong Province likewise reported on Friday [24 Jan 2014] that a 34-year-old woman in Shenzhen City had contracted the virus. She is also in a critical condition.

The health authorities in Guangdong's neighboring province of Fujian also announced that a 46-year-old female villager in Hui'an county was Friday confirmed to have been sicken by the H7N9 virus, bringing the total infections in the province to 8. The patient is under treatment at a local hospital and is in a critical condition.

In east China's Zhejiang Province, 7 human H7N9 cases were reported on Friday [24 Jan 2014], bringing the total number of such cases to 44 in the province. All the newly reported cases, aged from 23 to 82, are in critical conditions, according to the provincial health authorities. To limit spreading of the virus, the Zhejiang provincial capital of Hangzhou called a halt to live poultry trading in urban areas on Friday.

Events such as circuses involving live animals were also suspended, according to a circular released late on Thursday [23 Jan 2014]. Li Lanjuan, a leading researcher on bird flu at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the move to close poultry markets was necessary to help human beings avoid contact with infected live poultry. Many live poultry markets in cities of Jinhua, Ningbo and Shaoxing were also closed.

In another development, scientists with the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said Friday [24 Jan 2014], based on their research results, that the possibility of human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus is extremely slim. "H7N9 virus infects humans through [the] respiratory tract, so eating cooked poultry will not be [infective]," said Liu Yao, one of the scientists. Scientists said transportation of poultry plays an important role in helping the virus spread. They called for controlling the channel from poultry to human, and sterilizing live poultry markets.

[Efforts are continuing across the country to interrupt the spread of human cases of avian influenza H7N9 virus infection by controlling the opening of poultry markets. Events such as circuses involving live animals are also now being suspended to reduce contact between the human population and live animals. The continued release of information locally, rather than initially nationally, continues to impede recording of the progress of the epidemic. - Mod.CP
