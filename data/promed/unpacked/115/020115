This is not the 1st time that there has been local transmission of chikungunya virus in Italy. There was a locally transmitted chikungunya outbreak in 2007 in Emilia Romagna, central Italy. That outbreak was initiated by a viremic individual traveling from India (see Chikungunya - Italy (Emilia Romagna) (04) 20070907.2957)

France (Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur). 25 Aug 2017. WHO; as of 23 Aug 2017, (susp.) 8 cases, (probable) 1 case, (conf.) 4 cases.

[2] Brazil: genomic analysis

Ref: da Costa AC, Theze J, Komninakis SCV, et al. Spread of chikungunya virus East/Central/South African genotype in Northeast Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017 [date cited]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2310.170307
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We investigated an outbreak of exanthematous illness in Maceio by using molecular surveillance; 76 percent of samples tested positive for chikungunya virus. Genetic analysis of 23 newly generated genomes identified the East/Central/South African [ECSA] genotype, suggesting that this lineage has persisted since mid-2014 in Brazil and may spread in the Americas and beyond.

[Approach]
----------
Analyzed samples were from patients who were on average 37 years of age (range 1-86 years); 175 (64 percent) were female, and 198 (73 percent) resided in Maceio municipality. Diagnostic tests for DENV [dengue virus], ZIKV [Zika virus], and CHIKV [chikungunya virus] confirmed that 208 (76 percent) were positive for CHIKV RNA. In addition, 36 (13.2 percent) were co-infected with CHIKV and ZIKV, consistent with Zika virus circulation in Northeast Brazil in mid-2016. We detected no DENV infections. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for CHIKV RNA-positive samples were lower (average Ct = 24.6) than those for ZIKV (average Ct = 33.5).

We applied a metagenomics next-generation sequencing protocol to 38 randomly chosen CHIKV RNA-positive samples. We recovered 23 CHIKV genomes (greater than 4000 bp) by using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA); mean genome coverage was 72x and mean depth coverage 207x. We also included 2 CHIKV RNA-positive samples from Joao Pessoa, Para√≠ba state. We did not detect the E1-A226V adaptive mutation associated with large outbreaks in Asia in the strains we analyzed. We then appended sequences to publicly available data (659 CHIKV isolates) and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to identify the origins of the outbreak.

[Results and conclusion]
------------------------
On the basis of available sequences of isolates from the Americas, the Maceio sequences we analyzed fell within a single strongly supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap support = 99 percent, posterior support = 1.00) that belongs to the ECSA. Genetic analysis suggests the outbreak most likely originated from transmission cycles not previously identified in northeast Brazil and not from a separate introduction into the Americas.

[Given active dengue virus transmission in this area at the time that samples for this study were collected, it is likely that the earliest cases of chikungunya virus infection were misdiagnosed as dengue fever. - Mod.TY]
