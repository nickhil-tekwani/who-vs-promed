A strain of avian influenza has been detected at a Jennie-O turkey farm in Barron, Wisconsin. It is the 2nd case of bird flu reported at a US commercial poultry operation in the past week [week of 5 Mar 2017]. Hormel Foods Corp, which owns Jennie-O, confirmed the H5N2 strain was detected at the operation on [Sat 4 Mar 2017], the Associated Press reported.

Earlier this week [week of 5 Mar 2017], 73 000 chickens at a Tyson Foods supplier in Tennessee were killed due to an outbreak of avian influenza. The H7N9 strain found in Tennessee is not related to the H5N2 strain found in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin case is a low-pathogenic (LPAI) bird flu strain. Officials in Barron County say low-pathogenic strains are not uncommon in poultry flocks and do not cause many clinical signs of the illness in the birds.

In light of the recent outbreaks, Barron County Emergency Services is urging all poultry owners to increase their biosecurity efforts on their farms, regardless of size. For farmers, biosecurity is a preventative approach used to minimize the introduction or spread of disease-causing organisms like viruses or bacteria. Farmers should have a biosecurity plan or program tailored to their farm and livestock species.

Officials recommend farmers take the following actions:
- restrict access to your property and keep your birds away from other birds;
- wash your hands thoroughly before and after working with your birds. Clean and disinfect equipment;
- buy birds from reputable sources and keep new birds separated for at least 30 days;
-do not share equipment or supplies with neighbors or other bird owners. If you must borrow, disinfect it first;
- know the warning signs. Early detection can help prevent the spread of the disease. Check your birds frequently. If you find a sick or dead bird, don't touch it;
- report sick birds, don't wait. If your birds are sick or dying at an abnormal rate, call DATCP at 1-800-572-8981.

[The avian influenza strain in Tennessee, a highly pathogenic strain, is not the same as this low pathogenetic strain that has been found in Wisconsin. Nevertheless, avian influenza is clearly circulating in the USA. The following principles should be applied.

If you suspect your birds have a disease, please call a veterinarian, as well as your state animal health official.

Take precautions.
This is biosecurity. Wash your hands frequently, for your health as well as decreasing transmission of this or any virus between yourself, your birds, your fellow workers, or your family.

Biosecurity for the premises is important. Be cautious of trucks coming on to the premises. Wash the truck tires and parts of the truck if necessary. An adage worth repeating and reminding, is that it is better to be safe than sorry.

Wild birds can transmit the disease, whether they co-mingle with your birds, share water sources or feed sources. Again, biosecurity is important. Think biosecurity in every aspect of your movements and facilities. - Mod.TG
