[1] Isolate characterization

The Council of Agriculture said on Monday [5 Aug 2013] that the strains [isolates] of the rabies virus found in Taiwan are highly similar to those found in China. In the latest test, the researchers determined after analyzing the virus [isolates] found in rabies-infected Formosan ferret-badgers in Taiwan that they are about 90 percent similar to those found in China and can be classified into 3 types, said Tsai Hsiang-jung, Director-general of the Council's Animal Health Research Institute.

The findings suggest the virus has been lurking in Taiwan's mountainous areas for years before it was discovered by health authorities, Tsai said, but he declined to speculate on how long the virus has existed here. Asked if the disease could have been caused by smuggled animals from China, Tsai said health officials were not certain of this, but that there was a "very high possibility" this might have happened.

On 17 Jul 2013, Taiwan informed the World Organization for Animal Health of its 3 confirmed cases of rabies in wild Formosan ferret-badgers -- 2 in [Nan-T'ou] County and another in [Yun-Lin] County. The number of confirmed infections in animals in Taiwan went up to 40 as of Monday [5 Aug 2013]. All of the confirmed rabies cases so far have been Formosan ferret-badgers, with the exception of an Asian house shrew. Rabies has been recorded in 28 districts and townships in 7 cities and counties across central and southern Taiwan.

[The heterogeneity of the isolates of rabies virus obtained from the ferret-badger population suggests that the virus has been present in Taiwan for a considerable period, and is not a recent introduction. In any event it is not clear why anyone would have introduced an infected ferret badger into Taiwan recently. The extent of genetic variability of the rabies virus isolates obtained from ferret-badgers in Taiwan and China is similar apparently, reinforcing the conclusion that ferret-badger rabies virus is evolving at similar rates in the 2 countries. More detailed information on the genetic characterization of these isolates of rabies virus is awaited. - Mod.CP]

Taiwan denies stray-dog cull in rabies response
-----------------------------------------------
Taiwan's agricultural authorities on Monday [5 Aug 2013] denied that culling stray dogs and cats had ever been made an epidemic-prevention policy, in response to environmental groups' criticism of the authorities' rabies handling.

Environmental groups accused the authorities of tackling the island's rabies outbreak through culling stray dogs and cats.

The agricultural authorities in Taiwan urged the public not to abandon their pets, stay away from wild animals, and to also vaccinate their pets regularly.

A total of 39 ferret-badgers and one Asian house rat [Asian house shrew: _Suncus murinus_ (Soricidae)] were found with rabies in Taiwan by Sunday [4 Aug 2013; see item 3], the island's rabies outbreak control center said.

The island started reporting rabies cases last month [July 2013]. No humans or dogs have thus far been reported to be infected with the disease.

Before July 2013, Taiwan had been rabies-free since 1959.

Rabies in Chinese ferret badgers in Taiwan - Preliminary outbreak assessment
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease report
----------------
Taiwan has reported 3 Chinese ferret badgers have tested positive for rabies (OIE, 2013). According to the report the animals were found dead in 2012 (May, November, and December) but rabies tests were only carried out in June 2013. The tests included serology and PCR but could not use fresh brain tissue to test with the fluorescent antibody test, which would confirm classical rabies infection. However an expert group was convened and they have confirmed disease. Control measures were put in place including intensified surveillance and providing vaccination for domestic animals in the regions of Yunlin and Nantou.

2. Situation assessment
----------------------
Chinese ferret badgers, _Melogale moschata_, are members of the Mustelidae family and common to South East Asia, including India, China, and Indochina. In 2009, Zhang and colleagues (2009) reported on human cases associated with contact with ferret badgers in China. Between 1994 and 2004 between 60 and 77 percent of human rabies cases (that is, tens of cases) in some regions were associated with handling ferret badgers. Molecular analysis of the virus isolates over the last 10 years indicates that a sylvatic cycle (not involving dogs) is now established (Zhang et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2013). The species is historically an important furbearer and therefore is hunted widely in southern China hence the human contact (IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature], 2013).

Under PETS rules (EC Regulation 2003/998/EC, European Union, 2003) Taiwan is a listed 3rd country based on an assessment of its disease status and veterinary administration providing for a low relative risk of rabies. This means that dogs, cats, and ferrets arriving from Taiwan would only have to undergo vaccination and a 21 day wait before moving to the EU (and the UK). Countries are entered onto the "Third Country List" not only because of the relative low risk of rabies, but also the standards of the veterinary authorities and the ability to control disease. The Taiwanese authorities have reacted in a measured and appropriate manner by implementing intensive vaccination and surveillance and by informing not only international veterinary and public health agencies but also making the public aware in line with the blueprint for control of rabies (Lembo et al, 2012). It will be interesting to know whether the infected ferret badgers were wild or had been kept for fur trade as it may have implications for whether the disease has been introduced in dogs or in hunted ferret badgers.

3. Conclusions
--------------
At present we consider these cases do not increase the overall risk of introduction of rabies to the UK via legal imports under the current harmonised scheme for pet movement. There is no evidence to suggest the disease has spilled over into the pet population in Taiwan. This overall risk level of introduction of rabies in a pet travelling to the UK is considered to be very low at all times of the year, but is greater for listed 3rd countries than EU Member States, primarily those listed 3rd countries where rabies is present at significant levels and the number of movements is high. It is important to be aware of these issues and we will continue to monitor the situation.

[The Xinhua-sourced information that "about 1000 Taiwanese will receive rabies vaccinations" requires clarification; what is the background to those (post exposure?) treatments? Is the virus suspected to be circulating also in badgers kept for fur trade, a point raised in the DEFRA assessment (item 5)?

Media-derived information, such as the fox-news headlines of 31 Jul 2013 "Rabies outbreak jumps species in Taiwan" ("officials confirmed the disease had spread to a shrew, fuelling fears that it could mutate further to affect domestic pets -- greatly increasing the risk to humans") may be confusing.

The steadily growing number of dead wild badgers found rabies-positive in vast areas of the island is indicative of a widespread epizootic, fortunately limited, so far, to one species.

In this respect, the conclusions of the Chinese authors describing a recent similar situation in southeastern China (Ref 5 above), deserve attention:

"Rabies in ferret badgers occurred during 2 alleged epizootics (1994-1995 and 2002-2004) in southeastern China. Our preliminary data suggest another probable epizootic of rabies in ferret badgers during 2007-2008. Rabies in ferret badgers is becoming a greater public health threat to humans in eastern Anhui, middle to western Zhejiang, and northern Jiangxi provinces in China.

"Because no practical rabies vaccine has been developed for wildlife in China, a rabies epidemic in ferret badgers is almost inevitable without intervention, and the threat to public health is immediate. Lack of communication and cooperation among the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Agriculture, and wildlife services from the Bureau of Forestry makes the situation more complicated than canine rabies control. Whether rabies in ferret badgers is a spillover event from rabid dogs or whether ferret badgers serve as a natural reservoir remains to be addressed. In addition to more detailed epidemiologic investigations, control and elimination of rabies in dogs is a primary suggestion to test the latter hypothesis."

From the Taiwanese situation (rabies in badgers, in a country free of canine rabies), it may be hypothesised that ferret badgers may indeed serve as a natural reservoir. Further studies are anticipated, including molecular investigations. - Mod.AS
