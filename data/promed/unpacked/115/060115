Foot & mouth breaks out in Lakki
-------------------------------------
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), locally called tabak, has killed hundreds of
cattle, inflicting a huge loss on the farmer community of the district.
Sources said that almost all the localities of the district had been
affected by the viral disease.
The authorities concerned have failed to take any measure to contain the
disease so far, the residents alleged.
"More than 100 cattle, mostly cows and calves of precious species, have
been killed in Dallokhel village during the last 2 weeks," said a
representative of the Dallokhel Educational and Social Welfare Association
(DESWA), claiming that the authorities concerned were making all-out
efforts to contain the disease. He added that 10 cattle were dying per day
in the village because of the outbreak.
"We have launched a vaccination campaign throughout the district, and a
number of livestock have been administered vaccine as part of a
precautionary measure against the disease," an official of the Livestock
Department said, while requesting anonymity.
He further said that the higher authorities of the department had been
apprised of the situation. The district residents have demanded that Chief
Minister Muhammad Akram Khan Durrani, the provincial minister for
Livestock, and other authorities concerned take prompt measures to control
the epidemic completely.

[Lakki Marwat is in southern Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), sharing a
border with Punjab Province.
Official confirmation of FMD, or otherwise, is anticipated; if affirmative,
the identity of the FMDV serotype(s) involved, and data on vaccinations,
will be helpful.
Data on FMD in Pakistan can be seen in posting 20050126.0276. - Mods.MPP/AS]
