Ticks are the reservoir of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and
between 3 Apr and 25 Jun 2007, a total of 178 cases of tick-bites
(including 4 children) have been recorded in Elista, the capital of
the Republic of Kalmykia. A total of 6 persons have been admitted to
hospital in Elista on suspicion of CCHF in recent days, and 2 cases
have been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis.
A serious situation with regard to CCHF has developed this year
[2007] in the Southern Federal District of Russia. CCHF has been
reported in 7 of 13 regions of the Southern Federal District: in the
Rostov, Volgograd [see below], Astrakhan, and Stavropol regions, and
also in the Republics of Dagestan, Kalmykia, and Ingushetia.
Cases of CCHF have been recorded predominantly among the inhabitants
of rural districts. The airborne spread of infection has been
facilitated by herding and inadequate separation of livestock,
thereby promoting expansion of natural foci of CCHF.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been confirmed in 14
inhabitants of Volgograd. Since 11 May [2007], 54 persons were
hospitalized on suspicion of CCHF. A committee on public health
services in the Administration of the Volgograd Region has reported
that 463 inhabitants of the region, including 80 children, have
sustained bites from the ticks that transmit CCHF virus. More than
half of all cases have been registered among residents of the
Kotelnikovsky and Oktyabrsky districts.
Olga Fomina, a spokesperson for the Press Service of the region
stated that, "Healthcare workers are trying to prevent new cases of
infection in the region by arranging lectures, round tables, and
citizen's forums, stressing the necessity for immediate recourse to
medical treatment for tick-bites. We should remember that in May
[2007], one of the CCHF cases in the Volgograd Region had a fatal
outcome." The deceased patient was a 40-year-old woman, a resident of
the Oktyabrsky district.

[Last year (2006) CCHF was diagnosed in 15 inhabitants of the
Volgograd Region. In the same year the highest number of CCHF cases
(69) among all regions of the South of Russia was recorded in the
Republic of Kalmykia.
The Southern Federal District (SFD) is one of 7 federal
administrative districts in Russia. It is located in the far
southwest and includes the Rostov, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd,
and Astrakhan regions, and also the Republics of Chechnya, Kalmykia,
Dagestan, Adygeya, Severhaya Osetiya, Kabardino-Balkaria,
Ingushetiya, and Karachaevo-Cherkessiya. The Capital of the Southern
Federal District is Rostov-on-Don. - Mod.NP

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease reported from more than 30
countries in Africa, Asia, South-East Europe, and the Middle East.
Its distribution is roughly coincident with that of its _Hyalomma_
spp. tick vectors. The virus is transmitted by contact with domestic
animal products (such as, blood of slaughtered animals and
occasionally milk), by contact (and nosocomial) transmission, and
also by tick-bite. The majority of human cases occur in workers in
the livestock industry, agriculture, slaughterhouses, and veterinary
practice. Clinical manifestations are non-specific and symptoms
typically include high fever, headache, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia,
nausea, abdominal pain, and non-bloody diarrhea. Patients may show
signs of progressive hemorrhagic diathesis. The mainstay of treatment
of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is supportive, with careful
maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, circulatory volume, and
blood pressure. There is no clinical disease in animals other than
humans.
Recent molecular analyses including the determination of the complete
genomes of 13 geographically and temporally diverse virus strains
have revealed that CCHF viruses are be highly variable (see: Deyde et
al, J Virol. 2006 Sep; 80(17): 8834-42
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/80/17/8834?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=Deyde&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT>).

Distinct geographic lineages exist, but with multiple exceptions
indicative of long-distance virus movement. Discrepancies among the
S, M, and L genome subunit phylogenetic tree topologies are
indicative of multiple RNA segment reassortment events. This feature
(as well as apparent intra-segment recombination), indicate that the
genomic plasticity of CCHF virus is very high. - Mod.CP]
