Introduction
------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and
publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available
epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by
the Global Influenza Surveillance Network), FluID, and influenza reports
from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among
updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when
the update is developed.

Map timeline for influenza activity
-----------------------------------

Description: displayed data reflect the most recent information reported to
FluNet, WHO regional offices, or on ministry of health websites in the last
2 weeks. The percentage of specimens tested positive for influenza includes
all specimens tested positive for all influenza subtypes. The pie charts
show the distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were
tested positive for influenza. The available country data were joined in
larger geographical areas (influenza transmission zones) with similar
influenza transmission patterns in order to present an overview.

Influenza: update 120
8 Nov 2010 - summary
---------------------
Worldwide
---------
Overall influenza activity remained low, except in parts of the tropics,
most notably in South East Asia, and to a lesser extent in the tropical
areas of the Americas. After late winter and springtime influenza epidemics
in several countries of the temperate southern hemisphere, influenza
activity has returned to near or below baseline in most places.

Notably, however, a recent post-season rise in cases has been noted across
parts of southern Africa associated with localized outbreaks of influenza
H1N1 (2009) virus. Seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses continued to be the
predominant circulating type or subtype of influenza viruses worldwide,
however, in addition, in many countries there has been co-circulation of
seasonal influenza B viruses and to a lesser extent, influenza H1N1 (2009)
viruses. The latter has been recently predominant in a limited number of
countries, including in India.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In Chile, an unusually late winter and springtime influenza epidemic,
characterized by predominance of circulating seasonal influenza A (H3N2)
viruses, and to a lesser extent seasonal influenza B and H1N1 (2009)
viruses, appears to have largely subsided. A similarly timed influenza
epidemic was also observed in Paraguay and Uruguay. In Argentina, however,
little winter and springtime influenza activity was observed during 2010,
with influenza B viruses accounting for the majority of sporadic influenza
virus detections.

In South Africa, the 2010 winter influenza season, characterized by a
predominance of seasonal influenza B viruses, and to lesser seasonal
A(H3N2) viruses, had largely concluded by the end of September 2010 but was
followed by a mild resurgence of influenza activity (with a similar
distribution of influenza viruses) during October 2010. In neighboring
Namibia, there have been reports of school and community outbreaks of
influenza H1N1 (2009) during October 2010.

As of early to mid-October 2010, influenza activity had declined
substantially or had fallen below seasonal baselines in Australia and New
Zealand, respectively. In both countries, the season was marked by a
predominance of circulating influenza H1N1 (2009) viruses, however, in
Australia there was also co-circulation of seasonal A (H3N2) and B viruses.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
In the tropics of Asia, the most active reported circulation of influenza
viruses continued to be in Thailand. Since late July 2010, influenza H1N1
(2009) viruses have been the predominant circulating influenza viruses in
Thailand, however, more recently beginning in early October 2010, seasonal
influenza A(H3N2), B, and H1N1 (2009) viruses began to co-circulate at
similar levels. In southern China and Hong Kong (SAR), recent periods of
active circulation of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses during late summer
and autumn now appear to have largely subsided. In Hong Kong SAR (China)
but not in southern China, circulation of seasonal influenza A(H3N2)
viruses was associated with a significant increase in sentinel levels of
ILI [influenza-like illness] activity. In India, the national epidemic of
influenza H1N1 (2009), which began during June 2010 and lasted until late
September 2010, has largely subsided but small numbers of new cases
continued to be reported weekly. In neighboring Bangladesh, there has been
persistent influenza virus transmission since the early part of 2010,
however, only in recent months has circulation of seasonal influenza
A(H3N2) become predominant.

In the tropics of the Americas, between late July and early October, many
countries or parts of countries experienced periods of active circulation
of influenza viruses, including but not limited to southern Mexico, Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, Cuba, Peru, Colombia, and
Bolivia. In most of these countries, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) was the
predominant circulating influenza virus. Notably, Nicaragua observed
circulation of predominantly influenza B viruses, while Colombia and
Bolivia experience circulation of predominantly influenza H1N1 (2009)
viruses. In most countries of the region, overall influenza virus
transmission has declined substantially or returned to very low levels.

Limited data from the tropical areas of sub-Saharan Africa suggest that
overall influenza activity has remained low. Since late spring and late
summer, there have been persistent low levels of circulation of seasonal
influenza A(H3N2) viruses in Kenya and Madagascar, respectively. A similar,
but brief period of late summer circulation of seasonal influenza A(H3N2)
viruses was also observed in Tanzania. More recently, since late September
2010, Cameroon, in central Africa, has also begun to detect significant
level of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses. In contrast, little influenza
activity has been reported in West Africa during recent months.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In Canada and the United States, rates of ILI have increased slightly, but
remain at or below seasonal baselines; small numbers of seasonal influenza
A(H3N2) and B viruses have been detected during the past month.

Most countries in the European Region continued to report low overall
levels of ILI activity, with sporadic detections of influenza A(H3N2), H1N1
(2009), and influenza B viruses.

Overall influenza activity remains sporadic in Northern China, Japan, and
South Korea.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network is constantly monitoring the
evolution of influenza viruses. Like other influenza viruses, the influenza
H1N1 (2009) viruses have being undergoing genetic evolution. Since their
emergence, variants having substitutions at residues 125/142, 222, and/or
374/391 in the haemagglutinin gene have been detected. Recently other
genetic mutations have also been reported. However, antigenic
characterization to date has shown that all these viruses are not
antigenically distinguishable from the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009.

FluNet reports
---------------
During weeks 41 to 42 (10-23 Oct, 2010) National Influenza Centres (NICs)
from 31 countries reported data to FluNet (some NICs report to FluNet
retrospectively leading to updates of previous summary data). A total of
1749 specimens were reported as positive for influenza viruses, 1512 (86.4
per cent) were typed as influenza A and 237 (13.6 per cent) as influenza B.
Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses reported, 15.6 per cent were influenza
H1N1(2009) and 84.0 per cent were influenza A(H3N2).
