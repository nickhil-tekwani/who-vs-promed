Potato leaf curl - a new disease of potato in northern India caused by a
strain of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus

A severe leaf curl disease has been observed since 1999 in potato (_Solanum
tuberosum_) crops in northern India. Affected plants were severely stunted
with apical leaf curl, crinkled leaves, and expressed conspicuous mosaic.
Garg et al. (2001), using polyclonal antiserum to Indian cassava mosaic
virus in IEM, detected a begomovirus associated with this disease.
Inoculum from a severely affected potato plant was sap-transmitted to
_Nicotiana benthamiana_ [Nb] seedlings, in which it induced severe leaf
distortion and stunting 15 days post inoculation. Meristem-derived
plantlets of potato cv. Kufri Anand inoculated with sap from infected Nb
leaves developed yellow mottling, mosaic, and leaf curl symptoms.
Double-stranded viral replicative DNAs were purified from infected potato
and Nb plants and cloned at HindIII, BamHI, XbaI, and PstI sites in the
vector pUC18. The clones at the XbaI and PstI sites had a unit genome
length insert (approx. 2.7 kb) which hybridized with the viral replicative
forms from the infected plants. The nucleotide sequence of the XbaI and
PstI clones corresponded to the DNA A (Accession No. AY286316) and B
(Accession No. AY158080) components of the causal begomovirus.
Comparison of the complete nucleotide sequence of DNA A revealed that it
has 93-95 percent identity with that of ToLCV-NDe isolates and <75 percent
identity with other Tomato leaf curl virus isolates and Potato yellow
mosaic virus.
A whitefly-transmitted potato begomovirus has not been reported previously
in India, probably as potato crops on the North Indian plains have been
cultivated during winter months, when whitefly populations are low.
However, in recent years, potato crops have been planted earlier, resulting
in a sufficient buildup of whitefly populations that might have led to the
emergence of a new potato disease.
The nucleotide sequence data indicate that the cause is a virus closely
related to ToLCV-NDe which, unlike the strain infecting potato, is not
sap-transmissible and is not known to infect potato naturally. Therefore it
is likely that a new strain of ToLCV-NDe has emerged that infects potato, a
new host.
This is the first observation of a begomovirus causing a severe disease of
potato in India. We conclude that potato leaf curl disease is caused by a
strain of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCV-NDe).

[This piece is a good example of virus evolution at work. A
whitefly-transmitted begomovirus originating in potato fields in Northern
India is shown to be closely related to ToLCV-NDe. What is interesting is
that the new virus is a relatively rare example of a sap-transmissible
begomovirus. Based on genome sequence analysis, it is closely related to
ToLCV-NDe but less closely related to other ToLCV isolates/strains. At
least 3 other begomovirus strains/isolates have been reported from Asia.
The one associated with cucumber yellow leaf curl disease in Thailand
shares 95.6 percent nucleotide sequence similarity with the DNA-A of
ToLCV-NDe, and pumpkin yellow vein mosaic virus is most closely related to
the same virus. Recently a begomovirus in sponge gourd (_Luffa cylindrica_)
from India is now considered to be a putative strain of ToLCV-NDe. Clearly
new viral species continue to emerge in Asia. - Mod.DH]
