Hundreds of brown pelicans and great white herons in the Florida Keys
are sick, and in some cases dying, from a mysterious illness baffling
wildlife experts as they scramble to save the seabirds. In the last 6
months flocks of pelicans and herons have been found either dead or
critically ill throughout the islands and in the neighboring Marquesas
Keys.
Veterinarians say the seabirds' symptoms are strikingly similar to
those afflicting loggerhead turtles in the Keys, but they haven't been
able to link the 2 die-offs scientifically. The rescued seabirds
cannot open their mouths to eat or blink their eyes. A few have
mustered enough energy to walk, except they use their wings as feet.
But most of the pelicans and herons lie motionless in their cages, too
weak to lift their heads. "Some of them are so sick, you can't tell if
they're dead or alive," said Kelly Grinter, director of Marathon Wild
Bird Rescue, where some 40 seabirds have been brought with the unknown
illness. "Whatever is hitting them, it's hitting them fast. We're
finding dead pelicans that have literally nose-dived out of mangrove
trees without opening their wings."
Only 5 of the 35 sick loggerheads rescued have survived thus far, but
Grinter says the majority of pelicans and herons are recovering --
about 75 percent at the Marathon facility -- with extensive fluid
therapy.
Wildlife rescue centers in Key West and Tavernier have been successful
in rehabilitating the seabirds. Theories abound as to what may be
causing the epidemic, which surfaced in the Lower Keys and has
affected only brown pelicans, great white herons, and loggerhead
turtles. Some suspect a natural or man-made toxin, possibly in
jellyfish, having damaged the creatures' central nervous systems.
Although pelicans and herons mainly eat fish, and sea turtles feed on
crustaceans and squid, wildlife authorities contend an algae bloom
might have infected both creatures' food supplies and subsequently
caused a life-threatening toxicity.
