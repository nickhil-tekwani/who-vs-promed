Cholera in Liberia
------------------
Between 6-29 Jun 2003, 586 cases of cholera have been reported from
those health facilities still operational in Monrovia. As of 23-29
June, 50 percent of the admissions were from Bushrod Island and
central Monrovia. Because of the security situation, exact numbers of
cases and deaths are difficult to obtain.
WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health with control measures,
including mass chlorination in and around Monrovia. WHO is also
providing drugs, medical supplies and chlorine to those
nongovernmental organizations, including MERLIN and Medecins sans
Frontieres (France and Belgium), working in Monrovia.

sending troops into Liberia in the near future, ProMED has posted
