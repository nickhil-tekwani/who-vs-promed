Confirmed circulation of West Nile virus in Western Siberia in 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the summer of 2003, West Nile virus (WNV) was found in 2 species of
birds collected in the south of Western Siberia. 32 samples (18 birds were
dead) were collected in the Karasuk region of the Novosibirsk province and
were analyzed by anti-WNV monoclonal antibody-modified immunoenzyme assay
(EIA) for antigen detection and by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
2 positive samples (EIA and RT-PCR positive) from rooks (_Corvus
frugilegus_) [crow family] and 2 positive samples from grey crow (_Corvus
tristis_) were found to be infected with WNV. Sequencing of fragments of
the E protein gene showed the maximum level of homology with strain
WNV/LEIV-Vlg99-27889, a strain of WNV isolated in Volgograd, Russia, in
1999, and Siberian variants of WNV isolated in 2002 [see: ProMED-mail post:
"West Nile virus, birds, 2002 - Russia (Siberia) 20030516.1216].
The high level of homology between these sequences suggests a connection
between West Nile viruses circulating in the Caspian Sea region and Western
Siberia. These results confirm the results of study of field samples
obtained in 2002, indicating that WNV is actively circulating on the south
part of Western Siberia.

[ProMED-mail thanks the VECTOR group for this update. West Nile virus is
endemic in localities along the flight paths of migratory birds from South
Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe and Siberia, but human cases
are not commonly reported in these regions. - Mod.CP/JW]
