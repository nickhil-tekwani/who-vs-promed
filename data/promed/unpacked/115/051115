The French National Reference Center on trichinellosis was informed on 23
Sep 2005 of suspected cases of trichinellosis in a group of 10 hunters
returning from a trip in Canada.
On 30 Aug 2005, these hunters ate barbecued meat from a black bear killed
the same day in Northern Quebec. The 1st signs and symptoms (fever,
myalgia, facial edema, increased levels of muscular enzymes in the serum,
high levels of blood eosinophils) were observed 10-15 days after the
consumption of the meat in 9 hunters. Interestingly, 2 hunters brought back
bear meat that was shared with relatives. One meal involved, 2 Sep, 9
consumers (including 3 hunters previously contaminated); 3 additional
patients acquired the disease during this meal. A 2nd meal involved, 6 Sep,
8 consumers (including 1 hunter previously contaminated); these consumers
are still symptom-less and were informed of the potential risk of
trichinellosis. Biological tests are in progress, and their physicians were
advised to give them a prophylactic regimen of albendazole. So far, 12
patients (of whom 7 are hospitalised) have typical symptoms.
Epidemiological and biological investigations are in progress in the 11
other consumers.
Organised travel for hunting in northern Canada are becoming more and more
popular. Participants in such travels should be informed of the risk of
acquiring trichinellosis by consuming raw or rare meat of wild carnivores.
In 2004, an isolated case of trichinellosis was reported to the French
national Reference center after consumption of black bear, also in northern
Quebec.
Trichinellosis in this region is particularly frequent, and black bear meat
is a frequent source of outbreaks in northern Canada (see: Schellenberg RS
et al. An outbreak of trichinellosis due to consumption of bear meat
infected with Trichinella nativa, in 2 northern Saskatchewan communities. J
Infect Dis. 2003;188:835-43).

[Bear is a classic host of Trichinella spp. Eating undercooked bear meat is
also a classic way of infection. We agree entirely with the authors -- that
hunters should be advised not to eat undercooked meat from carnivores like
bear and wild boar. A particular feature of Trichinella infection is the
widespread distribution of cases seen when meat is transported from one
country to another or sent to friends and relatives by mail. - Mod.EP]
