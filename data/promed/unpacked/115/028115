re: Enzootic bovine leukosis - New Zealand (02): eradicated, not
----------------------------------------------------------------
Denmark, Iceland, SIovenia, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland are not the
only European countries free of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). European
Commission Decision 2003/467/EC and its further amendments declare also the
whole territories of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany,
Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
and the Slovak Republic plus a great deal of the territory of Italy and
Poland as officially free of EBL.

This regional eradication approach is very effective and is highly
recommended policy to our New Zealand colleagues.

[The above complementary information on the current EBL status in European
Community (EC) member states (and Switzerland) is gratefully acknowledged.

EBL is one of the diseases against which the European Community maintains
eradication and monitoring programmes aiming at their progressive
elimination. The list includes, besides EBL, also other bovine diseases,
namely bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis, IBR/IPV, Anthrax, Johnes
disease (paratuberculosis), CBPP, and bluetongue in endemic or high risk areas.

The EC provides financial contribution for the eradication, control and
monitoring of certain animal diseases and zoonoses presented by the Member
States. The list includes the following bovine diseases: bovine
brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, bluetongue in endemic or high risk areas,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and enzootic bovine leucosis. The
countries which obtain during 2009 financial assistance from the EC for the
eradication of EBL are Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, and Poland.

The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the EC sent, during recent years, 2
missions to New Zealand under the auspice of the agreement between the
European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade
in live animals and animal products.

The 1st mission (Inspection number 2007-7513) was carried out in February
2007. Its final report, published on 22 Feb 2007, included -- in article
4.3. "Animal health information" -- the following information: "Enzootic
Bovine Leucosis (EBL) is not a reportable disease, but a voluntary control
and eradication programme managed by the industry is in place. According to
data provided by BNZ [Biosecurity New Zealand], the herd prevalence of EBL
was 0.2 per cent in 2004 and <0.2 per cent in 2006."

The 2nd mission (Inspection number 2008-7899) was carried out in Jan-Feb
2008. Its final report, published 25 Jul 2008, included -- inter alia --
the following information in article 5.4.2.5, "Dairy farms Observations":
"The farms had good documentation which comprised raw milk testing results,
test results for bovine tuberculosis and leucosis, records of veterinary
treatments (including withdrawal periods) and water results." - Mod.AS]
