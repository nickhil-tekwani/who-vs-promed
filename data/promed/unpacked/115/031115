North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il has alerted his regime to fight bird flu
after at least one person was infected with the virus in Pyongyang in
December 2005, a human rights activist here said.
Avian influenza also struck chickens and other birds at 3 different places
in Pyongyang in December 2005, said Lee Young-Hwa, who heads RENK, a
Japanese group monitoring human rights in the communist state. (RENK, which
stands for Rescue The North Korean People's Urgent Action Network, is known
to have contacts within the secretive nation and has supplied media with
confidential information on the regime, including what it called official
documents.) If confirmed, it would be the first known human case of bird
flu reported in the country which has long been plagued by food shortages
and other economic woes. "According to our information, Kim Jong-Il issued
an internal order to party and government organs at the beginning of 2006
to work out measures for controlling and preventing bird flu," Lee told AFP.
The woman infected with the virus was admitted to the Red Cross hospital in
the North Korean capital said Lee, an ethnic Korean economics professor at
Osaka's Kansai University. The strain of bird flu was not identified and
there was no other information on her condition or how she contracted the
virus, he said. Lee said an ethnic Korean scientist in Japan was known to
have travelled to North Korea during 2005 with 10 packs of anti-flu agent
Tamiflu for hospital use.
An outbreak of bird flu that infected humans could be devastating in North
Korea, where poultry is an important source of meat for its 23 million
people. North Korea's official media reported outbreaks among poultry last
year and in 2004. But Tokyo's Radiopress, which monitors media in the
North, said it had not heard of any human infections.
Pyongyang informed South Korea last year that it had culled thousands of
chickens infected with the H7 strain of the virus, which poses no danger of
human infection. South Korea's unification ministry said Wednesday it was
unaware of any human cases in the North.
Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency reported on 21 Dec 2005 that North
Korean scientists had "found out the basis to rapidly and correctly
identify any types of bird flu viruses." And the official mouthpiece said
scientists had confirmed bird flu within 10 days when it broke out on
chicken farms in spring 2005. The scientists, "basing [their work] on this
success, have deepened the research work to put the nation-wide bird flu
prevention campaign on a scientific basis," it said.
North Korea's 2 main neighbours, South Korea and China, have both had
outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of the virus that has killed more than 80
people, mostly in Asia, and millions of birds. When Kim met Chinese
President Hu Jintao during his visit to China earlier in January 2006, he
could have asked for Beijing's help in fighting bird flu, the Japanese
daily Sankei Shimbun reported Wednesday, quoting Japanese government
sources. Kim reportedly visited a Beijing hospital during the
secrecy-shrouded 9-day visit. The Sankei newspaper said it was possible Kim
was tested for bird flu at Beijing's No. 301 Hospital of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army.

human - Eurasia (37): multicountry 20060125.0242, but there is as yet no
direct confirmation from internal sources of the occurrence of any human

An Indonesian chicken seller whom local tests showed had been infected with
H5N1 avian influenza virus has died, a hospital official said on Thu 26 Jan
2006. If confirmed by outside laboratories recognised by the World Health
Organisation (WHO), the case would take total known deaths in Indonesia
from avian flu to 15.
"The 22-year-old man died at 2 p.m today [26 Jan 2006]. He was the vendor
from a traditional market and the only positive case that we were treating
today," said Ilham Patu, a spokesman of the Jakarta hospital designated to
deal with bird flu patients.
This latest death comes as WHO drew attention to the threat posed by
Indonesia's traditional markets and urged that hygiene and sanitation
standards be improved. The global health body has called for preventive
measures included limiting contact between humans and poultry in markets,
as well as better access to water and improved waste management.
Asia remains the epicentre of the fight against bird flu, although the
virus has this month killed children in Turkey as it spreads westwards to
the edge of Europe. Bird flu has killed at least 83 people in 6 countries
since late 2003.
The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has affected birds in 2/3 of the
provinces in Indonesia, an archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220
million people. The country has millions of chickens and ducks, many in the
yards of rural or urban homes, raising the risk of more humans becoming
infected with the virus.
