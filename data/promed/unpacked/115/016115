In the United Kingdom, chestnut blight caused by _Cryphonectria parasitica_ (EPPO A2 List) was detected for the 1st time in England in 2011 [ProMED post 20120322.1077286]. Surveys conducted in 2017-2018 detected the disease at different sites in Berkshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, and London.

Further surveys in 2019-2020 detected _C. parasitica_ in additional sites in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Devon, London, and West Sussex, as well as on the island of Jersey. These surveys showed that the fungus still has a limited distribution in England.

Studies on 115 isolates also revealed a high diversity in vegetative compatibility groups, supporting the hypothesis of multiple introductions of _C. parasitica_ through imports over time from Europe. The situation in the UK deserves further study.

[Chestnut blight (CB) is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_. It affects edible chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.) and some other tree genera (for example oaks, maples, eucalypts), but not horse chestnuts (_Aesculus_ spp.). Susceptibility varies between species. Most susceptible are the European chestnut (_C. sativa_), which is most often used for commercial chestnut production, as well as the American chestnut (_C. dentata_). In the late 1800s, the disease spread from the Far East, where native species show very low susceptibility, to North America, where it caused massive extinctions. In the 1930s, it spread to Europe, and more recently it was also detected in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20100915.3350).

Virulent and hypovirulent forms of the pathogen exist. Virulent strains induce variable symptoms, which may include necrosis and cracking of the bark (cankers); orange to beige fungal growth; distortion of bark due to the destruction of the underlying tissues; yellowing of leaves; wilting of shoots; dieback of branches. Symptoms progress quickly, death of the tree occurs from girdling by cankers. Hypovirulent strains cause mild and/or transient symptoms which do not normally kill the host. The fungus enters through wounds and survives as a non-lethal parasite on a number of tree species. It is spread mainly by infected plant and other materials, mechanical means (including insect activity, cutting tools, machinery, and birds over long distances), wind, and splashing rain.

Hypovirulence is due to infection of the fungus by _Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-EP713_ (CHV1-EP713; type species of genus _Hypovirus_). The virus can be transmitted through hyphal anastomosis converting the recipient fungal strain to the hypovirulent phenotype. However, transmission is limited by a vegetative incompatibility system in the fungus. In continental Europe, the disease has lost its severity due to the natural spread of the hypovirus, which has enabled re-growth of chestnuts in many affected regions. Hypovirulence provides the basis for disease management. Research is in progress on virus diversity, dispersal, and the establishment of hypovirulence.

In the UK, suspected chestnut blight was confirmed for the 1st time in 2012, apparently introduced from France with legal plant imports (ProMED-mail post 20120322.1077286). National plant quarantine guidelines and procedures were reassessed. According to the report above, this seems to have succeeded so far to keep subsequent outbreaks largely localised.
