Salmonella infections are predominantly acquired through the consumption of contaminated food, but contact with animals may also be an important source of infection (1). Reptiles are frequent carriers of Salmonella in their intestinal tract (2), they usually show no signs of illness and shed the bacteria in their faeces, contaminating the water and any surface in contact with them (3-6). Several serotypes have been found in reptile-associated salmonellosis, including _Salmonella [enterica serotype] Java, _S._ Poona, _S._ Pomona, _S._ Marina, _S._ Stanley, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Newport and the most common serotypes, _S._ Typhimurium and _S._ Enteritidis [2-7].

Although other reptiles can also carry salmonellae, turtles pose a special risk, as they are commonly kept as pets for children. _S._ Paratyphi B infections can cause enteric fever (paratyphoid fever) or gastroenteritis. In some cases, serious complications can occur (septicemia, meningitis), especially in young children and immunocompromised patients (7). _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java shares the same somatic and flagellar antigens as _S._ Paratyphi B, but uses d-tartrate as a carbon source. This variant appears to be less virulent, causing infections characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, although infection can also be invasive. In sporadic cases and outbreaks, infection with _S._ Java has been associated with consumption of contaminated food, including salads, goat's milk cheese and poultry and with contact with reptiles and tropical fish aquariums (8-11).

The Epidemiology Unit of the Department of Public Health in Bizkaia (a territory of the Basque Country, in the north of Spain, with a population of nearly 2 150 000 inhabitants) identified, between September 2010 and October 2011, 14 cases of _S._ Paratyphi B infection (incidence rate: 0.65/100 000 inhabitants). In Spain, the most common Salmonella serotypes are Enteritidis and Typhimurium. _S._ Paratyphi B biovar Java represented 2.1 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent of the Salmonella strains isolated from humans and serotyped at the National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella in 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively. As _S._ Java is an unusual serotype, an investigation was initiated to identify the risk factors.

Results:
Out of the 14 strains of _S._ Paratyhi B studied, eight were identified as _S._ Paratyphi B variant Java (_S._ Java), 3 as possible monophasic variants of _S._ Java (_S._ 4,5,12:b:-), and 3 as _S._ Paratyphi B sensu stricto. The last 3, which came from a family outbreak involving 3 siblings, produced different clinical manifestations, and were excluded from this description. The 11 patients from whom _S._ Java or its possible monophasic variant was isolated were not related to each other, and developed a mild disease, with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Except for 2 adults in their mid-20s and early 60s, all cases were children aged between 3 months and 10 years. 6 of the cases among children were male and 3 were female.

During the interviews, the only common factor found to constitute a risk according to the literature was having been in contact with aquatic turtles during the days before illness onset in 6 of the 9 children, either at home (4 cases), or at a relative's house (1 case) or at school (1 case).

The laboratory results show 3 different PFGE profiles, which we call type 1, 2 and 3. All strains were fully susceptible to all antimicrobials tested.

3 of the 6 samples of turtle's water yielded _S._ Java, with the same PFGE patterns as the bacteria isolated from the children who had contact with them. 2 of them were type 2, and the other was type 1. The 3 negative results came from samples collected more than 5 months after the infection. The turtles were purchased at different shops and the supplier or suppliers could not be identified.

The PFGE patterns of isolates of patients with and without turtle exposure were indistinguishable, although the source of infection could not be found. All PFGE profiles were compared with those deposited at the PulseNet network and no match was found. The water sample taken from the shop where the turtle of case 8 had been bought yielded _Salmonella_ serogroup C. This turtle belonged to the subspecies _Trachemys scripta scripta_. The species of the other turtles are not known.

Discussion:
Although we lacked a control group, the epidemiological and laboratory findings from our investigation indicate that turtles were the most likely source of infection with _S._ Paratyphi B var Java or its possible monophasic variant in this cluster of cases. Although any Salmonella serotype may be carried and transmitted by turtles, _S._ Java has been particularly associated with these reptiles (4).

For the 1st time, a possible monophasic variant of _S._ Java associated with reptile contact is described.

This is the 2nd time we find an association between contact with turtles and salmonellosis infection. In 2008, following an increase in _S._ Typhimurium infections in our region, a case-control study was performed, which estimated the odds of infection to be 1.62 times higher if the case had been exposed to turtles (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.68-3.89). In this study, 67/145 (46.2 percent) of cases were children aged between 1 and 4 years and 24/138 (17.4 percent) of cases reported contact with turtles. The association between reptile exposure and salmonellosis infection has been described in several countries (2-7,15-18).

Most cases of turtle-associated salmonellosis occur in young children, who are in the most susceptible age spectrum, probably because they usually have a closer contact with these pets, and play with the aquarium water, which is a good medium for the growth of salmonellae. Moreover, their hygiene practices tend to be worse than those of adults (2,15). In addition, parents are often not aware of the risk of infection associated with the presence of turtles in the household.

Not all the cases in this cluster reported exposure to turtles. However, direct contact is not necessary for infection; environmental contamination and symptomatic or asymptomatic patients represent possible sources of infection that may have gone unnoticed. As Salmonella bacteria survive in the environment for a long time (2,5), indirect transmission can play an important role.

3 of the 6 samples of turtle's water tested negative. However, Salmonella shedding can be intermittent and increase in response to stress like crowding, living in an environment with inadequate temperature, humidity or cleanliness, transportation, a change of habitat or excessive handling. A negative result doesn't rule out the possibility of intermittent water contamination (2,5). For this same reason, a mixed infection in the water of the shop where Salmonella serogroup C was found is possible.

In the USA, the association between contact with small turtles and salmonellosis led, in 1975, to a ban on the sale and distribution of turtles under 10.2 cm in carapace length, except for scientific or educational purposes. As a consequence, an important reduction in the number of salmonellosis was observed in the following years, especially among children (2-5). Since then, many sporadic turtle-associated salmonellosis cases have been detected.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reptiles kept as pets, as well as in the number of infections linked to contact with reptiles, including more common serotypes, such as Typhimurium (2-4). Currently, an estimated 6 percent of salmonellosis in the USA are caused by direct or indirect contact with reptiles (4). In February 2012, the CDC reported 132 cases of _S._ Paratyphi B var. L (+) tartrate + infection between 5 August 2010 and 26 September 2011. The median age of the patients in this outbreak was 6 years and of the 56 patients interviewed, 36 reported turtle exposure (19).

In Europe, salmonellosis attributed to direct or indirect contact with reptiles have also been described, although the number is likely to be underestimated, as in many cases the source of infection is unknown (17). In Sweden for instance, between 1990 and 2000, 339 reptile-associated salmonellosis cases were reported, accounting for approximately 5 percent of all reported cases (5). In this country, from 1970 to 1994, a certificate was required for the import of reptiles, stating that the animals were free of salmonellae, and the commercial distribution of turtles with a carapace length less than 10.2 cm was banned. When import regulations ceased, an increase in the number of cases was observed between 1996 and 1997. After a public education campaign launched in 1997, the number of cases decreased again (20).

Attempts to eliminate salmonelle from turtles by antibiotic treatment have not been successful, as the animals readily become reinfected from the environment, food or other turtles and can result in the development of antibiotic resistance. As shedding may be intermittent and related to stress, it is difficult to determine whether turtles are free of bacteria (2). For this reason, the way to prevent transmission is to avoid contact of susceptible persons with turtles and to follow strict hygiene practices to minimize the risk of infection.

In the USA, apart from the restrictions on the sale of small turtles, there are recommendations published by CDC for preventing reptile-associated salmonellosis, which include washing hands after handling reptiles and keeping reptiles away from food and food preparation areas (21).

Conclusions and recommendations:
In conclusion, there is a risk of Salmonella infection linked to contact with turtles, which emphasises the need to give recommendations regarding ownership and handling of aquatic turtles and other reptiles kept as pets by young children. These recommendations can also apply to immunocompromised persons. It would also be appropriate to give information to potential buyers at points of sale about the risk of salmonellosis and measures that can be taken to minimise this risk.

A report of this outbreak with the following recommendations was sent to the public health authorities and the Department of Agriculture in Bizkaia so that preventive measures can be taken.
