Kansas hospital warns patients about hepatitis C
------------------------------------------------
Kansas officials have begun notifying about 460 former Hays Medical Center patients that they may have been exposed to hepatitis C by a traveling hospital technician accused of causing an outbreak of the disease in New Hampshire, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said Friday [20 Jul 2012]. Federal prosecutors in New Hampshire announced Thursday that David Kwiatkowski was charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product. Kwiatkowski allegedly infected patients with hepatitis C while working at a New Hampshire hospital.

KDHE said Friday [20 Jul 2012] in a release that Kwiatkowski also worked in the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Hays Medical Center, HaysMed, from 24 May 2010 through 22 Sep 2010. KDHE and the Hays hospital have begun notifying about 460 patients the lab treated during that time, advising them on how to get free testing for the disease, which is a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver damage and chronic health problems.

"As medical professionals and members of the Hays community, we are deeply concerned by the alleged criminal conduct of this individual in New Hampshire," Dr. John Jeter, president and CEO of HaysMed said in a prepared statement. Kwiatkowski, who grew up in Michigan, worked as a "traveler" sent by staffing agencies to hospitals around the country, usually for temporary jobs. In announcing the federal drug charges in New Hampshire, U.S. Attorney John Kacavas called him a "serial infector" who has worked in at least 6 states since 2007. Authorities have not publicly identified all the other states [but see below].

Kwiatkowski is accused of stealing anesthetic drugs from the lab, injecting himself and contaminating syringes that were later used on patients, 30 of whom have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C that Kwiatkowski carries. Though he told investigators he was diagnosed in May [2012], authorities said there is evidence that he has had the disease since at least June 2010. According to court documents, Kwiatkowski told investigators he did not steal drugs, is "not a shooter," and is scared of needles. He also said he was allergic to fentanyl, the powerful anesthetic he's accused of stealing, though medical records indicate he was given the drug during a medical procedure in 2011.

KDHE said only patients who underwent cardiac catheterization procedures while Kwiatkowski worked there were potentially put at risk. "We understand patients and their loved ones may be very concerned about this situation," KDHE Secretary and State Health Officer Robert Moser said in a statement. "I would like to reassure the public that we have no reason to be concerned about additional risks to the public."

KDHE said Hays patients who were possibly exposed are being contacted by mail with information on how to receive free hepatitis C testing for through KDHE. They're also being told who to contact with questions and concerns.

Man accused of causing hepC outbreak worked in several hospitals
----------------------------------------------------------------
Maryland public health officials say a man accused of causing hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire worked at 4 hospitals in the state. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said Friday [21 Jul 2012] that David Kwiatkowski worked in the state from 2008 to 2010. Kwiatkowski has been infected with the hepatitis C virus since at least June 2010. Officials do not know if there is a potential risk to patients in Maryland.

The 4 hospitals are Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Southern Maryland Hospital, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Maryland General Hospital. Officials say the hospitals will notify patients who underwent certain procedures with instructions on follow-up care.

In announcing federal drug charges Thursday, U.S. Attorney John Kacavas called Kwiatkowski a "serial infector."
