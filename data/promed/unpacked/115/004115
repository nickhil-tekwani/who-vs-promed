New Hampshire health officials said a 2nd worker at a Contoocook restaurant has developed hepatitis A, and that 100 to 200 people might have been exposed to the infection. Public Health Director Dr. Jose Montero said Friday [30 Aug 2013] it's linked to a previous case of a bartender developing hepatitis A at the Covered Bridge Restaurant last month [July 2013].

Montero said the 2nd worker was at the restaurant on [13 Aug 2013] and [20 Aug 2013]. The Health Department recommends that anyone at the restaurant on [20 Aug 2013] should receive vaccine to protect themselves. Anyone at the restaurant on [13 Aug 2013] should be alert to potential symptoms, but it's too late for a vaccine to take effect.

Hepatitis A can be spread when an infected person handles food without appropriate hand hygiene. Symptoms usually come on quickly and may include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine and jaundice. People who develop hepatitis A almost always recover without further complications.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality. According to the World Health Organisation, hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Hepatitis A viruses can persist in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens.

In developed countries with good sanitary and hygienic conditions, infection rates are low. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. In the situation at the Covered Bridge Restaurant in New Hampshire, the risk of infection for patrons will depend on the state of personal hygiene of the restaurant staff. This may not be great in the case of casually employed staff, as may be the case at this restaurant.

In developed countries with good sanitary and hygienic conditions, infection rates are low, but disease may occur among adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, such as injecting-drug users, men who have sex with men, people travelling to areas of high endemicity, and in isolated populations such as closed religious communities.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Nearly 100 percent of people develop protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a single dose of the vaccine. Even after exposure to the virus, a single dose of the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects. Still, manufacturers recommend 2 vaccine doses to ensure a longer-term protection of about 5 to 8 years after vaccination.
