The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating 2 linked cases of psittacosis, a bird-borne disease.

The 1st case involves a previously healthy 51-year-old woman who developed fever, cough, shortness of breath and malaise beginning in late January 2018. She was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital on 11 Feb 2018 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management on the next day. Her condition subsequently improved and she was transferred back to the general medical ward yesterday, 14 Feb 2018. She is now in a serious condition.

The 2nd case involves a 54-year-old man also previously healthy, who is the husband of the 1st patient. He developed fever, headache, and muscle pain since [4 Feb 2018]. He was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital on [12 Feb 2018] and his condition has been stable all along.

The couple's respiratory samples both tested positive for _Chlamydophila psittaci_ [previously referred to as _Chlamydia psittaci_] upon laboratory testing.

The CHP's preliminary investigation revealed that the pair had no recent travel history. However, they reported having visited the Bird Garden in Yuen Po Street, Mong Kok, twice in January 2018 and had purchased a parrot from a bird shop there. The home contacts of the pair remain asymptomatic so far. Officers of the CHP and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department visited the patients' home and the bird shop. Investigations are ongoing.

Psittacosis is a disease caused by bacteria called _C. psittaci_. It is usually transmitted by inhaling the agent from dried droppings or secretions of infected birds. Patients with psittacosis usually present fever, headache, rash, muscle pain, chills, and dry cough. Pneumonia may sometimes occur, and occasional complications include encephalitis, myocarditis, and thrombophlebitis.

The disease can be treated effectively with antimicrobials. The disease is not normally transmitted from person to person.

To prevent psittacosis, people are advised to take the following measures:
- maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
- wear gloves and a surgical mask when handling droppings or secretions of birds;
- wash hands thoroughly after handling birds;
- avoid close contact with birds;
- disinfect bird cages and surfaces contaminated by bird droppings or secretions; and
- seek medical treatment if symptoms develop.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, turkeys, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
