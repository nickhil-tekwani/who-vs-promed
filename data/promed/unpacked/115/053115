Scientists have destroyed the UK's laboratory stocks of a virus that once caused devastating cattle losses.

These stocks accounted for most of the world's lab samples of rinderpest, which were held at The Pirbright Institute in Surrey.

Rinderpest and the deadly smallpox virus are the only diseases to have been eradicated from the face of the Earth.

BBC News had exclusive access to the destruction of the final samples.

Dr Carrie Batten, from The Pirbright Institute, described the moment as "the end of an era".

"Rinderpest was devastating and by removing the stocks that are held globally you are essentially reducing the risk dramatically," she said.

Dr Michael Baron, honorary fellow at the institute, said the end of rinderpest would mark the beginning of a new war on other diseases.

"The success we have achieved with rinderpest has been one of the main drivers for people saying we can do this with other animal diseases and other human diseases such as polio, mumps, and measles. These diseases are eradicable and this should be done," he explained.

The rinderpest virus is responsible for one of the worst catastrophes in history. During an outbreak in the 1890s, it killed between 80% and 90% of cattle in eastern and southern Africa. This caused mass starvation in the region.

Millions of people died as a result. In Ethiopia alone, one-third of the human population was wiped out. The toll in lives was on a scale matched only by the Black Death in Europe.

A vaccination campaign eventually brought the disease under control until it was declared to have been eradicated in the wild in 2011.

But thousands of samples of the virus remained in 40 laboratories across 36 countries. If there happened to be an accident, the disease could potentially leak out and cause devastation once again.

To prevent this, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) approved a few highly secure labs and encouraged other institutes to send their rinderpest samples to these facilities.

Among them is the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, which has led efforts to record the genetic information contained in each sample and then destroy it.

Researchers have been reluctant to destroy lab samples of deadly viruses in case they are needed to create a vaccine should the disease ever re-emerge. But a digital record of the virus's genetic code means that this is no longer an issue.

And so Pirbright has been able to destroy all its samples which account for most of the laboratory rinderpest virus in the world.

Dr Samia Metwally, of the FAO, hopes that Pirbright's success will encourage other holding facilities to follow suit so that it is completely eliminated from the face of the Earth.

"This is a huge step by Pirbright. It sets a precedent for other countries to do the same."

Dr Monique Eloit, the OIE's director-general, told BBC News that she was "very happy" about the development.

"All the work done by farmers, veterinarians, and scientists for such a long time is on track to minimise the risk of the re-emergence of rinderpest," she said.

The government's chief vet, Dr Christine Middlemiss, welcomed the news. "It is such a devastating disease. 100% of susceptible animals become infected and die from the virus. So to have that removed as a threat is fantastic," she said.

[In 2011, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) declared global freedom from rinderpest (RP), formally announcing that RP virus infections had been eliminated from susceptible livestock populations. At the same time, it was recognised that RP virus, and material containing RP virus, remained stored in an unspecified number of facilities across the world. Although natural infections had been eliminated, there remained a risk that rinderpest could reoccur if such infectious material accidentally leaked or was intentionally released from one of these facilities into a susceptible animal population. To minimise this risk, the OIE and FAO, with the support of international partners, set in place a framework to: reduce the quantity of remaining rinderpest-virus-containing material; ensure that such material was only stored in high-security facilities; regulate any handling or manipulation of the virus; maintain vigilance amongst livestock keepers and Veterinary Services in the post-eradication era; and develop contingency plans to deal with any suspected or actual reoccurrence of rinderpest disease.

Vaccines were a centrepiece of many rinderpest control programmes in the past. In the post-eradication era, it was deemed important to have stocks of vaccines ready for use in case there was a reoccurrence of disease. However, there is little commercial incentive to manufacture rinderpest vaccines in a rinderpest-free world while public funds are very limited. Given also that it is not possible to distinguish animals that have been given the rinderpest vaccine from animals that have been previously infected [there is no differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) vaccine or test], trying to find an alternative to attenuated rinderpest virus vaccines was considered a priority. The FAO and the OIE approved in 2015 research into finding such an alternative; the work was based on the old observation that rinderpest virus vaccine can protect sheep and goats against the closely related PPR virus.

It was therefore reasonable to see if attenuated PPR (peste des petits ruminants) virus vaccines, which are produced in large amounts in many countries, could protect cattle against rinderpest. Unfortunately, when the study was carried out, neither of the PPR vaccines tested was able to fully protect the cattle from rinderpest infection (though unattenuated field strains of PPR did protect), meaning that, for the foreseeable future, it will be necessary to keep emergency stocks of rinderpest virus vaccine. An important question will be the location of these stockpiles; one has already been established at AU-PANVAC in Ethiopia, but at least one stockpile needs to be established in Asia, and agreements put in place to govern its use on a regional basis.

To address concerns that destruction of rinderpest virus isolates would lead to the loss of important historical data and biological material which might one day be needed for research (concerns that may discourage destruction of isolates of wild-type rinderpest virus), the OIE has offered to support genetic sequencing of remaining isolates, on condition that the virus stocks are destroyed after they have been sequenced. If for any unforeseen reason it becomes necessary to use rinderpest virus isolates for research in the future, the viruses could be reconstructed using these genetic sequence data. The sequence data could also be used for phylogenetic studies and forensic epidemiology investigations, should there be a reoccurrence of disease. Several approved rinderpest virus holding facilities expressed an interest in engaging with this process, including the Pirbright Institute in the UK which has, as described in the BBC report above, been completed and put into the public domain, joining the already existing virus genome sequence data that had been generated through previous research studies.

In 2016, 5 years after the declaration of global freedom from rinderpest, official reports to the OIE showed that virus and virus-containing material remained stored in 21 countries worldwide in 22 separate facilities, of which only 5 had been inspected and approved for holding rinderpest virus or vaccine. It will be interesting to obtain an update of this situation.
