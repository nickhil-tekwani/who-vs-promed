Is it possible to say whether the H7 strain isolated in the Delaware
outbreak has been classified as highly pathogenic avian influenza, as the
literature states that H7 and H5 subtypes can be of high or low pathogenicity?

[Currently the avian influenza in Delaware is considered low pathogenicity,
but the virus is being carefully monitored. Low pathogenic strains can
mutate to highly pathogenic strains. Consequently, it is beneficial to
eliminate infected flocks, and to closely monitor the virus. - Mod.TG]
