characterization of an influenza virus with potential to become the
precursor of a human pandemic virus.]

Abstract
--------
Although viruses of each of the 16 influenza A HA subtypes are potential
human pathogens, only viruses of the H1, H2, and H3 subtype are known to
have been successfully established in humans. H2 influenza viruses have
been absent from human circulation since 1968, and as such they pose a
substantial human pandemic risk. In this report, we isolate and
characterize genetically similar avian/swine virus reassortant H2N3
influenza A viruses isolated from diseased swine from 2 farms in the United
States. These viruses contained leucine at position 226 of the H2 protein,
which has been associated with increased binding affinity to the mammalian
alpha-2,6Gal-linked sialic acid virus receptor. Correspondingly, the H2N3
viruses were able to cause disease in experimentally infected swine and
mice without prior adaptation. In addition, the swine H2N3 virus was
infectious and highly transmissible in swine and ferrets. Taken together,
these findings suggest that the H2N3 virus has undergone some adaptation to
the mammalian host and that their spread should be very closely monitored.

[The current concentration of attention on the potential of avian influenza
A/H5N1 virus to evolve into a human pandemic pathogen should not divert
attention from the presence in the environment of other potential
precursors of influenza viruses with equal or perhaps greater potential to
become human pandemic pathogens. - Mod.CP]
