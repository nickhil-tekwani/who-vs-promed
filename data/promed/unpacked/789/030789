In order to reduce the development and spread of resistant bacteria and deliver better patient outcomes, healthcare organizations must implement measures to ensure optimal use of antibiotics. Implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program will help organizations reach the goal of providing patients requiring antibiotic treatment with the right antibiotic(s), at the right time, at the right dose, and for the right duration.

The International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) and Pfizer Global Medical Grants have partnered to award USD 1 million for research projects focused on the implementation and/or assessment of antimicrobial stewardship programs in the Latin America region. ISID will oversee the grant application and evaluation process, as well as the proposal review committee that will make funding decisions.

We are seeking innovative quality improvement research, health services research and/or educational research applications that identify and evaluate practices for successfully implementing key elements of antimicrobial stewardship programs within hospitals and other healthcare organizations.

- The following may apply: medical, dental, nursing, allied health, and/or pharmacy professional schools; healthcare institutions (both large and small); professional associations; government agencies; research facilities and other entities with a mission related to healthcare improvement.
