An industrial area of Christchurch [New Zealand] is at the centre of an outbreak of the potentially deadly Legionnaires' disease.

6 adults (4 women and 2 men) have been hospitalised since the beginning of April 2015 after contracting the airborne disease. The cases were linked to a cooling tower in the Hillsborough area, which tested positive for the _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 bacterium on 8 Apr [2015]. Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink said the tower was treated immediately.

3 of the patients lived in the area; 2 were regular visitors and 1 worked in the industrial area bordering the Hillsborough, Woolston and Ferrymead suburbs. Canterbury medical officer of health Ramon Pink urged businesses in the target area to test their cooling towers. Several schools and The Tannery shopping centre are located in the area.

The cases were reported on 1, 8, 9, and 14 Apr and 17 and 25 May 2015. The 2 cases reported in May indicated there may be another source, Pink said.

The affected adults ranged from 49 to 79 years old, and they suffered other health problems. They have been discharged from hospital.

Pink said the public had not been notified of the cluster until Friday [12 Jun 2015] because risk to those living or working in the area was low. "There'd be more danger driving your car than there would be [contracting] Legionella's disease [sic] in this situation." He urged businesses in the area to sample and treat their cooling towers and evaporative condensers.

Health officials and the Christchurch City Council were working with representatives from the air conditioning industry to contact businesses in Hillsborough to ensure water-based cooling systems were being property maintained.

The pneumonia-like infection is usually caught by inhaling potting mix or from exposure to contaminated water in plumbing systems, air-conditioning units or cooling towers. "The _Legionella_ bacteria can live in water-based cooling systems and can become dangerous when airborne. Businesses with these systems need to regularly sample and, where necessary, treat them to prevent the bacteria from circulating," Pink said.

Symptoms include coughing, fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, vomiting, headaches and diarrhoea.

Pink said 18 cases of Legionnaires' disease had been reported in Canterbury this year. This cluster was "unseasonal", as it was not related to gardening, he said.

In 2013, 2 elderly people required hospitalisation after contracting Legionnaires' disease from the same spa pool at a Hokitika motel. 12 people contracted the disease in Canterbury in 3 weeks in late 2012; 1 person died; 11 cases were caused by exposure to harmful bacteria while using compost or potting mix; 1 case was caused by bacteria in a cooling system. At the time, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Alistair Humphrey said the cases were not linked "other than it's springtime and they've been working in their gardens".

In December 2011, a Christchurch mother of 3 died from the disease after contracting pneumonia from the bacteria in compost or potting mix. The 62-year-old felt unwell for 10 days prior to her death on Boxing Day. Earlier in 2011, a 62-year-old man died from the disease in Christchurch Hospital. Legionnaires' disease killed 4 people in Canterbury in 2010.

[The news report above says that the suspected source for the Christchurch outbreak was a cooling tower that was remediated soon after positive test results for this tower came back on 8 Apr 2015. Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. If the remediation was successful, this cooling tower could not be the source for at least the 2 cases that were reported on 17 May and 25 May 2015.

We do not have information concerning the species of _Legionella_ nor genotypes of _Legionella_ isolated from patients and the genotype of the environmental isolate of _L. pneumophila_ in the current outbreak. A single species with the same genotype in the patient isolates would suggest a common source, which could be matched to genotypes of the environmental isolates. Frequently, however, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens, genotyping of clinical isolates would be not, of course, possible. More information about this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease and, in particular, the association of legionellosis in New Zealand and Australia with _L. longbeachae_ and use of potting soil, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - New Zealand: (CA) potting soil, alert 20110116.0189.

Non-sterilized potting soil apparently contains a mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae, and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).

The Canterbury region of New Zealand is located on the South Island; its main city is Christchurch.
