More information about this outbreak is needed, specifically the type
of _Clostridium botulinum_ involved. That being said, outbreaks
involving numerous horses like this are typically due to type C
botulism. The source of toxin is generally a carcass of a rodent or a
cat (in which the organism is growing) that contaminated the hay or
food supplied to the animals. It is very unlikely that _C. botulinum_
would germinate, grow and produce toxin in snow melt or in hay
without a carcass or other protein source present. One contaminated
carcass can generate sufficient toxin to kill a large number of
animals. For example, one cat carcass that contaminated a mixed
ration caused the death of over 400 dairy cows in California in 1998
(Galey et al., 2000. J. Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation
12:204-209). If other animals nearby are also affected by botulism,
as indicated in this report, a common food source should be looked for.

[Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by the neurotoxins of
_Clostridium botulinum_ and in rare cases, _Clostridium butyricum_
and _Clostridium barati._ These gram-positive spore-forming anaerobes
can be found in soil samples and marine sediments throughout the
world. _Clostridium botulinum_ is a soil bacterium. The spores can
survive in most environments and are very hard to kill and may be
acquired by grazing animals, especially in pastures with very short
or little to no readily available grass.

_Clostridium botulinum_ is the bacterium that produces the toxin.
While it is true that there is generally a source such as a rodent or
some other animal that is the nidus of providing a good medium for
growing the bacterium that produces the toxin, there does not always
have to be such a source.

Type A _C. botulinum_ predominates in soil samples from the western
regions, while type B is the major type found in eastern areas. While
type C usually affects large animals (cattle, horses), this may not
always be the case. Type C and D are not well absorbed by the
gastrointestinal tract.

It would be helpful if the veterinarian and laboratory involved could
confirm the type of botulism involved. Clearly, a veterinarian and
lab were involved if the people received the appropriate antitoxin to
treat the horses.
