[Several cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have been recently diagnosed in humans in Uganda's south-western province Kabale, bordering Rwanda. Traditionally, RVF is known to cause a severe disease in ruminants, with mortality rates in juvenile ruminants, particularly lambs and kids, known to exceed 50 percent and in newborn animals even significantly higher. The main symptom in adult animals is abortion. Human disease follows the disease in animals by exposure to infected animal tissues such as aborted foeti, placentae, organs and blood, as well as by arthropod vectors transmitting the virus from the viraemic animals to human victims.

Antibodies in humans were reported in Uganda in 1936. During the period 1944-1967, RVF virus was isolated from mosquitoes and humans. In 1968, a limited epidemic was reported in humans. A cross-sectional study published in 2013 reported serological evidence in goats in Sembabule, Mpigi, Masaka and Mubende districts of Uganda.
