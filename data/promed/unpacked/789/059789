TOTAL NUMBER OF DEAD ADULT SEA LIONS UNKNOWN
Nick Gales said it appeared the main cause of pup death on Enderby Island
was now starvation although some disease deaths were still occurring, while
on Dundas the main cause seemed to be the mystery cause being investigated.

Mr. Donoghue said the deaths of adult sea lions, especially the females or
cows, was a greater concern as the remaining sea lion pups would die from
starvation if their mothers did not return with food for them, in addition
to losing potentially pregnant females. Cows usually left their pups while
they foraged for food for up to three to five days, so it was difficult to
know when or if the mothers would return.
At Davies Point on Campbell Island, 24 dead pups had been found and two of
six adult females there appeared to have symptoms.
About 95 percent of the sea lions breed on two small islands, Dundas and
Enderby, which are part of the Auckland Islands group.
Minister of Conservation Nick Smith said a decision to review the sea lion
bycatch from the squid fishery, will be made when further information on
the cause of the deaths is known later in the month.
No results were expected immediately from the postmortem examinations. DOC
would release final results when they were received.
Mr. Donoghue said the three most likely possible causes of the deaths were
a virus, a bacteria or a biotoxin, although it could be weeks before any
definite results were available.
For further information, please contact Nicola Patrick, Department of
Conservation Public Awareness Unit on 04-4713117 or 025-571503.
Unless there is a major development, the next update will be on Monday, 9
February.
