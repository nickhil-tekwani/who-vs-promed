The following data are abstracted from Gideon and the Gideon e-book series. [1] Charts were created using an interactive tool driven by over 30 000 base graphs in the program. [2] (see charts at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/05/04/tick-and-mosquito-borne-diseases-trends-in-the-united-states/)

Chart 1 contrasts trends for reported incidence of Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). Note that while rates of Lyme disease in 2016 are 15-fold those reported in 1987, those of RMSF increased by a factor of 7. The number of fatal cases for both diseases has remained similar in recent years (i.e., the relative case-fatality rate of Lyme disease has decreased).

Chart 2 summarizes incidence data for a variety of tick-borne and mosquito-borne infections. Note that rates of Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, Babesiosis, Jamestown Canyon virus infection and Powassan encephalitis have increased since the year 2000. The incidence of LaCrosse encephalitis has decreased, while that of California encephalitis is largely unchanged.

Charts 3 and 4 demonstrate that incidence and reported deaths for Western equine encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile fever have changed little in recent years.

Chart 1 on the right shows data on Lyme disease mortality. However, Lyme disease is very rarely a cause of death in the U.S. For example, in a study of death certificates, Lyme disease was listed as an underlying or multiple cause of death on 114 death records during 1999-2003. Upon review, the investigators found only one record was consistent with clinical manifestations of Lyme disease (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/52/3/364/307928).

Cardiac involvement in Lyme disease associated with conduction disturbances is uncommon and can very rarely cause sudden death (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864163 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6249a1.htm https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6343a4.htm). In a study of 121 894 cases reported to the CDC during 1995-2013 (120 198 cases with any form of Lyme disease and 1696 cases with carditis specified), 702 (0.6 percent) died from all causes within a year of Lyme disease diagnosis. The observed all-cause mortality for these 121 894 patients is below the predicted age-adjusted, all-cause mortality for this population based on national, age-adjusted death rates. Two of these deaths (0.002 percent of the total) were classified as suspected cases of Lyme carditis-associated mortality after review of available clinical information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779475/).

[Interestingly, the graph shows that cases of both Powassan and Jamestown Canyon virus infections have increased somewhat in the recent 10 years. Climate change may be affecting the distribution of tick-borne Powassan (and its blacklegged tick variant) and the mosquito vectors of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV). In coming years, it will be interesting to see if the northward expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, increases the distribution of JCV well. This mosquito is susceptible to infection with JCV and can transmit it. It is also susceptible to La Crosse virus (LACV), which was isolated from that mosquito in Tennessee. Experimentally, it has been shown that all 6 recombinants of LACV X JCV can result in _Ae. albopictus_ dually infected with these viruses. Not only can the geographic expansion of _Ae. albopictus _ occur in the future, the distribution of JCV and LCV may accompany that expansion and a new group of recombinant virus might emerge. - Mod.TY]
