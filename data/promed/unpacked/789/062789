More than 200 [214 Vietnamese have died from dengue fever in the first
eight months of this year, nearly double the number in the same period in
1997, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. [ProMED-mail reported on 21
August that 186 people had died in this epidemic and that the number of
cases was 84,500. - Mod.CHC
Health officials said the 214 deaths compared to 112 for the same period
last year. The number of infections nationwide has soared 121% to 99,151
cases, an official said, adding that adverse weather was largely to blame.
The shortage of rainfall, especially in the south of Vietnam this year, has
turned rivers into pools and created ideal circumstances for the breeding
of mosquitoes which transmit the disease.
Careless storage of water due to the drought also enabled the insects to
reproduce more rapidly than usual, a World Health Organization official
said.
The problem has been exacerbated by the recent movement of people to the
cities, which lack sufficient clean water outlets and force people to store
water in open containers.

[The suggestion that the dry conditions that have led to lower river levels
and better conditions for the breeding of the mosquitoes that carry the
viruses that cause this disease sounds good but is not correct. The
_Aedes_ species that transmit dengue viruses are container breeders,
although every once in a while one of them probably breeds somewhere else.
Blaming this explosive situation on uncontrollable conditions might appear
to be a nice out but it won't hold water. The comment by the WHO official
is more correct. - Mod.CHC
