The deaths of dozens of birds in downtown Austin earlier [in January 2007]
were caused by parasites and a drop in temperature, animal health experts
said on Thursday. Avian pathologists at Texas A&M University examined 9 of
the birds and concluded they died of natural causes.
When the 63 birds were found on 8 Jan 2007, it caused a minor panic --
Congress Avenue was closed, dozens of businesses were shuttered, and the
mystery became national news.
"We did not find any evidence that there was a public health problem,
either from a poison or from an infectious disease," said Dr Lelve Gayle,
the executive director of the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory. "These birds were heavily parasitized by multiple species of
parasites," Gayle said. "These birds were sick."
Officials had suspected poisoning, and their investigation continues. City
Manager Toby Futrell, briefed on the A&M results, said health officials
were awaiting test results from other agencies before announcing the cause
of death. "There is no reason to believe the A&M results are not going to
be right," she said. "The bottom line is that they have a negative test for
poison."
Futrell said she did not know when the other test results would be
complete. City health officials would not comment Thursday night.
Gayle said a sudden temperature drop from the 50s to the 40s contributed to
the birds dying at about the same time.
There was no indication the birds were poisoned. "Normally when you have
birds that have been poisoned, you find food in their stomachs," Gayle
said. "And we found no food in their stomachs."

[It is not uncommon for illnesses and weather to overwhelm a bird,
resulting in death. With only 63 dead birds, out of some perhaps 5000 in
the same area, this does not give the impression of poison or avian influenza.
