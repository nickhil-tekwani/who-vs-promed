FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory contract report, July-September 2010,
Foot-and-Mouth Disease: summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asia
Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey
---------------------------------------
The O-PanAsia-2 and A-Iran-05 lineages continue to dominate in these
countries. The PanAsia-2 lineage has been subdivided into 6
sub-lineages named BAL-09, YAZ-09, FAR-09, SAN-09, ANT-10, and
PUN-10. During 2010, the ANT-10 sub-lineage has become dominant in
Iran and Turkey. This sub-lineage has been detected in Pakistan, but
not yet in Afghanistan.

PR China
--------
3 further outbreaks of FMDV type O occurred in July and August 2010,
bringing the total to 17:
- 27 Jul 2010: Chengdong village, Shan Dan, Zhang Ye, Gansu (pigs);
- 23 Aug 2010: Huangzangsi, Qilian, Habei Prefecture, Qinghai (cattle);
- 23 Aug 2010: Animal health inspection station of Er Ba Tai, Ku Che,
Akesu, Xinjiang (cattle).

No information concerning the genotyping of viruses from these
outbreaks is yet available.

Taiwan ROC
----------
As the result of a routine serological survey using an NSP Elisa, 8
pigs in a herd of 1428, at Sinwu Township, T'ao-Yuan (10 Aug 2010)
were found to be positive for FMDV antibodies. The pigs were all
clinically healthy and attempts at virus isolation and RT-PCR were
all unsuccessful.

Japan
-----
The last (292nd) outbreak of FMD occurred on 4 Jul 2010 at Miyazaki
city 3, Miyazaki. One of 16 cattle showed clinical signs and was
confirmed as having type O. No outbreaks have occurred since. [On 5
Oct 2010, Japan submitted to the OIE its follow-up report on FMD,
declaring the outbreak resolved as of 5 Jul 2010. The report included
the following comment: "Since, on 6 Oct 2010, 3 months will have
passed after the destruction of the last case, Japan will shortly
apply to the OIE for recovery of status "Freedom from Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD) without vaccination", providing the dossier required to
be evaluated by the Scientific Commission for Animal Disease (SCAD),
in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code". - Mod.AS]

Mongolia
--------
2 new outbreaks of FMDV type O occurred on 26 Aug 2010 at Sukhbaatar
soum, Baga-3 Gun jalga, Sukhbaatar in sheep and goats, and on 2 Sep
2010 at Teeliin bulag, Tsagaanchuluut baga, Chuluunhoroot soum,
Dornod in cattle. All outbreaks this year [2010] (n=5) have been in
the east of the country. [Reportedly, on 7 Nov 2010 the virus spread
to a 3rd province, Khentii, affecting cattle. Genotyping Report of
2010 isolates from Mongolia (batch WRLFMD/2010/00033) is currently
available online. It includes the respective genotyping results of 8
strains collected from cattle in Sep 2010, of which 6 from the
province Dornod and 2 from Sukhbaatar. All were found to be FMDV-O,
topotype SEA, Strain Mya-98 (similar to 2010 strains from Hong Kong
SAR, Republic of Korea, Japan, and Russia). For each isolate, 10
"most Closely Related Viruses" and 10 "Most Closely Related Reference
Viruses" are tabled. The report includes also a dendogram (graphical
phylogeny reconstruction) comparing the 8 said isolates with other
isolates of similar strain and topotype. The report, dated 26 Oct
2010 (but published, following confirmation, during this week of 15
Nov 2010), is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-00033%20O%20Mongolia%202010.pdf>.

Russian Federation
------------------
2 outbreaks of FMDV type O occurred on 5 Jul 2010 at Abagaytuy,
Zabajkal'skij Kray and on 26 Aug 2010 at Village Makarovo,
Shilkinsky, Zabajkal'skij Kray. Both outbreaks involved cattle and
pigs. Complete VP1 sequences of viruses from both outbreaks were
submitted to the WRLFMD by ARRIAH. The sequences indicated that both
viruses belonged to the SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage, however, the
virus from the July 2010 outbreak was most closely related to viruses
from Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Japan, while the virus
from the August 2010 outbreak was closely related to a virus sequence
from recent outbreaks in Mongolia, indicating different origins for
the 2 outbreaks (a detailed analysis is to be found in the document
at the above URL. - Mod.AS]

Africa
Botswana
--------
An outbreak of FMD caused by the SAT 2 serotype occurred in 200/349
cattle at Lesoma, Chobe, Kasane between 26 Jul 2010 and 20 Sep 2010.
Lesoma is a village located in the northeast of Botswana close to the
borders with Zimbabwe and Namibia. Samples have been typed at the
Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE's Reference Laboratory) and
genotyping results are awaited.

Namibia
-------
An outbreak of FMD, which was reported previously (9 Apr 2010) on
Impalila island, Kabbe constituency, Caprivi, was confirmed by the
OVI [Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa] as being
caused by SAT 1. It is suspected that transmission of FMDV occurred
from wild African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) resident in the area.

Mozambique
----------
4 outbreaks of FMD were reported in cattle in the south of the
country (Gaza province) on 24 Sep 2010. Samples were submitted to the
OVI and results are awaited. It is thought that FMD originated from
infected cattle moved from Chicualacuala District (close to the
Zimbabwe border) to Bilene and Chokwe Districts (which are located
further south in Mozambique).

South Africa
------------
An outbreak of FMD occurred in 19/80 cattle on 6 Aug 2010 at Malati,
Ba-Phalaborwa, Limpopo in the FMD Protection Zone adjacent to the
Kruger National Park. No typing results have yet been reported by the
OVI.

Zimbabwe
--------
The FMD situation following 4 outbreaks of SAT 2 between May and June
[2010], at Mangwe, Matebeleland South, is unclear. Animals are
suspected to have been in contact with previously infected animals
during a previous outbreak that occurred in September 2009 at a
feedlot in the area.

South America
Venezuela
---------
Panaftosa [Pan American Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease] reported
the presence of FMD type A in Venezuela in July 2010.


Uncharacterised FMD viruses
A number of other outbreaks have occurred where samples have not been
sent to the WRLFMD. It is probable that the countries involved have
performed their own genetic characterisation; however, through the
OIE/FAO laboratory network we would also like to encourage the
submission of samples (or complete VP1 sequences) to the WRLFMD.

An up-to-date list and reports of FMD viruses characterised by
sequencing can be found at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010.htm>.

WRLFMD vaccine recommendations have not changed from the previous
report [see Annex 3 in the document at the source URL above. - Mod.AS]
