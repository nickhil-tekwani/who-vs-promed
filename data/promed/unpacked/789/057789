Study finds type of cancer in dogs contagious
---------------------------------------------
Scientists in England reported on Friday [11 Aug 2006] in the new
issue of U.S. journal Cell they have gathered definitive evidence
that a kind of cancer in dogs is contagious. Although no human cancer
is known to spread naturally from person to person, the finding of
such a disease in dogs -- and emerging evidence that a different
contagious cancer is spreading among marsupials in Tasmania [see
ProMED-mail references below. - Mod.CP] -- is a reminder, said
scientists from University College London.
A cancer cell is usually an animal's or person's own cell that --
because of exposure to a virus or other environment agent -- has
broken free of normal growth controls. Cancer-causing viruses may
spread from person to person, but the cancer does not. But the dog
cancer, known as Sticker's sarcoma, is spread by tumor cells getting
passed from dog to dog through sex or from animals biting or licking
each other. "It is clearly a dog tumor cell behaving absolutely like
a parasite," said Robin Weiss, lead researcher. Weiss called the
tumor transmission trick "a curiosity of nature."
Scientists have suspected for decades that Sticker's cancer was being
passed directly from dog to dog, but doubts persisted because no
other naturally transmitted cancers were known. Weiss and his
colleagues did genetic studies on the tumor cells from 40 dogs with
Sticker's sarcoma, collected from 5 continents. The researchers
showed that the cells are not genetically related to the dogs they
are in -- proof that they did not arise from the dogs' own cells.
They also showed that all the tumor cells, no matter where they were
collected, are clones of each other. That is, they are all progeny of
the same parent cell. Further genetic studies suggested that the
parent cell probably arose in a domesticated dog of Asian origin --
perhaps a husky -- hundreds of years ago, and perhaps more than 1000
years ago. Since then, the cancer has perpetuated itself by jumping
from one dog to another.
Robert A. Weinberg, a pioneer in the genetic underpinnings of cancer
at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, said he was not
surprised to learn that genetic studies had confirmed that Sticker's
is a transmissible cancer, given the strength of earlier clues. But
he agreed that the phenomenon raises difficult questions about why
more cancers do not spread this way.

The summary reads: "The transmissible agent causing canine
transmissible venereal tumor is thought to be the tumor cell itself.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic markers including major
histocompatibility (MHC) genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood samples.
In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its host.
Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived
from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into 2 subclades.
Phylogenetic analyses indicate that canine transmissible venereal
tumor most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of
dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although canine transmissible
venereal tumor is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable
genotype. During progressive growth, canine transmissible venereal
tumor down-modulates MHC antigen expression. Our findings have
implications for understanding genome instability in cancer, natural
transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of a somatic cell to
evolve into a transmissible parasite."
This research confirms that the infectious agent of canine
transmissible venereal tumor is the cancer cell itself and that the
tumor is clonal in origin. These findings have implications for
understanding the relationship between genome instability and
transmissible cancer and for conservation biology, canine genomics,
and companion animal medicine. Fortunately no human equivalent of
this form of transmissible cancer appears to exist, but it may be far
from unique. The enigmatic "Facial Tumor Disease" affecting a species
of marsupial in Tasmania (for photographs of these animals see

which 1st emerged in the 1990's, may be another example (see
