From the beginning of the year [1-28 Jan 2011], the Ministry of
Health tallied 26 034 dengue cases in the country. This total is
preliminary, since the states and municipalities have not forwarded
all relevant data for the 1st month of the year. There are more than
100 serious [dengue] cases and 12 deaths suspected due to the disease
that are under investigation. Of these deaths under investigation, 5
occurred in the north (4 in Amazonas and 1 in Roraima), 3 in the
northeast (2 in Ceara and one in Pernambuco), 3 in the southeast (2 in
Espirito Santo and one in Minas Gerais) and one in the central-east
(in Mato Grosso).
According to this partial total, the northern region of the country
had the greatest number of cases during this period; there were 10 471
notifications, with Acre state having 6851 cases. Next were the
southeast (7094 cases), central-west (5045), northeast (2240 and south
(1184).
In the southeast, most of the cases were registered in Minas Gerais
(3058), followed by Espirito Santo (2205), Rio de Janeiro state (923)
and Sao Paulo state (908).
Data provided by some states this Fri (11 Feb 2011) show a scenario
very different from the preliminary totals of the Ministry of Health.
Minas Gerais gave a total of 6639 reported cases up to now.
The state Secretariat of Health of Rio de Janeiro also reported today
[11 Feb 2011] that from 2 Jan-5 Feb [2011], 3582 suspected dengue
cases were reported.
Currently, the state of Sao Paulo announced today [11 Feb 2011] that
the municipalities in Sao Paulo reported, up to the present, 571
autochthonous cases (with transmission within the state) of the
disease in January [2011].

[Timely case reporting is challenging, especially from a large country
with widely distributed dengue cases such as Brazil. There is
doubtless underreporting, as many infected individuals without serious
symptoms or located far away from health services do not seek medical
attention, or are unable to.

- Brazil (Rio de Janeiro state). 10 Feb 2011. Alexandre Chieppe,
Director of Epidemiological Service of the Department of Health, said
that in the past month (January 2011), 3582 dengue cases were
registered compared to 1447 in January 2010. Chieppe said that the
increase is mainly due to the appearance of dengue (virus) serotype 1,
which has been practically absent in the state. As a result, the
residents of the state have no immunity (to that virus serotype) as
they have to dengue (virus) types 2 and 3, the most common in the state.
