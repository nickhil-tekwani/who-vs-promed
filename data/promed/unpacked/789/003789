The 1st 2 cases of a hantavirus [infection] have been reported this
year [2009] in the Chaco [region], both from Presidente Hayes, one
with a fatal outcome. Meanwhile, surveillance in the La Patria area
continues where, last year [2008] there was an outbreak with a series
[of cases] of this disease [see ProMED-mail archives below].

The people affected in these 1st 2 cases of this year [2009] in the
Chaco are 2 men, a 37-year-old from Tte. Esteban Martinez, and a
30-year-old from Nueva Mestre who died. Both were workers on farms in
Presidente Hayes.

Dr Silvio Ortega, director of the XVII Health Region of Boqueron,
reported that although no cases have been recorded so far this year
[2009], there is continuous surveillance in the La Patria area, where
last year [2008] there was an outbreak of a hantavirus [infection]
with chain [serial] transmission among 9 people, of whom 4 died.

The virus is spread through the urine and fecal material of rodents
(_Calomys laucha_) and transmission occurs through inhalation of dust
while moving objects that are contaminated [with virus]. This is an
acute infection that causes respiratory difficulties, which can lead
to death.

There are also studies that have detected hantavirus in the saliva of
humans, that is to say transmission might occur from person to
person. According to official records, from 2005-2007, there were 56
cases positive for hantavirus [infection] with 12 deaths.

In central Chaco, hantavirus [infections] have been recorded since
1987 and local sources speak of more than 200 infected [people] in
the past 20 years with 30 deaths. Also, cases have occurred in
Caaguazu, San Pedro, and Itapua [departments].

In order to control the disease, rodents must be controlled inside
and outside the house.

_Calomys laucha_ reproduces according to the quantity of food within
as well as outside cropland and with a loss of biological equilibrium
from the elimination of its natural enemies, such as owls and snakes.

[The small vesper mouse, _Calomys laucha_, is the principal rodent
host for Laguna Negra hantavirus in central Chaco of western
Paraguay. This virus has also been found in lowland Bolivia and
western Brazil. Laguna Negra virus has also been detected in _Calomys
callosus_ and _Akodon simulator_ in northern Argentina. I am not
aware of any confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission of
Laguna Negra virus as it has been for Andes hantavirus.

The article above is another example of the popular press reporting
cases as if there was just one hantavirus involved in human disease
in South America, when, in fact, there are several. However,
determining which hantavirus is involved in these cases requires a
sophisticated virology laboratory.

The Chaco region of western Paraguay includes the departments of Alto
Paraguay, Boqueron, and Presidente Hayes, which can be located on the
