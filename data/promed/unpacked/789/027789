Suspected Skin Anthrax Cases Reported in Italy
----------------------------------------------
Though local health officials stressed that any links with terrorism had
been ruled out, 2 Italians from the northern region of Lombardy were
undergoing tests Sunday for suspected skin anthrax.
A 50-year-old farmer from Bergamo near Milan was admitted to hospital last
week, believed to be suffering from a mild form of skin anthrax. Hospital
officials said that the farmer probably contracted the disease from one of
his animals and was responding well to treatment.
The second suspected case concerned a 23-year-old immigrant from Senegal,
who was admitted to a Como hospital 3 days ago. The man is being treated
with antibiotics while doctors wait for the results of tests for anthrax.

Here's what I have learnt from my colleague Antonio Lavazza in Brescia
(Lombardy).
The immigrant from Senegal seems to suffer from a pustular dermatitis, not
from skin anthrax.
As regards the farmer in Bergamo, no confirmatory test results are
available at present. As regards the source of infection (the direct
contact with a contaminated carcass), during the last week the regional
Veterinary Institute (IZS) has not received any animal sample for anthrax
cultures. I wouldn't be surprised if it is skin anthrax. [Though] the
incidence in northern Italy may be insignificant, still there's plenty of
contaminated pastures.

[Many thanks, Antonio, for the prompt and informative reply. It seems that
this report has stimulated a lot of concern within the country. The areas
in Italy with endemic anthrax in the livestock are south of Rome, and in
Sicily and Sardinia. - Mod.MHJ]
