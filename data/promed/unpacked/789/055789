How_Echinococcus multilocularis_ was established on Svalbard, Norway
------------------------------------------------------
I am [one of the scientists who, with my Norwegian colleagues Rolf Ims and
Nigel Yoccoz, found _Echinococcus multilocularis_ on Svalbard in 1999. I
would like to make some additional comments to the ProMED [ProMED-mail
posting August 30 based on information from the BBC.
Svalbard island group is situated in the Arctic Ocean, some 1000 km north
of the northern coast of Norway. Just to be sure for readers not familiar
with the geography of northern Europe, _E. multilocularis_ is not found on
the Fennoscandian mainland.
There are no native rodents on Svalbard. The vole species introduced to
Svalbard is nowadays called _Microtus rossiaemeridionalis_, the common name
is sibling or eastern vole and the species has a wide distribution in
eastern Europe. The species had been introduced to several Russian mining
towns (mining is allowed to [for the countries that have signed the
Svalbard Treaty), but as far as is known now, only the vole population at
Grumant, some 20 km from Longyearbyn, the capital of Svalbard, has survived.
This population inhabits a slope under bird cliffs with huge seabird
populations that fertilize the slope below, thus contributing to the rich
growth of grasses not found elsewhere. The vole population is mainly
regulated by irregular formation of ice layer on the slope in early winter.
During high densities voles are known to disperse to Longyearbyn, and e.g.
in autumn 1999 voles were found on dogyards at Longyearbyn, thus being
potentially able to infect sled dogs there.
The arctic fox, the main host of _E. multilocularis_ in the Arctic, is
common on Svalbard. As [is known, arctic foxes can migrate long distances,
and obviously there are movements between Svalbard, Novaja Zemlja and
Taimyr Peninsula. In the Siberian Arctic, _E. multilocularis_ is common,
and it is possible that with migrating arctic foxes the parasite could
often have come to Svalbard, but because of the lack intermediate hosts
(voles and lemmings), the local life cycle has not been possible. Only
after [the introduction [of sibling voles, [has the local life cycle has
been established on Svalbard. _E. multilocularis_ was common in sibling
voles at Grumant both in 1999 and 2000.
In the present world with all kinds of accidental introductions of exotic
species, this is an interesting example on how a dangerous parasite can
establish itself to a new area after accidental introduction of an
intermediate host. The Svalbard story will be properly published.
The moderator mentioned only the Japanese human population screening, but
there have been others in Central Europe, and in those studies the
proportion of clinical cases out of seropositives has been higher (see refs
at the end).
I was left a bit confused by the moderator's comment that human screening
on Svalbard would lead to confusion. I think the logic of Norwegian
authorities is the opposite. Antibody screening would calm down the worries
among local people, and [the possible few seropositive cases could be
further studied by the modern ultrasound/tomography methods for the
presence of permanent infection. As known from central European studies,
[the majority of seropositive humans have no clinical disease. The
moderator asked what to tell to these people. I think it would be a great
relief to these people to know that in spite of the past infection having
induced antibodies, the parasite has not been able to establish a permanent
infection. The Norwegian authorities should be acknowledged for their
efforts and responsibility.

[Thank you very much for an authoritative update on the background. The key
message is "this is an interesting example on how a dangerous parasite can
establish itself to a new area after accidental introduction of an
intermediate host".
Professor Henttonen refers to 2 studies on serological screening. In the
1994 paper 7 884 persons were investigated for _E. multilocularis_ specific
antibodies and 289 were positive and were retested. In the retest, 152 were
positive and 140 underwent clinical examination and ultrasound/computerized
tomography of the liver and 12 cases were found. These results are very
close to the Japanese results where the end result was that approximately
5% of seropositives had clinical disease. It is important to realize that
imaging of the liver has a lower resolution so a normal
ultrasound/computerized tomography does not rule out infection.
The second study reports screening with ultrasound and a variety of
antigens in Bavaria, Germany. Two cases were found by ultrasound screening
of which one was totally seronegative (but only positive by PCR on biopsy
material) and 5 tested positive against at least 2 antigens. The conclusion
must still be that the predictive value of a positive test is at best
uncertain and will lead to repeated testing of people. Perhaps the
conclusion should be that until the serological tests are better,
population screening should be restricted to ultrasound alone. -Mod. EP
