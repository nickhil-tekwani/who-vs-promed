More people infected with anthrax
---------------------------------
A total of 9 more people have been infected with anthrax in Sirajganj
and Pabna, the health officials confirmed on Tuesday [31 May 2011].

In Sirajganj, M. (10), A.I. (25), and R.H. (26), of Mohonpur Satbila
village in Ullapara were diagnosed with the disease Monday [30 May
2011] evening while A. (60), of Mohonpur Satbila village and R. (4),
and B. (7), of Sharatoil villages in Shahjadpur upazila on Tuesday.

The 6 people have contracted anthrax as locals slaughtered a sick cow
a few days back and distributed the meat among the villagers, Ram
Chandra Saha, sanitary officer of Sirajganj Civil Surgeon office, told
The Daily Star. He said a 3-member team of Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), led by Dr Apurba Chakraborty,
has already visited the villages. They collected skin and blood
samples from the infected people, the officer said.

The disease has infected a total of 39 people in Shahjadpur and
Ullapara upazilas since Friday [27 May 2011].

In Pabna, 2 children and a woman were diagnosed with anthrax at Raut
village in Faridpur upazila on Tuesday. M. (11), A.A. (8), and As.A.
(42), were detected with the disease while they were going to take
medical treatment at the upazila health complex in the afternoon. The
people have been suffering from cutaneous anthrax, said Dr Khalilur
Rahman, upazila health and family planning officer. The official told
our Pabna correspondent that the villagers were infected after
processing meat of a sick cow.

[This is clearly a replay of the events of 2009-2010. But it should
be pointed out that it is unusual to see so many young children
afflicted, with 5/9 11 years old or younger. It is sad that these
reports are as a result of human cases. The Livestock Service needs to
be more active and be finding the sick and dead livestock before
moribund animals are slaughtered and butchered.

Something I have said before and is very relevant here, rural human
cases are the fault of the veterinarian and nobody else. They are as a
direct result of access to infected animals that should either never
have got sick thanks to being vaccinated or that the carcass was
identified before anyone butchers it. Sirajganj and Pabna have the
highest density of dairy cattle in Bangladesh and therefore livestock
and human anthrax cases are concentrated in those 2 districts. But
this disease is seen in 15 districts throughout Bangladesh, north to
south, east to west and in the middle. - Mod.MHJ]

More infected with anthrax
--------------------------
A total of 5 more people have been found infected with anthrax at
Shahjadpur Upazila in Sirajganj and Faridpur Upazila in Pabna.

4 people, including 3 women, have been afflicted with the disease in
Saratail village under Kayempur union of Shahjadpur, taking the count
to 46 in Sirajganj district over the last 6 days, a health official
confirmed on Wednesday [1 Jun 2011]. Sanitary inspector of Sirajganj
civil surgeon office Ramchandra Saha said the infected were given
treatment at Shahjadpur Upazila Health Complex.

Civil surgeon Dr Nazim Uddin told bdnews24.com that a 5-member expert
team, led by Dr Apurba Chakrabarty from Dhaka, was working at
Shahjadpur and Ullapara upazilas for the last 2 days to combat
anthrax.

District livestock officer Shafiqul Islam said 5 teams of the Upazila
livestock department and 2 more from Milk Vita, the trade name for
dairy products manufactured by the Bangladesh Milk Producers
Co-operative Union Limited (BMPCUL), were vaccinating cattle in the 2
upazilas. "Moreover, they are conducting campaigns so that the people
don't be panicked over anthrax and slaughter the infected cattle," he
added.

In Pabna, a man has been tested positive for anthrax in Nagdapara
village of Faridpur, raising the count to 10 in the district over the
last 3 days.

Upazila health officer Khalilur Rahman told reporters that 9 more
people were found infected with the disease on 30 and 31 May 2011 in
the same village. An ailing cow was slaughtered in the area on 30 May
2011 and those who processed and consumed the meat got infected with
anthrax, he said. "The patients have been given necessary treatments
and advice," the physician added.

[By my count it is 44 people but there could well be [more] folk
affected but reports are jumbled. It happens when there is a rush of
reporting.
