[It has now been 27 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 13 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases) -- if no cases reported tomorrow, 2 incubation periods will have passed since Wuhan reported its last locally transmitted case. It has now been 37 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 23 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing. The appearance of an occasional locally transmitted case in Inner Mongolia is also of concern for possible low level local transmission having been established there as well. While Inner Mongolia has a large border with Mongolia, there is also a smaller border shared with the Russian Federation where there is extensive transmission ongoing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 874 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 12 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (29 Apr 2020) report. 6 of the newly reported cases are imported (5 in Shanghai and 1 in Fujian) and 6 were locally transmitted (5 in Heilongjiang and 1 in Inner Mongolia). In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 4 days. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1680 imported cases identified.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 25 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 1 was an imported case. There were 6 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 981, and 115 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 205 463 cases, including 27 967 deaths, up from 203 591 cases and 27 682 deaths reported on 29 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 29 and 30 Apr 2020 was 1872 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2086 newly confirmed cases between 28 Apr 2020 and 29 Apr 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 75.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 31.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont, 1 other province (Liguria) has reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 7 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 7 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

In a press conference held today (30 Apr 2020; in Italian, machine trans., edited) data were presented further supporting the reduction of cases but cautioning that the epidemic was far from over:
"'The epidemic curve continues to decrease in the number of both cases and symptoms. The contagion index R0 is below 1 in all regions, a consequence of the measures taken and citizens' adherence to them. But we are still in an epidemic phase,' said the president of the Higher Institute of Health (ISS), Silvio Brusaferro, at the opening of today's press conference on the epidemiological analysis of COVID-19.

"The red areas
"The number of red areas has decreased compared to last week. They are found in 74 Italian municipalities in 7 regions and many of these will be dismantled in the coming days.

"Same trend between immigrants and Italians
"There are 6395 positive COVID-19 cases attributable to individuals of foreign nationality, equal to 5.1 percent of the total. 'The curve of the epidemic is similar in Italians and foreigners -- explained Brusaferro. A further study of this comparison will be presented next week.'

"Deaths and comorbidities
"The highest number of deaths is concentrated in the over 60 population, particularly in the age group 80-89: 10 241, equal to 40.6 percent of all deaths. In most cases, these patients already had 2 (20.9 percent) or 3 or more conditions (63 percent).

"The epidemiological document ISS -- Bruno Kessler Foundation
"In the 2nd part of the press conference, Brusaferro clarified the rationale behind the epidemiological document drawn up by the ISS with the Bruno Kessler Foundation, adopted by the Technical and Scientific Committee, and sent to the Minister of Health: "It is a national study with the aim of analyzing the weight of the various variables, such as production activities and social contacts, in determining the circulation of the virus in the population and assessing the reopening." 'The models will have to be updated and calibrated regionally on the basis of the results obtained.'

"Stefano Merler of the Bruno Kessler Foundation finally explained the model for the evaluation of reopening policies using social contacts and the parameter of the risk of occupational exposure. 'If we opened all schools today, the rate of contagiousness would rise to 1.3 and the situation would be worrying,' Merler underlined. 'In a work that we published in the journal Science -- added the researcher -- we found that children under 15 are 66 percent less susceptible to coronavirus than adults between 15 and 64 years. While adults over 65 are 47 percent more susceptible than adults between 15 and 64. That means that children are almost 4 times less susceptible than the elderly.'"

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes will be on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 94 640 total cases, 6028 deaths
Date: Thu 30 Apr 2020
Source: Jordan Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
http://www.jordantimes.com/news/region/iran-virus-death-toll-surges-past-6000


Iran's health ministry said on Thursday [30 Apr 2020] that 71 new deaths from the novel coronavirus took the country's overall toll past the 6000 mark. "The number of deaths from this disease effectively crossed 6000 today," ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in televised remarks. "Considering that we lost 71 of our countrymen in the past 24 hours, a total of 6028 of those infected with COVID-19 have passed away to date," he added.

He added that another 983 people tested positive for the virus during the same period, bringing the total to 94 640.

More than 75 100 of those infected had already been released from hospital after recovering. Of those still being treated for the disease, 2976 were in critical condition.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki criticised some Iranians for not taking the outbreak seriously. "I have a complaint about some citizens; you are considering the situation to be too normal," Namaki said in televised remarks. "It is true that we had very good results at the height of economic distress, that deaths dropped to double digits and hospitalisations reached minimum, but this does not mean the coronavirus is done with." Namaki also warned that Iran must prepare itself for a "simultaneous heavy wave of COVID-19 and the flu" in the coming autumn and winter.

Iran has shut schools, universities, cinemas, and stadiums among other public spaces since March[2020] to contain the spread of the virus. But since [11 Apr 2020], it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy and lifted restrictions on intercity travel.

Mosques remain closed even as Muslims observe the fasting month of Ramadan. According to Namaki, his ministry is devising health protocols to allow on Friday and group prayers to recommence in cities that have been given the all clear. Group prayers have been banned in the Islamic republic as a high-risk activity since mid-March [2020].

[In the 24 hours from 29 to 30 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 93 657 to 94 640, an increase of 983 compared with 1073 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (29 Apr 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 5957 to 6028, an increase of 71 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 30 Apr 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 9th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, and Russia, having surpassed China. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 095 210, including 63 861 deaths, an increase from 1 046 396 cases and 61 668 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 310 839 (28.4%) cumulative case reports and 4681 (15.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 162 212 as of 1:30 PM on 30 Apr 2020, including 12 571 confirmed deaths and an additional 5295 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2563 -- 8.3% of total), New Jersey (2388 -- 7.8%), Pennsylvania (2271 -- 7.4%), Massachusetts (1940 -- 6.3%), California (1570 -- 5.1%), and Michigan (980 -- 3.2%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. Texas has increased cases and surpassed Louisiana and Connecticut.

Repeating from yesterday (29 Apr 2020), more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, New Jersey, Russia, and Iran as number 10. Number 11 would be Brazil, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Canada, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Canada, 15 Illinois, 16 California, 17 Belgium, 18 Pennsylvania, 19 Michigan, and 20 Netherlands. 7 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between Germany and Turkey.

The US military has confirmed 6962 cumulative cases, with 314 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 8611 cumulative cases and 337 new cases today (30 Apr 2020). There have been 2041 cases reported from federal prisons (164 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 1977 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (104 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1539 cases (106 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1309 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 213 435 [239 639] as compared with 212 917 PCR [236 899] confirmed cases yesterday (29 Apr 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 78.87, a continual slow decrease over the past 23 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 78.87 today (30 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 213 435 [239 639] cases, approximately 116 661 (54.7%) [48.7%] -- an additional 816 cases have been hospitalized and 10 776 (5.0%) [4.5%] an additional 55 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7287311,43. Madrid, Catalonia, and Castile and Leon are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon is located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Castile and Leon to its northwest and Catalonia to its northeast. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Saint Lucia: 17 cases no deaths
Date: Wed 29 Apr 2020
Source: Government of Saint Lucia press release/MOH Saint Lucia
http://www.govt.lc/news/saint-lucia-records-two-new-cases-of-covid-19


As of [28 Apr 2020] the World Health Organization reported a total of 2 954 222 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with 202 597 deaths.

There are now 1 179 607 confirmed cases in the region of the Americas. The affected region includes Dominican Republic (6293), Haiti (74), Barbados (79), Jamaica (305), Cuba (1389), Dominica (16), Grenada (18), Trinidad and Tobago (116), Guyana (74), Antigua and Barbuda (24), Bahamas (80), Saint Vincent and Grenadines (15), Guadeloupe (149), Martinique (175), Puerto Rico (1389), US Virgin Islands (59), and Cayman Islands (70).

On Tuesday [28 Apr 2020], results of 44 samples for persons tested for COVID-19 were received. Of that batch, we received 2 positive results and 42 negative.

The 1st of the 2 positive results is a 54-year-old female, diabetic, who is a direct contact from a previous positive case and has been in isolation from [4 Apr 2020]. She is clinically doing well. The 2nd case is a 20-year-old male, son of a previous confirmed case, who has been in isolation from [4 Apr 2020] and is doing well. It must be noted that both of the new cases are contacts of a confirmed case and have been monitored in quarantine and isolation at the Rodney Bay Public Health Facility from [4 Apr 2020].

Saint Lucia has now recorded a total of 17 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 15 of whom have recovered and been discharged from care. A total of 490 tests have been carried out to date.

We are still implementing our national response to the COVID-19 epidemic and as such, we should collectively remain focused and committed to reducing the spread of this virus. Some individual measures that need to be sustained include hygiene measures such as hand washing and respiratory etiquette, use of homemade face masks, remaining home and away from public places when sick. Also, ensure personal hygiene and keep homes and office spaces clean.

The population most at risk would require special considerations to keep them safe and healthy. This includes ensuring control of chronic conditions, staying at home as much as possible, and facilitating the services to them as needed.

The Ministry of Health will continue to remain vigilant and maintain the capacity for early detection, aggressive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, testing, and treatment capacity. We will continue to keep you informed in a timely manner. We have expanded the testing protocols to cover persons with respiratory symptoms within the communities, which will continue today and over the weekend.

The Ministry of Health continues active surveillance for COVID-19 but in the interim, we ask all to remain guarded. If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms go to the nearest respiratory clinic or call one of our telemedicine physicians for guidance. If there is the need for any general information on COVID you may call our 311 information hotline from 7 am to 12 midnight daily. All these telephone services are free to the public.

The Ministry of Health and Wellness will continue to provide the public with regular updates on COVID-19. For more information please contact the Office of the Chief Medical Officer or the Epidemiology Unit, at 468-5309/468-5317 respectively

[It is interesting to see how a small island nation is approaching the pandemic on its shores. According to Worldometer, the estimated population of St Lucia as of 30 Apr 2020 is 183 486. The country has chosen to do intense contact tracing with testing, as well as isolation of contacts for the quarantine period, and so far has been successful. - Mod.MPP
