The Government's top advisers on foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been
drawing up secret plans to vaccinate animals to combat the disease.
The special interdepartmental scientific committee chaired by Professor
David King, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, has commissioned the
plan to try to stop a fresh epidemic breaking out while sheep are moved off
the hills to lowland farms for winter grazing.
During the autumn 5 million animals are expected to be moved.
The Army moved into Northumberland to organize the slaughter and disposal
of thousands of sheep and cattle after the latest outbreak in the Allendale
area. The number of confirmed cases since the epidemic began last February
is expected to exceed 2000 early this week.
Gareth Davies, a member of the committee and the former head of the
epidemiology unit at the official Central Veterinary Laboratory, was asked
to start drawing up the plans in July. The committee has given itself until
the end of this month to finalize those plans.
The move, which would propose a separate vaccination package for each
region to address differences in the way sheep are moved in different
areas, is the latest sign pressure is building for a U-turn in the
Government's FMD strategy.
Reportedly, ministers are prepared to authorize a limited program of
vaccination in 6 weeks, if the disease has not been eradicated by then.
The entire scientific committee now supports vaccination after formerly
skeptical members changed their minds. It is now only blocked by Dr Jim
Scudamore, the Government's Chief Vet, and the farming unions. Ben Gill,
the President of the National Farmers' Union, recently described the case
for vaccination as "bilge."
Mr Davies, who dealt with the last European outbreak in Greece in 1996, has
said: "If we had vaccinated during late March, we would have been spared
the loss of thousands of animals and the public revulsion at the carcasses
strewn across the countryside. However, I had underestimated the almost
mystical belief in the superiority of slaughter as a method of control.
This has allowed all sorts of false statements to flourish."
In a further blow to the case against vaccination, the Government has now
admitted the British are already eating vaccinated meat. The National
Farmers' Union's insistence that people would never consume it was one of
the factors persuading the Government to abandon tentative plans to
vaccinate this spring, even though experts pointed out they already ate
meat inoculated against other diseases.
Now, in a letter to the Soil Association, the Department of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said that 18 718 tons of beef were
imported from Brazil (which vaccinates against FMD) in the year up to last
May. It says it has "no reason" to trace the meat and so has no detailed
information about when or where it is sold.

As the 2000th case of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was confirmed yesterday,
the Government admitted it had failed to meet its target of slaughtering
all cases within 24 hours of being reported by farmers.
The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said last week
animals on only 43 per cent of infected premises were slaughtered within 24
hours and only 86 per cent were slaughtered within 36 hours. The epidemic
is now the worst in the world in terms of the total number of animals
slaughtered.
The present epidemic has a lower number of cases than the 2354 in the
1967-68 outbreak. But, partly as a result of farms having grown many times
since then, the number slaughtered was 3 801 517 this year compared with
433 987 in 1967.
Livestock have now been slaughtered on 9311 farms. Nearly as many animals
have been slaughtered in Britain in 7 months as in the 4 years since the
1997 Taiwan outbreak, which in terms of the slaughter of infected and
suspected cases remains the largest outbreak in the world. Some 4 037 014
livestock, nearly all pigs, have died or been slaughtered in Taiwan since
1997, causing economic hardship and removing Japan's main source of pork.
But when the 1 557 780 slaughtered under the livestock welfare scheme are
added to the total infected and suspected cases slaughtered in Britain
during the 2001 epidemic, the British epidemic has resulted in the greatest
loss of life. The total number of livestock slaughtered this year for all
reasons was 5 359 297.

[For whatever reasons and in spite of the more intense involvement of the
military, the UK seems to have again fallen behind in achieving slaughter
within 24 hours of diagnosis. This cannot bode well for the rapid
eradication of FMD in that country. Therefore, the apparent change in
attitude regarding vaccination may be the best strategy for both
eliminating the disease and reducing the number of animal deaths. ­
