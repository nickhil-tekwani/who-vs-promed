The state's health ministry today [16 Jul 2007] expressed worry over
the rising cases of falciparum malaria, with almost 788 cases
reported between January-June 2007, as against last year's [2006]
figure of 240 cases.
The Health minister Vishwajit Rane today [16 Jul 2007] said that the
existing machinery had been geared up to combat the problem, with all
energies being diverted to target construction sites, which, in his
opinion, are the potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes in the
state.
"The construction sites not only include commercial constructions but
also house constructions, particularly in Dona Paula and Caranzalem,"
he said. Statistics furnished by the health department today [16 Jul
2007] indicate a high number of falciparum malaria cases in Tiswadi
(354 cases), followed by Bardez with 342 cases.
Data show that nearly 2883 malaria cases have been reported all over
Goa during the last 6 months, as against 1552 reported last year
[2006].
The health minister also disclosed that besides vivax and falciparum
cases, a new complication has been detected, with reported cases of
mixed malaria in which persons are found having both vivax and
falciparum together.
In the wake of the growing concerns, the health minister today [16
Jul 2007] told the media that the department has deployed all its
health officers to inspect construction sites and initiate steps for
notices against violations by builders failing to provide hygienic
conditions.
Likewise, steps to have the labor force checked for malaria, for the
provision of health cards, renewals etc. and for action against
violations in these spheres have been taken as well.
Mr. Rane, however, regretted that the department was toothless in
taking action for stopping construction projects, wherein health
violations are being reported. He said that the health ministry has
initiated steps to re-activate the committee on public health,
involving all departments concerned, namely health, district
administration, civic bodies etc., for strict monitoring and
controlling breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
He also said that adequate kits will be made available at health
centers for testing for malaria, and he appealed to the general
public that even cases of low grade fever be checked for malaria.
Admitting that the department and hospitals are short-staffed, he
said that the chief minister has given assurances to have all
vacancies identified and filled at the earliest possible time.
Replying to queries, he said that fogging was not a solution to
curbing malaria and neither was the use of deltamethrine an effective
measure for controlling malaria.

[ProMED 1st reported on malaria imported from Goa to Europe on 1 Jan
2007, and the increased number of imported cases since November 2006
was summed up in Eurosurveillance on 11 Jan 2007, also published by
ProMED. It is most welcome to have data from the indigenous
population showing that there indeed are an increased number of cases
in Goa and surroundings. Data are needed on susceptibility to
chloroquine, and the data show that until the number of cases
declines, visitors should be recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis,
preferably not chloroquine. - Mod.EP]

Rajasthan has witnessed an alarming rise in cases of malaria in recent
weeks even as the state government is putting in place a plan to
combat diseases that spread during monsoon.
Between 1-7 Jul 2007, over 1110 cases of malaria were recorded across
the state, compared to 667 cases during the same week last year
[2006]. A majority of the cases have been reported from the western
parts of the state.
Concerned over the malaria outbreak, the government has chalked out a
strategy to fight the mosquito menace. "We have prepared an action
plan to combat seasonal diseases, and we are already working on these
lines," Rajasthan's Medical and Health Minister Digambar Singh said.
"We have asked all chief medical officers and health officers, doctors
and other staff to be on alert," he said, adding that the government
"is fully equipped to fight the disease out." The government is also
taking the services of some 3000 private
doctors in remote and rural areas. Over 3000 malaria kits have been
sent to all community health centres.
As many as 2669 villages and areas that have experienced heavy
rainfall in recent weeks are under surveillance, and measures against
mosquito breeding were underway.
Experts feared that the malaria cases could rise, as the intensity of
the seasonal disease usually increases after 3-4 weeks of the 1st
spell of rains, when there is also the added danger of dengue and
chikungunya.

[Rajastan is endemic for malaria, and in the period from 1986 to 1997,
the annual parasite rate in Rajastan was 5 to 10 cases per 1000
population, of which 10-25 percent were _P. falciparum_ and the
remaining were _P. vivax_. A surge in malaria transmission following
heavy rain is, therefore, a possibility, but as pointed out in the
posting, other vector-borne diseases like dengue fever and chikungunya
are also possibilities.
