[1] Cholera - Guinea (Kindia, Boke regions)

A cholera outbreak in western Guinea has caused at least 14 deaths and 83 cases recorded in a month.

"The cholera epidemic which resurfaced just a month ago affects the coastal prefectures of Forecariah [Kindia region] and Boffa [Boke region], where a medical team recorded 14 deaths," said a source close to the Ministry of Health and Public Health. "The 1st cases were recorded in the islands of Kaback (off Conakry), bordering Sierra Leone."

Another medical source in Guinea argued that "if nothing is done", Guinea "could find 8000 cases of cholera with 800 deaths" in 2012. During a crisis meeting, the Guinean minister of health, Naman Keita, invited international partners of Guinea to "get involved to stop the epidemic and fight together against the diarrheal diseases."

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone (Northern province)

At least 20 people have died as a result of a cholera outbreak, the Health Ministry in Sierra Leone has said. More than 1000 cases have been recorded in 3 districts in the Northern region of the country, Port Loko, Kambia, and Pujenhun.

Health ministry officials confirmed that those reported to have contracted the disease did so from drinking contaminated water. "The reported cases suggest an outbreak and the most affected people contracted the cholera bacteria from drinking infected water," said Dr Foday Dafae, manager National Disease Surveillance and Response at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, at the weekend [3-4 Mar 2012].

Sierra Leone faces, among other major problems, an unavailability and inaccessibility of clean drinking water in most areas, especially in its rural districts.

[With outbreaks of cholera occurring in West African countries prior to the rainy season that should start next month [April 2012], the prospect of a substantial amount of diarrheal disease, including cholera, is large. - Mod.LL]
