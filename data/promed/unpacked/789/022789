Here is today's (4 April) main front-page headline and story in The
Independent newspaper -- in the printed version it is labelled "EXCLUSIVE"

Thousands of animals to be infected in BSE experiment
By Anthony Bevins, Political Editor
A huge seven-year programme of experimentation and research into mad cow
disease, involving hundreds of cattle and sheep and thousands of mice - some
of them, genetically-engineered - has been quietly launched by the
Government. One Whitehall source told The Independent: "We are leading the
world on research into BSE, which is quite right because we did, after all,
give the world BSE in the first place." The Ministry of Agriculture
Fisheries and Food (Maff) was reluctant to divulge details of the programme,
which could ultimately cost more than BP 150m.
But The Independent has been told that work is being done at two sites. A
number of "discreet" buildings have gone up on an estate run by the Central
Veterinary Laboratory Agency, near Weybridge, Surrey - where experiments and
research are being carried out into the origins of BSE, and its effect on
animals and people. One source said there were 700 cows there. Other
research is being carried out at a ministry site near Stratford-upon-Avon,
Warwickshire.
Because the work involves infecting cows, sheep and mice with BSE and
scrapie, the Government is probably concerned about the prospect of animal
rights protests, and people living nearby might also become concerned for
their safety. It is thought that residents in the Weybridge and Stratford
areas are largely unaware of the nature of the BSE research.
A Maff spokesman said that up to the end of last month, the Government had
spent a total of BP 80m on research into BSE. No firm estimates are
available, but the new research programme could eventually cost twice as
much again. The Independent has been told that it is proving "a massive
drain" on the Maff budget.
Conditions at the two sites are so restricted and secure that there is
little human contact with the infected animals and there is an on-site
veterinary hospital to deal with unrelated sickness or injury.
The ministry spokesman said work included "looking at the scrapie strains in
sheep" to see if any of the strains were similar to BSE. Other work involved
seeing how mice reacted to BSE. "Some of the mice have been engineered to be
biologically similar, in the way they react to BSE in cows."
Government sources say that the research programme was initiated last August
after the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) had urged
greater co-ordination of effort.
The Independent has been told that work now being carried out is so thorough
that the scientists are trying to nail down the actual source of BSE. While
the official view continued to maintain that the source was cattle feed, and
that was the consensus in SEAC, all possibilities were being seriously
examined. Going right back to scratch, the research teams are ruling nothing
in, and nothing out - and they are even examining the theory, presented to
the BSE inquiry this week, that the disease might have been caused by
organophosphates.
In similar vein, maternal transmission and the contamination of milk are
also being examined - in spite of all previous research showing no evidence
for concern.

[The mind boggles at the biosecurity problems as, for one, all faeces will
presumably have to be incinerated. With "700 cows" on one not very large
site at the CVL, surrounded by dense suburbia ... I suspect that the actual
details differ slightly from this report. - Mod.MHJ]
