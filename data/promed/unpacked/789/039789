Police are investigating a Melbourne doctor who is believed to have
infected 12 patients with hepatitis C [virus] while working at a
private clinic last year [2009]. The Medical Practitioners Board of
Victoria is expected to announce today [9 Apr 2010] that the doctor
was suspended as soon as health authorities realised some of his
female patients had been infected with the same strain of the virus
he was carrying.

The Age [newspaper] believes that the Department of Health discovered
the link through testing of the patients' blood. A spokeswoman for
the board said she could not comment on how the doctor allegedly
infected the women, but the most common way people get hepatitis C in
Australia is by sharing drug-injecting equipment such as needles.

It can also be spread by needlestick injuries in healthcare settings.
People who receive blood transfusions in Australia have a low risk of
getting hepatitis C because since February 1990, donations have been
tested for the presence of hepatitis C virus, but people have been
known to contract it from unsterile procedures overseas.

Sexual transmission rates of hepatitis C virus are low, but the risk
is increased with certain sexual practices or where there is the
possibility of blood-to-blood contact.

The Victorian Department of Health recently reported a substantial
increase in hepatitis C infections. Its latest figures show 662 new
cases were reported by doctors during the 2nd quarter of 2009 -- 25
per cent more than in the same period in 2008. About 70 per cent of
people infected with hepatitis C [virus] may develop a chronic form
of the [disease]. Of these people, about 1/5th will develop
cirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver that can lead to liver cancer.

[Such events are, unfortunately, not uncommon. In the present
instance, the mode of transmission and the condition of the patients
have not been revealed. Further information is awaited.

Hepatitis C is a strictly human disease. It cannot be contracted from
or given to any other animal. Hepatitis C virus is spread by
blood-to-blood contact. Most people have few, if any symptoms after
the initial infection, yet the virus persists in the liver in about
85 percent of those infected. No vaccine against hepatitis C is
available. Persistent infection can be treated with medication,
peginterferon and ribavirin being the standard-of-care therapy. 51
percent are cured overall. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver
cancer may require a liver transplant, and the virus universally
recurs after transplantation.
