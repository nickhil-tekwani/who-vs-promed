A total of 6 people have been hospitalized in Palma [Mallorca] with salmonellosis. The victims were infected after eating tortilla at a restaurant on the outskirts of the El Terreno neighborhood of the city. The health department has launched an investigation to determine whether there are any other problems at the restaurant.

Hospitals and health centres must report all _Salmonella_ cases to the Ministry of Health, who carry out a survey to determine the source of the outbreak. In August 2019, a Japanese restaurant in Calle Blanquerna was temporarily closed after a salmonellosis outbreak affected more than 100 people.

[Unlike a tortilla in the Americas -- a thin, circular unleavened flatbread originally made from maize hominy meal (and now also from wheat flour) -- in Spain, a tortilla or "tortilla de patatas" is an omelette made with potatoes, eggs, onion, and olive oil.

"Mallorca, or Majorca, is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean. The capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca). - Mod.LL
