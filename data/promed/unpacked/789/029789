Thai Government to Impose Dengue Vector Control Fine
----------------------------------------------------
BANGKOK: Facing an increasing threat from dengue fever, the Thai government
plans to impose a special fine on people whose houses and offices are found
to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the carrier of the disease, the
government-owned MCOT radio reported on Sat 7 Jul 2001. Deputy Health
Minister Surapong Suebwonglee said that the measure, imitating a successful
method used in Singapore, will effectively eliminate mosquito breeding by
urging people to keep their surroundings clear of the disease vectors.
He conceded that the government's efforts to wipe out the [disease had not
yielded satisfactory results. In Thailand, dengue fever has killed 87
people and infected 48 000 so far this year. He said that he would also
seek cooperation from the Interior Ministry to inform local administrations
of the policy and how to implement it. He added that from Mon 9 Jul 2001
more than 700 000 volunteers would begin efforts to destroy mosquito
breeding grounds across the country.

[Mosquito breeding site reduction campaigns are frequently unsuccessful as
they rely upon voluntary actions with a failure to recognize the importance
of "just one" breeding site per household in contributing to persistent
high _Aedes sp._ indices. This proposal is reminiscent of how a combination
of school entry laws combined with obligatory education laws was required
to increase vaccination coverages in the US back in the late '70s. - Mod.MPP
