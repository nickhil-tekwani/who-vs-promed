Emerging paralysis disease in pet African hedgehogs
-----------------------------------------------
I am posting with the hope of reaching veterinarians or other researchers
who are interested in disseminating findings or perhaps collaborating in
the research of a progressive, paralytic disease which is becoming more
predominant in the USA and Canadian population of captive African/Algerian
strain hedgehogs.
Recently formed is a group of veterinarians and geneticists as well as a
large group of participating animal owners who are researching this
typically-fatal disease. The initial research, necropsies, biopsies and
other data show there is a demyelination seen in every terminal case.
However, other small bodies associated with canine distemper (which also
exhibits demyelination effects) are not present in the stains currently
available.
Databases of medical and care histories are being compiled. Genealogies are
being referenced with assistance from the International Hedgehog Fancier's
Society and their database of registered animals. It is hoped that the
genealogies may assist in identifying any hereditary aspects of this
disease.
The disease begins with loss of balance and a pervasive 'wobbliness' of the
animal and proceeds with circulation deficiencies, atrophy, and systemic
shutdown. Some owners are pursuing a diet-related treatment while others
are following regimens as directed by their veterinarians. Still others are
pursuing holistic solutions to alleviate symptoms in the affected animal.
I'm not sure what additional information would be appropriate to post at
this time. I have additional information, professional contacts within the
veterinary and genetic research communities, e-mailable video of affected
animals and additional symptomatic descriptions for any interested party.
My goal in posting to this professional list is to elicit interest,
educate, and engender support for the privately-funded efforts being poured
into this research.
Please contact me at either e-mail address for additional information.

[This disorder was reported in the UK. It is hoped that the researches in
the US and Canada have collaborated with the hedgehog researchers there. I
wonder if these researchers have seen the article in Veterinary Record,
143: 550-552, "Paralysis in hedgehogs (_Erinaceus europeus_) associated
with demyelination", A.C. Palmer et al. Also, have these researchers
considered Theiler's virus or a lysosomal storage disorder? Some lysosomal
storage disorders in companion animals present similarly. - Mod.TG
