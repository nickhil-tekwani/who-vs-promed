The medical committee analyzing the deaths of 12 individuals in Basti Behram Leghari, Rukanpur, has confirmed meningoencephalitis to be the cause of death.

Dr Hassan Khan, CEO of the District Health Authority, told the media that the committee, chaired by Shaikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital Principal Dr. Muhammad Saleem Leghari, determined that all 12 deaths were caused by meningoencephalitis after conducting a thorough investigation into the cases.

It is important to understand that meningoencephalitis is an infection of both the meninges (tissue layers that surround the brain) and the brain. It is caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses and can be fatal if not treated quickly. The District Health Authority's Chief Executive Officer stated that the fatalities were most likely caused by direct contact and that medical workers will visit the region to track the situation and promote awareness about the condition.

According to some locals, a local health professional recommended the family members of the deceased visit a hospital in Rahim Yar Khan, but they did not do so. The area's health officials also did not conduct a campaign to raise awareness about the illness or other outbreaks.

Another 8 residents of Basti Behram Leghari were shifted to the Shaikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) on Friday [6 Jan 2023] with the symptoms of the unidentified disease that had earlier claimed the lives of more than 10 persons, mostly children.

The symptoms were detected among these persons when a committee formed and led by Health Services Director General Dr Sohail Arshad Rana in Lahore visited the village and screen the residents. The committee comprising Additional Director Dr Imran Bashir, RYK District Health Authority (DHA) Chief Executive Officer Dr Hassan Khan, Additional Director (MIS) Dr Mohsin Watoo, WHO Bahawalpur Division EPI Officer Mufakir Mian, during its visit to the village, interviewed the members of the affected families and examined the rooms and other items used by them to probe into the deaths of more than 10 locals within a fortnight.

The committee members also collected the specimens from food, cattle, and fodder with the help of officials of the livestock department and the Punjab Food Authority (PFA). It will furnish a fact-finding report to the Health Services DG within 3 days.

As per local sources, WHO member Dr Mufakir Mian had contradicted the view that meningoencephalitis caused the death of 12 residents of the village.

As per Wikipedia, meningoencephalitis is a medical condition that simultaneously resembles both meningitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the meninges, and encephalitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the brain.

Dr Mufakir told the committee members that after discussing the symptoms with the other residents of the village, a report would be finalised in 74 hours to identify the disease.

Meanwhile, the DHA officials have established a medical camp at Basti Behram that will be functional round the clock on the direction of health department high-ups.

DHA CEO Dr Hassan did not attend the phone calls by this correspondent for confirmation of more suspected patients of the disease.

Yet another committee, this one by the district administration, has been formed to probe into the deaths of 12 persons at Basti Behram Leghari, because of an unidentified disease, as the number of the locals showing its 'symptoms' rose to 11 from 8, on Saturday.

A committee formed by Punjab director general health is already probing into the matter and was ordered to file a report within three days, while another committee formed earlier by the Shaikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) Principal Dr Muhammad Saleem Leghari had "confirmed" the deaths were caused by meningoencephalitis. However, World Health Organisation (WHO) representative Dr Mufakir reportedly rejected the committee's findings.

The three more suspected patients of the disease surfacing within the last 24 hours have been shifted to SZMCH here. The total 11 suspected patients so far shifted to the SZMCH are [10, 15, 60, 40, 60, 2, 18, 5, 1.5, 25, and 1.5 years old.]

SZMCH spokesperson Dr Rana Ilyas Ahmed told this correspondent that these patients would be kept in isolation at the hospital till the completion of the investigation into the issue. He added that so far all the patients were stable and being monitored properly.

The deaths have created panic in the area and locals have started avoiding visiting Basti Behram and meeting with its residents. Meanwhile, the latest two-member committee has been formed by RYK District Health Authority CEO on the orders of the deputy commissioner. District Health Officer Dr Liaqat Ali Chohan is the convener of the committee while Dr Saleh Ahmed is its focal person. This committee will investigate the matter in detail and fix responsibility for any slackness found during the course of an earlier inquiry into the deaths, and furnish a 'fact-finding' report by January 10 [2023].

DC Muhammad Salman Khan told Dawn that RYK Assistant Commissioner Sarmad Ali Bhagat has visited the Basti Behram Leghari and met with the families of the victims. He said that the district administration was vigilant and with the help of DHA, issued health guidelines for the people. A medical camp has already been established at Basti Behram and an ambulance was available to shift any persons showing disease symptoms to the hospital. The DHA had also started an awareness campaign about the diseases in the area through health workers, he added.

Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhury Parvez Elahi has sought a report from Bahawalpur Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar and officials of the health department regarding the 12 deaths caused by the disease that was yet to be identified. According to an official communique, the chief minister expressed his concern over the deaths and directed the officials to take immediate steps to probe into the cause and suggest measures to control the 'mysterious disease'.
