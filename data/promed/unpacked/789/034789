Castle Vets, Breaffy Road, Castlebar [County Mayo, Ireland], have issued a warning to pet owners walking their dogs near lakes around the country.

In a post on their Facebook site, they stated: "We have had 2 dogs die tragically over the past 24 hours from suspected exposure to blue green algae in lakes.

"Exposure can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness, lethargy, muscle tremors, seizures, and sudden death.

"Please be very vigilant when walking your dogs near lakes and don't let them in for a swim if you see or suspect blue green algae."

[Blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) are the only group of algae to be toxic in freshwaters. They are microscopic bacteria living in water, and are capable of photosynthesising which is why they are often called algae. Though microscopic, when they form colonies and accumulate together they can become visible to the naked eye. Blue-green algae can produce potent liver and neurotoxins as well as skin irritants. However, not all blue-green algae are toxic, and even toxic species do not always produce toxins.

Many blue-green algal species are able to float and can sometimes be seen as green scums on water, or they just colour the water green. For more information on identifying blooms, use the Key to Blooms (http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/water-management/water-quality/algal-information/key-to-blooms).

Toxic marine and estuarine algae can also affect recreational water use. Some of these algae produce toxins that can cause illness if ingested and others can cause skin irritations. These algae often cannot be seen, but some cause red coloration to water -- a phenomenon known as red tides.

Blue-green algae can pose a risk to human health because of the toxins they produce. These toxins can damage the liver and neurological system of both humans and animals and in severe cases can cause death. The cell walls of all blue-green algae contain contact irritants which can cause gastrointestinal, skin, eye, and respiratory irritations to humans and animals.

Toxins produced by blue-green algae
-----------------------------------
Toxins are compounds that have a harmful effect on other cells, tissues, and organisms. In the natural environment, these toxins are generally contained within the blue-green algal cell but they are released into the water when the cell is damaged or dies.

Blue-green algal toxins can be divided into the following groups:
1. Hepatotoxins
- Hepatotoxins cause blood to collect in the liver causing circulatory shock and can lead to death by internal hemorrhaging.
- Hepatotoxins can cause weakness, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
- Nodularin and microcystin are 2 types of hepatotoxins.
- Nodularin is produced by the algal species _Nodularia spumigena_.
- Microcystins can bioaccumulate in aquatic invertebrates such as mussels so aquatic animals caught from water where there is an algal bloom should not be eaten.

2. Neurotoxins
- Neurotoxins interfere with the functioning of the nervous system and can cause death of humans and animals within minutes by causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles.
- Marine dinoflagellates (red tides) produce saxitoxins (also known as paralytic shellfish poisons) which concentrate in shellfish and have been known to cause death in humans.

3. Non-specific toxins
- Cylindrospermopsin is a non-specific toxin produced by the blue-green algae _Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii_ and _Aphanizomenon ovalisporum_.
- This toxin is a relatively slow acting toxin that damages most organs in the body including the liver.

4. Dermatoxic lipopolysachharides
- When non-toxic species of blue-green algae are present at concentrations above 10 cubic mm per litre, the water may still pose a risk to recreational and domestic users as all blue-green algae have lipopolysachharides in their cell walls.
- Lipopolysachharides are less toxic than hepatotoxins or neurotoxins but are significant in terms of water supply for drinking, showering and recreation.
- Lipopolysachharides have been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis, skin and eye irritations and hay fever, in humans that have come into contact with algal blooms. Humans that contact lipopolysachharides in the aerosol form (fine spray, such as sprinkler) may suffer asthma, eczema, and blisters in the lining of the nose and mouth.

Incidents of blue-green algal poisoning
---------------------------------------
Animal deaths from blue-green algae have also been reported in North and South America, Europe, and Africa. The major cause of deaths in animals is from liver poisoning and neurotoxicity that leads to respiratory failure.

Research had shown that while all species of blue-green algae produce skin irritants, not all species are capable of producing liver toxins and neurotoxins. Not all toxic marine algae are known to be hazardous to recreational water users.

For freshwaters
---------------
A Red Level Action Mode is in place when greater than 50 000 cells of _Microcystis aeruginosa_ are present or a biovolume of all toxin producing cyanobacteria exceeds 4 mm3/L. Red Level is also triggered if the total of all cyanobacteria (toxic and non toxic) exceeds 10 mm3/L or scums are present for long periods. At Red Mode, Local and Health Authorities should be contacted to assess risks to recreational users and appropriate measures should be taken to warn water users. Water should not be used for primary recreation.

While much of this comment has focused on the human health issue, pets can be similarly affected. Pets tend to die very quickly from the blue-green algae toxins.
