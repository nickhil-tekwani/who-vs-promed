The Mesa County [Colorado] Health Department reported a confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a county resident. The resident was taken to Denver for treatment over the weekend and was still being treated there on Monday [21 Jul 2014].

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus, which can be deadly, is carried primarily by deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. The infected rodents excrete the virus in their urine, droppings and saliva. People are infected by inhaling airborne particles of the virus or by direct contact with rodents, their droppings or nests.

Health officials say the case is a good reminder to residents to try to avoid exposure to hantavirus[es] by taking precautions while cleaning homes, sheds, cabins, barns or other areas where mice or mouse droppings are present.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Colorado. This report does not indicate the sex or age of the patient, the patient's condition, or the specific location and environmental setting in Mesa County where the infection occurred. This is another reminder that cleaning in closed buildings that have been unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.
