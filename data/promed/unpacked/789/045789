[The following information is quoted from the response received from a member of the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project in response to our request for information in African swine fever - Zambia: (NR) OIE, RFI 20170428.4998914. - Mod CRD]

"Currently, there's a movement ban on pigs out of the Eastern province. For outbreaks that occurred in Lusaka province, it's believed the source of the outbreaks is Eastern province. In Lusaka, affected farms were depopulated. In Eastern province, depopulation has not been effected; rather a movement ban is in effect.

Depopulation is rarely used as a control measure when outbreaks affect rural communities; this is largely due to the fear of a public outcry and possibly political backlash. Movement ban of affected livestock out of the province is usually the preferred control measure. However, on commercial farms, depopulation is usually carried out as most farms are usually covered by insurance and it is easy for the government to pay compensation to such enterprises."
