Vet services confident measures will stem disease
-------------------------------------------------
2 new cases of Newcastle disease have been uncovered in Nicosia and
Larnaca, despite 80 percent of all private poultry on the island being
vaccinated since the disease was first diagnosed on Saturday.
The fatal virus affects all species of birds, but the Agriculture
Department reiterated yesterday that it was "not harmful to humans and
poses no danger to public health".
The outbreak has so far affected guinea fowl, doves, geese, pigeons,
partridges, peacocks, and small parrots.
Transmission of the virus can occur in several different ways, through
direct contact with secretions from infected birds and also through
contaminated feed, water, implements, premises, and human clothing.
Veterinary services chief Phedias Loukaides said yesterday he expected the
remaining 20 percent of private poultry to be vaccinated by the end of the
week and was confident that would stop the spread of the disease.
Farm poultry has not been affected, as it has already been vaccinated.

[According to a previous posting, the 1st outbreak in Cyprus involved
pigeons. Confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the above information, related
to outbreaks in additional species and locations, will help.
If confirmed, this will become another demonstration of the problems
concerning disease control in small holdings, hobby birds, and backyard
avian premises, even in countries with efficient, advanced veterinary
apparatus and infrastructure. - Mod.AS]
