Leon County horses test positive for mosquito-borne illness
-----------------------------------------------------------
So far, 2 horses within one mile of each other in the Fort Braden area near Highway 20 have tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), reports the Florida Department of Health (DOH).

EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that is nearly always fatal to horses contracting it. Another horse in the Woodville area tested positive for the disease yesterday [11 Sep 2012].

These cases, combined with the 1st human case of West Nile virus in Gadsden County, reported yesterday, and Leon County's 1st human case, reported in late August, have the DOH on high alert for mosquito-borne diseases. The DOH recommends all precautions against possible infections, including regular standing water drainage, covering skin with clothes or repellent, covering windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out, and protecting pets from mosquito bites.

State officials will continue to conduct statewide surveillance for mosquito-borne illnesses, including West Nile virus infections, Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria and dengue.

State health officials are looking into the 1st case of Eastern equine encephalitis in Maine in several years. State officials said a pheasant that died on Thursday [11 Sep 2012] in Lebanon, Maine, tested positive for the disease. The bird was one of about 30 that died on private property recently.

"It could very well be affecting a lot of wild birds that people aren't noticing. Pheasants, though, are particularly sensitive to Eastern equine encephalitis. It would go through a flock very quickly," Maine Medical Vector-borne Disease Lab field biologist Chuck Lubelczyk said. Until this point in the summer, scientists at the lab had been capturing mosquitoes and sending them out to be tested for West Nile virus.

The discovery of EEE adds a new concern. EEE is spread by mosquitoes and can be transmitted to humans. The late summer warm weather and rainfall in low-lying southern Maine may explain why this is the part of the state that's seen positive cases of West Nile virus and EEE.

"If you are having birds that are dying from it, the potential is there that, obviously, it's being transmitted by mosquitoes," Lubelczyk said. Lubelczyk said Maine is the only state in the Continental U.S. that has never had a confirmed human case of either disease but people still need to be alert when it comes to mosquitoes.

"There have been fatalities in Massachusetts and Vermont reported in the last month from this disease so, obviously, it is something that folks should be aware of," Lubelczyk said.

Health officials want people to be aware but not alarmed. They are reminding people to wear long sleeves, try to stay indoors at dusk, fix holes in screens on their homes and wear bug repellant when necessary. Biologists said the 1st frost of the season should kill all of the mosquitoes.

[Two horses coming down with a mosquito borne disease in such close proximity may indicate that the area possibly has a high mosquito population. Horse owners need to be very diligent to keep their horses vaccinated, at least every 4 months. Horse owners should be using a recommended fly and mosquito spray designed for use on horses.

People in the area need to be especially careful not be out at dusk or dawn, to use repellants containing DEET, and to wear dark clothing.

Avian species are often very sensitive to the EEE. Chickens are often used as sentinel animals for this disease and other mosquito transmitted diseases such as West Nile virus. The 2nd article makes a good point: there may be other birds succumbing to this disease that have not been found, especially wild birds.
