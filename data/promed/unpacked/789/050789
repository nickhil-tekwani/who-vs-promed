Because of the surprising increase in occurrences of babies born alive with microcephaly in Pernambuco, the state Secretariat of Health will issue a clinical protocol to be carried out by professionals in the area. Just this year [2015], 90 cases were registered. The annual mean is 9 [cases]. Most of these cases have been registered in the past 3 months.

Specialists from the Ministry of Health are investigating and interviewing the mothers of the patients.

Usually, in the majority of cases, microcephaly is caused by congenital infections that pass from the mother to the fetus during gestation, such as cytomegalovirus, rubeola and toxoplasmosis. However, in Pernambuco, the situation is different. Although it is not possible for now to define the real causes, some mothers [what proportion?] have reported that they had a rash during gestation. These symptoms are related directly to [those of] dengue, Zika and chikungunya [virus infections]. "It is irresponsible to say that these diseases are responsible for the microcephaly. Dengue is less likely. We are investigating. From the tomography findings, we attribute the cause as infectious, but it is too early to speak of it," concluded the Secretariat of Health Surveillance.

[This summarized report is posted in response to the earlier report from Bahia suggesting that microcephaly has been due to Zika virus infection of the mother at 4-5 weeks of gestation (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151106.3767857). The above report does not confirm that possibility but does indicate that there is a significant increase in microcephaly in Pernambuco. In some cases (what proportion?) the mothers had a rash compatible with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus infections. No mention was made of whether there was laboratory confirmation of infection by any of these viruses. As with the previous report of microcephaly and Zika virus infections, we are left with more questions than answers. It will be interesting to learn what the ongoing investigations turn up.

A 13 Nov 2015 report indicated that 89 of 141 microcephaly cases were officially confirmed in Pernambuco (in Portuguese). Other states are also reporting cases, including Piaui with 12 cases (in Portuguese), Sergipe with 49 cases (http://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/estado/2015/11/12/sergipe-tem-49-bebes-com-microcefalia-diz-diretor-de-hospital.htm in Portuguese), Rio Grande do Norte 22 cases (in Portuguese) and Paraiba 21 cases (in Portuguese) (ProMED-PORT post Microcefalia - Brasil (07) (vários estados), aumento da incidência, informações oficiais, Ministério da Saúde do Brasil Archive Number: 20151117.3799505). All states report that these case numbers are above the usual number. None of these reports mention that Zika, chikungunya or dengue viruses were associated with these cases. - Mod.TY
