Georgia: Green Onions Responsible for Hepatitis A Outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis A outbreaks that affected nearly 300 people in Georgia and
Tennessee appear to be caused by green onions, health officials said on Fri
10 Oct 2003. According to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report by David
Wahlberg, the onions were probably contaminated before being shipped to
several restaurants in Georgia and one in Knoxville, Tennessee.
The Division of Public Health of the State of Georgia defines hepatitis A
as "an acute infectious disease with fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of
appetite, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing the skin and eyeballs."
Rarely fatal, the disease is most commonly transmitted by food, water, and
sexual contact. Anyone who has not been vaccinated against it can be infected.
According to officials, more than 200 cases were reported in Georgia. Many
were tied to a restaurant in metro Atlanta, while others were connected to
dining establishments in the northern part of the state. In addition to the
cases reported in Georgia, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reports that at least 70 cases of hepatitis A have been reported
in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area. Officials say that the Food and Drug
Administration is trying to pinpoint how the contamination occurred.
According to Wahlberg's article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it is
not clear whether the restaurants washed the pre-packaged onions before
serving them. Even if they did, washing doesn't always remove virus,
especially in layered foods like onions. Cooking kills the virus, but
freezing doesn't. Some have theorized that prepackaged foods are to blame
for the current outbreak. However, Dr. Paul A. Blake, State Epidemiologist
for the Georgia Division of Public Health, downplays this theory. "We have
seen a dramatic increase in hepatitis A cases in mid-September," said Dr.
Blake. "Interviews with the infected persons have shown that only a small
proportion can be accounted for by eating at any one restaurant; they ate
at more than half a dozen restaurants in mid-August, which would be the
appropriate incubation period for Hepatitis A."
Dr. Blake said that since multiple restaurants are involved, and each of
those restaurants employs a different staff, the possibility of infected
food handlers causing the outbreak has been ruled out. "Only a contaminated
food distributed to all of the restaurants during a short period of time
would account for this," said Dr. Blake. "This conclusion is supported by
finding that the vast majority of the cases were caused by identical
viruses, suggesting that they all had a common source."
Dr. Blake also says that the state of Georgia is working to prevent similar
outbreaks in the future by investigating which foods cause illness, as well
as which suppliers and distributors are associated with such foods. In
addition, they are working with the Department of Agriculture and the Food
and Drug Administration, as well similar agencies representing other
states, to further determine the origin of this problem. "We are working
with North Carolina and Tennessee, which also had hepatitis outbreaks at
the same time, to identify any foods that these restaurants had in common
and trace them back along the food supply chain," said Dr. Blake. "We hope
to find a single food that was contaminated on the farm or during
subsequent processing and keep it from happening again." Blake stresses
these are continuing programs and are not restricted to Georgia and
Tennessee but in fact are nationwide.

[Food-borne outbreaks of hepatitis A have been linked to green vegetables
in the past, although perhaps not to green onions. The extent of the
outbreak suggests that the produce may have been contaminated on the farm
before or after harvesting, rather than during packaging, which is more
likely to have been by mechanical means. The results of the ongoing
investigations will be awaited with interest by consumers and producers
alike. - Mod.CP]
