------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to make a clarification. In the latest report of anthrax in Zimbabwe I implied that there might be a measure of under-reporting. In fact Zimbabwe provides a wealth of data to OIE in their formal reporting to Paris. For 2017 there are only 6 months data on 11 outbreaks on the OIE website; the full record will not be available until this May or later. But 2016 saw 67 bovine outbreaks involving 178 cases distributed as follows: Manicaland (20 outbreaks, 43 cases), Mashonaland Central (6, 24), Mashonaland East (3, 6), Mashonaland West (4, 26), Masvingo (21, 39), Matabeleland South (1, 2), Matabeleland North (3, 15), Midlands (9, 21). There were no reported outbreaks in sheep, goats, equidae, or swine, but there were 167 human cases, no deaths. These can provide some background to the 9 human cases seen already in 2018.
