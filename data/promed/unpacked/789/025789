A person living in Auckland's northwest region has likely been infected with a typhus disease that can be found in fleas living on pets. Two other people from the same home are also suspected of having the illness known as murine typhus, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS] said.

An ARPHS spokeswoman said they were notified last week about the likely typhus infection, which can cause fever, headache, malaise, swollen lymph nodes, sore muscles and a rash in humans. Symptoms can take up to 2 weeks to develop after infection but severe illness is rare. "Treatment is with antibiotics and most people recover completely, sometimes without treatment," the ARPHS spokeswoman said.

Murine typhus is caused by a bacterial germ that in New Zealand is spread by fleas from cats or rodents. The bacteria live harmlessly in the insect's salivary glands but can make humans sick when transmitted via its bites or [flea] faeces.

Three people northwest of Auckland, who were handling stray kittens they wanted to rehome, are suspected of catching a form of typhus. It cannot be passed from person to person. "You can reduce your risk of infection by treating pets to keep them flea-free and keeping rodents and other animals like possums away from your home or workplace," the spokeswoman said.

This can include keeping tight lids on rubbish bins and compost bins and storing food -- including pet food -- in tight containers. Fleas found on rats can transmit a form of typhus to humans. It can also include using traps or pest control to control rodents, always wearing gloves when feeding or handling sick or dead animals, using insect repellent and avoiding handling stray or wild animals without appropriate protection.

Cases of murine typhus in Auckland tend to be rare with the last notified case taking place in 2017. The Dairy Flat Veterinary Clinic, 35 km (21.7 mi) north of Auckland, said it was notified of the outbreak on 3 Jun 2022. Veterinarian Dr Angela Matthews told Stuff 3 people had earlier been hospitalised with the disease but were now recovering at home. The cases included 2 adults and a staff member from the Kaukapakapa area, who had been handling a litter of stray kittens carrying the disease. They had been hoping to rehome the kittens. "The family told the clinic because they were very worried about the disease being in the area and wanted locals to be aware of it," Matthews told Stuff. The 3 have been released from hospital and are recovering at home.

[Flea-borne typhus (also known as murine or endemic typhus) is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia typhi_ and _Rickettsia felis_. Rats are the primary animal reservoir for _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums, and their fleas, can maintain these microorganisms in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al. Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis. 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/). The rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the most common vector for _R. typhi_ and the cat flea _Ctenocephalides felis_ is the principal reservoir and vector for _R. felis_ (https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e332a62c703f653182faf47/5e332a62c703f6d8f22fc6e5_Vol-118-No-1208-28-January-2005.pdf).

Infected humans often have contact with animals that can carry these fleas. Fleas defecate when they feed. Humans become infected when the feces from infected fleas are rubbed into the excoriated bite wound or other wounds in the skin or rubbed into the eyes. Infection can also result from inhalation of aerosolized flea feces or ingestion of flea feces. These bacteria are not spread from person to person. Murine typhus is a relatively mild disease as compared to epidemic typhus. Among patients admitted to an acute care hospital with this disease, only 10% require intensive care, up to 4% die. Therapy consists of doxycycline.

A single elevated IgG antibody titer of greater than 1:128 is considered supportive evidence of a rickettsial infection. A 4-fold or greater rise in IgG titers in paired acute/convalescent samples is required to confirm a recent infection (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/FleaBorneTyphusGuidance.pdf). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of whole blood or serum (prior to antibiotic treatment) is also confirmatory.

Murine typhus is distributed worldwide, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments of tropic and subtropical regions, including the northwest Auckland area of New Zealand (ProMED post Murine typhus - New Zealand (North Island) 20061004.2841 and https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e332a62c703f653182faf47/5e332a62c703f6d8f22fc6e5_Vol-118-No-1208-28-January-2005.pdf). In Europe, it is distributed along the Mediterranean coast as well as the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa. In the United States, most cases of murine typhus occur in Texas, California, and Hawaii, with an average of about 300 cases every year, although the disease is not nationally reportable.

California averaged 70 reported murine typhus cases annually between 2009 and 2014 and 98 between 2015 and 2017 (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/FleaBorneTyphusGuidance.pdf). The number of cases spiked in 2018 in California, with 100 confirmed and 64 probable cases of murine typhus, followed by 77 and 64 cases, respectively, in 2019; as of 1 Jul 2020, however, there have been no confirmed and only 15 probable cases, perhaps because murine typhus is being misdiagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Flea-borneTyphusCaseCounts.pdf). Most cases of murine typhus in California occur in southern California in Los Angeles County (LAC) (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Flea-borneTyphusCaseCounts.pdf). - Mod.ML
