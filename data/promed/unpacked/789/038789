ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[There have been several reports of suspected human cases of avian
influenza in parts of India where there has been avian influenza
disease in poultry. None have been confirmed. The intensive
surveillance of the population of Tripura state likewise has revealed
no human cases of avian influenza so far, but revealed many cases of
unidentified fever. Malaria may be the cause of many of these fevers
since Taindian News has today (3 May 2008) reported a widespread
outbreak of malaria in the state accompanied by 22 deaths (see:
<http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/malaria-claims-22-lives-in-tripura_10044622.html>).
