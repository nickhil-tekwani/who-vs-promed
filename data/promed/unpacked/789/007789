A _Shigella_ outbreak in Denmark that sickened more than 40 people was likely caused by imported fresh mint. In August and September 2020, 44 Danes became ill, including 30 women and 14 men between 0 and 75 years old; 13 people were hospitalized. Those sickened mostly live in Hovedstaden.

A case was defined as a patient with either a culture-positive sample for _Shigella sonnei_ or people PCR-positive for the ipaH gene, which is a marker for all _Shigella_ species and enteroinvasive _E. coli_, from August 2020 onward. The Statens Serum Institut (SSI) investigated the outbreak with the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute.

Inquiries showed the majority of patients had eaten fresh mint bought at local greengrocers or bazaars in and around the Copenhagen area from mid to late August 2020. Because of the herb's short shelf life, it is thought there is no longer any contaminated product on the market and no risk of more people being infected.

Among the 36 interviewed patients, 24 had eaten fresh mint before disease onset. Of the 24 cases, 22 had bought it in a greengrocer or bazaar. It was not sold in retail chains. A total of 12 different places were mentioned, which indicated the source of infection was a locally traded food. Traceback was difficult, as the mint sellers had several suppliers during the outbreak period and had bought different types of mint packed in a variety of ways. A lack of invoices for purchase of the mint also hampered the investigation. The duration of the outbreak indicated there was probably only one or a few contaminated batches.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has seized mint lacking traceability details and has taken some test samples with results pending.

Luise Muller, an epidemiologist at SSI, said the outbreak was an opportunity to remind consumers that fresh herbs must always be washed thoroughly before eating them. SSI checked with European health agencies, but no other countries have reported an increase in _Shigella_ infections in the same time period. Infections with _Shigella_ are not common in Denmark and are most often acquired in connection with travel abroad. Interviews with those affected showed they had not been traveling before they became ill.

Previous outbreaks in Denmark include one in 2007, when more than 210 people became ill from eating contaminated imported baby corn. Another outbreak in 2009 involved 10 people and was traced to fresh, raw sugar peas (sugar snaps) imported from Kenya.

Most people infected with _Shigella_ develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or 2 after they are exposed to the bacteria. Shigellosis usually resolves in 5 to 7 days, but some people may experience symptoms from a few days to 4 or more weeks. People who are in poor health or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick for a longer period of time.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given the relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
