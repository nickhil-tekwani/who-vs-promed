The pig-borne encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia that has claimed 100 lives
is "virtually over", the World Health Organization (WHO) said Saturday,
crediting the culling of
almost a million pigs for controlling the disease.
While 100 people had died from over 258 recorded cases of the disease, the
WHO said that as of 30 Apr 1999 there had been no new cases admitted to
hospitals in the past eight days. This compared to seven new cases being
admitted to hospitals daily
in mid-March when the outbreak was at its peak.
Culling of 901 228 pigs in three states to prevent the spread of the virus
"has effectively elminated the reservoir of the virus... and brought the
outbreak to an end," the WHO said. While the destruction of the pigs had a
"major economic impact... it clearly saved many lives," the WHO added.
According to Malaysian health ministry data, the pig culling was completed
on 26 Apr 1999.
