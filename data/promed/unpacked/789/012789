Indonesia: death from avian influenza suspected
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman in Jakarta has died of what authorities suspect may be
bird flu, the health minister said on Sunday [11 Sep 2005]. The woman, 37,
died on Saturday night in a hospital in south Jakarta, after suffering from
pneumonia and flu-like respiratory problems since 6 Sep 2005.
"We had taken samples for tests, and one showed it was positive (for the
H5N1 virus)," Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari told El Shinta radio,
adding that more tests were being done.
[H5N1] avian influenza has killed 63 people in Asia since late 2003. The
death in Jakarta, if confirmed, would be the 4th recorded in Indonesia.

Indonesia: suspected human case of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman has died of avian influenza, becoming the country's 4th
case of the disease, according to the Indonesian health authorities. The 37
year old woman died at a private hospital in Jakarta. Blood samples had
tested positive for avian influenza.
3 other Indonesians, a father and his 2 daughters, died in July 2005 in
Tangerang district, south west of Jakarta. The government said infected
chicken droppings were suspected of having caused these deaths. Indonesia
subsequently launched a vaccination drive but has been criticized for
carrying out only limited culls of poultry. Bird flu has killed 62 people
in Asia in the past 2 years.

Indonesia probes possible case of avian influenza
-------------------------------------------------
Indonesia is investigating a possible human case of [avian influenza virus
infection], after a 37 year old woman died showing symptoms of the disease,
the health minister said on Sunday [11 Sep 2005]. If confirmed, this would
be Indonesia's 4th human fatality from avian influenza.
In July [2005], Indonesia became the 4th country in Asia to record human
cases, when a man and his 2 daughters died after contracting the H5N1
virus. Health Minister Siti Fadila Supari said blood samples from the
woman, who died late Saturday [10 Sep 2005], had been sent to Hong Kong for
analysis. The results should be available in several days, she said. "It is
possible it may be a positive (case)," she told the el-Shinta radio
station. After the deaths in July 2005, the government pledged to step up
its monitoring of chicken farms and to cull infected birds to halt the
spread of the disease.
The virus has swept through poultry populations in large swaths of Asia
since 2003, killing tens of millions of birds and 62 people, most of them
in Viet Nam and Thailand. [Up to the] present, almost all of the human
fatalities contracted the virus from poultry. But experts worry it could
mutate into a more deadly virus that could spread from person to person and
potentially kill millions of people around the world.

[Four cases of avian influenza (H5N1) were confirmed in Indonesia prior to
the current case. The previous cases were a single asymptomatic case and 3
fatalities in the same family. The asymptomatic case was a farm employee,
but the circumstances surrounding the fatal infections of the 3 members of
a family living in a suburb of Jakarta remain in doubt. The nature of the
exposure of the current case is unclear from these reports. Confirmation
(or not) of the preliminary diagnosis is awaited. - Mod.CP]
