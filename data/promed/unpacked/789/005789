Discovery of mad cow disease in Denmark has widespread effects
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A cow diagnosed with mad cow disease or BSE has been killed in Jylland,
Denmark. The case was the first in 8 years in Denmark and the rest of the
cows at the farm are under observation. Only 1 case of BSE has ever been
found in Denmark before this, in an animal imported from the UK and it is
not yet clear how the new case is possible.
Denmark is reportedly the tenth country in Europe that has reported BSE and
the first of the Nordic countries to do so. The infected cow was born in
Denmark, which makes the case more serious. There is a risk that other
animals at the farm are infected with BSE, but the period between infection
and disease is long -- up to 6 or 7 years.
Media reports say that all the animals at the farm will be put down. It is
believed that the cow received the infection from the fodder. Danish
consumers have been advised to throw away beef from fridges and freezers
and a number of products have been removed from the Danish shops.
New slaughter procedures have also been introduced in the country -- the
spinal cord, eyes, brain, the spleen and parts of the intestines will be
removed from all cows slaughtered, as these are the parts that are most
dangerous if the animal is infected.
The Finnish ministry of forestry and agriculture is not worried about the
BSE discovered in Denmark, although about 3.8m kilos of beef was imported
from Denmark to Finland last year. The ministry is currently awaiting the
investigation results from the Danish authorities.
In Sweden, all imports of Danish beef have been stopped and grocery stores
have removed the meat from the counters. It appears that the storeowners
want to be sure that the meat is safe and imports have been stopped until
further information is provided. There have been suspected cases of BSE in
Sweden, but when the animals have been tested none were infected. The
Norwegian authorities are expected to ban the import of Danish beef
shortly. The Norwegians have also been warned against eating any Danish
beef bought recently until the authorities have said it is safe. The food
inspection (naeringsmiddelstilsyn) has said the import ban will be enforced
unless there is further information.
