[Moderator's note: in 1995 Zhu Ling was diagnosed through the Internet as having thallium poisoning. This is an update regarding this young woman. - Mod.TG]


With a population base of 1.3 billion people, China has no shortage of strange and gruesome crimes, but the attempted murder of Zhu Ling by thallium poisoning in 1995 is burning up China's social media long after the trails have gone cold. Zhu Ling, a brilliant and beautiful sophomore attending one of China's most prestigious colleges at the time, is now bed-bound and nearly blind. The only suspect questioned by police was [her] roommate, whose family is rumored to be politically connected. Police quickly released her and she now reportedly lives in the US. The case has been brought to the Chinese public's attention again because of a recent poisoning case in another elite Chinese college. (That case was quickly solved).

Hundreds of thousands of Internet users sympathetic to Zhu are now pursuing their version of justice through online vigilantism -- by exposing personal information of the suspect, by tweeting and commenting on the case on China's micro-blogs, and even, by petitioning the White House.

The case inflamed passions because it touched on the question of judicial independence in China -- many assume that the suspect got off because of privilege and connections. The censors blocked the search term "Zhu Ling" on Sina Weibo on [6 May 2013], but perhaps realizing that the move only further fanned anger at political interference in the case, Sina unblocked the search term about a day later. Soon afterwards, China's Party-controlled mainstream media outlets also published interviews and investigative reports on the case.

Some Internet users are taking the mainstream coverage of this case as a sign that the authorities will heed the Internet users' call to re-open this case. However, even if the case is re-opened, accusations of manipulation and interference may continue. As was true in the cases of Yao Jiaxing and Li Gang, calls for justice for Zhu Ling have become an outlet of popular anger against China's privileged class, whom many believe can act above the law. The only path to judicial fairness in China, according to many Internet users, is to make their voices heard online.

The Zhu case certainly proves that online vigilantism works, at least as far as getting mainstream media attention is concerned. However, it also demonstrates a Catch-22 for those waiting for justice to be done in China -- making a splash online may be the only way for victims of crime to get the attention of the public, but online vigilantism could take on a life of its own by reaching a foregone conclusion without the benefit of a full investigation. And that could ultimately cloud the truth.

[There are several ways for exposure to thallium to occur -- through ingestion of contaminated food, through workplace exposure, and through environmental contamination/exposure. Oftentimes work place exposure is associated with inhalation of the substance, which can result in a higher exposure level, which in turn may lead to neurologic system involvement. Ingestion of thallium usually results in a lower level exposure with resultant gastrointestinal involvement such as vomiting, diarrhea, and often there is a temporary alopecia (hair loss) associated with the ingestion.

Thallium is a metal and may be obtained from the smelting of other metals. It is generally used in electronic devices and the semiconductor industry. It has also been used for special glass manufacturing. As a pure metal it is odorless and tasteless, but it is often found in combination with other substances such as bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine. When it's combined, it appears colorless-to-white or yellow.

When there is environmental contamination with thallium, usually associated with the smelting process, it remains in the air, water, and/or soil for a prolonged period of time. Rain or snow may remove it from the atmosphere, but it is still available for plants as well as fish and shellfish to absorb it from the environment.

In humans the results of low dose chronic ingestion has not been well characterized. Ingestion of large amounts of thallium in a short period of time has resulted in hair loss, gastrointestinal effects, as well as effects on the nervous system, the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. It can result in death.

To date there have not been reports of birth defects resulting from pregnant women exposed to low level contamination of food products such as fruit and vegetables. However, developmental and reproductive effects associated with low level contamination of food products have been documented in rats. Studies on rodents suggest the male reproductive system may be susceptible.

Industrial exposure is most often associated with inhalation of the substance but it is not known if short time high level exposure impacts on human reproduction. The impact of exposure to thallium via skin contact has not been well characterized in either humans or animals. As thallium is a soluble substance there is the theoretical concern that there would be absorption through skin contact.

There have not been studies in either humans or laboratory animals addressing the issue of thallium as a carcinogenic substance. Blood, urine, and hair may be tested for thallium exposure. Treatment includes Prussian blue or ferric ferrocyanide.

Thallium is used in rodenticides (poisons) in some parts of the world. In the United States it is available through appropriate medical channels. - Mod.TG]
