Indonesia: 2nd avian influenza case in critical condition
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman was in critical condition on Mon 8 Jan 2007 after
being hospitalized with bird flu, a health official said. It was
unclear how she contracted the virus. The 37-year-old is the 2nd
person to be sickened by the disease in less than a week, said I
Nyoman Kandun, the Ministry of Health's director general of
communicable disease control. The other was a 14-year-old boy, Kandun
said, adding that both are from the industrial city of Tangerang on
the western outskirts of the capital, Jakarta and are being treated
at the Persahabatan hospital.
"The woman is now in critical condition," said Kandun. We are still
trying to track down the source of infection," he said.
Indonesia has reported 76 people infected with the deadly H5N1 bird
flu strain, and 57 of them have died -- more than a 3rd of the
world's total -- since the disease began ravaging Asian poultry
stocks in 2003. International experts have accused Indonesia's
government of not doing enough to tackle the virus, which they fear
may mutate into a form that could spread easily between humans and
potentially kill millions around the world.
However, the number of infections and deaths has dropped sharply in
the past 3 months, a situation partly attributed to a national
campaign to increase public awareness and vaccinate poultry.
