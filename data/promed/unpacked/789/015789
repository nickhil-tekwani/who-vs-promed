Slovenia sends bird flu samples for testing
-----------------------------------------------
Slovenia has sent samples of avian influenza H5 found in a swan to
Britain for further tests to see whether it is of the highly
pathogenic variety, the European Commission said on Sunday [12 Feb 2006].
"The Slovenian authorities today [12 Feb 2006] informed the European
Commission of a confirmed case of avian influenza virus H5 in (a)
swan," the Commission said.
The area where the swan was found is less than 10 km (6 miles) from
the Austrian border, the Commission said.
The Commission said the Slovenian Laboratory for Avian Influenza made
the 1st analysis and sent samples to the EU Reference Laboratory for
Avian Influenza in Weybridge, Britain.
Dead swans discovered in Greece, Italy and Bulgaria tested positive
for the highly pathogenic version of the H5N1 strain of the virus on
Saturday [11 Feb 2006].
The Commission said Slovenia was taking similar measures to those 3
countries, including establishing a 3 km (2 mile) protection zone
around the area where the swan was found and a surveillance zone of 10 km.
"The Slovenian authorities are in close contact with their Austrian
counterparts, since the 10 km area crosses the Slovenian-Austrian
border," the Commission said.

H5N1 Confirmation Likely at Bulgaria's Seaside
-----------------------------------------------
Tests are almost certain to prove the presence of H5N1 bird flu at
Bulgaria's seaside, the head of the national veterinary service says.
Samples from the swans found in northeast Shabla will be sent to the
Weybridge laboratory in the UK next Tuesday [14 Feb 2006], Zheko
Baychev said on 12 Feb 2006.
Results are expected by the end of next week [See the Ref. lab's
statement, in 20060211.0451, regarding information on when results
may be expected. - Mod.AS]
Meanwhile, Shabla's lakes were quarantined, and local authorities
braced for the possibility to start culling domestic poultry.
In case of an outbreak, the birds will be killed with gas and then buried.
The area is expecting the delivery of 250 placards warning of bird flu danger.
On Saturday [11 Feb 2006], the infection was confirmed in a swan
found near Vidin, on Bulgaria's western Danube riverside. On the same
day, test results also confirmed the 1st H5N1 cases among wild birds
in Greece and Italy.
No human infections were reported in the 3 countries, but the
outbreak raised concerns that the spread of the disease could
increase the risk of mutation into a form easily transmissible among humans.

Bird flu cases, precautions in Europe
-----------------------------------------
Greece and Italy said on Saturday [11 Feb 2006] they had found swans
with the H5N1 bird flu virus, the 1st known cases in the European
Union of wild birds with the deadly strain of the disease.
Following are the latest key facts about the status of bird flu in Europe:
Azerbaijan - Azerbaijan, a state that lies on a crossroads between
Asia and Europe, reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 last Friday.
Azerbaijan said the virus had been found in wild birds in the Caspian
Sea near the Absheron peninsula and off the southern Massaly region,
near the border with Iran. [Data on the species involved will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
France - France extended its poultry confinement measures last month
[January 2006] to 58 departments of the 96 in mainland France, from
an original 26.
Germany - Earlier this month [February 2006], Germany ordered poultry
to be kept indoors from 1 Mar 2006 for at least 2 months to protect
German flocks.
Greece - Greece confirmed on Saturday [11 Feb 2006] cases of H5N1
bird flu in 3 dead swans found around the Thermaikos Gulf south of
the northern port city of Thessaloniki.
Italy - Italy said on Saturday [11 Feb 2006] that 5 wild swans found
in Sicily and on the southern mainland had tested positive for the
highly pathogenic version of the H5N1 strain.
The Netherlands - The Netherlands said last week it would order
poultry producers to keep animals indoors from around March 2006 to
protect them from the threat of avian flu from migrating birds.
Romania - Romania said on Saturday [11 Feb 2006] it had found new
cases of suspected bird flu in fowl in the Danube delta, where the
disease was 1st detected last October [2006]. The delta is Europe's
largest wetland and lies on a major migratory route for wild birds.
Russia - Russian President Vladimir Putin told the government last
month [January 2006] to take measures to prevent a new outbreak.
Russia has been battling with bird flu in poultry since July 2005,
culling more than 600 000 domestic fowl, but no case of human
infection has so far been registered in Russia.
Ukraine - Officials in the Crimea peninsula said last month [January
2006] they had detected new cases of bird flu among wild birds in the
port of Sevastopol. More than 200 000 birds have been destroyed in
Ukraine since the H5N1 virus was discovered in a dozen villages in
northeastern Crimea last year [2005]. Further difficulties are
expected when migratory birds pass through Ukraine on their way north
in the spring.

[4] UK - precautionary measures

Statement On Avian Influenza (bird Flu) And The New Poultry Register, UK
-----------------------------------------------
1. Defra is closely monitoring global developments on avian
influenza. Taking account of the latest incidents in Eastern Europe,
our current risk assessment remains that the overall risk of an
imminent outbreak in the UK of avian flu (H5N1) is increased but
still low. However, there is a high risk of further global dispersal,
and future events may lead us to change our risk assessment. That is
why we constantly keep alert to developing factors and are ready to
act if necessary.
2. Defra is working in close partnership with the UK poultry
industry, independent experts and others to ensure that the UK is
thoroughly prepared to prevent an outbreak of avian flu and has
robust plans in place to contain and eradicate it if it does occur.
With these partners, we have issued leaflets and posters to poultry
keepers on how they can protect their flocks. We have used specialist
journals and representative bodies to get these messages to hobby
groups and small and non-commercial keepers and have provided
information materials to intermediaries, such as posters for
veterinary surgeries.
3. In December 2005, we launched the Poultry Register. Its purpose is
to provide a central database of information on poultry premises.
This information will only be used for preventing and controlling
avian flu, more specifically: to improve our risk assessment and
contingency planning; and to enable effective up to date
communication with poultry keepers.
4. Keepers with 50 or more birds have a statutory obligation to
register. Priority has been given to these flocks because, if
infected, they could act as significant sources of disease spread, as
they are large enough for virus to circulate and multiply
sufficiently to spread infection through movement to or other
contacts with another premises.
5. Small flocks have a low likelihood of contracting avian flu if
good biosecurity practices are followed. Even if disease were to
occur in small flocks, the risk of further spread would likewise be
very small. Backyard flocks in the UK are kept in different ways from
the village flocks of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, where some
poultry keepers have been infected through intimate contact with
infected birds. However, we are encouraging all owners of flocks of
fewer than 50 birds to register voluntarily to enhance the value of
the register to all concerned, both in terms of improving contingency
planning and improving our ability to communicate with poultry keepers.
6. In the event of an outbreak there would be movement restrictions
that would apply to all birds in the area. SVS patrols will identify
any flocks that should have registered but did not, including any
small poultry flocks.
7. As with all our communications on avian influenza, poultry keeping
organizations have played an important role in promoting the register
to their members. They have circulated thousands of leaflets and held
events to raise awareness of the need to register and implement
strict biosecurity. This activity will continue over the coming
weeks, including advertisements in local press and specialist
magazines, several of which have also published editorials urging
readers to register. The deadline for registering flocks with 50 or
more birds is 28 Feb 2006. However, we are keeping the register open
after this date to allow voluntary registrations to continue.
8. Everyone keeping poultry should follow the biosecurity advice that
has been made available and take commonsense hygiene precautions as a
barrier to disease. It is important to remember that the UK is free
from avian influenza, and we want to keep it that way. Meanwhile, if
there are any suspicions of avian flu, poultry keepers should report
them to the local Animal Health Divisional Office immediately.
[The said statement has been initially published on 1 Feb 2006].

Greece, Italy, Bulgaria - swans
Date: Sun 12 Feb 2006

Bird Flu Detected in Greece, Italy and Bulgaria
-----------------------------------------------
The lethal A(H5N1) bird flu virus has been detected in wild birds in
Italy and Greece, European officials announced yesterday [11 Feb
2006], the 1st time its presence has been detected in the European
Union. It was also detected in Bulgaria.
"The bird flu virus has arrived in Italy," said Francesco Storace,
the Italian health minister, at a news conference, announcing that 17
swans had been found dead in 3 southern regions, Calabria, Sicily,
and Puglia. [Other media sources mentioned 20 to 22 swans. - Mod. AS]
Testing at the National Avian Influenza Lab in Padua determined the
cause to be the A(H5N1) virus, he said, although it was not clear
whether all 17 swans had been tested.
The arrival of bird flu in Western Europe had been predicted for some
months, since the virus has marched steadily from China, to Russia,
to the Balkans and, in the last week, to West Africa. It is being
carried by migrating birds, so all countries on their flight paths
are vulnerable.
"In some ways, we would have expected it earlier in Italy," said Dr.
Juan Lubroth, a senior veterinarian at the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization in Rome.
The Italian outbreak seems to have been a model of early detection,
underlining how bird flu can be controlled in countries that have the
money and the scientific resources to do it.
Recent outbreaks in poor countries like Nigeria, Turkey and Iraq have
percolated for months before they were discovered, allowing the virus
to spread widely to commercial chicken flocks and even to humans.
While the A(H5N1) virus currently does not readily spread from human
to human, scientists worry that it will mutate into a form that can,
setting off a devastating worldwide human pandemic.
Only about 160 people have become infected with the disease, mostly
through close contact with sick birds, and about half of them have
died. In Italy, police officers near Messina, in Sicily, found 2 dead
swans on Thursday [9 Feb 2006] and performed rapid screening tests on
them in the wild, which suggested that the swans had a flu virus,
according to ANSA, the official Italian news agency. Such simple
tests are not specific enough to indicate a particular virus or
strain, like A(H5N1). [Are Italian police officers trained/engaged in
the performance of rapid AI screening tests? Clarification and
details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
The carcasses were immediately sent to a veterinary institute in
Palermo, the Sicilian capital, which sent samples to the lab in
Padua, where the positive test results were returned yesterday [11 Feb 2006].
In the wake of the tests, Mr. Storace prohibited all movement of live
animals in the affected regions. There are no signs of infection in
commercial poultry yet, he said.
"There is no immediate danger for our country, because our system of
surveillance is efficient and has not contaminated bird farms," Mauro
Delogu, an Italian virologist at the University of Bolgona, told ANSA.
In Greece, health officials announced that 3 swans in the northern
part of the country tested positive for the virus, and hours later,
European Union officials said some swans in Bulgaria, near the Danube
Delta, did as well.
Dead swans have become an important flu sentinel, because they are
very susceptible to the virus and are so large that people notice
when they die, Mr. Lubroth said.
Swans in southern Italy do not normally migrate, he said, but their
wetlands are along many bird migration routes.
Last autumn [2005], several European nations, including Switzerland,
Austria and the Netherlands, mandated that all commercial poultry be
kept indoors to prevent any contact with migrating birds. Greece now
requires that poultry be kept indoors and bans the sale of live birds
at street markets.
Trying to calm public fears, the European Union's health
commissioner, Markos Kyprianou, said: "We should not be unduly
surprised or alarmed if such cases are found in the European Union.
What is important is that we have the framework in place to take the
appropriate measures as soon as possible to contain it and prevent
its spread to poultry, and that is what we are doing."
Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said she was not surprised that infected
birds had been found in southern Europe.
"I view that as an expression of how birds fly," she said. "It's just
like West Nile marching across the U.S.; you follow the flight patterns."
The variant strain of the A(H5N1) flu found in Turkey and confirmed
in Africa last week is identical to one found last year [2005] in
dead migratory birds in a nature reserve in northern China and later
in Siberia. It is different from strains circulating among poultry in
Southeast Asia and Indonesia.
2 species of ducks, the northern pintail [_Anas acuta_, picture at
<http://bailey.aros.net/nature/images/Northern%20Pintail%20reduced.jpg>]
and the garganey [_Anas querquedula_, picture at
<http://www.nicksworldofwaterfowl.com/clip_art_files/Garganey%20male2.jpg>],
migrate in a southwesterly direction each fall from Siberia to Turkey
and the Black Sea coast, and in some cases to central Africa,
according to a recent article in New Scientist. Other species that
share the same African wetlands migrate north in the spring, which
raises the threat that the disease will be spread more widely around
Western Europe later this year [2006].
But movements are unpredictable. Dr. William B. Karesh, director of
the field veterinary program for the Wildlife Conservation Society,
which runs New York City's zoos, noted that northern pintails from
Siberia were also found from East Africa to Britain, which suggests
that some picked it up from domestic flocks during the fall migration.
"The simple presence of the same species of wild birds in 2
geographic areas does not indicate a transmission route," he said.

[Swans have been reported to be clinically affected by the H5N1 virus
in Mongolia, Russia (Astrakhan region), Romania, Croatia, Bulgaria,
Greece and Italy and currently suspected in Slovenia. Die-off in
swans is under investigation in Iran. Updates will be appreciated).
As suggested by Dr. Lubroth, swans might have become H5N1 sentinels
because they are (probably) very susceptible to the virus and are
easily detected when dying, due to their size/color. The hypothesis
that the disease is spread by resistant species (ducks?) which
function as carriers covering relatively long distances, infecting
susceptible avians (eg. swans) while sharing common wetland
"pastures" along their migration routes, is in need of scientific
evidence. This is a repeated reminder of the urgent need for
cooperative investigatory effort by virologists, epidemiologists,
avian-health specialists and ornithologists. - Mod.AS]
