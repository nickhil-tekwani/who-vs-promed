[This message received from Dr D. Lavanchy, Influenza Focal Point, WHO/EMC
(Geneva), is the 2nd answer to PACNET RFI of 21/01/98 on the influenza
vaccine to be used in the southern hemisphere this year. It is reinforcing
what has been explained by Dr A. Hampson in his answer of 22/01/98. Many
thanks to both Dr Lavanchy and Dr Hampson for their clarifications - TK
[... The vaccine composition for the southern hemisphere indicated in your
message is correct. However, WHO does not issue recommendations for the
southern hemisphere. WHO publishes in September each year a summary of
influenza viruses circulating and investigated by the WHO collaborating
centres since the recommendation in February. This summary is part of the
basis used by the Australian authorities to update the vaccine composition
for the southern hemisphere. For temperate climates in the southern
hemisphere, the recommended period for influenza immunization is April-May.
For tropical climates the epidemic activity is less clear. Influenza can
be an all year phenomenon, however multiple peaks of activity are observed,
sometimes in relation with augmented rainfalls. For travelers,
immunization is therefore recommended one month before traveling, for
locals there is no clear policy as this would depend of the local
epidemiological activity pattern, when it is known.
