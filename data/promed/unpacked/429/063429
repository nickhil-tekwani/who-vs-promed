Last month [February 2019], Myanmar health officials reported a measles death in a young child in Mandalay region, according to local media. In 2017 and 2018, Myanmar reported 1293 and 1330 measles cases, respectively. About 75% of these cases were in those under 15 years of age.

From 17-28 Feb [2019], health officials held a measles supplementary immunization campaign in 7 townships of Yangon region. Yangon region accounted for about 50% of cases nationwide [in 2018]. The campaign targeted from those from 9 months up to 15 years of age in the townships of Hlaingtharyar, Insein, Mingaladon, Dagon East, Dagon Seikkan, Dagon South and Shwepyithar.

Measles has risen dramatically in Myanmar in recent years. In 2014 and 2015, 122 and 6 cases were reported in the country, respectively. This of course has risen to more than 1300 cases last year [2018]. Health officials say the cumulative number of unimmunized children in Myanmar reached a level where the country would face measles outbreak.

Health authorities seek passengers on Cathay Pacific Hong Kong-Tokyo flight [1 Mar 2019] after a man [said to be a Cathay Pacific flight attendant] contracted measles, a contagious disease. The man tested positive for the immunoglobulin M antibody that confirms a measles infection. He was admitted to St Paul's Hospital in Causeway Bay after he returned to Hong Kong. He was later declared to be in a stable condition and discharged.

This is the 11th case of measles confirmed in city this year [2019] with at least 7 infections imported. Authorities seek passengers on the Cathay Pacific flight who might have had contact with the 23 year old man.

A Taipei resident in her 20s has been confirmed to be infected with measles and is suspected of having had contact with 247 people during the incubation period, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The woman, who works at a restaurant in the ATT 4 Fun shopping center in Taipei's Xinyi District might have been infected through coming into contact with foreign tourists in her workplace, said CDC deputy director-general Lo Yi-chun in a statement issued on Mon [11 Mar 2019].

To date, 247 people considered to have had contact with the patient, including her family, colleagues and health care personnel, have been traced. The contact tracing will continue until 27 Mar [2019]. The CDC alerted people who used the same bus and had been to the same places the patient visited to beware of possible exposure to the measles virus. It asked those who might have had contact with the woman to conduct self-health management for 18 days.

The reported new case has brought the total number of confirmed measles cases in Taiwan to 29 since the beginning of this year [2019], 16 contracted at home and 13 from abroad. Among the 16 indigenous cases, 8 have been linked to imported cases, the CDC said.

Lo reminded the public that measles is highly contagious and now is the peak transmission season. Outbreaks in some Asian countries have been growing, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, China, India and Indonesia, he said. As of 24 Feb [2019], the number of measles cases in Japan has risen to 258, the highest in the same period since 2009, Lo added.

Measles in Japan from 1st to 7th epidemiological week, 2019 (as of 20 Feb 2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Japan aims to maintain measles elimination status that had been verified internationally in March 2015, based on "Guidelines for the Prevention of Specific Infectious Diseases: Measles" issued by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in December 2007.

The number of measles cases reported was between 1 and 9 cases per week since the 35th week of 2018. However, the number has increased rapidly (22-47 cases per week) since the 2nd week of 2019, and has comparatively increased faster than the cases identified during the Okinawa outbreak in April 2018, as of the 7th week of 2019. This report is to provide details of the recent epidemiological situation of measles in Japan based on the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID).

In Mie Prefecture where the outbreak occurred from the beginning of 2019, multiple measles cases (secondary infection) were reported from the participants of a meeting that was held in December 2018. After that, cases were reported from among contacted persons such as family members or at hospitals and schools. In Osaka Prefecture, where they reported more cases than Mie Prefecture, multiple outbreaks have occurred. It was reported that a salesperson of a shopping facility had measles, and the patient spread measles to colleagues and customers in February 2019. There are other measles cases reported in several prefectures, and press releases followed.

The Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division of the Health Services Bureau at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has alerted the local authority that there are some possibilities of new measles cases in a wide range of areas due to mobility of patients (regarding the alert associated with the increase of reported number of measles cases on 18 Feb 2019, request for cooperation).

The number of reported measles cases was 221 in the 1st to 7th weeks of 2019 (as of 20 Feb 2019). Of those, 197 cases (89%) were laboratory confirmed (158 measles, 39 modified measles). Of these, 108 were males, 113 were females, and the median age was 23 years (range, 0-72 years). The numbers of reported cases by prefectures are 77 Osaka, 49 Mie, 20 Aichi, 14 Tokyo, 9 Kyoto, 8 Kanagawa, 7 Wakayama, 5 Gifu and Hiroshima, 4 Chiba, 3 Hokkaido, Ibaragi and Shizuoka, 2 Tochigi, Saitama, Shiga, Hyogo, Nara and Okinawa, and 1 Iwate and Kumamoto.

The probable infected areas are 170 Japan (13 unknown prefecture) and 33 outside Japan (13 Philippines, 8 Vietnam, 3 Myanmar, 2 Maldives, and 1 Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Malaysia, 2 Sri Lanka/Maldives, 1 Thailand/Laos), 3 Japan/overseas (2 Aichi/Philippines, 1 Aichi/New Caledonia), and 15 unknown Japan or overseas. As for vaccination history, 84 (38%) had not been vaccinated, 72 (33%) unknown, 38 (17%) received 1st dose, and 27 (12%) received the 2nd dose.

Of the 27 who received the 2nd dose, 15 had mild and atypical measles (modified measles). Among the 84 who had not been vaccinated, 81 had typical measles; of them, 70 were laboratory confirmed.

As of 21 Feb 2019, 73 cases of measles virus genetic information were sent to the Infectious Agents Surveillance System. The genotypes detected were 69 (95%) D8, 3 (4%) B3, and 1 (1%) not typed.

For prevention against measles from spreading in Japan, individual protection and maintenance of herd immunity are crucial. To do so, it is most important to enforce 2nd-dose vaccination by using measles and rubella combined vaccines. In addition, early detection of measles cases and rapid response are indispensable. The other important factors are appropriate diagnosis, rapid investigation and response through contact tracing with cooperation of related organizations right after even one case is reported, and informing local medical facilities and advocating local residents for prevention. Information sharing among related local authorities is important in case of possible diffuse outbreaks.

Especially in the area where a measles case is reported, infection control should be strengthened in the medical facilities. The vaccine records of all medical staff, including clerical staff, should be checked and recommended vaccination as needed. Any person who develops measles-like symptoms such as fever and rash after having contact with measles-suspected cases should make a phone call to a medical facility before presenting himself/herself and inform of the possibility of measles to prevent secondary infection.

[6] Nepal (Dhading District)
Date: Mon 11 Mar 2019
From: Sher Bahadur Pun, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal [edited]


On 10 Mar 2019, a 29 year old male resident of Dhunibesi Municipality-6, Dhading District, visited the outpatient department (OPD) of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) according to a scheduled follow-up visit. He was admitted (on 14 Feb 2019) to STIDH with a history of fever, rash (after 3 days of fever), which was 1st seen in back of the neck followed by face, trunk and limbs. Body ache, dry cough and red eyes were other associated symptoms that developed prior to admission. Measles was suspected but not confirmed by laboratory testing during his hospital stay. He visited the OPD with a positive anti-measles IgM report.

According to the patient, nearly half a dozen other residents (all adults) of that municipality are being treated in different hospitals in Kathmandu [for] a "measles-like illness", meaning [that] a measles outbreak may be occurring in that area (municipality).

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) late last week said several European countries are reporting an increase in measles cases in recent weeks, with 4 nations reporting more than 100 cases in January [2019]. For January [2019], 19 countries reported a total of 881 measles cases, with 10 reporting no cases, ECDC said. Romania, Italy, Poland, and France had the highest case counts with 261, 165, 133, and 124 cases, respectively.

ECDC said overall the case counts were markedly up compared with November and December of 2018, with Italy, Poland, and Austria recording the largest increase in case numbers. From February 2018 to January 2019, Italy has recorded 22% of all measles cases reported in the European Union.

In the past year, ECDC said 77% of all measles cases occurred in unvaccinated case-patients. "Measles continues to spread across Europe because vaccination coverage in many countries is suboptimal," ECDC said. "Only 4 EU/EEA countries (Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, and Sweden) reported at least 95% vaccination coverage for both doses of in 2017."

https://globalnews.ca/news/5047526/italy-mandatory-vaccination-law-school/


Unvaccinated children are now banned from attending preschool in Italy, as a new law came into effect this week. The law, passed in 2017 by a previous government, requires children to be vaccinated against 10 diseases in order to attend daycare and nursery school. Without the shots, they must stay home. Older children can attend school without being fully vaccinated, but parents face fines of 100 to 500 EUR [USD 113-567], and local health authorities will then schedule vaccinations for the children to make sure they catch up.

The required vaccinations are polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, pertussis, measles, rubella, mumps, chickenpox and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B. Children who are unable to get vaccinated due to medical reasons are exempt from the requirement. The deadline for parents to provide proof of vaccination was on Mon [11 Mar 2019], according to news reports.

The goal of the law, according to a government website, is to fight the gradual decline in Italy's vaccination rates. A recent report from ECDC found that Italy reported 165 cases of measles in January 2019, one of the highest numbers in Europe.

Italy's current government, which includes the Five Star Movement, had previously questioned the safety of some vaccines and denounced efforts to make them mandatory. It threatened to overturn the mandatory vaccination law passed by the previous government but ended up scrapping its plans in the face of criticism as the country experienced a measles outbreak last summer [2018].

New data from Italy's health ministry suggest that the laws are making a difference, with 94% of children having at least one dose of the measles vaccine in June 2018, up 2% in just 6 months as parents may have vaccinated their children in anticipation of the new requirements.

In British Columbia, Canada, which is currently experiencing a small measles outbreak, parents started a petition calling for mandatory vaccinations to attend school. However, the British Columbia government has said that it is planning to only require mandatory reporting of vaccination status in the upcoming school year.

Statement from the chief public health officer of Canada, Dr Theresa Tam, on the current measles outbreak and vaccine hesitancy, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"As Canada's chief public health officer, I [TT] am very concerned to see vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly those as serious and highly contagious as measles, making a comeback in Canada and around the globe. From my perspective, even one child dying of measles is unacceptable.

"In an era where, thanks to the success of vaccines, we are no longer familiar with these dangerous illnesses, some parents have come to fear the prevention more than the disease. Seeds of doubt are often planted by misleading, or worse, entirely false information being spread in campaigns that target parents on social media and the Internet. It is no wonder some parents are confused and concerned. Parents want only the best for their children, always. Some parents may question, hesitate or delay vaccinating their children for a variety of reasons, but they all want to protect their children from harm.

"Yet over the past few weeks, we have heard Canadian parents speak to the media about watching their children suffer through a vaccine-preventable disease. Some have spoken of difficult recoveries that have taken weeks or months, sometimes leaving permanent disabilities, and, heartbreakingly, some have spoken about losing their children.

"Sadly, as a paediatric infectious disease specialist, I have witnessed the devastating effects of vaccine preventable diseases on the lives of children and their families. Healthcare providers are on the front lines of this battle between truth and misinformation. We must support parents as they tease apart fact from fiction. How we talk to parents who have questions about vaccines can have a direct effect on improving their confidence and supporting them in getting their children vaccinated.

"I urge my fellow healthcare provider colleagues to take the time to answer the questions of concerned parents, and in turn, I urge parents and guardians to ask questions and seek out trusted and reliable sources of information to help guide them. To that end, I am including links to some top Canadian websites providing credible information on vaccines.

"Keeping Canadians, especially our children, healthy and free from disease is our shared priority. In the weeks and months ahead, I will work with partners and stakeholders to continue to address the misinformation around vaccines. The health of our children and of our country deserves nothing less."

[11] USA: lawsuit
Date: Wed 13 Mar 2019
Source: Ars Technica [abridged, edited]
https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/anti-vax-parents-sue-to-keep-unvaccinated-kids-in-school-during-outbreak/


As New York's Rockland County grapples with a large and lengthy outbreak of measles, a group of anti-vaccine parents sued officials for temporarily barring their unvaccinated children from school -- and the county is not having it. In a fiery response, Rockland county attorney Thomas Humbach forcefully defended the legality of the county's move, which was intended to thwart the spread of disease. He also went so far as to cast doubt on the validity of the religious exemptions the parents had used to opt their children out of required vaccinations.

"The [Rockland county health] commissioner, Dr Patricia Ruppert, has every legal right, under New York State's Public Health Law and the County's Sanitary Code, to take every necessary step to stop the outbreak of measles in this County," Humbach said in a statement released to the press.

"[T]he right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death," Humbach wrote. Moreover, he added, "[t]hese religious exemptions run the gamut from references to organized Christian doctrine to a generalized spirituality. As the case progresses, we expect several of the exemptions to be challenged, as not evincing a sincere religious belief against vaccination."

Rockland's battle with measles began late last September [2018], when an international traveler arrived with a suspected case. Since then, other international travelers have arrived in the county with the extremely infectious, sometimes-fatal disease.

In all, the county has confirmed 145 cases of measles, almost all of which are in children and teens (84%). That includes 22 cases (15%) in infants less than one year old -- the age when babies can receive their 1st dose of vaccine against measles. Overall, around 90% of those infected are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. The remaining 10% of infected people had an unknown vaccination status.

In efforts to contain the outbreak, officials issued an order in December [2018] that barred unvaccinated children from schools that did not reach a minimum of 95% vaccination rate. According to the order, the exclusion of unvaccinated children would end if the area went at least 21 days without a new case. With the fast pace of the outbreak, the exclusion time could be increased to 42 days.

The order affected the private Green Meadow Waldorf School. According to county records, Green Meadow's vaccination rate was about 33% at the time the order was issued in December [2018]. It has since increased to about 56%.

In the lawsuit, 24 parents of 44 unvaccinated children that attend the school alleged that the order violated their religious objections. They also argue that the order was unnecessary because the school has not had any cases of measles and that the outbreak has largely stayed within the county's orthodox Jewish community and affiliated schools. The Green Meadow school has no religious affiliation but sits within the area most affected by the outbreak.

"The school they attend has not experienced a single case of measles," the parents' attorney, Michael Sussman, told Patch. "We believe that state law forbids exclusions of students except where the school they attend has an outbreak of a communicable disease. That did not happen here."

On Tue [12 Mar 2019], a federal judge in the case denied issuing a temporary injunction that would allow the 44 students to return to school. "The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that public interest weighs in favor of granting an injunction," the judge concluded. He did not immediately set the next court date for the case and reportedly told Sussman that the case may have better success in state court.

Rockland is just one of 6 locations in the country now experiencing a measles outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented 228 confirmed measles cases in 12 states, including New York, since the start of the year [2019].
