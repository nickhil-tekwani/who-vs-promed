MSF Highlights Danger of Sleeping Sickness
------------------------------------------
The NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland (MSF-H) has expressed concern
about the possibility of a re-emergence of sleeping sickness
(trypanosomiasis) on an epidemic scale in the Republic of Congo.
The danger was due to an almost complete collapse of the national
prevention and control programme since 1996, during which not only active
screening stopped but treatment and vector control (of the tsetse fly) were
also interrupted, it said in its July situation report. In addition, there
were 3 civil wars during the 1990s, and attendant excessive population
movements in and out of traditional foci of the disease, including the
Plateaux/Pool area and others bordering the DRC, it added. In November
2000, the MSF-H sleeping sickness programme was started - the NGO returned
to Congo-Brazzaville in February last, having left the country in 1997 -
and, as of May, was undertaking both passive and active screening, the
latter through a mobile team based in Gambona.
From April to July, 2001, 163 new cases were admitted for treatment in
Gambona, with 146 later released cured. In addition, a mobile team
continued screening activities in Plateaux area, along the River Congo, in
Mpouya, Bodzeka and Makotipoko. Over 300 more patients were diagnosed
during active screening (up to 31 Jul 2001), of whom about 175 had finished
treatment by 1 Aug 2001, MSF-H reported. Among the issues to arise during
the screening of the first 8 villages was why perhaps 3 times as many
patients had phase one of the illness, and whether or not that meant that
phase-2 patients were dying or going elsewhere (perhaps the DRC) for
treatment, it said. During the remainder of August and September, the
agency intends to undertake further screening in the Plateaux; additional
decentralised treatment in Mpouya and Makotipoko; undertake exploratory
missions to Ngabe and Bounze; assess the feasibility of vector control
interventions; and develop proposals for a second phase of the sleeping
sickness programme, it added.
West African (Gambian) sleeping sickness is a serious disease that is fatal
if not treated, though symptoms may not appear for months to years after
the initial infection. Initial symptoms include swollen lymph nodes,
swelling of face and hands, skin rash, fever, severe headaches, muscle and
joint pain, and fatigue. Neurological damage [encephalitis occurs during
the second stage, in which the victim can experience personality changes,
slurred speech, changes in sleep patterns, progressive confusion,
difficulty with walking, and seizures. Sleeping sick-ness has a profound
impact on the health of a large portion of sub-Saharan Africa, with an
estimated one third of the population of Africa living in tsetse
fly-infested areas. The economic impact of sleeping sickness is also
significant owing to the dramatic reduction in the labour force and
resulting decrease in economic productivity - apart entirely from a
reduction in cattle production of between 20 percent and 40 percent in
areas where the disease is epidemic. (It is estimated that
cattle-production losses alone amount to $2.7 billion each year.)
