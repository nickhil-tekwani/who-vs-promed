For the 1st time, African swine fever (ASF) was found in domestic pig populations nationwide. These are holdings in the Brandenburg districts of Spree-Neisse and Märkisch Oderland. The state of Brandenburg announced this in a press release late on Thursday evening (15 Jul 2021).

The 2 animal holdings affected were closed by the responsible veterinary authorities and the necessary measures were initiated. The virus was initially detected by the Berlin-Brandenburg state laboratory. On Thursday evening (15 Jul 2021) the national reference laboratory, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), confirmed the suspicion of ASF.

The Federal Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that, due to the regionalization principle within the EU, there is still the possibility of intra-Community trade in pigs and pork, since the affected domestic pig populations are in the same regions as the previous ASF cases in wild boars.

"I would like to thank the local authorities for their quick and consistent action. It is now important that we quickly find the cause of the entry into the pig population so that we know which route the virus took. The necessary investigations have been initiated and are supported by the Task Force of the State of Brandenburg and specialists from FLI, who we immediately asked for help. The fact that the cases were apparently found quickly shows that the animal disease monitoring is working," explains the Brandenburg consumer protection minister, Ursula Nonnemacher.

In the organic farm in the Spree-Neisse district, the virus was detected in a dead animal as part of the ASF monitoring. By order of the responsible veterinary office, 200 animals of the herd are expected to be killed and harmlessly disposed of.

The case in the district of Märkisch Oderland involves a small-scale holding with 2 animals. The pig farmers can be compensated by the animal disease fund.

The state of Brandenburg has been struggling with the epidemic pressure from Poland for almost a year. "The solid fence along the Oder and Neisse [rivers] is closed, we now have 6 core areas in Brandenburg in which we contain the ASF by systematically searching for and removing fallen game," explains Nonnenmacher. Unfortunately, an outbreak in domestic pig populations could not be entirely ruled out.

The Brandenburg consumer protection minister appeals to all pig-keeping herds to continue strictly adhering to the biosecurity measures, especially in small farms, in order to avoid further outbreaks in domestic pig holdings.

So far, African swine fever has been found in a total of 1501 wild boars in Germany but domestic pigs have not been affected.

[The German authorities have commendably managed to prevent the introduction of the ASF virus, circulating within the wild boar population in German states bordering Poland, into pig farms since its initial introduction from that country in September 2020.
