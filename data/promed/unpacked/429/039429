For foodies [often used by the media as a conversational synonym for
gourmet] across the world, it's a bad news. [A killer disease has hit
the much-savoured cultured shrimps reared in the coastal belt of
Olpaad taluka in Surat.]

The outbreak of the white spot syndrome (WSS)*, a highly lethal and
contagious disease killing shrimps quickly, has set alarm bells
ringing for shrimp farmers as shrimp exports of around 900 tonnes
from some 40 percent [of the] farms in Olpaad have been affected. The
loss has been estimated at Rs 30 crore [Indian rupees 300 million,
USD 7 615 421].

[*The disease is designated by the OIE (World Organization for Animal
Health) as white spot disease (WSD), while the causative agent as
White spot syndrome virus (WSSV). - Mod.AS]

The aquaculturists are not ruling out the fact that almost all the
farms in the area that export 2000 tonnes of shrimps annually are
susceptible to the virus transmission. If this happens, then the
farmers fear that the outbreak may wipe out the entire population of
the shrimp farms in Olpaad incurring losses of Rs 70-80 crore [USD
17.7 - 20.3 million].

Olpaad taluka in Surat district exports around 2000 tonnes of tiger
prawns [_Penaeus monodon_; for background, including picture, see
FAO's (UN Food and Agriculture Organization) factsheet
<http://www.fao.org/fi/website/FIRetrieveAction.do?dom=species&fid=3405>.
- Mod. AS] -- reared in some 1400 shrimp ponds -- to Europe, the US,
Japan, South Africa, and Gulf countries.

This is the 1st time that the aquaculturists in Olpaad are facing
such a situation. Earlier, some 85 shrimp ponds in Samapur village in
Navsari district that exports shrimps worth Rs 5 crore [USD 1.3
million] had been affected following the outbreak of WSS in April
2007.

Although the cause of the outbreak is difficult to investigate,
farmers told ET that some of the farmers had bought low quality
shrimp seeds at cheap prices from the suppliers in Mumbai and that it
might be responsible for the outbreak of the disease.

The transmission of the virus is mainly through oral ingestion and
water-borne routes in farms and infected mother prawns in case of
shrimp hatcheries. The virus is present in the wild stocks of shrimp,
especially in the coastal waters adjacent to shrimp farming areas,
but mass mortality of wild shrimps is yet to be observed.

Experts said the clinical signs of WSSV in the shrimps include a
sudden reduction in food consumption, lethargy, loose cuticle and
often-reddish discoloration, and presence of white spots of 0.5 to
2.0 mm in diameter on the inside surface of the carapace, appendages,
and cuticle over the abdominal segments.

The virus has a wide host range, is highly virulent, and leads to
mortality rates of 100 percent within days in case of the cultured
shrimps. The 1st reported epidemic due to this virus is from Taiwan
in 1992, followed by the outbreaks in India in 1994-96 that
[seriously affected] the shrimp industry.

The shrimp farmers in Olpaad are taking serious bio-security measures
by using large numbers of disinfectants to prevent an outbreak,
disposing of the crops in proper manner, etc. Meanwhile, the district
collectorate has sent a team to take stock of the situation. A senior
officer said: "Samples have been collected from the farms and sent
for clinical testing to confirm the virus."

[WSD outbreaks were 1st reported from farmed _Penaeus japonicus_ in
Japan in 1993; later, outbreaks of viral disease with similar gross
signs and caused by similar rod-shaped viruses were reported from
elsewhere in Asia -- including the People's Republic of China,
Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, India, the Philippines -- and the USA. The
causative agent of WSD is designated as White spot syndrome virus
(WSSV) 1. For further information, subscribers are referred to
