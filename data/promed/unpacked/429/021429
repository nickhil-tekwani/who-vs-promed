An epidemic of pertussis, or whooping cough, has killed 42 people and
infected about 400 in northern Guatemala, a public official said Tuesday.
Chajul Mayor Manuel Asicona was in Guatemala City to plead for help from
the government of President Alvaro Arzu. The health ministry sent teams to
Indian towns in the thinly populated north to fight the disease. "The
health situation in Chajul is a disaster because there are no vaccinations,
no medicine or health personnel," he said in an interview. Most of the
dead and ill are children or young people, said Asicona, who acknowledged
that some help was coming from people who had made the lengthy trek,
portions of it by donkey. "But it's very little since it is difficult to
get to the towns because there are no highways and the area (of the
epidemic) is very remote," he said. The affected area has been
quarantined, said epidemiologist Weldemar Velez. Pertussis, identifiable
by a peculiar whooping noise made as the person breathes in after coughing,
can be prevented by use of vaccinations and treated with antibiotics.
Children are most vulnerable to the disease.

[The case fatality rate suggested by this report is high. Assuming that
the diagnoses are correct, this outbreak serves to remind us of the danger
of pertussis in unvaccinated children. Sometimes emotional discussions of
the pros and cons of vaccination tend to forget the lessons of history. -
