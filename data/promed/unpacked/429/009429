Between 2003 and 2007, a yearly average of 6 cases of West Nile virus
neuroinvasive infection were diagnosed in Hungary. In 2008, 14 cases have
been confirmed by the end of October. In contrast with previous years the
infection has now appeared also in the north western part of the country,
which is endemic for tickborne encephalitis.

Case descriptions
-----------------
On 19 Sep [2008] the Hungarian reference laboratory for viral zoonoses
reported the first 2 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) neuroinvasive infection
in Hungary in 2008. As of 31 Oct [2008] a total of 14 confirmed cases were
identified in accordance with the European Union case definitions. In all
14 confirmed cases fever was accompanied by neurological symptoms. The
clinical diagnosis for these cases included: serous meningitis (8 cases),
encephalitis (4), meningoencephalitis (1), tickborne encephalitis (1). All
patients, except one, were treated in hospital and all recovered.

Eight of these cases occurred in August and 6 in September. The first case
developed symptoms on 14 Aug [2008]. The last patient was infected in the
2nd half of September (date of onset 24 Sep [2008]).

The age of cases ranged between 16 and 80 years (median 52); 10 cases were
male and 4 female. [Of these,] 4 cases were residents of the Hajdu-Bihar
county, 2 were living in Budapest, but supposedly exposed in the incubation
period at the lake Balaton (Veszprem county) or in the Matra mountains
(Heves county), 2 in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok county, and single cases were
identified in Csongrad, Pest, Fejer, Gyor-Moson-Sopron, Vas and Zala
counties. The geographical distribution of cases contrasts with previous
years; the infection has now appeared also in the north western part of the
country, where tickborne encephalitis is endemic.

Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
To date, detailed epidemiological investigations have been performed for 12
of the 14 cases, using a disease-specific case investigation form. None of
these cases had travelled abroad during 3 weeks before the onset of
disease. There was no history of blood transfusion or tissue/organ
transplant. None of the cases was vaccinated against yellow fever or
tickborne encephalitis (as WNV belongs to the same genus of the family
Flaviviridae, the presence of antibodies against one of these viruses may
influence the course of illness caused by another virus of the same genus).
No person with high fever or neurological symptoms has been identified
among household or other contacts of the cases. Of the investigated cases,
7 reported a history of mosquito bite.

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
Investigations at the national reference laboratory for viral zoonoses
found IgM and IgG antibodies against WNV [see original for titre size] in
samples from 14 cases using indirect fluorescent antibody and
haemagglutination inhibition tests. Titration of antibodies was performed
in parallel tests for tickborne encephalitis and WNV. These were thus
considered confirmed cases of WNV infection.

Results of laboratory investigations of samples taken from another 5
patients with suspected WNV infection are still pending.

In a seroprevalence study conducted in Hungary in 1999 the presence of WNV
antibodies was found in 30 of the 5312 persons examined (0.56 per cent).
The majority of people with antibodies were residents of the south eastern
part of the country (Alfold), including Pest, Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok,
Hajdu-Bihar, Bacs-Kiskun, Csongrad, and Bekes counties. As now the virus
has also appeared in TBEV endemic western territories of the country (such
as Gyor-Moson-Sopron, Vas, Veszprem, and Zala counties), more caution is
needed to avoid the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon (such as
controlled vaccination against TBEV of persons previously infected by WNV).

Conclusion
----------
The activity of the vector as observed at the end of the season has been
very low, so further new cases of WNV infection are not expected to occur
this year [2008]. The number of cases registered this year has been higher
than in the past 5 years but still rather low.

[WNV infections continue to occur in southern Europe, the most recent cases
having occurred in Italy (see ProMED archives listed below). No mention of
equine cases is made in this report, although plans include equine
surveillance in the areas where human cases occur.
