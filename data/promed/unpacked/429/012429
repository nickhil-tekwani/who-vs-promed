On 8 Sep 2006, the Georgia Division of Public Health (GDPH) and CDC were
notified of 3 suspected cases of foodborne botulism in Washington County,
Georgia. On 25 Sep 2006, the Florida Department of Health and CDC were
notified of an additional suspected case in Tampa, Florida. This report
describes the joint investigation and control measures undertaken by state
and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On 8 Sep 2006, the 3 patients from Washington County, Georgia, went to a
local hospital with cranial nerve palsies and progressive descending
flaccid paralysis resulting in respiratory failure; the patients had shared
meals on 7 Sep 2006. On the evening of 8 Sep 2006, physicians suspected
foodborne botulism, notified the state health department, and collected
clinical specimens for testing at CDC. On the same evening, CDC provided
clinical consultation and dispatched botulinum antitoxin, which was
administered to each of the patients the following morning. After receiving
antitoxin, the patients had no progression of neurologic symptoms, but they
remain hospitalized and on ventilators.
On 9 Sep 2006, the Washington County Health Department, Richmond County
Health Department, and GDPH launched an investigation. The 3 patients had
consumed several food items during their 2 meals together on 7 Sep 2006,
including juice from a single 1-liter bottle of Bolthouse Farms carrot
juice. The bottle had a "best if used by" date of 18 Sep 2006. Clinical
specimens and leftover food and juice were collected and sent to CDC for
testing. On 13 Sep 2006, botulinum toxin type A was identified in the serum
and stool of all 3 patients. On 15 Sep 2006, leftover carrot juice
recovered from the home of one of the patients also tested positive for
botulinum toxin type A.
During 8-15 Sep 2006, FDA, the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the
Georgia Hospital Association, and public health officials in all 50 states
were notified of the outbreak and the implicated product as information
became available. After these notifications, no additional cases of
botulism in Georgia were reported to the state and local health departments
or to CDC.
During this time, FDA launched an investigation of the Bolthouse Farms,
Inc., manufacturing plant in Bakersfield, California. FDA and CDC tested
other bottles of the implicated brand of carrot juice, including bottles
from different lots, and all were negative for botulinum toxin. Because
botulinum toxin was found only in the bottle of carrot juice consumed by
the 3 patients, a lapse in refrigeration of the carrot juice bottle during
transport or storage was suspected, which would have allowed for growth of
_Clostridium botulinum_ and subsequent production of botulinum toxin. Based
on the CDC test results, on 17 Sep 2006, FDA issued a consumer advisory on
the importance of keeping carrot juice refrigerated. However, information
obtained from patient interviews regarding storage and transport of the
carrot juice did not confirm mishandling by the patients.
On 25 Sep 2006, officials at the Florida Department of Health, the
Hillsborough County Health Department, and CDC were notified that a patient
had been hospitalized in Tampa, Florida, on 16 Sep 2006, with respiratory
failure and descending paralysis. On 28 Sep 2006, botulinum toxin type A
was identified in the patient's serum. Circulating toxin persisted more
than 10 days after illness onset in this completely paralyzed patient,
indicating ingestion of a massive toxin dose. Accordingly, the patient was
treated with antitoxin, which prevents binding of circulating botulinum
toxin to nerve endings. The patient remains hospitalized, paralyzed, and on
a ventilator.
The Hillsborough County Health Department collected an open, 450-mL bottle
of Bolthouse Farms carrot juice, which had been found by a family member in
the hotel room where the patient had been staying during the month before
being hospitalized. The hotel room had no refrigerator. The bottle, which
had a "best if used by" date of 19 Sep 2006, had a different lot number
than the bottle associated with the Georgia cases. On 29 Sep 2006,
botulinum toxin was identified in carrot juice from the bottle found in the
patient's hotel room; the toxin was subsequently identified as botulinum
toxin type A. The Hillsborough County Health Department and CDC notified
FDA, public health officials in all 50 states, and infection-control
practitioners in Hillsborough County about the botulism case and implicated
product. The manufacturer provided FDA with bottles of carrot juice from
the same lot as the bottle found in the patient's room. FDA tested juice
from all of these bottles, and it was ne!
gative for botulinum toxin.
_C. botulinum_ spores are found in the environment and can be present
naturally in carrot juice and other foods that have not undergone the
retort canning process, which involves high temperatures and high pressure.
Anaerobic conditions, low acidity (pH greater than 4.6), low salt and sugar
concentrations, and temperatures greater than 39 degrees F (greater than 4
degrees C) promote germination of _C. botulinum_ spores and botulinum toxin
production. Carrot juice has low acidity, with a natural pH of
approximately 6.0; therefore, in the absence of another inhibitor,
refrigeration at temperatures less than 40 degrees F (less than 4 degrees
C) is necessary to prevent germination of _C. botulinum_ spores and
production of botulinum toxin. Inhibiting _C. botulinum_ growth in other
ways, such as through acidification, can retard its growth in juice that is
not properly refrigerated.
Acidification has been used as a solution to previous foodborne botulism
outbreaks. In 1985, 36 patients in the USA and Canada were identified with
botulism after eating at a restaurant in Vancouver, British Columbia. A
case-control study implicated commercially produced, chopped garlic in
soybean oil stored at room temperature as the source of the outbreak (1).
In 1989, a 2nd outbreak of botulism associated with chopped garlic in oil
occurred when 3 patients in New York were identified with botulism after
consuming a meal containing unrefrigerated, commercially produced, chopped
garlic in virgin olive oil (2). After these outbreaks, FDA rules were
altered to require that garlic-in-oil products contain an acidifying agent
such as phosphoric or citric acid.
The carrot juice consumed by these 4 patients was manufactured by Bolthouse
Farms, Inc., and distributed in all 50 states, Mexico, Canada, and Hong
Kong with the labels "Bolthouse Farms 100 Percent Carrot Juice,"
"Earthbound Farm Organic Carrot Juice," and "President's Choice Organics
100 Percent Pure Carrot Juice." Investigations of these cases by state and
local health departments and investigations of the manufacturer by FDA are
ongoing. On 29 Sep 2006, GDPH and the Georgia Department of Agriculture
recommended that Georgia residents not purchase or consume Bolthouse Farms
carrot juice. The same day, the FDA warned consumers not to drink Bolthouse
Farms carrot juice with "best if used by" dates of 11 Nov 2006 or earlier
(i.e., all bottles produced before the date the warning was issued), and
Bolthouse Farms issued a voluntary recall of these products.
Additional information regarding the recall is available from the Bolthouse
Farms website at <http://www.bolthouse.com/bolthouserecallFAQ.pdf> or from
FDA (telephone, 888-723-3366).
Suspected botulism cases should be reported immediately to local or state
public health officials, who then should call the 24-hour CDC Emergency
Operations Center at 770-488-7100; the center will immediately connect them
with an on-call botulism specialist. Health-care providers and public
health officials are encouraged to inquire specifically about consumption
of carrot juice as part of the food history of suspect botulism cases.

[This dispatch in MMWR provides much more information than what was
available in earlier ProMED postings and stresses the need for
refrigeration of products that are supposed to be kept cool.
Botulism is an intoxication, usually with a foodborne preformed toxin,
caused by one of a number of types of _C. botulism_ neurotoxins. Types A,
B and E are the most common, the latter primarily associated with fish or
marine mammal food sources. Each neurotoxin consists of a 2-chain
polypeptide linked by a disulfide bond. The larger polypeptide (heavy
chain) is identical for all the toxin types. The smaller polypeptide (light
chain) varies for each toxin subtype.
Within a nerve ending, where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine transmits
the neural impulse, are a series of proteins that are necessary to allow
the synaptic vesicles to bind with the nerve endings to allow release of
the acetylcholine. These proteins include SNAP-25, VAMP, and syntaxin.
Botulinum toxin types A and E lyse SNAP-25; botulinum B lyses VAMP.
Two commerically available botulinum toxins are available at very low
concentrations to be used therapeutically. Botulinum Toxin A, commonly
referred to as "Botox", is licensed by the FDA particularly for
blepharospasm and wrinkles. Botulinum Toxin B, commonly referred to as
"Myobloc" or "Neurobloc", was more recently licensed by the FDA for
cervical dystonia. - Mod.LL]
