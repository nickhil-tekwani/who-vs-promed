After a new strain of bluetongue disease was confirmed on 24 Oct 2008 on 4
cattle farms in the region of Overijssel in the eastern part of the
Netherlands at the border of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, this
virus has now also been detected on 3 cattle farms in the immediate
vicinity, in the border county Bentheim.

It was assumed that the BTV 6 infections [in the Netherlands] have been
caused by the illegal use of a BTV-6 vaccine. If a live vaccine has been
used illegally, it remains to be clarified whether this is a circulating
infection. In the 4 affected cattle herds from the Netherlands, clinical
symptoms have occurred. Furthermore, these farms are not connected with
each other.

Yesterday [Wed 5 Nov 2008], the Friedrich Loeffler Institute demonstrated
the BTV serotype 6 genome in 4 samples of cattle from Bentheim county.
Virus isolation and further genetic characterizations are under way.
Because of the location of the farms, Lower Saxony and North
Rhine-Westphalia are affected by the relevant EC legal restrictions. The
Dutch ministry of agriculture has established restricted zones for trade in
susceptible animals (ruminants). In Lower Saxony and North
Rhine-Westphalia, 3 zones (20 km, 50 km and 150 km around the affected
holdings) are established where certain surveillance activities and
movement restrictions for susceptible animals are in place. These zones are
adapted accordingly to disease development.

An overview by the local veterinary authorities on the measures that have
to be applied are available on the website
<http://66.102.9.104/translate_c?hl=de&sl=de&tl=en&u=http://www.tierseucheninfo.niedersachsen.de/&usg=ALkJrhhdzbJtqFkrdSc18I1fzomrz59ZeA>
under the "Bluetongue Chapter". More information about this disease and the
legal requirements can be found there. In Lower Saxony, there are around 17
900 cattle, sheep and goat farms with a total of about 1.36 million cattle,
83 000 sheep, and 4500 goats, which are affected by the current restriction
zones.

The European Commission plans to reevaluate the situation and measures on
11 Nov 2008.

Following the discovery of bluetongue serotype 6 (BTV-6) [in the
Netherlands], the disease has now emerged in Germany as well.

Cows positive to this serotype have been found on 3 holdings in Bentheim
county, adjacent to the Dutch border.

It is not known how these animals got infected. Lower Saxony's Ministry of
Agriculture has taken into consideration infection through midges
introduced from the Netherlands or [locally applied] illegal vaccination
with a live vaccine.
