At least 99 people have contracted salmonella at St. Louis Children's
Hospital, although the specific source of the intestinal illness
remains a mystery. The number of cases could rise because several
people are still being tested, a hospital spokeswoman said. The
cafeteria at the hospital was closed on 6 Jun 2003 after city health
officials learned that 3 hospital employees were sick. The hospital
has tested more than 400 people who visited it or ate in the
cafeteria since 1 May 2003. The cafeteria reopened on 15 Jun 2003.

[The source of this outbreak of salmonellosis has yet to be
determined. Although the implication is that the hospital cafeteria
was the source of the pathogen, there is no direct information to
support this hypothesis.
This health care delivery organization is located in western St.
Louis, adjacent to Forest Park and close to restaurants of various
kinds and sizes. An appropriate foodborne outbreak investigation
using a questionnaire such as the one on the CDC website could be
quite useful when applied to those who acquired the pathogen and
those who did not.

Although the cafeteria in the hospital might be a suspect, many
visitors and staff could have acquired the infection at an extramural
site. Additionally, several other points could be quite instructive
in helping to rule in or out the hospital itself as the source, such
as: did food handlers who denied eating the cafeteria food have the
same strain in their stool? and were patients who did not eat food
from the outside affected? - Mod.LL]
