Robin die-offs in Central Texas baffle biologists
Scientists suspect birds overdose on alcohol-spiked berries
-------------------
A mysterious killer has left a trail of dead robins from Dallas to San
Antonio, stumping state wildlife biologists attempting to crack the case.
Pesticides, a common killer, were ruled out. So was West Nile virus because
the mosquitoes that transmit the disease have been zapped by cold weather.
Tests run by 2 laboratories were inconclusive.
Now scientists are wondering whether the birds succumbed to a junkie's fate
-- overdosing on alcohol-spiked berries or hallucinating on fruits plucked
from exotic bushes in the back yards of suburbia.
"The bird gets stoned," said Cliff Shackelford, an ornithologist with the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which has been investigating reports
of dead robins along the Interstate 35 corridor since mid-January 2003.
One of the largest die-offs occurred near downtown Waco, where several
hundred birds were discovered dead.
No bird deaths were reported to the state from Houston.
"It's not much different than a drunk driver," Shackelford said. "The birds
just sit there and the cat can get them ... the car gets them."
Each year millions of robins born in southern Canada, the Great Lakes and
Northeast make the trek to Texas, settling for the winter in areas with the
most abundant food.
Die-offs happen periodically, due to bacteria flare-ups and the stresses of
migration, but this particular death spell was more pronounced because of
the size of the robin population, which was pushed higher this year by the
harsh winter gripping the North, state wildlife biologists said.
With more competition, some robins gorge on foods that in a normal year are
not as prevalent in their diet. Some of these plants cause the same side
effects that college freshmen get after downing too many tequila shots,
Shackelford said.
The problem is that the state may never be able to prove it. There is no
equivalent to the blood alcohol test for birds, since their digestive
system processes berries and alcohol rapidly.
"I don't know what other tests we can do," Shackelford added. "When they
keep coming up negative, we don't have the resources."
And while it is a common belief that birds get drunk on berries that
repeatedly freeze and thaw -- [fostering] a process called fermentation
that converts sugar to alcohol -- some scientists question whether the
fruit is a high enough "proof" to kill them.
"The evidence that there is enough alcohol in the berries to kill them is
not there," said Jesse Grantham, a biologist and director of bird
conservation for Audubon Texas. "They think grapes, berries, alcohol ...
the birds are drunk. I've never seen a study saying birds are dying of
alcohol intoxication."
Grantham said the cause is more likely that the birds are feeding on
non-native ornamental shrubs that contain toxins that American birds
weren't designed to stomach. Examples include Chinese tallow, firethorn
(_Pyracantha coccinea_), and chinaberry, he said.
"Most of the die-off is in suburban areas where people plant ornamental
shrubs," Grantham said. "There are some hazards to planting non-native
species in your yard."
And the reason birds would die in Central Texas and not near Houston, a
state biologist said, is that the soils support different types of shrubs.

[Although birds can become intoxicated from fermented berries, and it is a
springtime phenomenon; even for Texas this is extremely early. The berries
mentioned in the article are characteristically the culprit. So alcohol
intoxication is probable. - Mod.TG]
