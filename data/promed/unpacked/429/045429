Symptoms of an undiagnosed disease that has affected dozens of
people, mainly children, in Chechnya's Shelkovskaya district have
been recorded in 2 more communities in the same district.
A schoolgirl was taken to Shelkovskaya district hospital from
Privolnoye early on Saturday, and a female worker from school No. 1
in the village of Chervlyonnaya was also reported to be sick, the
Shelkovskaya district hospital told Interfax on Saturday.
90 people have shown similar symptoms in the district over the past
several days. 7 people have been discharged from the district
hospital after their health status improved.
Some patients are staying at children's hospital No. 9 in Grozny and
a number of others are at different hospitals.
Certain doctors are of the opinion that the disease is psychogenic in
nature, and have criticized journalists for facilitating its spread.
"Journalists are to blame for everything as they are showing patients
on TV," Musa Dalsayev, an associate professor from the medical
department of the Chechen State University said at a government
commission session on Friday evening.
"On seeing the sick children on TV, viewers develop similar
symptoms," Dalsayev said. "Don't mess around here, let us
professionals work and the problem will be resolved within a week,"
he said addressing journalists.
The spread of the disease has been a source of increasing concern for
the Chechen population, despite active efforts taken by the
government commission to explain the possible reasons behind the
disease to locals.

An outbreak of disease among Chechen children in the republic's
Shelkovskoi district is of psychogenic nature, first deputy director
of the Zashchita /Protection/ all-Russia disaster medicine center
Ivan Sakhno told Itar-Tass.
"There's no evidence to confirm that the affliction was caused by
poison gas; it's a purely psychological reaction, foremost explained
by hardships over the past few years, and is typical for women. It's
a psychological breakdown confirmed clinically; as fits stop after
sedative therapy," Sakhno said.
He noted that convalescing and preventive measures against the
recurrence of such cases require a complex therapy, foremost rest.
At present, authorities are discussing the arrangements to send
children to health centers during the winter holidays.
The most important thing now is to calm the people, and explain the
situation at Chechen schools, Sakhno said.
Meanwhile, the tests carried out by Dagestani medics found ethylene
glycol in the blood of 5 patients, which they said might have caused
the disease. But a conference of Moscow doctors and army medics in
Chechnya said these conclusions were erroneous.
"The results of analyses carried out in Dagestan found ethylene
glycol, but it could not possibly cause the affliction from which the
children are suffering," chief doctor of Chechnya's children hospital
Sultan Alimkhadzhiyev told Itar-Tass on Friday.
"It can be found in juices or other beverages as a dye component, but
in this case it does not cause such side effects," he added.
Latest reports said the strange illness had sickened 83 people in
Chechnya. 22 of them were rushed to the children's hospital.
Experts announced a preliminary diagnosis: pseudoasthmatic syndrome
of psychogenic nature.
The first cases of the disease with strange symptoms were reported on
October 24, when 8 pupils from the village of Staroshchedrinskaya
were taken to a district hospital.
