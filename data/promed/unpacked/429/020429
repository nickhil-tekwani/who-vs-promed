Bird flu found in 18 Canadian farms
------------------------------------
The virus found on 18 farms in the Fraser Valley region in the western
province of British Columbia has been confirmed as bird flu, Canadian
Agricultural Minister Bob Speller said Friday.
The government will decide within days on an industry proposal to slaughter
up to 16 million farm birds in an effort to halt the rapid spread of the
virus in the region, Speller said.
But authorities have no plans at the moment to extend the radius of the
current high-risk control zone beyond the original 5 km around Abbotsford
in the region, he said.
12 of the 18 infected sites were in the original zone, the minister said,
without specifying the locations of the other 6.
About 500 000 chickens and turkeys had been slaughtered by Fri 2 Apr 2004.
The massive expansion of the culling program would raise the question of
how to dispose of the millions of potentially infected carcasses. Experts
hope that incinerators could be brought in to the region.
According to local reports, poultry contributes nearly 1 billion US dollars
to the province's economy per year, with 80 percent of it coming from the
Fraser Valley region. Hundreds of workers in the industry have already been
laid off due to the outbreak of bird flu, and the number is expected to
increase.
Ray Nickel, the president of the Poultry Committee of British Columbia
Province, said the industry is losing an average of about 2 million dollars
a week, and hatcheries are losing nearly 200 000 dollars a week.
