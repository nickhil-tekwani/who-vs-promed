A 15-year-old boy died and 37 others from a village in Beaufort district
have been admitted to hospital after swimming in a stream near an oil palm
plantation over the weekend.
This has sparked off alarm in Kampung Kebatu, about 115km from here, as
villagers now are afraid to use the stream where they have been bathing for
many years.
The health and environment departments sent teams to the village yesterday
following the tragedy.
The victims were all males although females were also in the group.
The dead boy was a Form Three student of SMK Beaufort.
His father said yesterday that his son died on the way to the Queen
Elizabeth Hospital on Monday morning. He said The boy and his friends had
gone for a dip in the stream. "He was fine on Saturday evening when he came
home," the father said, adding that his son began suffering from high
fever, dizziness and vomiting on Sunday morning.
The father said when the boy became very weak after vomiting blood, they
rushed him to Beaufort Hospital where doctors said that he was suffering
from ruptured lungs and kidney. He said the following day the doctors sent
him to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital but the boy died on the way there. "My
son was an active and healthy boy," said the father, adding that others who
swam in the stream that Saturday had complained of similar symptoms as the
boy.
Since Sunday, Beaufort Hospital treated a stream of people from Kampung
Kebatu. As of yesterday, 37 people aged between 11 and 20 had been
hospitalized, with some subsequently transferred to the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital.
"I believe the stream is polluted or poisoned," said another man, whose 12
and 15-year-old sons were hospitalized.
Beaufort district hospital director Dr Tan Enoch said he was in no position
to give details of the condition of those admitted.
Sabah Medical and Health Services director Dr Saimy Ismail said a team was
investigating the matter and he would release a statement today. "We are
checking if it is a contamination of the water or an infection," he said.
Beaufort police said no report has been lodged yet.
