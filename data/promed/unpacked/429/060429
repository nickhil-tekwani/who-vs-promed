Swedish authorities are investigating an outbreak of salmonella infection that has affected more than a dozen people in less than 2 weeks. From 13 Apr 2021 to 24 Apr 2021,14 people have been infected with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup in 10 different regions of the country.

Whole genome sequencing has shown the patients to be linked, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhalsomyndigheten). People sick range from a few months old to 91 years of age, and 10 are women.

Infection control units, municipalities, the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and the Public Health Agency of Sweden are investigating the outbreak. This involves interviewing patients to find out what they ate the week before falling ill, with the aim of identifying commonalities between them. The source of infection has not been identified but is suspected to be a food widely distributed in Sweden.

_Salmonella_ Braenderup entered the top 20 list of serovars causing confirmed infections in Europe in 2018 with 259 cases and was responsible for 300 infections in 2019.
