Hantavirus Outbreak Causes Alarm in Chile
----------------------------------------
Health authorities in Chile have launched a campaign to control the mouse
population in the capital, Santiago, and other cities after an outbreak of
hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome. One person has died so far from of the
disease and 3 others are seriously ill. The [hantaviruses associated with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are carried by [species of field rodents
and affect the lungs. There is no known cure for the disease, which kills
around 50 per cent of those affected. More than 60 people have died in
Chile because of hantavirus [infection since 1993.

[The principal reservoir host of Andes virus, the hantavirus probably
responsible for this outbreak, is the long-tailed pigmy rice rat
_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. Domestic mice do not carry Andes virus.
Prevention efforts should aim to reduce contact with rural rodent species.

New Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Talca
---------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: The Public Health Institute confirmed that a 20 year old male in
Talca died yesterday as a result of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The
chief of epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Dr Ximena Aguilera,
indicated that this case [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was an
agricultural worker on the Isla of Maipo. At the same time as this
announcement, 2 other suspected cases (a 13 year old from San Clemente in
the Sixth region and a 55 year old resident in the Puente Alto commune)
were not confirmed as cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Dr Aguilera [emphasized that it was difficult to establish the precise
location of infection with the hantavirus, since the incubation period was
unknown. It was also stated that, including this case, 6 cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been confirmed in 2001, a number
slightly in excess of that observed during the year 2000, when 3 cases were
reported in January and 4 cases in February 2000. The number of confirmed
cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome during the period 1993-2001 has
climbed to 134.
