South Korea's severest foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak is
expected to come under control by early March [2011] as nationwide
vaccination efforts take effect, a senior policymaker said Friday [18
Feb 2011].

In a radio interview with a local broadcaster, Farm Minister Yoo
Jeong-bok said the number of FMD cases has started to fall off in
recent weeks after the 1st round of nationwide vaccinations have been
completed on all cattle and pigs.

After the 1st case was reported in late November [2010], Seoul
officially confirmed a total of 147 [now 149; see commentary] cases in
6 provinces and 4 major cities across the country, with 3.37 million
pigs, cows, goats, and deer being culled and buried so far at a cost
exceeding 2 trillion won (USD 1.8 billion)[that's more than USD 500
per head -- seems rather high. - Mod.JW].

"Since the 2nd round of vaccinations that can further raise
resistance to the highly contagious animal disease will be completed
by the end of this month [February 2011], outbreaks should come under
control soon after, although there may be some isolated cases," he
predicted.

But the minister, who said he will resign once the animal disease was
contained, added that there may be a need to continue giving shots to
livestock for 2 to 3 more years.

"As can be seen in Taiwan's case, inoculating animals does not mean
the FMD virus has been completely wiped out," he said.

Experts said that it may cost the government around 100 billion won
[USD 89.9 million] annually to vaccinate the 13 million heads of pigs
and cows in the country every year. [To evaluate the said calculation,
it will be helpful to obtain the price of a single vaccine dose and
the relevant labor costs per vaccination. - Mod.AS]

All burial sites to be inspected over FMD contamination
-------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of eagles were seen flying over the burial sites of pigs and
cows as the stench of the dead animal corpses filled the air.
Residents living near such burial sites where the herds were buried to
stem the spread of FMD saw their tap water sometimes flow mixed with
blood and smelling putrid.

These are some of the recent reports from the epidemic-hit villages,
which raise concerns about a catastrophic environmental aftermath --
massive contamination of soil and water.

To rectify the situation, the government has vowed to conduct an
inspection of all the 4500 burial sites across the nation and "repair"
them, if necessary.

"Remedial action will be taken for sites where animals have not been
properly buried," Farm Minister Yoo Jeong-bok said Friday [18 Oct
2011] in a radio interview, adding inspections will be conducted on
all burial sites by the end of February [2011].

The remark came as a government investigation team conducted its 1st
on-site inspection of 83 sampled burial sites in Gyeonggi, Gangwon,
and North Chungcheong Provinces near the Han River between 10 and 14
Feb 2011 and concluded that 27 sites were at risk of causing
contamination to the soil and water in the region.

The team, consisting of officials of the Ministry of Environment and
Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, warned most of
the inspected sites were also vulnerable to collapse amid the thawing
temperatures due to hasty and shoddy burial procedures.

The government will put 1.4 billion won (USD 1.2 million) into
repairing and removing the burial sites that violated the necessary
quarantine rules. In principle, animals were to be buried in a 4-5
meter-deep hole covered by 2-fold vinyl to prevent anything from
leaking and such burial sites should be far from underground water to
avoid contamination.

But such regulations were frequently violated to stop the speedy
spread of the disease, outpacing the authorities' slaughter capacity.
Consequently animals were buried in mountain slopes and areas near
streams or water reservoirs.

The number of reported appearances of wild boars in cities has
recorded a 3-fold increase in the past 5 years, a lawmaker said Friday
[18 Feb 2011].

Members of the National 119 Rescue Service were sent to capture or
kill wild boars 103 times in 2006, but the number has gradually
increased to reach 384 in 2010, according to Rep. Ahn Hyoung-hwan of
the governing Grand National Party.

"As we have seen an increase in the number of boars seen scavenging
in cities, we need fundamental measures to ensure the safety of
citizens," Ahn said.

Gyeonggi Province posted the most reports with 227, followed by South
Gyeongsang Province with 175, North Gyeongsang Province with 148, and
Seoul with 41.

[The possible role of wild boars in the dissemination of FMD virus
has been recently demonstrated in Bulgaria. It will be interesting to
note if this potential mode of spread has been investigated/excluded
in South Korea.

According to follow-up report no 12, submitted to the OIE on 18 Feb
2011, 149 outbreaks have been recorded in South Korea since the start
of the epizootic at the end of November 2010. See, with interactive
