Argentina: Death from Hantavirus Infection in La Plata City
--------------------------------------------------
A 57 year-old man died as a result of a hantavirus infection in the city of
La Plata, outside of Buenos Aires. Sources from the health department
informed that surveillance for the disease has been redoubled. The man
lived in a rural area in the vicinity of La Plata, capital of the province
of Buenos Aires, where 40 cases of hantavirus infection were recorded in 2002.
Blood samples have been obtained from 7 neighbors to determine whether they
too are infected and whether there is an outbreak of the disease.
The man was hospitalized last Thursday [25 Sep 2003] with symptoms and
signs consistent with hantavirus infection. The diagnosis was later
confirmed by laboratory tests. The patient's condition worsened and he died.
Over the past few days, another resident of the same area was hospitalized
with clinical signs of hantavirus infection but he has already been released.

[The long-tailed pygmy rice rat is a reservoir host for _Andes virus_, a
hantavirus present in Chile and southwestern Argentina to about 50 degrees
south latitude. This virus has been associated previously with cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this region. The cause of death in this
case is presumed to be hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, but this is not
stated directly in the text.- Mod.CP]
