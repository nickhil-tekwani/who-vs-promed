The number of confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ poisoning has now risen to 30
as fears grow that the scare could result in a fall-off in the sales of ham
and pig products. Hundreds of calls flooded into hotlines operated by the
Food Safety Authority and the North Eastern Health Board this weekend from
concerned members of the public over the country's cooked ham _Salmonella_
outbreak.
The NEHB confirmed last night that they are now dealing with 30 cases of
_Salmonella_ poisoning across Meath, Cavan and Louth. To date, 24 cases of
_Salmonella_ have been confirmed in Meath; five in Cavan and one in Co
Louth. The North Eastern Health Board is currently investigating Augherskea
Meats of Navan, Co Meath in connection with the
outbreak.
To date, 10 people have been treated in hospital suffering from _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DTIO4. However, it is understood that all have now been
released from hospital. _Salmonella_ poisoning symptoms include vomiting,
abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. It is crucial to ensure those affected are
given replacement fluids. Consumers have been warned by the FSA not to eat
pre-packed ham until the source of the outbreak is definitely confirmed.
Shops which have cooked ham in stock should also contact their supplier
directly to determine its source.
Augherskea Meats first decided to withdraw all its cooked meat products
from retailers as a precautionary measure. This is normal in _Salmonella_
cases. The plant's cooked ham production line has now been closed pending
the investigation by environmental health officers from the NEHB. The three
big supermarket chains - Superquinn, Dunnes Stores and Tesco - confirmed
that they do not buy ham from Augherskea Meats and said that sales of ham
were unaffected this weekend with staff briefed to reassure concerned
shoppers.
Retailers nationwide are co-operating with the investigation by the NHEB by
returning loose and packaged hams from Augherskea for testing.
