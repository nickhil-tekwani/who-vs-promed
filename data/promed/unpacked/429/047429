RABIES: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
********************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
[We have had two queries on rabies. For convenience & efficiency they have
been bundled together. Would anyone with information please contact the
relevant enquirer directly. Do not reply to ProMED-mail. Thanks. - Mod.MHJ]

Does anyone have information on the incidence of rabies in the bat
population of eastern West Virginia (Capon Bridge area, about 30 miles west
of Winchester, Virginia). The reason for the request is an inquiry about
safety and need for prophylaxis from a camp with a bat infestation in that
area.

Can anyone advise on whether the rabies virus can be transmitted in the
incubation phase by sexual contact (with a human, of course).
We have had a query from a traveller who is worried about this possibility
(groundlessly, it seems - he is much higher risk of other STD's).
I would be grateful for any hard information on this rather obscure and
unlikely issue.
