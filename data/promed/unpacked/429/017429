Amid reports of large number of fever cases being reported in the 3 talukas [subdistricts] of Vadodara, the district administration on Friday evening [5 Oct 2012] confirmed 4 positive cases of chikungunya fever in Shinor taluka.

Earlier, 5 cases of chikungunya were reported in Naswadi taluka 2 months back. Health officials claim that since January [2012], only 11 positive cases of chikungunya have been reported in the district other than the 4 cases reported on Friday.

The district authorities have been receiving reports of rising fever cases from Shinor, Chhota Udepur and Naswadi talukas for the past one week, while some panchayat representatives from Shinor had also approached the district development officer expressing apprehensions of an outbreak of chikungunya [virus infections] recently.

"We have 4 confirmed cases of chikungunya out of 7 samples which we had sent to SSG on Wednesday. But there is no epidemic. We have screened all 1600 households in Shinor taluka in the last 2 days, and have sent another 18 samples for testing," said district development Officer (DDO) Rakesh Shankar.

A day-long medical camp on Friday was also organized.

"Even before we had received confirmation of the 4 cases, 17 medical teams had been placed in Shinor as a preventive measure. An 11-doctor team and an ayurvedic doctor conducted the medical camp today. Sanitation workers have also undertaken a larvae-removal exercise where all water bodies are being checked. In addition, we have also ordered spraying of insecticides in the area," said Shankar.

District health officer (DHO) Dr B R Solanki said the increase in number of fever cases in the taluka was mainly because of change in season and it should not be seen as any outbreak of a fever like chikungunya.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in many parts of India, and sporadic cases occur there frequently, as illustrated by the above report. There is no specific antiviral drug available for treatment of chikungunya virus infections, only supportive care for the acute incapacitating arthralgia that often occurs and may persist for weeks to months. - Mod.TY
