- Tue 13 Nov 2018. Uganda: WHO and Ministry of Health train health workers on compassionate use of the Ebola vaccine
[AllAfrica, WHO; abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201811140169.html

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak escalates in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda is ticking all the boxes to ensure that the country is able to respond effectively should there be a confirmed case of Ebola in the country.

Therefore, this week, the Ministry of Health with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) trained health workers on the good clinical practice (GCP) course. This is designed to prepare health workers to conduct clinical trials with human participants. It is an ethical and scientific quality control course that prepares participants to design, conduct, perform, monitor, audit, record, analyze, and report on clinical trials.

The GCP course is important in the ongoing vaccination exercise because it protects the rights, safety, and welfare of health workers to be vaccinated, minimizes human exposure to investigational products and improves quality of data collection and compilation. Compliance with the standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of the health workers are protected.

In the on-going vaccination exercise, a total of 97 health workers were immunized in Ntoroko district, last week [week of 5 Nov 2018]. This week, 659 frontline health care workers including volunteers working at border points of entry will be immunized in Kasese district [both districts are in Western Uganda].

Despite minor operational challenges, the exercise is going on well and was well received by the district leaders and health workers. In many ways, this vaccination exercise is a "first" for Uganda in that the country is the 1st in the world to deploy the EVD vaccine even before it registers a single case.

This 1st phase of the vaccination exercises will be done in 5 high-risk districts. More districts will be added in the 2nd phase after assessment and upon receipt of more vaccine doses.

- Tue 13 Nov 2018. Merck takes key step toward approval of experimental Ebola vaccine
[Stat News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/13/merck-takes-key-step-toward-approval-of-experimental-ebola-vaccine/
[byline: Helen Branswell]

Merck said [on Tue 13 Nov 2018] that it has begun the process of submitting the evidence it will use to seek approval for its experimental Ebola vaccine, a crucial step in the drug maker's long effort to bring the vaccine to market. The company said it hopes to complete the filing process sometime next year [2019].

The vaccine is currently being used in the troubling Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines. While there are a number of other experimental vaccines, the Merck product is the furthest along in the developmental pipeline, having been shown to be protective in a clinical trial in Guinea at the tail end of the devastating West African outbreak of 2014-2016.

Since that epidemic, WHO has recommended use of the vaccine, designed to generate a quick immune response, in Ebola outbreaks under a "compassionate use" protocol. The vaccine was deployed this spring [2018] in an outbreak in DRC's Equateur province, where 3330 people were vaccinated, and was again put into use to help contain the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu, on the northeastern border of the country.

As of [Tue 13 Nov 2018], nearly 30 000 doses of the vaccine have been used in the North Kivu outbreak, where it is deployed in a so-called ring vaccination approach. Response teams offer vaccine to people who have been in contact with a case -- and their contacts as well -- in a bid to halt spread.

Data are being gathered on the use of the vaccine in the hopes that scientists can determine whether it is helping to contain this outbreak, which has been fueled by ongoing violence in North Kivu. It's too soon to draw conclusions, but last week [week of 5 Nov 2018] the WHO's deputy head of emergency responses, Dr Mike Ryan, told STAT in an interview that to his knowledge none of the contacts of contacts who have been vaccinated have gone on to develop disease.

The [US] Food and Drug Administration indicated in the summer of 2016 that it had given Merck's vaccine, provisionally called V920 [scientific designation: rVSV-ZEBOV], a "breakthrough therapy designation" -- a form of regulatory fast track. The designation allows a manufacturer to meet more frequently with the FDA to discuss the filing, and to submit its material on a rolling basis, as it is ready, rather than waiting for the dossier to be complete before it is filed, all with the aim of speeding the item through licensure.

[3] Rwanda: preparedness
Date: Wed 14 Nov 2018
Source: ReliefWeb, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) report [abridged, edited]

Ebola preparedness emergency plan of action (EPoA) update no. 1 - DREF Operation no. MDRRW017
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:

The MoH has supported training for 300 volunteers in community surveillance and contact tracing and 100 in safe and dignified burials (SDB). Training materials and equipment are not sufficient and there is need to reinforce skills by conducting additional trainings with adequate equipment with the PPE and SDB kits that have been procured through the DREF. This 2nd allocation will ensure that all volunteers are adequately prepared in the event of an EVD outbreak. The operational strategy remains the same as described in the initial emergency plan of action (EPoA).

A. Situation analysis
Nine neighboring countries were put on high alert by WHO and advised that they are at high risk of spread of the virus. Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan, and Burundi are ranked as Priority-1 and as such, have EPoA Operation Update Rwanda: Ebola Preparedness had EVD preparedness DREFs [Disaster Relief Emergency Fund] launch. The 5 other countries -- Angola, Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, and Zambia are Priority-2. Preparedness activities have begun in these countries to ensure countries are able to respond in the event of an EVD outbreak. The Ministries of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners are monitoring and investigating all alerts in affected areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in neighboring countries.

To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighboring provinces and countries.

Population mobility, including cross-border movements, were identified as a significant risk for disease transmission in this outbreak due to the high number of traders, displaced populations, and insecurity caused by rebels and militias in the area (Source IOM, 15 Aug 2018). In addition, the security situation in North Kivu has hindered the implementation of response activities to control the EVD outbreak. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered very high at the national and regional levels.

A total of 11 districts are considered most at risk of the outbreak in Rwanda. These are Rusizi, Nyamasheke, Karongi, Rutsiro, Rubavu (bordering DRC), Nyabihu, Musanze, Burera, Gicumbi, and Nyagatare (bordering Uganda) and Kigali city (comprised of 3 localities). Kigali is also at risk because of the Kigali international airport and high population density of the city.

Rwanda Red Cross Society (RRCS) is part of the National Rapid Response Team (NRRT). The NRRT is the national level coordination team and is composed of the Ministry of Health (MoH)/Rwanda Bio-Medical Centre, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), WHO, RRCS, UNICEF, National Reference Laboratory (NRL), FAO, Epidemiologists, and other partners. Weekly meetings are being held to update and coordinate the response strategies. RRCS was tasked with community surveillance/contact tracing, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB) as well as Psychosocial Support (PSS). RRCS are also implementing infection prevention and control activities, such as decontamination/disinfection of public places and households, as well as health facilities if requested.
