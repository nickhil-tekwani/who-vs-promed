Health officials have confirmed another case [4th] of Legionnaires' disease in a guest who stayed at the Grand Islander by Hilton Grand Vacations in Waikiki.

The 4th case of the disease was diagnosed on 16 Apr [2022], the state Department of Health said today [6 May 2022]. The individual with the disease is a non-Hawaii resident who stayed at the hotel from 16-18 Apr [2022]. The 1st case was diagnosed in June 2021, followed by another in early March [2022] and a 3rd case on 2 Apr [2022].

"Legionnaires' disease can potentially have severe consequences, and we encourage anyone who developed symptoms following a stay at the Grand Islander to contact a physician and DOH," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble in a statement. "We are encouraged that the Hilton has brought in additional experts and is stepping up efforts to pinpoint potential sources of contamination and treat water sources as a precautionary measure."

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by exposure to the _Legionella_ bacteria, which is commonly found in freshwater environments but can spread through water systems such as showers, sinks, hot tubs, and plumbing systems. It can be treated with antibiotics and cannot spread from person to person.

A Grand Islander spokesperson said in a statement, "Our top priority at The Grand Islander is to provide a safe environment for our owners, guests, and team members. To that end, we are working closely with the Hawaii Department of Health as they conduct their investigation. We have also engaged leading experts and, under their direction and in an abundance of caution, are implementing additional precautionary measures at The Grand Islander to ensure our safeguards are in line with best practices."

Those who stayed at the Grand Islander and developed symptoms consistent with _Legionella_ infection are encouraged to get medical attention and report their illness to the DOH's Disease Outbreak and Control Division Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586.

[ProMED posted a report in late March 2022 of 2 confirmed cases of non-Hawaii residents diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease following a stay at The Grand Islander, a hotel located in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii (Legionellosis - USA (03): (HI) hotel 20220328.8702268). The 1st case was diagnosed in June 2021, and the 2nd case was diagnosed on 6 or 7 Mar 2022. The 3rd case was reported in April 2022, and now the 4th case has been reported in May 2022 in guests staying at this hotel.

The source of the outbreak has not yet been established. Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Genotyping the isolates from patients with Legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates to assure frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). We will await further findings from the investigation.

About 20-25% of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and report because its identification implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.

Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.

Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the US, national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease. CDC relies upon state and local health departments to conduct this surveillance; all cases should be reported through National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). See the CDC Legionellosis case report form at https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/surv-reporting/form-instructions.html.

The Grand Islander is an all-suite hotel with each suite having 1-3 bedrooms, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and bathroom. Waikiki is a neighborhood of Honolulu on the south shore of the island of O'ahu in the US state of Hawaii (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki).
