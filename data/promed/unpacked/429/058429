An Italian grandmother and her family have been left paralysed after she accidentally garnished their dinner with a poisonous herb.

[The 66-year-old woman], her husband, daughter, and young grandson were found vomiting, or collapsed and paralysed on the floor, by another family member.

They were rushed to hospital, where they have been put into a medically-induced coma, AFP [Agence France-Presse] reported Italian media as saying.

It is understood that the woman found the poisonous plant, devil's trumpet, in some bushes near a market, and believing it to be a type of bitter green broccoli, took some home and planted it in her herb garden.

She sprinkled it over the family's pasta dinner on Monday [24 Jun 2013]. Shortly afterwards they all began to feel ill.

"I can't forget the image of my mother and sister paralysed on the floor," [the woman's son], is quoted as saying. "I saw my family members falling ill one by one. After my nephew starting being sick, I realised that all of their symptoms were related to something that they had eaten."

Devil's trumpet, or _Datura metel_, is highly toxic and can be fatal if ingested by humans or animals.

The 4 are still in hospital but doctors said they are confident the paralysis would be temporary.

The plant that poisoned a family in the center of Turin yesterday [25 Jun 2013] initially seemed to be belladonna, but instead it was _Datura metel_. A lunch like all others: the grandmother cooking for the family, garnishing a plate of pasta with the leaves from a plant grown in pots in the balcony, probably believing them to be turnip greens. The 4 (grandparents, their daughter, and her 11-year-old son), however, remain severely intoxicated and are still in hospital, in stable condition. The only one to have avoided the incident was the boy's uncle, averse to vegetables. _Datura metel_, commonly called "metel" or "devil's trumpet", is a plant of the _Solanaceae_ family known since ancient times for its hallucinogenic effects. Native to Asia and America, Theophrastus, the 1st to write a botanical treatise known to date, already talked about it for its characteristics. Datura was used in ancient times for religious and shamanic rituals, despite its toxicity being already clear.

[The Latin name for these plants is _Datura_ spp. There are a number of common names, including angel's trumpet, devil's trumpet, Jimsonweed, moon trumpet, and thorn apple, to name a few.

The species referenced in the article has almost completely glabrous leaves and a black or extremely dark purple stem that appears highly polished. It is a very attractive plant and often grows much like a shrub would. It frequently ranges from 2-4 feet tall (60-120 cm).

The plant has an almost worldwide distribution and is very adaptable to many climates and habitats.

There are a number of species with slight differences in the shape of leaves or flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents, in slightly different proportions. Photos may be seen at http://www.wildflowersofontario.ca/jimsonweed1.jpg and http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/images/10292.jpg. The thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at http://i1.treknature.com/photos/11556/datura_metel04.jpg.

The memory tool for jimsonweed intoxication is "red as a beet, dry as a bone" (flushed, hot, red skin) and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in Wonderland, for its hallucinogenic properties). The seeds have been collected by addicts trying to get high because of their hallucinogenic properties. A variety of _Datura_ species are sold ground as herbs and have proven to be quite dangerous. So while an extract or tincture of the boiled seeds may provide some hallucinogenic properties, it may also have fatal effects.

The plant contains a tropane alkaloid (a belladonna alkaloid). These alkaloids are similar to atropine and scopolamine. The plant contains 0.45 percent to 2.0 percent. All human and frequently animals are affected by this plant.

The most common clinical signs are sub-normal temperatures, mydriasis, restlessness, muscular twitching, convulsions, tachycardia, incoordination, paralysis; death can result from respiratory paralysis.

Treatment usually includes activated charcoal to reduce gastric absorption of the toxin and physostigmine to reverse the effects of the toxin. However, in some cases gastric emptying may be necessary.

Many varieties are used as ornamental and often planted in gardens and around walkways. The wild plants may be controlled with appropriate herbicides. - Mod.TG
