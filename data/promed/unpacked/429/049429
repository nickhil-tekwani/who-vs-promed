LIVESTOCK OFFICIALS TRACKING DOWN POSSIBLE DISEASE
Apr. 9/98
Manitoba Co-operator
North Dakota government release
Bismarck, North Dakota State and federal officials have notified two North
Dakota livestock operations that their cattle may have been exposed to a
serious disease threat. Dr. Larry Schuler, North Dakota state veterinarian,
said seven heifers formerly held in North Dakota came from a Rossburn,
Manitoba, herd that was diagnosed with bovine tuberculosis. The Manitoba
herd was recently destroyed. "Canadian officials have informed us that
seven cattle from that herd were sold earlier as part of a group of 82 head
to North Dakota buyers last May," Schuler said. "These buyers' ranches are
now quarantined and the operators are co-operating with us to determine if
other animals may have been exposed." It is not yet known if any of the
seven heifers from the Manitoba herd were in fact infected with TB, but
Schuler said that when the Rossburn herd was destroyed, more than 50 per
cent of the animals were found to have lung lesions caused by TB.
The TB outbreak was initially detected at a Long Prairie, Manitoba,
slaughter plant when lung lesions were spotted on carcasses, which were
then traced back to Rossburn. Dr. Anne Scully, Bottineau, a veterinarian
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, has completed an epidemiological study of the two North Dakota
ranches and has determined that no livestock in the surrounding area have
been exposed.
The two North Dakota buyers later sold the 82 head of cattle, including the
seven heifers from the affected herd, at a South Dakota auction market on
September 23, 1997. The auction house is currently reviewing its records to
locate the buyers and South Dakota officials have been informed of the
situation. Schuler said it is important to trace all contacts that the
seven heifers may have had with other animals to ensure the disease has not
entered the state. "North Dakota has enjoyed a tuberculosis-free status
since the early 1980s," he said. "We are working to maintain this status
which saves our livestock producers thousands of dollars annually in
testing costs and paperwork."
Bovine tuberculosis is a respiratory disease, causing lung lesions, wasting
and eventual death of infected animals. Schuler said the disease poses a
very minimal risk to humans.
