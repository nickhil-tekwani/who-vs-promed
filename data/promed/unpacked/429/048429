Is there a possible relationship to the concurrent "red tide" algal
bloom activity in this region?

I do not know much more about this since the tissues have not been
evaluated here. I was asked about doing some immunohistochemistry to
check for evidence of red tide and said I would be glad to but I have not
been contacted further. Sea World does the manatee necropsies and I
am not sure who is looking at the tissues.
