Update: Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome --- Worldwide, 2003
------------------------
CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are continuing to investigate
the multicountry outbreak of unexplained atypical pneumonia referred to as
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1). Pending development of
confirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case
definition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to
other SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case
definition will be updated periodically as new information becomes
available. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.
As of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases
have been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States
(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:
3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and
surveillance and prevention activities in the United States.
Descriptive Epidemiology
----------------------
As of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see
Figure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81
(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100
suspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before
illness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar
2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or
suspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person
with suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided
medical care to a patient with suspected SARS.
Manifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in
the United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.
patients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to
have pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby
meeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of
the 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24
hours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required
mechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.
Reports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received
by state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are
being monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS
investigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially
to have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete
clinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or
because of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative
diagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory
syncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and
_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been
identified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in
one cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible
transmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).
Enhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel
---------------------------------------------
As a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to
Hong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but
essential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that
persons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong
Kong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further
notice.
To detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States
from these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have
implemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in
English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to
approximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline
flights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform
disembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these
countries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to
seek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and
cough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their
health-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have
been reported.
Laboratory Investigations
----------------------
Efforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously
unrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,
isolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are
being developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected
SARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to
anti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed
and are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory
studies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory
Network have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is
consistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human
metapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have
detected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses
in the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.
MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
The number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,
continues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and
households continues in some areas, and transmission within communities
(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete
understanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in
the United States have focused on early identification of potential cases
through surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in
health-care settings and the community.
CDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.
health-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on
experience in the United States to date and will be revised as more
information becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and
clinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should
consult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.
Transmission in health-care settings has been documented in several
countries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after
close contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control
precautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce
transmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of
patients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and
ambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for
triage of potential SARS cases are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.
In the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to
health-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with
suspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the
home and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public
areas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.
Additional guidance for these patients is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.
The majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized
clinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality
proportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).
Possible explanations for this include differing case definitions among
countries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to
identification in the United States of patients with less severe or early
manifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with
other respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is
available, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely
to identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including
antiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have
been administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has
not been determined.
Health-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case
definition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes
of respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes
activity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of
uncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory
pathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should
notify their state health departments if these patients receive
confirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.
Information on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with
possible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.
Airline travel
----------
The potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.
Transmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)
during air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew
reports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might
board the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the
passenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the
passenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected
SARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health
authorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for
information about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.
Although ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international
borders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during
international travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.
Despite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing
transmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.
Understanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that
cause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with
pneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for
known respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will
require sustained attention to infection-control interventions within
health-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory
testing techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an
important step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: international update
-------------------------
As of 2 Apr 2003, 2223 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and
78 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), a case
fatality rate of 3.5 percent
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_04_02/en/>. This is an increase of
4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest
proportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong
Province), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little
absolute rise in other country totals.
18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission
seems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),
Singapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:
Guangdong Province;
Beijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS
cases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas
where WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are
Hong Kong and Guangdong
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued
advice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.
Guangdong and Hong Kong
--------------------------
Information about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest
reports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed
descriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission
centering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks
involving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community
transmission has been established. There is now evidence of community
transmission within a large housing complex.
Measures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the
local spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and
Singapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and
the restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,
<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.
Although such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience
in Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country
receiving a case.
Ontario, Canada
---------------
The outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory
symptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days
later, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of
her family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital
with respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the
emergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,
where he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now
apparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A
patient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed
symptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and
died 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the
emergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index
case was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission
in the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting
family members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).
The Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on
1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr
2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now
been closed to new admissions.
The experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be
vulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in
hospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission
through large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be
totally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative
organism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would
have been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has
slowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection
that are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as
fomites.
If the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control
precautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at
risk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close
contact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no
reported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where
family members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered
to strict infection control precautions.
Clinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and
infectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of
SARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently
returned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong
Kong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS
<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When
patients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital
that infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously
enforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.
Updates on the developing situation are also available from WHO
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED
(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national
public health organisations, including CDC
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada
(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health
Protection Agency in the United Kingdom

[These 2 weekly updates are good descriptions of the ongoing outbreak with
discussions on public health implications and recommendations. The MMWR
article is interesting as it presents information on suspected as well as
probable cases, suggesting that the suspected cases, milder forms without
pneumonia may well be part of the clinical spectrum of SARS. Once
available, a definitive etiologic agent with laboratory testing for
confirmation will help define the true spectrum of clinical disease.
It is also interesting to note that a human metapneumovirus was isolated
from one of the patients with SARS in the USA. Clearly we await further
information with respect to the etiologic agent of SARS.
The observation in the Eurosurveillance Weekly report that "The experience
in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be vulnerable to
transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in hospitals (3,4)."
is an important reminder of the realities of this current outbreak. -
