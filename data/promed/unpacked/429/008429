[The 16th meeting of the GF-TAD's Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe (SGE ASF16) took place as a teleconference on 23 Nov 2020. A total of 28 countries of Europe participated, as well as the representatives of GF TAD from Asia and the Americas. In the summary of the meeting report, it is noted that "The SGE ASF16 developed a set of recommendations. Amongst these, it was highlighted that preparedness, passive surveillance, early detection, and prompt reaction are essential when ASF is detected for the 1st time in wild boar or in the domestic pig population. In the case of the 1st detection of ASF in a wild boar population, a 'core zone' should be delineated, and immediate actions should be taken to avoid further spread. The involvement of many actors and stakeholders (like the Belgian did as part of their success story) is necessary for obtaining a successful and overall clearer picture of the situation.
