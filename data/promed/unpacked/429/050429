Another person has contracted an _E. coli_ infection in an outbreak linked to raw venison. The case is the 11th to surface in Dundee since the beginning of the outbreak earlier in October 2015. All of those now affected by the same strain of _E. coli_ O157 had consumed the venison which was purchased raw and cooked at home before [the affected persons fell] ill.

Health watchdogs have linked the outbreak to products from the firm Highland Game, including Scottish Slimmers venison sausages, Scottish Slimmers venison meatballs, grillsteaks, and venison steaks with pepper sauce, which had use-by dates from 4 Sep 2015 to 1 Oct 2015. These products are now no longer on sale [but could be frozen in someone's home or restaurant - Mod.LL].

None of the 11 have required hospital treatment. Dr. Syed Ahmed, Consultant in Health Protection and Clinical Director at Health Protection Scotland said: "It can take up to 14 days for someone to display symptoms following consumption of contaminated food products. It's not unusual for some cases to be identified after control measures have been taken. The important thing to note is that this additional case consumed products from the same time frame as all previous cases."

[Cattle are the most common livestock to carry enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. Sheep can also be a reservoir, as well as water buffalo, swine and, as in this case, deer.

Transmission of the potentially lethal pathogen can be from eating undercooked meat or from poor kitchen hygiene. Ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, direct contact with an infected animal or its environment, or eating uncooked produce contaminated with an infected animal's feces. - Mod.LL
