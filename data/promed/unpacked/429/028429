An Indonesian woman and her 5-year-old daughter on the tourist island
of Bali have died of bird flu, a Health Ministry official confirmed
today [Mon 13 Aug 2007], bringing the nation's [death] toll to 83
[and the number of cases to 104 - Mod.CP]. The deaths are the 1st on
Bali, where the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus was found more than a
year ago.
The 29-year-old woman from the northwest of the island, far from the
major tourist centres, died yesterday [12 Aug 2007], while her
daughter died on 3 Aug 2007, said Bayu Krisnamurti, head of
Indonesia's national bird flu commission. "Both people are positive,
from (tests at) the Eikman Institute and the Health Ministry's lab,"
he told a news briefing. In Indonesia 2 tests must be returned
positive before a human infection is confirmed.
Another young girl, a 2-year-old neighbour of the victims, was
admitted to hospital yesterday [Sun 12 Aug 2007] and was also
suspected of being infected, Krisnamurti said.
Joko, from the Bird Flu Information Centre in Jakarta, said that
chickens had died of bird flu in the victims' neighbourhood recently.
Indonesia reported its 1st human bird flu case in July 2005 and has
since confirmed 81 deaths, the highest number of any nation. Infected
poultry was 1st found on the northwest of Bali last year [2006], when
hundreds of birds were culled but no human infections were found.

These 1st cases of avian influenza on the island of Bali appear to
have occurred at a location remote from the holiday resort sites on
the island and may not greatly affect the Indonesian tourist
industry. The more devastating terrorist incident on Bali in the 2002
causing 202 deaths predominantly among foreigners failed to damage
the tourist industry in the long term. It remains to be seen whether
the risk of exposure to H5N1 avian influenza will deter tourists to a
greater extent. - Mod.CP]
