Rift Valley Fever Kills 16 in Saudi Arabia
------------------------------------------
At least 16 people have died in southwest Saudi Arabia since last Monday
from the viral disease Rift Valley Fever, health officials said. The
Health Ministry said in a statement received on Sunday that 38 other cases
were being treated in hospitals following an outbreak of the disease.
"An official source at the Health Ministry has clarified that the deaths
which happened in the Jizan area since Monday (11 Sep 2000) resulted from a
viral disease called Rift Valley fever which appeared for the first time in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," the statement said. It said a team of
experts had been sent to the region to spray the mosquito-infested areas
and to dispose of dead livestock. They would also impose controls on the
movement of livestock to prevent the spread of the disease.
Saudi newspapers on Saturday reported up to 30 deaths in Jizan, near the
Yemeni border, from a mysterious disease which affected the area and that
specimens had been sent for analysis to Washington [probably Atlanta,
London and Riyadh. The ministry said results from laboratory tests
conducted in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States confirmed the diagnosis.
The ministry said that 16 people had died as of Saturday evening. It said
symptoms of the disease included high fever, diarrhea, burst arteries and
renal failure.

Saudi Arabia's mystery virus traced
-----------------------------------
An outbreak of an illness which has killed at least 16 people in the Saudi
province of Jizan has been identified as Rift Valley Fever (RVF). According
to the World Health Organisation (WHO) this is the first report of the
disease outside Africa. The virus usually affects animals, but can be
transmitted to humans via mosquitoes, or through coming into contact with
the blood of contaminated animals.
A spokesman for the Saudi health authorities said the disease had been
transmitted by sheep and a large number of animals had died recently in
Jizan. He said 16 of the 36 people infected had now died, but no new cases
had been reported in the last 48 hours. The authorities in Jizan province
imposed emergency measures after cases of the disease were detected
The disease can cause bleeding from the mouth, ears and nose, eye lesions
and encephalitis but symptoms more usually resemble those of influenza.
Malnutrition and poverty contribute to mortality rates. Human mortality
rates in outbreaks are usually low, but hundreds died in Kenya and Somalia
after the disease spread widely during floods.
Saudi Arabia regularly imposes bans on the import of livestock from
countries suffering outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in order to prevent the
spread of the disease.
Jizan province lies around 300km from the coast of Africa across the Red
Sea. The town of Jizan is known for its heat and humidity at this time of
year which, combined with recent seasonal heavy rains, makes it an ideal
breeding ground for mosquitoes.

[This is the first report of Rift Valley Fever from Saudi Arabia. According
to Chin's Control of Communicable Diseases 2000, Rift Valley Fever has only
been reported in Africa.
According to Gideon, The Rift Valley virus was first isolated during an
outbreak among livestock in the Rift Valley (Kenya) in 1931. An outbreak
in Egypt during 1977 to 1978 involved 18 000 human cases (598 fatalities).
An outbreak in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania during 1997 to 1998 involved an
estimated 89 000 humans. The disease was first reported in West Africa in
1974 (mosquitoes in Senegal); however, large outbreaks in the area were not
reported prior to an epidemic in southern Mauritania in 1987. The first
outbreak outside of sub-Saharan Africa occurred in Egypt in 1977
(serological surveys indicate that the virus had not been in Egypt prior to
that year).
During epizootics, disease usually occurs first in animals, then in humans.
Human infection occurs mainly among farmers and others at occupational
risk. Sheep are more susceptible than cattle; goats are least susceptible.
Infected bats have been identified in Guinea.
Hemorrhagic phenomena and fatal encephalitis have been observed in
approximately 1% to 2% of patients during epidemics and account for much of
the mortality. (According to the article from the Gulf News below, the
case fatality rate in this epidemic is currently reported as 13 percent).
Vectors include _Eretmapodites chrysogaster_, _Aedes caballus_, _Ae.
circumluteolus_, _Ae. lineatopennis_, _Ae. cumminsii_ (Burkina Faso),
_Culex theileri_, _Culex antennatus_ (Nigeria), _Mansonia africana_, _Ma.
uniformis_ (Burkina Faso) and _Culicoides_ spp. Interepizootic vectors
belong to the _Aedes_ subgenera _Neomelaniconion_ in East Africa,
_Aedimorphus_ in West Africa, _Culex theileri_ in South Africa, _Aedes
dalzieli_, _ochraceus_ and _vexans_ are active in Senegal, and _Culex
pipiens_ in Egypt. Transovarial transmission has been found in _Aedes_,
and epidemics may occur when high rainfall favors hatching and development
of transovarially-infected offspring. - Mod.MPP
