CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states
across the USA and with the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety
and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) to investigate an ongoing
multi-state outbreak of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- (pronounced "four
five twelve eye minus") infections in humans. An investigation that
used interviews comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons is
showing that eating Banquet brand pot pies produced by the ConAgra
Foods company is the likely source of the illness.

Between 1 Jan 2007 and 19 Oct 2007, at least 238 isolates of
_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- with an indistinguishable genetic
fingerprint have been collected from ill persons in 34 states. Ill
persons whose _Salmonella_ strain has this genetic fingerprint have
been reported from Arizona (1 person), Arkansas (4), California (16),
Colorado (7), Connecticut (6), Delaware (5), Florida (2), Georgia
(2), Idaho (8), Illinois (6), Indiana (3), Kansas (3), Kentucky (8),
Massachusetts (6), Maryland (7), Maine (1), Michigan (3), Minnesota
(7), Missouri (16), Montana (4), Nevada (6), New York (10), Ohio
(10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (3), Pennsylvania (17), Tennessee (6),
Texas (4), Utah (12), Virginia (9), Vermont (2), Washington (17),
Wisconsin (23), Wyoming (3). Their ages range from less than one to
87 years with a median age of 20 years; 51 percent of ill persons are
female. At least 50 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have
been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
CDC coordinated a case-control study designed to identify the source
of these infections. For this study, a case was defined as
_Salmonella_ infection on or after 1 Aug 2007, with a strain that had
the outbreak genetic fingerprint. Eating a Banquet brand pot pie was
significantly associated with illness. The outbreak appears to be
ongoing. State health departments are collecting and testing pot pie
products recovered from patients' homes. To date, one pot pie yielded
_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates [from Wisconsin - Mod.LL] with a
genetic fingerprint indistinguishable from the outbreak pattern.

[The entire report, which reproduces much about the outbreak
previously posted is not reduplicated here. It can be seen in the source URL.

This moderator apologizes for the delay in this posting, which
increases the total number of cases to 238 but decreases the states
involved to 34. The previous posting in the thread, citing an 18 Oct
2007 report, had 211 cases and 35 states. How many of the newer cases
are ongoing after the recall is not stated, but some likely are since
the report describes the outbreak as "ongoing."

A discussion on _Salmonella_ nomenclature can be found in a previous
ProMED-mail posting (Salmonellosis, frozen poultry pie - USA
(multistate) (04): recall 20071013.3355). - Mod.LL]
