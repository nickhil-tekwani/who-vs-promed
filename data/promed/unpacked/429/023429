Indonesia: Avian influenza Deaths Cause Panic in Wealthy Jakarta Suburb
---------------------------------------------------
When a government auditor and his 2 young daughters died suddenly this
month, there was panic in their middle-class suburb along with reports that
they were Indonesia's 1st casualties of avian influenza. Neighbors
anxiously traded rumors across the metal fences surrounding their neatly
landscaped yards. Mothers kept their children from playing on the
palm-lined streets. Some families in this quiet California-style
subdivision of bankers, businessmen and doctors considered packing up their
belongings in their SUVs and abandoning their homes.
Most residents of the Villa Melati Mas [commuter] community on the western
outskirts of Jakarta had paid little [attention] to reports of avian
influenza, which has devastated poultry flocks across Indonesia during the
last 2 years and killed dozens of people in other Southeast Asian countries.
Indonesian health officials announced last week that they suspected bird
flu; test results, received Wednesday from a specialized laboratory in Hong
Kong, confirmed it. The father's sample tested positive for the highly
lethal virus while a specimen from the older daughter showed she, too, had
been exposed. No test was done for the younger [one-year-old] daughter.
So far, nearly all of the avian flu victims in Asia have contracted the
disease from infected birds. International health experts warn that the
virus could spark a pandemic, killing tens of millions of people, if the
strain evolves into a form easily passed among people. "I'm wondering why
this happened. I'm confused. Can we get this? We're trying to be calm," a
doctor's wife said anxiously as she stocked up on broccoli and cauliflower
from a vegetable peddler plying the subdivision's cobblestone streets. She
has forbidden her children to eat outside the home in case the virus can
spread through food. "We've stopped going to Kentucky Fried Chicken," she said.
Stoking the neighborhood's fear is uncertainty about the outbreak's cause.
Unlike the rural villages of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, where other
avian influenza deaths have occurred, there are no farmers or live chickens
in Villa Melati Mas.

Indonesia: Signs of Avian Influenza Near the Home of Victims
---------------------------------------------------
Indonesian veterinary authorities have found signs of avian influenza in
chicken droppings near the home of 3 Indonesians who died from avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection this month, but have not yet linked the
discovery to the victims, an official said on Tuesday [26 Jul 2005].
Experts from the Health Ministry have been puzzled by the deaths of a man
and his 2 young daughters near Jakarta due to avian influenza, the 1st
human fatalities in the world's 4th most populous country. "Our
veterinarian researchers found a positive result from this [fecal test],
but whether (the victims) were infected [from this source] is still
unknown," said Agriculture Ministry spokesman Hari Priyono. "Our problem is
if it is true that it jumped to humans, the ones who would die 1st should
be the farmers."
The chicken droppings that contained the H5N1 avian influenza virus were
found near the victims' family home in Tangerang, a satellite city of
Jakarta. As part of efforts to combat the virus, authorities on Tuesday [26
Jul 2005] killed more than 800 chickens at a farm in West Java province,
where signs of avian influenza infection were found last week.
Indonesia has prepared 44 hospitals across the country for the treatment of
further possible victims. But in a sprawling archipelago dotted with small
farms, and where even many urban families keep chickens, pinpointing the
source of the virus is proving difficult.
Avian influenza, which arrived in Asia in late 2003, has so far killed more
than 50 people in the region, including Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. In
Indonesia, the virus has spread to 21 provinces out of 33 over the past 2
years. It had already jumped species in Indonesia, having been discovered
in pigs on densely populated Java island in May.

[The restriction of the Indonesia outbreak to 3 members of one family,
leaving at least 2 others unaffected, is curious. The mystery of the route
of transmission of infection is further complicated by the fact that the
family reside in an affluent suburban area of the capital city. - Mod.CP]
