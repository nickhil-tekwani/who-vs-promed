The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed Tue [12 Nov 201] that it has put 8 camels in confinement. They are suspected of being infected by the coronavirus following initial laboratory tests. Jaber Al-Shehri, spokesman for the ministry, said 2 medical teams, consisting of members from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, were formed to test the 8 camels, whose owner is a Saudi citizen.

Al-Shehri said the camels were put in isolation until further tests are completed. The results will be announced in a few days.

The Ministry of Health announced on Monday [11 Nov 2013] that a 43-year-old Saudi from Jeddah was infected with coronavirus by a camel.

In an earlier statement, the ministry said that all those persons and livestock who were in direct contact with the man had been checked according to scientific standards. The ministry also took samples from the surrounding environment of the infected, including the camels on his property, where initial tests showed positive results concerning the existence of the virus.

Earlier, a team of international researchers said that Arabian camels might be the bearer of the new coronavirus. The team found in the blood of these animals antibodies for the virus that looks like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to the researchers who work under the supervision of Chantal Roeskin of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands.

Most lethal cases of the virus were in the Kingdom so far.

I wanted to tell ProMED something in relation to the moderator's comment [in 20131112.2051424]. Moderator AS says: "From previous, media-derived information, it appears that the tissue sampled was mucous or saliva; confirmation will help."

That was from my story [The Canadian Press Report, 11 Nov 2013, see at 20131112.2050868]. But I do not know what specimens were used. I used those as "for instance" type examples. No one should take them as knowledge on my part.

[Helen's clarification is helpful and gratefully acknowledged.

Official information on the tissues/specimens used for the ongoing tests, as requested in posting 20131112.2051424, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]

Has there yet been a goal of camel fecal matter or intestines being tested for MERS-CoV? Intestinal coronavirus in ferrets can be spread from fecal matter.

Perhaps it might pay with other coronavirii to check other bodily wastes as well? I do not know how robust this particular coronavirus is.

Many MERS-CoV patients reported having no contact with animals before becoming sick. So where did those who didn't own camels contract the virus?

[As stated by the Saudi authorities (item 1), the precautionary measures have been undertaken by the Saudi authorities "until further tests are completed." The results of the genetic sequencing are anticipated with great interest. If the human and camel isolates are found genetically identical, at least 2 routes of human infection might be considered: either camel to human, or exposure of both said species to another infection source/virus disseminator (bat?).

The raised possibility of camel fecal matter as a potential virus vehicle (item 3) might deserve to be included within future investigations. Freshly emerged camel droppings have a strikingly low humidity; for a picture, see sample 5 in http://tinyurl.com/oce47sb. - Mod.AS
