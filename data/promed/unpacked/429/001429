[This immediate notification to the OIE of an FMD outbreak in Morocco, after its absence since 1999, is in line with ProMED-mail's earlier posting (20151101.3758850). It addresses our RFI about the serotype involved, which appears to be FMDV serotype O. Genotyping of the strain is anticipated with interest, to verify if it is identical to the ("Indian") strain responsible for the recent epizootics in neighbouring Algeria (2015) and in Tunisia (2014). The long distance between the affected site and Algeria's border raises concerns and the need for enhanced surveillance.

The Moroccan authorities have applied stamping out policy, culling all 17 cattle and (apparently, unaffected) 14 in-contact sheep on the premises. - Mods.AS/CRD
