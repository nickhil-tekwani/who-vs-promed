The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) announced investigating an outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infections occurring in 4 provinces. Based on the investigation findings to date [16 Oct 2020], exposure to shellfish has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Many individuals who became sick reported eating shellfish, mainly raw oysters harvested from eastern coastal waters, before their illnesses occurred.

As of 14 Oct 2020, there are 21 confirmed cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ illness in the following provinces: Saskatchewan (1), Quebec (7), New Brunswick (10), and Prince Edward Island (3). Individuals became sick between early July and mid-September 2020. One individual has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The following tips may help reduce your risk of getting sick from _Vibrio_, but they may not fully eliminate the risk of illness:

- Avoid eating raw or undercooked shellfish.
- Get shellfish products from a licensed establishment or harvest them from a fishing area that is open under the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP), Fisheries and Ocean Canada.
- Store and transport shellfish at 4 deg C (39 deg F) in the refrigerator or on ice from the time purchased until cooking or eating.
- Shellfish must be cooked to a safe internal temperature of 74 deg C (165 deg F) to kill bacteria like _Vibrio_.
- Follow proper safe food-handling practises when preparing and cooking shellfish.
- Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water before and after handling any shellfish.
- Always clean and proper sanitize any cutting boards, counters, kitchen surfaces, knives, and other utensils used to prepare raw shellfish.
- Use only drinking-quality water for rinsing shellfish.
- Discard any shellfish that do not open when cooked.
- Eat shellfish right away after cooking and refrigerate leftovers.
- Always keep raw and cooked shellfish separate.
- Wear protective clothing (like gloves) when handling raw shellfish.
- Avoid exposing open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish.
- Avoid taking antacids prior to eating oysters or other seafood, as reduced stomach acid may favour the survival and growth of _Vibrio_.
- If you have been diagnosed with a _Vibrio_ infection or any other gastrointestinal illness, do not cook food for other people.
- Contact your local public health authority to report any food safety concerns at restaurants or grocery stores, or if you suspect food poisoning from a restaurant or other food establishments.

[_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea.

It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease the chances of acquiring a case of foodborne illness compared to eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
