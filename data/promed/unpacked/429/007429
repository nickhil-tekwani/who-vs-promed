New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Chester County, Pennsylvania
Started on: 10 Jun 2021
Ended on: 13 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: Other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered-Killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cats / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1
Dogs / 34 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 33
Affected population: the affected population includes the case dog, and 32 dogs and one cat that were imported from the same rescue as the rabid dog and are considered "exposed". These animals are all under strict quarantine by local health officials.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): animal vaccine failure, legal movement of animals.
Epidemiological comments: importation of a dog infected with the canine rabies variant into the United States, which is considered free from this viral variant since 2007. The imported rabid dog developed signs of rabies 3 days after importation and was euthanized by a private veterinarian before testing positive at the National Reference Laboratory. Virus characterization confirmed the dog was infected with a canine rabies virus variant that has been previously reported in Azerbaijan. Additional animals that originated from the same rescue as the rabid dog are undergoing serological screening and quarantine. The rabid dog potentially exposed up to 36 people and 33 other animals (32 dogs and 1 cat). After assessment, post exposure prophylaxis has been recommended to 15 people. The exposed animals are being closely monitored under quarantine. As of [7 Jul 2021], results of prospective serologic monitoring (paired rabies titers at day 0 and 5 after rabies booster vaccine) are available from 30/33 (91 percent) exposed animals. 6 of 30 (20 percent) animals did not show an expected response to booster vaccination and CDC is concerned about improper vaccination practices in Azerbaijan. CDC continues to investigate the reasons for vaccine failure in these animals.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied in domestic: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; movement control inside the country; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; selective killing and disposal; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); traceability; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; screening; quarantine

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology (DHCPP), National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) OIE Reference Laboratory
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Dogs / Direct immunofluorescence test for antibody detection (Ab DIFT) / 18 Jun to 9 Jul 2021 / positive
