The postinfectious COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) first characterized in children has a different presentation in adults that may lead to underrecognition, according to a small, single-center study today in JAMA Network Open.

Conducted by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the retrospective study involved 15 patients 21 years and older who met the working definition for MIS in adults (MIS-A) from [1 Mar to 30 Sep 2020] and were hospitalized 14 to 84 days after testing positive for COVID-19 or 15 days before or after SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results identified them as at risk for the syndrome.

The 15 MIS-A patients were compared with 683 hospitalized COVID-19 patients without MIS-A. MIS-A patients were younger than those with acute COVID-19 (median age, 45.1 vs 56.5 years) and more likely to have coronavirus antibodies on serologic testing (9 [60%] vs 0), suggesting a previous infection. Other demographic characteristics and underlying illnesses were similar between the 2 groups.

Of the MIS-A patients, 9 (60%) had symptoms of COVID-19, and 3 (20%) were hospitalized for coronavirus infection before they were admitted for the related syndrome. Median time between the COVID-19 and MIS-A hospitalizations for these patients was 23 days.

At admission to the hospital for MIS-A, 5 (33.3%) of patients needed intensive care to monitor their blood pressure, one (6.7%) required medications to increase blood pressure, and one (6.7%) was given noninvasive ventilation. Four patients (26.7%) were given immunosuppressive drugs, and 7 (46.6%) received antibiotics. No participants died.

The median number of organs involved among MIS-A patients was 4, most often involving the gastrointestinal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Median age of all 698 patients included in the analysis was 55.8 years, 53.3% were men, 58.2% were White, and 24.2% were Black.

The researchers urged clinicians to be vigilant for signs of MIS-A, the incidence of which was likely underestimated in their study. "Most patients who met the MIS-A criteria were not identified as such by the primary clinical team," they wrote. "These data suggest that, although uncommon, MIS-A has a more heterogeneous clinical presentation than previously appreciated and is commonly underdiagnosed."

The authors said that the MIS-A patients in their study had broader organ involvement and lower disease severity than those reported in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in the United States and the United Kingdom published on 2 Oct 2020, in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [Morris SB, Schwartz NG, Patel P, et al. Case Series of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection -- United Kingdom and United States, March-August 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 1450-1456; DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6940e1external icon]. That study established working criteria for MIS-A, which included severe illness requiring hospital admission in patients 21 and older, a previous or current positive COVID-19 test during hospital admission or in the 12 weeks before, severe dysfunction of at least one non-lung organ system (e.g., low blood pressure, shock, cardiac abnormalities, arterial or venous blood clots, thromboembolism, liver damage), test results indicating severe inflammation (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, interleukin-6), and the absence of severe respiratory disease.

"Future investigations, including prospective enrollments, are necessary to improve the diagnostic and treatment approaches for patients with MIS-A," the Vanderbilt researchers concluded.

In an invited commentary in the same journal, Eric Chow, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington at Seattle, said much remains unknown about MIS, including its underlying mechanisms, incidence, different presentations, and optimal treatment. In children, he said, "therapy frequently includes intravenous immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids, which are extrapolated from the management strategies of Kawasaki disease. Further research will be needed to decide whether these same treatments can be applied to adult cases."

The study, according to Chow, provides another piece of the rare yet clinically important syndrome. "Not only does MIS have important implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathology, but it also has the potential to offer new insights in how our immune system functions and its role in hyperinflammation," he said.

"Discussion. The patients with MIS-A identified in our cohort have a broader distribution of organ involvement and lower illness severity compared with those in previously published series. (4) Most patients who met the MIS-A criteria were not identified as such by the primary clinical team. This study had some limitations. Our data likely underestimate the incidence of MIS-A because many patients with COVID-19-related admissions did not have routine comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessments to screen for this syndrome. These data suggest that, although uncommon, MIS-A has a more heterogeneous clinical presentation than previously appreciated and is commonly underdiagnosed. Future investigations, including prospective enrollments, are necessary to improve the diagnostic and treatment approaches for patients with MIS-A."

"Many questions about MIS remain. First, the underlying etiopathogenesis remains unknown, but because cases occur in the post-acute COVID-19 period, an antibody-mediated process or dysregulated immune response is suspected. Second, the incidence of MIS-A is not known, but it is likely to be an uncommon complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults, as it is in children. From [1 Mar through 10 Mar 2020], the incidence of MIS-C in New York State among people younger than 21 years was 2 per 100 000 individuals vs 322 per 100 000 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (4). Third, there may be a diversity of phenotypes of MIS not only between individual cases but across age groups. In MIS-C, mucocutaneous manifestations were more common in the younger cohort, while myocarditis and gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequently reported in older children (4). In fact, in the adult cases of MIS identified by Davogustto et al. (6), 12 of 15 patients with MIS-A (80.0%) had gastrointestinal complications. As we learn more about MIS-A, we are likely to uncover additional aspects of its spectrum. Lastly, evidence for an optimal treatment strategy for MIS-A is lacking, and for now therapy may depend on supportive medical management. In children, MIS-C therapy frequently includes intravenous immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids, which are extrapolated from the management strategies of Kawasaki disease. Further research will be needed to decide whether these same treatments can be applied to adult cases."

Brazil's decline in cases has stopped, and cases and deaths doubled last week in parts of Argentina and Uruguay, a sign that the Americas region is still in the heat of battle with COVID, officials from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said today [Wed 19 May 2021] during a briefing.

Though the world's cases declined last week, 4 of the 5 highest-burden countries are in the Americas region, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [Tue 18 May 2021] in its weekly snapshot of the pandemic. They include Brazil, the United States, Argentina, and Colombia.

Yesterday, Argentina -- now in its 2nd surge -- reported a record daily high for deaths, with 745 confirmed, in addition to 35 543 new cases, according to Reuters (https://news.yahoo.com/745-fatalities-argentina-hits-one-214907138.html).

At today's [Wed 19 May 2021] briefing, Carissa Etienne, MBBS, MSc, PAHO's director, said intensive care occupancy rates are at 90% in Brazil and Colombia, a sign that people are still at risk for not getting care. She added that Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Honduras are experiencing sharp rises in COVID activity, with infection numbers also rising in Bolivia and French Guiana. In a number of Caribbean locations, deaths doubled over the past week, including the Bahamas, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago.

In parts of Canada, including Newfoundland and the Northwest territories, cases have tripled, and hospitalizations are rising across the country.

Etienne said the impact of vaccine rollout in the United States has been dramatic, underscoring the importance of speeding vaccine access to other parts of the region. Only 3% of the population in Latin America has been vaccinated, compared to the nearly half of US residents who have received at least one dose.

Though India's cases have shown some signs of decline, falling 12% of the past week according to the WHO's update, deaths continue to surge. Over the past day, deaths crossed the 4500 mark, setting another daily high mark for India and for the world, according to the New York Times (https://news.yahoo.com/745-fatalities-argentina-hits-one-214907138.html).

Data from a private lab chain in India underscores the massive spread of the virus there, according to Reuters. The company said 63.5% of people have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over the past week, up sharply from 45% a month ago. The data cover people from 25 of the country's states (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-reports-267334-new-coronavirus-infections-2021-05-19/).

In clinical developments, following a rise in potentially fatal fungal lung infections, called mucormycosis, in COVID patients, the country is running low on Amphotericin-B, the antifungal drug needed for treatment, according to the Washington Post. It's not clear how many people have the coinfection, which might be related to steroid treatment, but Maharashtra state has reported as many as 1500 cases, 50 of them fatal. People are reaching out on social media for supplies of the drug, and one of the country's pharmacists' unions said the drug is unavailable in most stores (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/19/coronavirus-COVID-live-updates-us/#link-ZPTVXUZ6TJBCLJYDMURQWAM2OM).

More global headlines
- European Union countries have agreed to open borders to vaccinated international travelers, according to a spokesman who said final approval could come this week or next and take effect within days, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-opening-vaccinated-travel/2021/05/19/64196bc0-b897-11eb-bc4a-62849cf6cca9_story.html).

- In vaccine developments, United Kingdom officials said they are increasingly confident that the B1617 variant first identified in India is susceptible to vaccines and may not be as transmissible as earlier thought, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/indian-variants-transmissibility-edge-might-be-smaller-than-feared-uk-expert-2021-05-19/). Also, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both announced that they will offer people who received 2 doses of China's Sinopharm vaccine a booster dose, at least 6 months after the 2nd shot, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-says-it-will-offer-sinopharm-booster-shot-2021-05-18/).

- In Asia, Taiwan today [Wed 19 May 2021] raised its national alert level to the 2nd-highest level after reporting 267 more local cases (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/19/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/#link-BD3KHHIQWFDZZPIQGJO26YBE3Q), and China has ramped up its vaccination efforts, immunizing 100 million people in 9 days, which came in the wake of small outbreaks in Anhui and Liaoning provinces (https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-05-19-21/h_7694eee8e408ecbcba42bbfb0b93c529).

- The global total is approaching [165 million] cases and is at 164 960 600 cases, with at least 3 397 600 deaths, according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

[In the US, it feels like the country has come through the pandemic, but in SE Asia and the Americas, COVID remains a serious problem. India continues to see a rise in deaths and is running out of Amphotericin-B to treat cases of mucormycosis, which are reported to be as high as 1500 cases in Maharashtra state. Argentina reported a record daily high for deaths. - Mod.LK]

Long-haul COVID-19 was associated with severe or very severe symptoms, low income, and some age groups, but was common even in those with mild symptoms, with a quarter of patients in that group having symptoms after 60 days, according to a Clinical Infectious Diseases study today [Wed 19 May 2021] that looked at adult Michigan patients.

The researchers surveyed 593 Michigan adults who had a symptomatic COVID-19 diagnosis through mid-April 2020. Most were female (56.1%), older than 45 years (68.2%), and either White (46.3%) or Black (34.8%). More than half reported 30-day COVID-19 symptoms (52.5%), and 35.0% said they had symptoms 60 days post-diagnosis. The most common symptoms among 60-day COVID-19 patients were fatigue (52.9%) and shortness of breath (43.9%).

Respondents with very severe symptoms were 2.25 and 1.71 times more likely to have 30- and 60-day COVID-19 symptoms, respectively, than those who had mild cases. Similarly, those who were hospitalized had about 40% higher crude increased odds of 30- or 60-day COVID-19 symptoms (crude odds ratio [OR], 1.37 and 1.40, respectively). Still, long-term COVID-19 also occurred in non-hospitalized patients (43.7% at 30 days and 26.9% at 60 days) and those with mild symptoms (29.2% at 30 days and 24.5% at 60 days).

While associations with race, some comorbidities, and multiple age groups were found using unadjusted models, the researchers' adjusted models showed significant links only for psychological disorders (OR, 1.42 for 60-day symptoms), low household income (OR, 1.38 to 1.40 for income below USD 75 000 for 30-day symptoms), and people 35-44 years of age versus those 18-34 (OR not given).

The researchers add that, although Hispanic adults had a 48% higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 and 67% higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 compared with non-hospitalized White adults, the adjusted models showed no statistical significance for any race or ethnicities.

"Abstract
Background
Emerging evidence suggests many people have persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 illness. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

"Methods
We employed a population-based probability survey of adults with COVID-19 in Michigan. Living non-institutionalized adults aged 18+ in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (n=28 000). Among 2000 selected, 629 completed the survey between June and December 2020. We estimated PASC prevalence, defined as persistent symptoms 30+ (30-day COVID-19) or 60+ days (60-day COVID-19) post COVID-19 onset, overall and by sociodemographic and clinical factors, including self-reported symptom severity and hospitalization status. We used modified Poisson regression to produce adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for potential risk factors."

"Conclusions
PASC is highly prevalent among cases reporting severe initial symptoms, and, to a lesser extent, cases reporting mild and moderate symptoms." - Mod.LK]

Non-White COVID-19 patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White people regardless of socioeconomic status, according to a study yesterday [Tue 18 May 2021] in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. The researchers also found that non-English speakers were more likely to require hospital care.

University of Minnesota researchers looked at 5577 COVID-19 patient records from the M Fairview health system in Minnesota from 4 Mar - 19 Aug 2020. Of these, 15.5% were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were more likely to be male (49.1% vs 43.5%) and had more comorbidities (5.0 vs 1.0 on the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index).

Compared with White patients, Black, Asian, and Hispanic people were more likely to need hospitalization (odds ratios [ORs], 1.50, 2.39, and 3.80, respectively). The researchers also found that, while hospitalized patients were older than their outpatient counterparts in general (median 60.9 vs 40.4 years), racial differences in hospital patient age were noted: White patients were a median 69.6 years old, whereas Black patients were 55.4, Asians 58.9, and Hispanics 48.5.

Using the Area Deprivation Index for each patient's ZIP code, the researchers did not find any association between hospitalization outcomes and socioeconomic status, a common factor that is brought up when looking at COVID-19 racial disparities. "It supports concerns that other unidentified confounders (i.e., structural racism, testing, etc.) drive the association," the researchers write.

Conversely, language was independently associated. Regardless of race or ethnicity, the likelihood of hospitalization increased 1.91 times for patients who didn't speak English.

"Seeing an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease in people of color and non-English speaking, independent of other known risk factors, these populations should be considered high priority for the continued vaccination rollout," lead author Nicholas Ingraham, MD, said in a University of Minnesota press release. The team also advocates for more multilingual COVID-19 information and implicit bias remediation among healthcare providers.

From the University of Minnesota press release: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uomm-ssn051821.php:

"'For people of color, even in the highest socioeconomic status, our data shows they still have worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to people who are white,' said Nicholas Ingraham, MD, a 3rd-year fellow in the Department of Medicine at the U of M Medical School who led the study. 'We also found that, independent of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, non-English speaking is also associated with worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19. It puts patients at higher risk of disease, not only across racial and ethnic populations, but also within those populations.'"

"The study team recognizes that many other factors, including job type, genetics, testing access, and systemic racism, may all play a role in COVID-19 health disparities. To provide more insight, Ingraham plans to expand on the study to determine which of the 17 factors within the area deprivation index may make patients more vulnerable to the disease. The team will also partner with the U of M School of Public Health to link their patient data set to other social determinants of health like environmental pollution and food deserts."

Such factors as co-morbidities (diabetes, high blood pressure), where people live, and under what conditions (e.g., crowded housing, poor ventilation) will impact disease. But the latter are less likely not to play an important role in people of higher socioeconomic status. Which factors impact the difference in response by different racial groups needs to be studied further so society can address the underlying causes. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, India (276 261), Brazil (79 706), Argentina (39 652), and the USA (27 379) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 065 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 17 May 2021 to late 18 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include India, Brazil, Argentina, the USA, France (19 050), Colombia (16 579), Iran (12 789), Germany (11 881), and Turkey (11 553). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 58 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 17.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 19.9% decrease in daily reported cases and 6.2% decrease in reported deaths.
