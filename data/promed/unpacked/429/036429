Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome cases increase in Udmurtia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Udmurtia are
on the increase. Epidemiologists expect cases to peak in early
September [2011]. The regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] has announced 107 HFRS cases in
July and around 100 cases so far in August.

Since the epidemiological situation is deteriorating in the region,
public health officials are increasing dissemination of advisory
information are undertaking rodent control measures around populated
areas.

[Udmurtia is a sovereign republic within the Russian Federation. It is
situated in the western part of the Middle Urals between the Kama and
Vyatka rivers. A map showing the location of the Republic of Udmurtia
is accessible at http://www.udm.ru/geograph.html. The
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the Republic of Udmurtia can
be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/008*.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically
similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses of the family _Bunyaviridae_.
HFRS occurs throughout the world. Puumala virus is the likely cause of
HFRS (also known locally as 'mouse fever') in Udmurtia. Contamination
of dust, food and hands with the dried urine and excreta of infected
rodents, stirred up during cleaning of rodent-infested premises, is
the main route of infection. In the preceding post from Udmutia in
June 2011 (Hemorrhagic fever w/renal synd - Russia (02): (UD) 20110630.1992) it was reported that sampling surveys of forest rodents
[the wild reservoir of the disease] showed a 2-4 fold increase in
population size compared with the preceding year [2010] and high
infection rates (9-13 percent). - Mod.CP]
