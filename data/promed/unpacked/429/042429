-----------------------------------------------
We have received several comments about the moderator's description of
the routes of infection in the posting from 28 Aug 2011. The following
comment (the others are similar), points out that the description of
the routes of infection leading to intestinal _Taenia solium_
infection and cysticercosis was incorrect. - Mod.EP

This posting is incorrect: The intestinal form adult _Taenia solium_
develops after the ingestion of raw or medium-rare porcine meat
infected with the immature stage to the tapeworm (this is the only
way), the cysticercus. Eggs of _Taenia solium_ when ingested by people
with feces-contaminated food (vegetables) will generate the
cysticercus, not the adult parasite.

The life cycle of Taenia solium is as follows:
Porcine host develops the intermediate stage called cysticercus (old
name was _Cysticercus cellulosae_) which is the infective form for
human developing the adult stage tapeworm in the small intestine.

The cysticercus is a bladder with an external membrane, a liquid, and
the scolex (head) of the tapeworm. Once attached in the intestine will
develop a body with several segments called proglottid.

Each mature segment of the worm, proglottid, contains several hundred
eggs that are immediately infective (no incubation in the environment
needed) for porcine host (and other susceptible species) and human.

In humans the ingested egg will release the embryo in the intestine,
penetrate the mucosa, reaching blood stream, migrating in the body and
most of them will survive in the brain producing the syndrome called
neurocysticercosis, a serious condition that most of the times cannot
be resolved with surgery or medication.

It has been described a more aggressive form of cysticercus called
_Cysticercus racemosus_. The form is able to grow and invade spaces in
the brain cavity.

Auto infection of people is common. People are susceptible to both
parasite forms, the cysticercus (immature stage) and the _T. solium_
eggs. Cysticercus is ingested with raw or medium-rare porcine meat and
eggs in fresh vegetables contaminated with raw sewage containing _T.
solium_ eggs.

Sorry about the length of the note. I had to do it to correct the
info. Thank you for your consideration.
