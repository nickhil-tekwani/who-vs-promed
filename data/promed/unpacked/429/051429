From: Carlos Hermida

Dr. Maura Ricketts's cited words contains a mistake when include Argentina
as having a small number of BSE cases. Neither BSE nor scrapie was found in
Argentina. Moreover EUÂ´s Scientific Steering Committee in its Final Opinion
(issued in Brussels July 2000) states as is "highly unlikely that cattle
are infected with BSE" within a short list of countries including Argentina.

The list of countries with "small numbers of cases" is Canada, Falk Islands
(1989; not Argentina, as in your item), Italy and Oman.

[Item [7 in our BSE update erroneously indicated that Argentina had a few
cases of BSE. Thanks very much to Carlos and Arnon for ensuring that
ProMED-mail provides accurate information. We always invite and appreciate
such corrections from ProMED-mail readers. Since people react so strongly
to information about BSE, we especially appreciate correction concerning
the possibility of countries having cases. - Mod.PC
