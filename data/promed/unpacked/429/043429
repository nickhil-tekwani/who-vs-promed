Brucellosis outbreak due to unpasteurized milk
----------------------------------------------
Due to an unusual outbreak of brucellosis in the Western Galilee, the Nahariya hospital [HaZafon (Northern District)] had to treat about 30 patients during the last 2 weeks, half of them children. The patients were found infected by the brucellosis bacterium, known to contaminate cheese and unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The cases have been reported to the Ministry of Health.

The bacteria cause a disease known as "Malta fever." The disease is found mainly in the non-Jewish sector in the Galilee [north], Wadi Ara [centre] and the Negev [south].

The Director of the pediatric infectious disease service in the Galilee medical center, Dr. Daniel Glickman, said the patients, arriving during the last 2 weeks at the hospital, are residents of the Druze villages Yarka and Julis, half of them children who consumed unpasteurized cheese; many of them relatives (father and daughter, cousins) who most probably consumed cheese from a common source.

"The signs of the disease are usually joint and bone pain, accompanied by high fever. The disease is not contagious among humans and is mainly treated by antibiotics," he said.

The patients were hospitalized in the pediatric and internal departments. One case, a 5-year-old girl, had to be hospitalized in the ICU to stabilize her condition.

It has been said that the current wave may continue, since the incubation period of exposed persons may take weeks and sometimes even months before clinically manifested. According to the Medical Center, throughout the course of 2013, only 10 patients had to be treated.

After questioning by the hospital's doctors, 3 possible sources of infection have been identified.

About 10 days ago, another cluster of brucellosis was discovered, in Jerusalem; 14 people were found infected following the consumption of unpasteurized cheese brought from the territory of the Palestinian Authority [West Bank].

[Most likely, all reported cases of Malta fever (the commonly used name for brucellosis in Israel) have been caused by _Brucella melitensis_, the bacteria species which is regarded endemic. There is a concerning increase of reported human cases during recent years (see further data of 2011-2013). The true number of human infections is generally considered to be significantly higher, many remaining unreported.

Unfortunately, humans seem to have become the sentinels of brucellosis in sheep/goat flocks.

Number of outbreaks in animals and human cases (OIE data)
---------------------------------------------------------
Year / Outbreaks in animals / Human cases / Rate per 100 000 population
2011 / 6 / 127 / 1.8076
2012 / 14 / 183 / 2.6046
2013 / 11 / 336 / 4.7822

The majority of the human brucellosis cases in Israel are caused by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products produced from family-owned sheep and/or goat flocks. Exposure to infected farm animals (occupational infection) is another common cause of infection. Though most of the human cases have been encountered, during previous years, in southern Israel, the current events are indicative of significant circulation of the agent in other parts of the country. The situation in the Palestinian territories is known to be even worse.

The main reservoir of _B. melitensis_ are sheep and goats, with the main symptom being abortions. _B. melitensis_ may occasionally infect cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which causes abortions in cattle, _B. melitensis_ is not abortifacient in cattle, but will infect the udders, followed by massive discharge of the highly pathogenic bacteria in the milk and consequent human infections.

Results of laboratory investigations, confirming the clinical diagnosis of the described cases, will be appreciated. It will be interesting to follow the epidemiological investigations at the 3 suspected sources of infection (Western Galilee) and obtain their results, hopefully identifying the source(s). Similarly, updates on ongoing and contemplated control measures will be welcomed.

ProMED-mail's request for information on a previous event is pending (see 20140513.2467609).
