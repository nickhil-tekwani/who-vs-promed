[ML], an agricultural engineer from Colombia, had cutaneous leishmaniasis -- the most common form of a vector-borne disease which manifests as skin sores that grow and change appearance over time. Although not fatal, these lesions can become infected and painful, and leave disfiguring scars.

[ML's] diagnosis was traced back to a trip he made to Colombia's Magdalena Medio region, one of many remote, tropical locations where the sandflies that transmit the disease are present.

These types of rural locations are the backdrop to Diseased Landscapes [https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/projects/humanities-social-sciences-tackling-global-challenges-diseased-landscapes/], a project spearheaded by British and Colombian researchers exploring the impact of leishmaniasis on workers who pick coca -- the raw ingredient used to make cocaine. The research is focused near the Colombian-Venezuela border, one of the prime coca-growing areas of Colombia.

Compared to other forms of informal employment, coca picking provides reliable income, paying approximately COP 80 000 (GBP 15) [about USD 21] per day. Not only is it attractive to people in this part of Colombia, where more than 56 per cent of the population's income is below the region's poverty line, but it's why low-income Venezuelan migrants come to areas like Catatumbo [Norte de Santander Department], says Alejandro Cañizares, a research assistant for the Diseased Landscapes team.

Since 2015, Venezuela's economic and political crisis has driven mass migration to Colombia, now home to nearly 2 million Venezuelan migrants. For 2 years the border between the 2 countries was closed but illegal armed groups help people cross clandestinely. Often, Venezuelan migrants who arrive via these irregular routes do not have documents or fixed incomes, leaving them vulnerable to the armed groups who "lure them in" to work on coca plantations, explains Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.

The manual work of raspachines or coca pickers is physically demanding. They toil under the sun for 30 to 45 days at a time, and are typically confined to coca farms and exposed to health risks like leishmaniasis, says Wilfredo Cañizares, executive director of Fundación Progresar, a human rights NGO working on the border. Coca pickers were unable to speak to The Telegraph due to security concerns.

Leishmaniasis is endemic in Colombia; in 2020, the World Health Organisation reported 6124 cases of the cutaneous form of the disease, though scientists consider actual figures to be higher. It's one of the WHO's neglected tropical diseases, which according to Dr Iván Vélez, director of the University of Antioquia's Program for the Study and Control of Tropical Diseases (PECET), is why the country "lacks good methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

In Catatumbo, there are few hospitals and most are inaccessible. If patients make it to a clinic, many GPs lack the technical expertise to diagnose leishmaniasis, explains Dr Maria Adelaida Gómez, coordinator of the biochemistry and molecular biology unit at Colombia's International Centre for Training and Medical Research. This is one of the reasons case numbers are sorely underreported.

Only patients who receive a parasitological diagnosis are prescribed treatment. In Colombia, the most common treatment is glucantime -- highly toxic injections administered daily for between 20 and 28 days. Patients report experiencing headaches, nausea, and suffer a loss of appetite and fatigue.

"There were some days...when I was bed-bound with chills, my defences were low, I couldn't get up," [ML] says, remembering the treatment period. While he found the disease itself painless, the cure was tough: glucantime affected his ability to concentrate, and the tiredness left him unable to work.

These side effects can cause patients to abandon treatment, Dr Vélez says. Additionally, injections can only be administered by medical professionals, so patients must travel to hospitals to receive them.

The 1st choice treatment for leishmaniasis is a 28-day course of miltefosine tablets. However, tablets are not always available in Colombia and can cause side effects like vomiting and abdominal pain. Miltefosine is also not recommended for pregnant women.

Problems accessing medical care and treatment in Colombia mean that leishmaniasis sufferers often resort to traditional cures or the guidance of local healers. Natural remedies are plant-based or involve burning lesions with a hot machete or hot panela (unrefined sugar). According to Dr Vélez, these can successfully treat cutaneous leishmaniasis but are painful.

The PECET is currently working to develop more treatments for cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, a lack of funding has prevented progress.

"The disease is associated with poverty," states Dr Álvaro Acosta-Serrano, a reader in the parasitology and vector biology departments at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

Historically, sufferers of leishmaniasis have been stigmatised in Colombia because of the disease's association with Colombia's civil war, a time when case numbers were the highest ever. For low-income Venezuelans, whose migrant condition is already "easily identifiable" to Dr Acosta-Serrano, leishmaniasis scars can worsen discrimination.

For researchers, leishmaniasis is more than just a public health issue -- it's the lens that magnifies Colombia's working conditions that expose sufferers, including vulnerable migrants, to the disease. Not until [there is a reduction in] poverty, [improved] access to health care, and [stabilisation of] the ongoing conflict in rural areas, can leishmaniasis wounds really heal.

"Leishmaniasis [is] a way of seeing everything that is wrong with the system," says Juan Montoya, a Diseased Landscapes researcher.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Colombia, "especially in sylvatic foci, and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working in coffee plantations can be seen as a risk factor. Epidemic outbreaks of CL [cutaneous leishmaniasis] caused by _L.eishmania braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_, and _L. panamensis_."

The departments bordering Venezuela have previously been regarded as low incidence areas (Alvar J, Vélez ID, Bern C, et al; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.Suppl. S19 Colombia; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). The endemicity is due to abundance of animal reservoirs and of the sandfly vector. The report underlines that leishmaniasis is a disease of poverty and illegal immigrants from Venezuela are particularly at risk. - Mod.EP]
