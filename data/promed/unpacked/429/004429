The health vice minister, Dr Edgar Gimenez, met yesterday [19 Aug
2008] with Boqueron [department] political and health authorities to
organize an epidemiological barrier to halt the hantavirus outbreak,
detected in the area of La Patria [in Boqueron], 785 km (488 mi) from
the capital. The approach is intersectoral and will begin today [20
Aug 2008].

Since the incubation period is up to 6 weeks, Dr Ivan Allende,
director of epidemiology, warned that in the worst-case scenario, it
would be possible to have 50 or more infections during this period.
Dr Carlos Britos, of the Protected Areas of SEAM [Secretariat for the
Environment of the Paraguayan government], held that the hantavirus
outbreak had a lot to do with deforestation and spoke of a probable
logging moratorium.

A hantavirus outbreak with apparent chain transmission to 9
individuals has been recorded in the area of La Patria, with 4
deaths, people hired from the Oriental region, who worked cleaning up
and logging in said area [La Patria].

According to the Ministry of Health, between 2005 and 2007[?], 56
cases positive for hantavirus [infection] with 12 deaths have been
registered. In Central Chaco, hantavirus [infections] have been
recorded at least since 1987, and, according to local sources, in the
last 20 years more than 200 people have been infected and the number
of humans who have lost their lives totals 30. For example, in 2001,
87 [hantavirus] infections were recorded.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about the basis
on which a hantavirus infection diagnosis was made, or evidence for
person-to-person transmission. Andes virus is the only South American
hantavirus shown to do this, and would not be expected to occur in
the Chaco region, western Paraguay. There is no indication of which
hantavirus might be involved in these cases.

Hantaviruses that cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and could be
involved in these cases include Bermejo virus (in _Oligoryzomys
chacoensis_, Chacoan pygmy rice rat) found in Paraguay; Laguna Negra
virus (in _Calomys laucha_, small vesper mouse; and _C. callosus_,
large vesper mouse) found in W. Paraguay, Bolivia, W. Brazil; and Oran
virus (in _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, long-tailed pygmy rice rat)
found in NW Argentina, southern Bolivia, and probably is present in
Paraguay.

Alto Paraguay virus (in _Holochilus chacarius_, Chaco marsh rat) is
found in NW Paraguay but is not associated with human disease.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr James Mills for an inventory list of hantaviruses.

The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has an
excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses available at
