Seven people were confirmed killed following an outbreak of cholera in Nigeria's capital Abuja, local health authorities said Thursday [24 Jun 2021]. A total of 91 suspected cases have been recorded in Abuja as of Wednesday [23 Jun 2021].

Mohammed Kawu, acting secretary in charge of Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS) of the Federal Capital Territory, told a press conference in Abuja. Kawu said out of the 91 suspected cases, 3 have so far tested positive for cholera through the use of rapid diagnostic test kits.

He said from May 2021 the city began to receive reports of sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in some communities in Abuja, and the health secretariat through the department of public health had intensified surveillance in the communities. He also said that the secretariat had provided some rapid diagnostic test kits, drugs and consumables in some of the health facilities with reported cases.

According to Kawu, community sensitization on preventive measures is ongoing. He enjoined residents to report any case of diarrhea to the nearest health facility or the department of public health.

Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. The infection is frequently reported in Nigeria due to the lack of potable water supply, especially in densely populated areas.

[A number of states of Nigeria have ongoing outbreaks of _Vibrio cholerae_. The lack of clean water, often exacerbated by times of either drought or flooding, is the most relevant risk factor for cholera acquisition. - Mod.LL
