In Uttar Pradesh, 7 more children have succumbed to Japanese
encephalitis [virus infection-JEV], taking the toll in the deadly
brain fever to 30 this month [November 2009]. The deaths were reported
in Mahrajganj, Kushinagar, and Gorakhpur districts yesterday [9 Nov
2009], additional director (Health) P Rawat said. He said 16 new
patients suffering from the disease have been admitted to the BRD
Medical College in Gorakhpur.

Of the total 2839 cases of Japanese encephalitis and acute
encephalitis syndrome reported from the region this year [2009], 496
patients have died, Rawat said.

[The encephalitis cases continue in this region of Uttar Pradesh.
Again, there is no indication of the proportion of the cases that are
due to JEV infection and how many are due to another, as yet
unspecified, etiological agent. Without a specific determination of
the agent causing the acute encephalitis syndrome, it will be
difficult to devise and implement control or prevention measures. An
additional report published in another 10 Nov 2009 issue of the Press
Trust of India
(<http://www.ptinews.com/news/371110_Four-more-succumb-to-encephalitis--toll-touches-503>) indicated that there have been 2864 cases in this area, with as many as 18 new patients admitted to local
hospitals.

[The case fatality rate of nearly 20 percent is bad enough, but it can
go up to 30 percent for JE. Are they not vaccinating in UP? - Mod.JW]
