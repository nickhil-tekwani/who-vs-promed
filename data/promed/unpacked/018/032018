A cluster of cases of _Escherichia coli_ infection was being investigated on Wed 6 Jun 2012, in the metro Atlanta area as health officials in several southern states looked at similar cases, including at least 1 death. The Georgia Department of Public Health on Wednesday confirmed the region has 5 confirmed cases of a strain known as _E. coli_ 0145. One sufferer required hospitalization. No deaths, however, have been reported in Georgia.

The department, which is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has identified 2 cases of _E. coli_ 0145 in Cobb County and 1 each in Cherokee, Coweta, and Forsyth counties. According to public health spokeswoman Nicole Price, 4 of the 5 cases involve women 18 to 52 years old, and the _E. coli_ was reported between 15 and 28 Apr 2012. The source of the _E. coli_, however, has not been determined.

"At this time, we continue to interview new cases as we are notified of them," Price said in a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "We have detected no food items or environmental exposures that are statistically associated with illness at this time. This investigation is ongoing."

Food Safety News reported recently that an _E. coli_ 0145 outbreak in Louisiana killed a 21 month old girl in New Orleans on 31 May 2012 and sickened at least 2 other adults. Louisiana health officials are also working with CDC to track down the cause of the outbreak. Health departments in Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida also were investigating similar cases.

Price, of the Georgia Department of Public Health, said [Wed 6 Jun 2012] that no connection had been made between the cases in Georgia and others outside the state. "If a connection is established, we'll make that known," she told the AJC.

According to Food Safety News, _E. coli_ O145 is 1 of the "big six" _E. coli_ strains now considered adulterants in food by the US Department of Agriculture. The other strains are O26, O45, O103, O111, and O121.

[The state of Georgia can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1AYh. A Georgia county map can be seen at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/georgia.shtml. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

As suggested in the ProMED-mail post regarding the Louisiana case (E. coli EHEC - USA (14): (LA) fatality 20120605.1156789), it seems that the cluster of cases is wider than just Louisiana with cases in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida. It is not clear if all the isolates are genetically-related but it is likely that they are.

We await more information from CDC or state officials regarding the extent and source of this outbreak. - Mod.LL]
