The clear-up of a substance on Cornish beaches has begun after it was found to be palm oil, a contractor says. A dog that ate the substance died and several others became sick, according to vets.

Cory Environmental, which works for Cornwall Council, said it was removing the substance after it was identified as "safe to touch". Public Health England (PHE) said the substance was identified as a "non-harmful oil-based product".

PHE had warned people to avoid 11 west Cornwall beaches, although Cornwall Council did not close them.

Cornwall Council contractors Cory put up warning signs on the beaches affected by the substance, which was 1st seen on Sunday [20 Oct 2013] at Pedn Vounder beach and was described by witnesses as smelling like firelighters. [I think firelighters contain naphthalene. - Mod.TG]

Beaches affected included Praa Sands, Porthcurno and Penzance promenade. Cory said the clear-up was starting "straight away". PHE said the substance had been confirmed as a "non-toxic, degraded, edible oil or fat".

Dr Femi Oshin -- from PHE Devon, Cornwall and Somerset -- said: "It's reassuring that the substance has been found to be some kind of cooking oil. It has clearly turned rancid and that's why we've had reports of it smelling so bad.

"While not harmful to people, it's unpleasant, and we'd still advise people -- and dog owners with their pets -- to keep away from it, and allow the council's contractors to get on with taking it away and disposing of it."

PHE also warned it was possible the substance would affect other beaches over the forthcoming days. The substance was analysed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). Palm oil has a wide variety of uses and is found in food, soaps and shampoos and biofuels.

[This story has more twists and turns than a coiled up rope. First of all, rancid oil smells nasty but it is very distinguishable from firelighters, also known as naphthalene. So why are so many people reporting the chemical smell, not the rancid oil smell?

Also, since when does rancid oil kill dogs? Enough of the oil should make them sick with diarrhea, and maybe cause transient vomiting. I know of no property in palm oil that in and of itself should kill dogs, even if the oil is rancid.

The next thing I wonder is how the palm oil got loose. It is usually shipped in barrels. The photo on the original website, and this one also, looks like a patty of salt or foamy flotsam. So how did palm oil get out of its shipping container? When did this spill occur? Where did it occur? And why doesn't it look like normal oily water as we have seen in other oil spills? Even in the salt water of the ocean, I cannot see how oil would look like a salt patty. While enough salt can be toxic to animals, I fail to see how palm oil in salt water would kill animals, or look like what is in the photo.

So I would like to ask the company that is cleaning the beach: what is this substance really? It is safe to touch, but it kills dogs, so warning signs have to be put up.

There is something just not right about all of this. Maybe someone should collect some of these white patty-looking things and have them analyzed at a private laboratory.
