Bihar's Gaya district is being hit by another disease outbreak amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of people have been affected with chickenpox, a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Most cases are being reported from Banshraj Bigha and Boknari villages under the Paraiya Khurd block, with more than 100 patients in the age group of 2-80 being affected. Villagers have expressed disappointment against the district administration and the state government for not taking cognizance of the situation and not providing the medical assistance needed.

However, K.K. Rai, the civil surgeon of Gaya, told media that a team of medical officers visited the Pairaiya block for inspection on Fri 2 Apr 2021 and that action will be taken after the reports from the team. Meanwhile, Rai said, villagers have been asked to keep the patients indoor and sanitise the area, which is equally important apart from medical assistance to the patients.

The varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox infection can spread through direct contact with the rash. It can also spread when a person carrying the virus coughs or sneezes and another person inhales the air droplets.

Vaccination is the best way to prevent chickenpox. The disease can easily spread to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. This means that if you have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against the disease, you're likely to be immune to it. Chickenpox may affect people more than once, but this is rare. A few people may get chickenpox even after vaccination, but with milder symptoms and fewer blisters and mild or no fever.

Normally, it is a mild disease, but sometimes it can cause serious complications including bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints, or bloodstream (sepsis); dehydration; pneumonia; inflammation of the brain (encephalitis); toxic shock syndrome; Reye's syndrome in children and teenagers who take aspirin during chickenpox; and death.

[This is an added burden to India, on top of the surge in COVID-19 cases, although the locations of the most intense activity are apparently different. The target vaccination groups of the 2 viruses also are different, children in the case of chicken pox, and older individuals in the case of COVID, making it a little more difficult to capture both populations, adding to the challenge. - Mod LK
