Ebola Virus Eliminated as Cause of Death of 2 Recruits at Training College
------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Blood tests from the Kenyan woman police recruit who died on Mon 9
Apr 2001 from a mysterious disease, have ruled out the deadly Ebola virus as
a possible cause, Kenyan medical authorities announced on Fri 13 Apr 2001.
Public Health minister, Sam Ongeri, confirmed that the tests were
"conclusive" saying they should now put the Ebola hemorrhagic fever scare to
rest. The authorities, together with the World Health Organisation (WHO),
also confirmed that tests carried out by the National Institute for Virology
in Johannesburg showed no traces of the disease.
Preliminary reports from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) on Thu
12 Apr 2001 also ruled out several other viral hemorrhagic fevers;
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever and Lassa
fever. KEMRI researcher, Lee Dunster, observed that the deceased woman's
condition had deteriorated faster than usual for most Ebola fever victims,
"suggesting other causes of death." He confirmed an earlier assertion by
Ongeri that her family had a history of bleeding disorders. The 24-year-old
police trainee died at the Mathari Catholic Hospital in Nyeri, 140 km north
of Nairobi on Mon 9 Apr 2001 after bleeding from body openings. The
patient's bleeding and vomiting of blood had raised fears of an outbreak of
Ebola hemorrhagic fever. A second patient, a 19-year-old recruit at the
Police Academy admitted to the same hospital, has been diagnosed as
suffering from typhoid and enteric fever. Health Minister Ongeri said this
patient was responding well to treatment. Ongeri also released the
post-mortem results of the dead recruit saying she died of disseminated
intra-vascular coagulation.
