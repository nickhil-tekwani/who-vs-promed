--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the omicron variant (B.1.1.529), SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations reached record levels (1 [see source URL for complete references, tables and figures]). Children younger than 5 years may be especially vulnerable because they are not eligible for COVID-19 vaccination (2). We examined incidence rates and clinical outcomes of omicron infection before and after micron became the predominant variant in the United States.

Results
-------
This cohort study included a total of 651 640 children younger than 5 years: [1] omicron cohort, 22 772 children; [2] delta cohort, 66 692 children; and [3] delta2 cohort, 10 496 children. The monthly incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections was mostly stable (1.0-1.5 cases per 1000 persons per day) between September and November 2021 (delta-predominant period) but rapidly increased to 2.4 to 5.6 cases per 1000 persons per day in December 2021, coincident with the emergence of omicron variant. Monthly incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections peaked at 8.6 cases per 1000 persons per day in the 1st half of January 2022 (omicron-predominant period) and 8.2 in the 2nd half of January 2022. Incidence rate of omicron infection was higher in children aged 0 to 2 years than in those aged 3 to 4 years. Omicron cohort was younger and with fewer comorbidities than delta cohort, but differences were eliminated after matching (Table). Risks for severe clinical outcomes in children infected with omicron variant were significantly lower than those in the matched delta cohort (Figure, A), whereas the risks for severe clinical outcomes in delta2 cohort did not differ from those in delta cohort (Figure, B). There were fewer than 10 deaths in all cohorts.

Discussion
----------
Results of this cohort study suggest that the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection with omicron variant was 6 to 8 times that of delta variant in children younger than 5 years, but severe clinical outcomes were less frequent than with delta variant. Study limitations include potential biases introduced by the observational and retrospective analyses of electronic health records and the need for validation of the results from other data. Study findings may inform risk-benefit considerations about in-person school attendance, mask use, and vaccination implementation for young children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
Background: Real-world evidence supporting vaccination against COVID-19 in individuals who have recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is sparse. We aimed to investigate the long-term protection from a previous infection (natural immunity) and whether natural immunity plus vaccination (hybrid immunity) was associated with additional protection.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we formed 3 cohorts using Swedish nationwide registers managed by the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and Statistics Sweden. Cohort 1 included unvaccinated individuals with natural immunity matched pairwise on birth year and sex to unvaccinated individuals without natural immunity at baseline. Cohort 2 and cohort 3 included individuals vaccinated with one dose (one-dose hybrid immunity) or 2 doses (2-dose hybrid immunity) of a COVID-19 vaccine, respectively, after a previous infection, matched pairwise on birth year and sex to individuals with natural immunity at baseline. Outcomes of this study were documented SARS-CoV-2 infection from 20 Mar 2020 until 4 Oct 2021, and inpatient hospitalisation with COVID-19 as main diagnosis from 30 Mar 2020 until 5 Sep 2021.

Findings: Cohort 1 comprised 2 039 106 individuals; cohort 2, 962 318 individuals; and cohort 2 and 3, 567 810 individuals. During a mean follow-up of 164 days (SD 100), 34 090 individuals with natural immunity in cohort 1 were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with 99 168 infections in non-immune individuals; the numbers of hospitalisations were 3195 and 1976, respectively. After the first 3 months, natural immunity was associated with a 95% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.05 [95% CI 0.05-0.05] p < 0.001) and an 87% (0.13 [0.11-0.16]; p < 0.001) lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation for up to 20 months of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 52 days (SD 38) in cohort 2, 639 individuals with one-dose hybrid immunity were registered with a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with 1662 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were 8 and 113, respectively). One-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 58% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0.42 [95% CI 0.38-0.47]; p < 0.001) than natural immunity up to the first 2 months, with evidence of attenuation thereafter up to 9 months (p < 0.001) of follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 66 days (SD 53) in cohort 3, 438 individuals with 2-dose hybrid immunity were registered as having had a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection compared with 808 individuals with natural immunity (numbers of hospitalisations were 6 and 40, respectively). Two-dose hybrid immunity was associated with a 66% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (aHR 0.34 [95% CI 0.31-0.39]; p < 0.001) than natural immunity, with no significant attenuation up to 9 months (p = 0.07). To prevent one reinfection in the natural immunity cohort during follow-up, 767 individuals needed to be vaccinated with 2 doses. Both one-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0.06 [95% CI 0.03-0.12]; p < 0.001) and 2-dose (HR adjusted for age and baseline date 0.10 [0.04-0.22]; p < 0.001) hybrid immunity were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation than natural immunity.

Interpretation: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals who have survived and recovered from a previous infection remained low for up to 20 months. Vaccination seemed to further decrease the risk of both outcomes for up to 9 months, although the differences in absolute numbers, especially in hospitalisations, were small. These findings suggest that if passports are used for societal restrictions, they should acknowledge either a previous infection or vaccination as proof of immunity, as opposed to vaccination only.

[3] Diabetes risk
Date: Thu 31 Mar 2022
Source: Nature [edited]

People who get COVID-19 have a greater risk of developing diabetes up to a year later, even after a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with those who never had the disease, a massive study (1) of almost 200 000 people shows. The research, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology earlier this month [March 2022], is one of a growing number of studies (2) showing that COVID-19 can increase a person's risk of diabetes, months after infection.

"When this whole pandemic recedes, we're going to be left with the legacy of this pandemic -- a legacy of chronic disease" for which healthcare systems are unprepared, says study co-author Ziyad Al-Aly, chief researcher for the Veterans Affairs (VA) St Louis Healthcare System in Missouri.

Al-Aly and Yan Xie, an epidemiologist also at the VA St Louis Healthcare System, looked at the medical records of more than 180 000 people who had survived for longer than a month after catching COVID-19. They compared these with records from 2 groups, each of which comprised around 4 million people without SARS-CoV-2 infection who had used the VA healthcare system, either before or during the pandemic. The pair previously used a similar method to show that COVID-19 increases the risk of kidney disease (3), heart failure and stroke (4).

The latest analysis found that people who had had COVID-19 were about 40% more likely to develop diabetes up to a year later than were veterans in the control groups. That meant that for every 1000 people studied in each group, roughly 13 more individuals in the COVID-19 group were diagnosed with diabetes. Almost all cases detected were type 2 diabetes, in which the body becomes resistant to or doesn't produce enough insulin.

The chance of developing diabetes rose with increasing severity of COVID-19. People who were hospitalized or admitted to intensive care had roughly triple the risk compared with control individuals who did not have COVID-19.

Even people who had mild infections and no previous risk factors for diabetes had increased odds of developing the chronic condition, says Al-Aly. Of the people with COVID-19 who avoided hospitalization, an extra 8 people out of every 1000 studied had developed diabetes a year later compared with people who were not infected. People with a high body-mass index, a measure of obesity -- and a considerable risk factor for type 2 diabetes -- had more than double the risk of developing diabetes after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Given the extraordinary number of COVID-19 cases globally -- 480 million confirmed cases and counting -- the modest increase in diabetes risk could correspond to a drastic rise in the number of people diagnosed with the disease worldwide, if the observed trends hold true, says Jonathan Shaw, an epidemiologist at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia.

But the findings might not translate to other groups of people. The US veterans in the study were mostly older, white men, many of whom had elevated blood pressure and were overweight, putting them at high risk of developing diabetes, says Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist studying diabetes at the University of Wollongong in Australia. But that risk is much lower in younger people, he says, and higher in some other ethnic groups.

And it's possible that some people in the control group had undetected mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 but were never tested, potentially skewing the data, Al-Aly adds.

Other factors might also be contributing to the apparent rise in diabetes among people who recovered from COVID-19, says Shaw. Existing cases of diabetes might have gone undetected until people sought medical care for COVID-19.

Early in the pandemic, researchers raised concerns based on anecdotal reports in young people and children that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, might damage cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, triggering type 1 diabetes.

But data on a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes remain mixed. Several studies (5-7) have found no evidence that the disease is causing the uptick in cases of type 1 diabetes in younger adults or children. And a laboratory study published in February [2022] also challenged the idea that SARS-COV-2 destroys insulin-producing pancreatic cells (8).

A lingering question is whether the metabolic changes observed in people who had COVID-19 persist after one year. More research is needed to clarify long-term trends in new-onset diabetes at a population level and to tease apart what might be causing them, says Shaw.

This study and others suggest following acute COVID, patients and their doctors should be on the alert for symptoms of diabetes, even though there is some controversy as to whether this sequela is COVID-induced. Other long-term effects that seem to be associated with long COVID also need to be followed closely. Individuals should be informed to pay attention to their general health after recovering from acute infection.

A global total of 4054 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 30 Mar 2022 to late 31 Mar 2022).

A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South-East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 42.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 6.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 20.9% decrease in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.36 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 490.04 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.17 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
