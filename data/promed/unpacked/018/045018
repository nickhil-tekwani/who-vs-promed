State of Connecticut Mosquito Management Program, Wed 23 May 2001 [edited

First WNV-positive crow recorded in Connecticut
-----------------------------------------------
On Wed 23 May 2001, the State Mosquito Management Program announced the
first bird positive for West Nile virus (WNV) in Connecticut, submitted
from Milford and tested through the state's bird surveillance system. The
city of Milford has a comprehensive mosquito control program that includes
larviciding and mosquito breeding site reduction. No other preventive
measures are needed at this time. Though finding a positive crow this early
in the season poses a very low risk to the public, it is always prudent to
avoid mosquito bites at any time during the season.
As of 18 May 2001, 20 birds have been submitted for testing from 14 towns
in 5 counties. Out of these 20 birds, 15 were crows, and the others were a
blue jay, sparrow, catbird, thrush, and ovenbird. Of the 20 birds submitted
one crow is positive, 7 other birds are negative, and [results for 12 are
pending.
On Thu 24 May 2001, weather permitting, The Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station (CAES), in coordination with the Milford Health
Department, will place mosquito traps near the area where the dead bird was
found. These traps will help to determine the level of WNV activity and the
number and species of mosquitos in the area. [Reports from this agency will
be released weekly on Wednesdays

Dead crow in Baltimore infected with West Nile virus
----------------------------------------------------
This bird was one of 94 that have been tested this year by state health
authorities and was the first confirmed case of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection. Authorities are taking a more restrained approach to fighting
the virus than they did last year. To combat mosquitoes and the public
health hazards they present, many states and localities have established
mosquito control programs. Historically Montgomery County has not engaged
in these routine programs because its topography, climate, and generally
well-drained soil do not warrant it.
There have never been any reported cases of WNV in Montgomery County in
either humans or mosquitos at any time, during the last 2 years or
currently. _Culex pipiens_, the northern house mosquito, is the only
mosquito found to carry WNV in natural settings; reports of other
mosquitoes carrying the virus referred to insects infected in laboratory
settings. If you encounter _Culex pipiens_ around your home, it has almost
certainly come from no more than 2500 feet away. Northern house mosquitoes
are very weak fliers and seldom travel more than half a mile.

West Nile virus-positive bird count in New Jersey reaches 9
---------------------------------------------
New in this update: 4 West Nile virus(WNV)-positive crows found in Edison,
on 11, 14, and 16 May 2001, and in Piscataway, on 15 May 2001.
To date, 84 crows and one hawk have been tested by the Department of Health
and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory. In total 9
crows found in Bergen and Middlesex Counties have tested positive for the
presence of WNV. Positive crows were found as follows: 30 Apr 2001, in
Upper Saddle River (Bergen); on 3, 4, 11, 14, and 16 May 2001 in Edison; on
8 May 2001, in Iselin; and on 10 and 15 May 2001, in Piscataway (Middlesex).
In 2000, a total of 6 New Jersey residents became ill and one died from WNV
infection. The virus was also detected in mosquitoes, horses, crows, and
other birds in 20 of the state's 21 counties. The virus was detected for
the first time in the western hemisphere in September 1999, in birds found
in New York City and Westchester County.
