The Alamance County Health Department announced Thursday, 23 Feb 2012, that it has lifted restrictions on who can receive the Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccine. The pertussis medication, which is usually 35 dollars, is now free for a limited time, and the department will be holding a communitywide vaccination clinic in March 2012.

The decision follows a countywide pertussis outbreak that has 82 confirmed, probable, suspected, or epidemiologically linked cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, since the middle of December 2011.

"Epi-link" cases refer to pertussis cases in which the disease develops in a person who had been in close contact with someone who had a lab-confirmed case. "Probable" defines a case of pertussis in which the patient has not been in close contact with a lab-confirmed case but has exhibited symptoms for 2 or more weeks, said Communicable Disease Program Coordinator Ayo White.

To date, said White, there have been 15 lab-confirmed, 31 epi-linked, 3 probable, and 3 suspect cases in Alamance County. "These are the numbers up to this point," and are expected to change quickly, she said. White acknowledged that 82 is a high number of pertussis cases and said, "This is more than usual."

Medical Director Dr Kathleen Shapley-Quinn said, "In the 10 years I've worked here, I've never had an outbreak (in Alamance County)."

The outbreak is a big one, hitting 5 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, 2 day cares, and 3 other individuals in the county.

The 12 schools with confirmed cases of pertussis are: Broadview Middle School, Turrentine Middle School, and Eastlawn Elementary School in Burlington; Western Alamance Middle School in Elon; B. Everett Jordan Elementary School, South Graham Elementary School, Alexander Wilson Elementary School, and Graham Middle School in Graham; Audrey W Garrett Elementary School, Hawfields Middle School, and Woodlawn Middle School in Mebane; and Haw River Elementary School in Haw River.

The health department has been administering azithromycin, an antimicrobial, to confirmed cases and Shapley-Quinn said the department has taken a targeted approach when giving the antibiotic to suspect cases. She said those at the highest risk take precedence, such as those children who have been in close proximity to confirmed cases and have poor immune systems.

Health officials are concentrating their efforts on immunizing as many people as possible, especially those at higher risk. Immunization Program Coordinator Christie Sykes said infants less than 12 months, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women are considered high risk.

The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said Mon 27 Feb 2012, that it is seeing an increase in cases of whooping cough. In a news release, the health department said it has confirmed 4 cases of whooping cough in recent weeks. 3 of the cases were infants less than a year old; the other was an adult.

"While the number of cases is not especially large, any such spike is notable because of the highly contagious nature of the disease," the release said. "The situation is compounded by an alarming lack of immunizations among infants in these recent cases."

Infants and young children are at the highest risk of life-threatening consequences. More than half of infants younger than one year of age who get the disease must be hospitalized. Of those infants who are hospitalized for pertussis, about one in 5 will get pneumonia and about one in 100 will die, according to the CDC.

There has been a confirmed outbreak of whooping cough at a Chester County public school. Valley Forge Elementary School has had 2 confirmed cases of pertussis, and that is enough to constitute an "outbreak," according to Betsy Walls, bureau director for personal health services at the Chester County Health Department.

"All of the kids were protected (vaccinated)," she tells KYW Newsradio, "but that's because of their age and school requirements. It was the faculty that didn't have it -- in adults it's not a required vaccine. And so that what was we were doing there on Friday [4 Feb 2012]. We thought we would have some students, but we had all adults (needing to be vaccinated)." One of those diagnosed with the ailment is a student, the other is not.

The Scott County Health Department in eastern Iowa is sending out an alert that there are more whooping cough cases in area schools. Davenport television station KWQC reports that 10 cases were reported last week [week of 20 Feb 2012] alone.

Iowa has seen a jump in whooping cough cases in recent years.

To date, 6 students on Vashon [Island] have confirmed cases of whooping cough, prompting King County health officials to issue a letter urging parents and teachers to be on alert for the highly contagious disease. The public health agency, in a letter to all parents and staff at Vashon's 3 public schools, says adults should pay attention to cold symptoms among children, noting they could be the 1st signs of pertussis, or whooping cough.

Those adults who have contact with babies or young children, considered the most vulnerable to severe infection from the disease, should take extra precautions to ensure they don't get the illness, the letter adds. Babies, according to the letter, signed by Eileen Benoliel, a public health nurse in the Communicable Disease Epidemiology & Immunization Program at Public Health, Seattle & King County, can die from pertussis.

The letter was issued late Fri 25 Feb 2012, after officials learned there are 4 confirmed cases of pertussis at the Vashon School District and 2 confirmed cases of the disease in school-age children who attend a private school on Vashon. School officials believe there's a linkage to those cases, or "evidence of contagion," as Sarah Day, Vashon's school nurse, put it, which led to the county's letter.

According to recently tabulated numbers, 33 percent of the students in the Vashon school district have not been fully vaccinated against whooping cough. What's more, according to health officials, the immunization is not highly effective or long-lasting. Health officials believe the pertussis vaccine is only 59 to 89 percent effective in preventing the disease.

According to the state Department of Health, there were 728 cases of pertussis in Washington from 1 Jan to 17 Dec 2011. This compares with 529 cases in the same period in 2010. 86 infants under one had the illness and 29 were hospitalized, including 23 who were under 3 months. 2 infants died. In King County, there were 98 confirmed cases in 2011, according to James Apa, the communications manager for county health department.

Vashon School District currently has 75 students who don't have either a record of their immunizations or a signed waiver on file, Soltman said. Next week [week of 27 Feb 2012], he said, the district will issue letters to the parents or guardians of those students, telling them that they have 30 days to submit documentation of immunization or a waiver to the district. Those students whose families don't comply, he said, won't be allowed to attend public school.

"In light of the concerns from the county health department," Soltman said, "we need to get Vashon's schools in compliance with the state's immunization laws."

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA continue to expand in efforts of continue to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem but other issues may be at work.

From the moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED post Pertussis - USA: (MN) 20100514.1573:
"Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains. As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis - Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly) responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen population. This is even true for pertussis.
