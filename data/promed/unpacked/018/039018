The Wisconsin DNR [Department of Natural Resources] has confirmed that a wild deer has tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD] in the southeastern portion of Marquette county. The infected deer was an adult doe harvested during the 2018 gun deer season [17-25 Nov 2018]. It is the 1st CWD positive wild deer in Marquette county. State law requires the DNR to enact a feeding and baiting ban in counties or portions or counties within a 10 mile [16 km] radius of where the infected deer was located. That means a 3-year baiting and feeding ban for Marquette county and a 2-year baiting and feeding ban for Green Lake county. Those bans went into effect [1 Mar 2019]. Green Lake county will also be designated as a CWD-affected county because of the positive test. For more information, visit the DNR website at https://dnr.wi.gov/
