Suspected Case of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Diagnosed in Palermo
--------------------------------------------------
Fears are growing that there could be a [new] human case of mad cow disease
[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD
in ProMED-mail], diagnosed a few days ago in Palermo. Doctors in the D'Anna
clinic, which specialises in nervous diseases, noticed signs of a variation
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome in the clinic's training college.
This syndrome is the human form of the neurological disease that is
[associated with] eating meat [originating from] animals with mad cow
disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy]. The female patient was admitted
to the neuro-psychiatric ward about 10 days ago and went home after doctors
had carried out clinical tests because she didn't want any further tests.
Now doctors are saying that other signs are in line with their fears. The
results of an EEG (electroencephalogram) of the 30-year-old woman were
similar to other cases of the common version [?] of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob
syndrome, particularly the initial signs of the illness. They were also
similar to those found in the young woman from Menfi [also in Sicily], who
died at the age of 27 in August 2003 in Milan's Besta hospital. To date,
this has been the only known case in Italy of the human form of the disease
[vCJD].
"Clinical tests to identify the disease unfortunately suggest that it is
the human form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome [presumably this is
intended to read "the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy" -
Mod.CP]," the neuro-psychiatrist's ward in the D'Anna clinic confirmed.
This is the thinking of Prof. Federico Piccoli, the chief neurologist at
the Palermo general hospital, who followed the Menfi case, and whose
comments were reported in today's edition of the Repubblica newspaper. He
said, "I haven't seen the girl, but the results my colleagues have suggest
that it could be a new case of mad cow disease".

[Confirmed cases of vCJD have been identified in the United Kingdom (146),
France (6), Italy (1) and Ireland (1). In addition to these 154 confirmed
cases, 3 other cases of vCJD have been recorded in Canada (1), Hong Kong
S.A.R. (1) and the USA (1), bringing the total to 157. In the latter 3
cases, however, each of the patients had long periods of residence in the
United Kingdom. Suspected cases have been reported from Czech Republic,
Guadeloupe, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, South Africa, but none have been
confirmed so far.
The report of a suspected 2nd case of vCJD in Sicily is disquieting,
particularly at a time when the original outbreak of vCJD in the United
Kingdom now seems to have passed its peak. The above AGI report is confused
in detail and judgment should perhaps be withheld until more information
becomes available regarding the basis for the diagnosis of vCJD rather than
classical sporadic CJD. - Mod.CP]
