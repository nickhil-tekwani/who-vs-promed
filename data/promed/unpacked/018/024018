Excess death of crows, possible West Nile
---------------------------------------------
On my way out to France, while in Chennai Airport, I read in the Times of
India, Hyderabad edition of 29 May 2005, that more than 300 crows have
fallen dead in the suburbs of Mumbai.
This is reminiscent of the West Nile virus outbreak in New York.
I have alerted the Indian Council of Medical Research, the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases (both in Delhi). My worry is that people
may not take the deaths of crows seriously. I have asked for the immediate
virological study of dead crows to look for West Nile virus (WNV). WNV is
mosquito-transmitted (by _Aedes aegypti_) which is found in plenty in
India. The disease in humans is manifested as encephalitis as well as fever
without encephalitis; there is considerable mortality, especially in older
adults.
Will you keep a watch on this episode and follow this up?

[We are grateful to Prof. T. Jacob John for this self-explanatory, timely
intervention. His e-mail was sent on 31 May 2005; we are sorry for its
delayed posting. As can be seen in the 2nd item, the crow die-off seems to
continue. - Mod.AS]

Do you know why crows are dying?
-------------------------------------
City environmentalists and doctors are concerned, both about the growing
number of crows dying in Mumbai as well as their inability to determine the
cause of these deaths.
According to environmentalist Sunjoy Monga, the reported toll has reached
363 for Mumbai and over 150 in the Khar-Bandra area. "We spotted 3 crows
falling dead in a span of one hour, 2 at Kherwadi and one near Bandra
court," said Monga , who has been following the rising body count of these
black and grey birds in the city.
Observers so far have not been able to pin down why the deaths are
significantly higher in Bandra and Khar. "We've not been able to explain
that yet, and we've sent out samples of the dead birds for testing," Monga
added.
The number of crows admitted at the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for
Animals, Parel, doubled last month [May 2005]. "In May, we had 12 crows
admitted, as opposed to 4 or 5 in other months. All the birds were found on
the road, and surprisingly, none of them were because of accidents," said
Ashish Sutar, hospital manager at Petit. According to Sutar, all the crows
admitted were dehydrated, with stiff legs and wings, and were unable to
fly. "We couldn't save 6 of them, while the others are on medication. It is
some sort of viral infection," added Sutar.
The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), while stating it did not have
reports of any cases on crow deaths so far, said, in the event the death
toll increases, it would take action soon. Isaac Kehemkar, public relations
officer, BNHS, said: "The crow deaths are in specific areas and could be
related to some kind of food poisoning. But if the toll is seen to
increase, we will take specimens and start studying them scientifically."
