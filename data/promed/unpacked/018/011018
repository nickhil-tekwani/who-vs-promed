US blood supply vulnerable to _Babesia_ infection spread by ticks
-----------------------------------------------------------------
_Babesia_, a tickborne parasite of red blood cells, is being
transmitted through blood transfusions, according to results of a
collaborative study, led by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, of data from the past 3 decades. Transfusion-associated
cases of babesiosis have been increasingly recognized since 1979, the
year the 1st known case occurred.

The article about the study and an accompanying editorial appear today
[6 Sep 2011] online in the Annals of Internal Medicine. In the report,
CDC and collaborators describe 159 transfusion-related babesiosis
cases that occurred during 1979-2009, most (77 percent) from 2000 to
2009. No _Babesia_ test approved by the Food and Drug Administration
is available for screening prospective blood donors, who can feel fine
despite being infected.

Babesiosis is a potentially fatal, but treatable, complication of
transfusion. Severe consequences, such as multi-organ failure and
death, are most often seen in persons without a spleen, the elderly,
and those with a weak immune system. The study authors say prevention
strategies, including development of a screening test, are needed.
Some manufacturers are working with investigators at blood
establishments to develop FDA-approved tests for _Babesia_ for
donor-screening purposes.

"We want clinicians to become more aware of babesiosis, including the
small possibility of transmission via blood transfusion," says Barbara
Herwaldt, MD, MPH, CDC medical epidemiologist, and lead author of the
article. "If a patient develops unexplained fever or hemolytic anemia
after a transfusion, babesiosis should be considered as a possible
cause, regardless of the season or US region."

Because babesiosis is spread most commonly by ticks, the risk of this
disease is another reason for people to prevent tick bites. People who
unknowingly become infected through the bite of a tiny tick (about the
size of a poppy seed) can transmit the parasite via blood transfusion.
Therefore, prevention of tickborne infection can help safeguard the
blood supply.

Most US tickborne _Babesia_ cases have occurred in 7 states in the
Northeast and the upper Midwest (in parts of Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and
Wisconsin), particularly during the warm months of the year. However,
transfusion-associated _Babesia_ cases have been identified in 19
states and have occurred year-round.

Dr Herwaldt points out that even severe _Babesia_ cases, not just
cases that are asymptomatic or mild, are easily missed unless the
diagnosis is considered. Even then, babesiosis often is mistakenly
diagnosed as malaria, which also infects red blood cells.

In January 2011, babesiosis became a nationally notifiable disease,
which means state health departments are encouraged to share
information about cases of babesiosis with CDC. More accurate
information about tickborne and transfusion-transmitted cases of
babesiosis will help CDC and its partners, including the Food and Drug
Administration, in their continued efforts to make the blood supply
even safer.

With no screening test available, the study emphasizes that infection
with babesia should be considered in febrile patients with hemolytic
anemia and a history of blood transfusion. The only diagnostic test is
a microscopy of a thick blood film just as for malaria. PCR diagnosis
is another possibility. PCR for _Babesia_ spp and expertise on
evaluating thick blood films for babesia or malaria are most probably
not available routinely in all hospitals, which makes diagnosis
difficult as samples needs to be send to centers where these methods
are available. - Mod.EP]
