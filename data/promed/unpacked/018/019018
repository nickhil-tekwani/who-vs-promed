6 new cases of dengue fever have been reported in Palau since 12 Aug 2004,
according to health officials, bringing the total number of cases to 23,
since the first 4 were reported before the Festival of Pacific Arts on 14
Jul 2004. During the festival 8 more cases were identified, and by August
additional new cases were confirmed.

Director for the Bureau of Hospital and Clinical Services, Dr. Dever,
Acting public health director Maireng Sengebau Kingzio and Incident
Commander Dr Seleima Lalabalavu have continuously made radio announcements
about the dengue outbreak. Flyers in the English and Palauan languages have
also been widely distributed to announce the outbreak, after which spraying
for mosquitoes started in the capital, Koror and Airai.

The Ministry said to end the dengue outbreak, Palauans should clean their
homes and yards, remove possible mosquito breeding sites and use insect
repellent. The people have also been encouraged to watch the local
television for programmes.

With 7 cases already being reported from the capital city in 2004, Delhi
faces serious threat of dengue outbreak that may be more severe than
2003's, officials said Wednesday.

"Already 7 cases -- 6 from MCD areas and one from NDMC area -- have been
reported," S K Garg from the NDMC told reporters here. "The situation is
bad this year. We found mosquito breeding 2 months back and breeding is
increasing," Garg said. The mosquito index has doubled this year. About
2000-3000 dengue cases were reported in 2003 with 36 deaths, he said. 2
AIIMS doctors had also died of dengue.
