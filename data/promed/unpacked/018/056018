Everybody knows one good reason to stay away from skunks. Now there
are 9 more. That's the number of confirmed cases of rabid skunks in
Hopkins County this year [2007] alone, as many as have been recorded
in the previous 7 years combined.
Dr. James H. Wright, regional zoonosis veterinarian with the Texas
Department of State Health Services office in Tyler, issued a notice
Monday [30 Apr 2007] that there have been 9 confirmed cases of skunks
with rabies in the county so far this year.
Number 8 was recorded earlier this month [April 2007] when a
homeowner near Sulphur Springs found her 2 dogs had been fighting
with a skunk the morning of 12 Apr 2007. She was unable to find the
skunk but had her 2 canines vaccinated as a precaution.
Four days later, she found a dead skunk in the pen with her dogs. She
put the skunk in a plastic bag and took it to a local veterinarian,
where it tested positive for rabies.
"Since this incident occurred, another rabid skunk has been reported
in Hopkins County," Dr. Wright stated in the news release. "That
makes number 9 in 2007."
Skunks are one of the most common carriers of rabies. Of the 14
confirmed cases in Hopkins County between 1998 and 2006, 8 were
skunks, 2 were bats, 2 were cats, one was a dog and one was an equine.
Because skunks are nocturnal animals, seeing one of the animals out
and about during the daylight hours -- especially one that shows no
fear of humans or domestic animals -- is a potential sign of rabies.
"However, rabid skunks are also active at night," Dr. Wright wrote.
"They sometimes actually come into people's yards and attack their
pets. They have the ability to get through very small holes in fences
or dog pens in order to gain entry. Therefore, day or night, one
should investigate unusual barking or other actions of pets."
Rabies is a virus that affects all warm-blooded animals. The disease
eventually kills the infected animal after attacking the brain,
causing encephalitis or inflammation of the brain. It is generally
transmitted through saliva, though ingestion of a diseased animal
would also cause infection.
People are normally infected with rabies through domestic pets which
have contracted the virus from a wild animal, such as a skunk. The
best protection against rabies is to vaccinate all pets over 3 months
of age once per year, following up each year with a booster shot.
The number of confirmed cases this year [2007] underscores the
importance of having family pets vaccinated for the virus, which is
virtually untreatable in animals; once they've contracted rabies,
euthanasia is the recommended course of action.
Anyone bitten by an animal suspected of having rabies must go through
a painful series of injections to stop the disease from taking hold.
"Rabies vaccine not only protects the pet, but also the family," Dr.
Wright wrote. "Invariably, if a dog, cat, or horse has rabies, 2 to 6
people have to take the rabies post-exposure rabies prevention shot
series because of their contact with the domestic animal."
According to Dr. Wright, the appropriate post-exposure follow-up for
a pet or for livestock that has come into contact with a rabid animal
depends upon its rabies vaccination status. Its owner should consult
with a veterinarian about the proper course of action to take.
