A freight train derailed and released a cloud of toxic gas that sent
at least 20 people to hospitals, an accident that touched nerves
still raw more than 2 decades after the Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster.
Hundreds of people were evacuated, and others fled their homes on
their own after the Monday [16 Jul 2007] evening derailment sparked a
fire in a cargo of yellow phosphorous, creating a cloud of gas that
affected 14 villages in the former Soviet republic.
20 people were hospitalized, although their lives were not in danger,
said Defense Ministry spokesman Ihor Halyavinsky. Authorities later
said that 6 had been released, although media reports said other
people in the area sought medical help.
"A disaster has happened. After the Chernobyl catastrophe, we are
dealing with (another) case that can pose a real threat for our
people," said Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk, who went to the
area in the Lviv region. "It is an extraordinary event, the
consequences of which cannot be predicted."
He later backtracked on the remark, and other officials took pains to
stress that the situation was under control and the danger minimal.
"The cloud of a toxic gas dispersed, and there is no threat for
people's lives," said Ihor Krol, spokesman for the Emergency
Situations Ministry.
The train, en route from Kazakhstan to Poland, derailed near Lviv,
and 15 of its 58 cars overturned, Krol said. Six of them caught fire,
and the poison cloud spread over a 35-square-mile area containing 14
villages, he said.
Rescuers extinguished the blaze. Phosphorus compounds are chiefly
used in fertilizers, although they are important components of
pesticides, toothpaste, detergents as well as explosives and
fireworks. The highly toxic substance can cause liver damage if
consumed.
Emergency workers sprinkled contaminated land with soda and sand and
tried to cool off the cars, Krol said.
Residents were advised to stay indoors, not to use water from wells,
not to eat vegetables from their gardens [and not to] drink milk
produced by their cows. Of the 11 000 people living in the
contaminated area, 815 were evacuated, Krol said.
Media reports said other people had left the villages amid
uncertainty about the effects of the accident.
On independent Channel 5 television, an elderly woman and a
middle-aged man in one of the affected villages -- neither identified
-- said authorities had not told them how to respond to the accident.
"Doctors did not come to our village. I only saw advice about what to
do on TV," the woman said.
Concerns about the government response to such accidents still
lingers from the 1986 explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant in
Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. The Soviet government kept the
world's worst civilian nuclear accident under wraps for days and
played down the disaster long afterward.
Transport Minister Mykola Rudkovsky said a commission was working at
the scene to determine the cause of the rail accident. A criminal
case was opened, which is standard practice in former Soviet
republics, and state railway agency director Volodymyr Kozak said
sabotage had been ruled out.
Cars of the freight train continued to burn near Lviv on the Polish
border Tuesday [17 Jul 2007]. 16 people were poisoned, 13 of whom
were hospitalized, said Ihor Krol, the spokesman for the emergency
situations ministry.

[Other articles indicated television reports did not tell residents
what to do other than to stay inside and to seal the house. They
reported that the extreme fear stemmed from lack of communication from
the authorities. Signs of illness were not covered in the news
announcements, and still other articles downplayed the illness,
reporting that it was from giddiness.
It would be frightening to be told not to eat your vegetables or
drink your water or your milk. There were no indications in any
article that issues with animals -- cows, chickens, or swine -- as a
food source were being addressed.
White or yellow phosphorus is a colorless, white, or yellow waxy
solid with a garlic-like odor. It does not occur naturally, but is
manufactured from phosphate rocks. The remainder of this comment will
address white phosphorous, as the effects and uses are almost the
same.
White phosphorus reacts rapidly with oxygen, easily catching fire at
temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above room temperature. White
phosphorus is used by the military in various types of ammunition,
and to produce smoke for concealing troop movements and identifying
targets. It is also used by industry to produce phosphoric acid and
other chemicals for use in fertilizers, food additives, and cleaning
compounds. Small amounts of white phosphorus were used in the past in
pesticides and fireworks.
White phosphorus can enter the environment when it is made, used in
manufacturing or by the military, or accidentally spilled during
transport and storage. It can be found in the water and bottom
sediment of rivers and lakes near facilities that make or use it. In
the air, white phosphorus reacts rapidly with oxygen to produce
relatively harmless chemicals within minutes. In water, white
phosphorus reacts with oxygen within hours or days. In water with low
oxygen, white phosphorus may degrade to a highly toxic compound called
phosphine, which eventually evaporates into the air and is changed to
less harmful chemicals. White phosphorus can build up slightly in the
bodies of fish that live in contaminated lakes or streams. In soil,
white phosphorus may stick to particles and be changed within a few
days to less harmful compounds. In deep soil or sediments with little
oxygen, white phosphorus may remain unchanged for many years.
Little information is available about the health effects that may be
caused by white phosphorus. Most of what is known about the effects of
breathing white phosphorus is from studies of workers. Most of what is
known about the effects of eating white phosphorus is from reports of
people eating rat poison or fireworks that contained it. Breathing
white phosphorus for short periods may cause coughing and irritation
of the throat and lungs. Breathing white phosphorus for long periods
may cause a condition known as "phossy jaw," which involves poor wound
healing of the mouth and breakdown of the jaw bone. Eating or drinking
small amounts of white phosphorus may cause liver, heart, or kidney
damage, vomiting, stomach cramps, drowsiness, or death.
We do not know what the effects are from eating or drinking very small
amounts of white phosphorus-containing substances over long periods of
time. Skin contact with burning white phosphorus may burn skin or
cause liver, heart, and kidney damage. We do not know whether or not
white phosphorus can affect the ability to have children or cause
birth defects in people. There is no medical test that shows whether
you have been exposed to white phosphorus.
Similar issues would be expected with farm animals. It is likely that
there will be some problems for some time with various animals,
including bovines, swine, and fowl. It would not be surprising to
find that a number of avian species die from the fumes.
There are tests to tell what the concentrations are. Knowing the
concentrations, it would be possible to calculate whether and when it
would be safe to consume the vegetables or the animals, whether that
is meat, milk or eggs.
It would be advisable for the producers to closely watch their
animals for signs of illnesses. Also, since the fields where the
animals graze may be contaminated, the fields are a source of
possible continued exposure for the animals.
The minister may be right that this is a disaster. None of the
articles about the incident detailed how many cattle, swine or avians
may be affected.
