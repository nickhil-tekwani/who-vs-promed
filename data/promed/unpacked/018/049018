Public health alert: mosquito warning
-------------------------------------

NSW Health is alerting the community to protect themselves against mosquito bites.

Japanese encephalitis virus has been detected in samples from commercial pig farms at 5 locations in southern and western NSW, indicating the virus is likely circulating in the mosquito population.

JE is a mosquito borne disease that may affect animals, including pigs, and humans. The virus is spread by mosquito bites.

"It is really important to protect yourself from mosquito bites as mosquitoes can spread viruses including Japanese encephalitis," said Dr Kerry Chant, Chief Health Officer.

Less than 1% of people infected with JE experience symptoms, which typically include fever, joint pain, and rash. Occasionally, JE can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness.

"There is no specific treatment for JE or other mosquito-borne viruses. The best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes", Dr Chant said.

Simple actions to avoid mosquito bites include:
- Cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear when outside.
- Use an effective insect repellent on exposed skin and reapply within a few hours. The best mosquito repellents contain Diethyl Toluamide (DEET), picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
- Use insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units (indoors) and mosquito coils (outdoors) to clear rooms or repel mosquitoes from an area.
- Cover all windows, doors, vents and other entrances with insect screens.
- Remove any water-holding containers outside the house where mosquitoes could breed.

[ProMED thanks Andrea Forde for submitting this report.

The only previously reported case of Japanese encephalitis on the Australian mainland was a Cape York fisherman who became ill in 1998, while the 1st known outbreak in Australia killed 2 people on the outer island of Torres Strait, Queensland in 1995. The virus was also found in Torres Strait mosquitoes.

The number of Japanese encephalitis positive pig samples in the above report is not given, nor are the tests used to establish positivity. This report does indicate that JE virus transmission has occurred in several (5) locations indicating some geographic dispersion in the state and another report states that there is evidence of virus presence in southern Queensland. A 27 Feb 2022 report states that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been found in pigs in Echuca, as well as in NSW border regions and southern Queensland (https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victorian-health-authorities-warn-of-encephalitis-virus-found-in-pigs-20220227-p5a00h.html). However, a 25 Feb 2022 report states that JEV has not been detected in mosquitoes in Victoria nor in other states at this point in time (https://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-advisories/japanese-encephalitis-virus-detected-in-victoria). The presence in pigs is of public health concern because pigs are JE virus amplifying hosts with high viremia and can serve as a source of infectious blood meals for large numbers of vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY
