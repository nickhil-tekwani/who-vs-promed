Tularemia Associated with a Hamster Bite - Colorado, 2004
------------------------------------------------------------
In Apr 2004, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
(CDPHE) was notified about a boy aged 3 years with diagnosed tularemia
associated with a hamster bite. Tularemia has not been associated
previously with pet hamsters. CDPHE conducted an investigation to determine
whether other owners of hamsters were at risk. Clinicians and public health
officials should be aware that pet hamsters are a potential source of
tularemia.
During Jan 2- Feb 8 2004, the boy was exposed to 6 hamsters that his family
had purchased from a pet store in the Denver metropolitan area. Each
hamster reportedly died from "wet tail disease" (i.e., diarrhea) within 1
week of purchase. One hamster bit the child on the left ring finger shortly
before it died. 7 days later, the child had fever, malaise, painful left
axillary lymphadenopathy, and skin sloughing at the bite site. After
treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate (brand name Augmentin - Mod.LL)
failed, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of a left axillary lymph
node 49 days after symptom onset for persistent painful lymphadenopathy and
intermittent fever. Tissue culture yielded a suspected _Francisella
tularensis_ isolate, which was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction and timed-release fluorescence at the CDPHE laboratory.
Convalescent serology was positive at a titer of 4096, and the isolate was
identified by CDC as type B. No other risk factors for tularemia exposure
were identified, including no other animal contact, no exposure to game
meat, and no known mosquito, tick, or fly bites. The patient improved after
treatment with ciprofloxacin.
Workers at the pet store reported an unusual number of deaths among
hamsters but not other animals during Jan-Feb 2004; no carcasses were
available for testing. One of 2 cats kept as store pets had a positive
serologic test for _F. tularensis_ at a titer of 256. Neither cat had
appeared ill to store employees.
Lists of employees, pet suppliers, and customers who purchased hamsters
during Dec 2003-Feb 2004 were obtained from the store owner. 15 of 18
customers were located and interviewed. 8 of these had hamsters that died
within 2 weeks of purchase, but all carcasses had been disposed of and were
unavailable for testing. One customer and one employee who had febrile
illness after being bitten by hamsters from the store were negative for _F.
tularensis_ by serologic testing. The same customer's hamster was
available, and it was also negative for _F. tularensis_ by serology and
culture.
Approximately 80 percent of the 50 hamsters at the pet store came from
customers who had pets with unanticipated litters. The other 20 percent
were purchased from 2 small-pet breeders. These breeders were contacted,
and neither reported an unusually high number of deaths of hamsters or
other animals. One breeder also supplied animals to 2 pet stores in
Wyoming. The Wyoming Department of Health had not been notified of any
tularemia cases linked to these stores.
Confirmation of a hamster as the infectious source was limited by the delay
between the patient's illness onset and diagnosis and subsequent lack of
availability of implicated hamsters for testing. Nonetheless, the hamster
that bit the patient was the most likely cause of infection because no
other exposures or risk factors were identified. The positive serologic
test for _F. tularensis_ in a pet cat at the store suggested that other
animals in the store might have been exposed to _F. tularensis_. In
addition, the proximity of the onset of the patient's illness to the timing
of the hamster bite, reports of illness among hamsters, and the deaths of
hamsters at the pet store indicated an infected hamster as the likely
source of illness. A possible scenario, similar to an outbreak of tularemia
that involved zoo primates (1), is that infected wild rodents infested the
store and spread the infection to hamsters by urinating and defecating
through metal screens covering hamster cages. The infected cat might have
had a subclinical or unrecognized illness after catching or eating an
infected wild rodent.
The store owner was advised to set traps for wild rodents and to inform the
state health department of any recurrent animal deaths or reports of ill
customers or staff. No other cases have been identified.
Although tularemia has been associated with hamster hunting in Russia (2),
it has not been associated previously with pet hamsters in the United
States. However, clinicians and public health officials should be aware
that pet hamsters might be a potential source of tularemia. Moreover,
because _F. tularensis_ is a potential agent of biologic terrorism (3),
clinicians should have a heightened awareness of tularemia.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as
voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _F. tularensis_ is found in a
wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low
temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal
matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can
be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are
important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of
mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks,
deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food
or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. An exposure such as an animal
bite will likely result in ulceroglandular or glandular tularemia
(depending upon whether there is a local lesion associated with lymphadenitis).
ProMED posted on alert (20041008.2760, see below) in Oct 2004 regarding
hamsters from a Canadian pet distributor that were found to be infected
with type B tularemia as well. No human cases were reported.
Tularemia in humans is generally a rural disease, and occurs naturally
throughout much of North America and Eurasia. The type B strain (_F.
tularensis_ biogroup palearctica) is the dominant strain in Eurasia,
whereas both biogroups (type A is biogroup tularensis) are found in the
USA. Type A is said to be more virulent than type B.
Although not generally transferable from person to person, the infectious
dose of _F. tularensis_ is quite low, and the organism is listed among the
category A bioterrorism agents. - Mod.LL]

"Clinical, epidemiological and therapeutical experience with human
tularaemia: the role of hamster hunter." (ref 2)
The discussion notes that "tularemia has been associated with hamster
hunting in Russia". It should be noted that the literature also documents
tularemia associated with hamster hunting in Hungary (Szekelyfoldi, J.
1970. Tularemia in hamster hunters. Del Med J 42:305-6). In 1966, 18 cases
were diagnosed in which the source of infection was hamsters. These
infections occurred in 4 villages in Hungary along the Berettyo River. Of
note, tularemia has also been found in bordering Rumania, where an epidemic
among hamster hunters was reported in 1955.
In addition to Russia, there has also been tularemia in hamster hunters in
Ukraine. In April-May 1934, an outbreak occurred "in connection with the
hunting of water rats, hamsters, and hares" (Pollitzer, R., and Fordham
University New York. Institute of Contemporary Russian Studies. 1967.

review. Institute of Contemporary Russian Studies Fordham University,
Bronx, N.Y., page 16). - Mod.DS]
