[1] Canada - bird surveillance

A dead crow, testing positive for the [West Nile] virus, was found
close to the intersection of Hwy. 7 and Ninth Line, the region's
health services reported. The bird was picked up as part of the
region's West Nile virus program.
Health services requests you report dead crows and blue jays to
determine possible West Nile virus activity in York Region. West Nile
[virus] is transmitted to the bird population by infected mosquitoes.
Crows and blue jays are known to be most susceptible to the disease
and act as an early warning sign for the virus in a particular area.
Last year [2006], the 1st birds testing positive showed up in
mid-August. In 2006, there were 3 human cases and 10 birds and 10
mosquito pools testing positive for the virus in the York Region.
There have been no reported cases of West Nile in humans in Ontario in 2007.

[It is interesting to note that West Nile virus infection in a bird
has been detected considerably earlier than last year (2006).
