Municipalities of northern Minas Gerais have been compelled to monitor the occurrence of yellow fever cases. These actions were sparked after monkey deaths due to yellow fever were observed in Ubaí and Icaraí in August 2021.

Samples of organs of howler monkeys found dead in Luislândia are still being analysed at a Fundação Ezequiel Dias (FUNED) laboratory in Belo Horizonte. There were also deaths in Serra das Araras, Chapada Gaúcha, although without confirmation of yellow fever diagnosis.

The monitoring actions by the state secretary of health of Minas Gerais have been ongoing since 20 Sep 2021. The investigation involves health officials of Montes Claros, of FUNED, of Januária and of Varginha.

Until [2 Oct 2021], teams of technicians, accompanied by staff from the municipalities, will travel around rural areas collecting mosquitoes that are potential vectors of the disease. If dead monkeys are found, they will be tested for yellow fever.

"With the positive results for yellow fever, it appears that the virus is circulating in the region. Therefore, it is important to investigate the extent of the problem so that we can take the most appropriate measure to contain the advance of the disease," emphasized Agna Menezes.

[The expansion of yellow fever that has been taking place in South America for the last couple of years raises concern for public health and also potential conservation problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. The virus is endemic in much of central and northern South America, and makes sporadic incursions to southern areas of the continent, like the states of Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, Misiones in Argentina, or Paraguay.

The yellow fever virus was introduced into the Americas about 400 years ago, yet the complex interactions that were established after its introduction are far from being elucidated. There is a need for more research on the eco-epidemiology of the disease in the continent, specifically on the role of each non-human primate species, and especially in the presence of the persistent anthropogenic global environmental change. - Mod.PMB
