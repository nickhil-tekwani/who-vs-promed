Surfers raised alarm after once-pristine waters caused major problems with eyesight, fevers, and throat aches.

The black volcanic sand of Khalaktyrsky beach -- one of the gems of the Kamchatka peninsula near its largest city Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky -- is littered with hundreds of dead sea animals, from deep-sea Giant Pacific octopuses, to seals, sea urchins, stars, crabs and fish.

The Pacific Ocean waves, once favoured by local surfers and loved by tourists, now have a strong toxic smell; water colour has a clear yellow tinge. The strongly-bonded community of local surfers signalled trouble with the beach 3 weeks ago, saying they had a burning sensation in their eyes, strong headaches, often fevers, throat aches, and a feeling of losing eyesight after getting out of the water.

Now it emerges even staying close to the water makes a poisonous effect (posing in pictures of gas masks on original site.) They continue to dive to update on the state of sea animals, bringing devastating news the once thriving underwater life is gone, with even the strongest shells that could tear wetsuits lying open, dead. [Hopefully the divers are in full wet suits. This amount of chemical could soak through the skin, even in the water and cause delayed issues in these divers. - Mod.TG]

Seals behave as if in a trance, they said, refusing to dive and spending as long as possible on the surface.

Checks by the regional Ministry of Natural Resources showed there was a spike in levels of phenols (2.5 times) and oil products (3.6 times).

Urgent investigation into the cause of water contamination was ordered today [3 Oct 2020] by Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Far Eastern federal district Yury Trutnev. Two versions are discussed so far, with one being recent military training at Kamchatka causing the ecological catastrophe, the other leakage of oil products and phenol from ships passing through the Avacha Gulf.

Poisoning of water in the area of Khalaktyrsky beach in Russia's Kamchatka region, according to preliminary data, was caused by oil products leak from a commercial tanker, which was [the leak was] eliminated. The ownership of the vessel has not yet been established, a search is under way, a source in the emergency services of the Far East region told TASS on Saturday [3 Oct 2020]. The source added, "This area of the Pacific Ocean has active routes of sea cargo ships."

It was reported earlier an excess of phenol and oil products was found in the coastal zone near Khalaktyrsky beach, where, according to local residents, a massive stranding of sea animals was seen on the shore. Later, phenol and oil products were identified in 3 more areas of the Avachinsky Bay in the Kamchatka region. The Russian Investigative Committee began a procedural check of information about the mass death of sea animals on Kamchatka beaches.

Ecological catastrophe' sees hundreds of animals wash up dead at Russian tourist spot and swimmers treated for chemical burns as scientists examine possible cause. People have been warned to stay away from black-sand Khalaktyrsky beach, on the country's Pacific shoreline. The beach has been littered with octopuses, seals, sea urchins, fish, and crabs. Locals have reported loss of sight, burning, and swollen eyes, fever, and nausea. A landfill site under the 7182 ft [2189 m] Kozelsky volcano has been blamed for pollution.

A leak of toxic rocket fuel is the likely cause of a pollution catastrophe at one of Russia's top surfing beaches, says a leading ecologist. Locals have reported debilitating medical problems including loss of sight, burning and swollen eyes, fever, nausea, vomiting, skin rashes, and head and throat aches.

"Phenols. The word phenol is also used to refer to any compound that contains a 6-membered aromatic ring, bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Thus, phenols are a class of organic compounds.

"Phenol is an organic compound appreciably soluble in water, with about 84.2 g dissolving in 1000 mL (0.895 M). Homogeneous mixtures of phenol and water at phenol to water mass ratios of approximately 2.6 and higher are possible. The sodium salt of phenol, sodium phenoxide, is far more water-soluble.

"Phenol and its vapors are corrosive to the eyes, the skin, and the respiratory tract. [61] Its corrosive effect on skin and mucous membranes is due to a protein-degenerating effect. [50] Repeated or prolonged skin contact with phenol may cause dermatitis, or even second and third-degree burns.[62] Inhalation of phenol vapor may cause lung edema. [61] The substance may cause harmful effects on the central nervous system and heart, resulting in dysrhythmia, seizures, and coma. [63] The kidneys may be affected as well. Long-term or repeated exposure of the substance may have harmful effects on the liver and kidneys. [64] There is no evidence that phenol causes cancer in humans. [65] Besides its hydrophobic effects, another mechanism for the toxicity of phenol may be the formation of phenoxyl radicals. [66]

"Since phenol is absorbed through the skin relatively quickly, systemic poisoning can occur in addition to the local caustic burns. [50] Resorptive poisoning by a large quantity of phenol can occur even with only a small area of skin, rapidly leading to paralysis of the central nervous system and a severe drop in body temperature. The LD50 for oral toxicity is less than 500 mg/kg for dogs, rabbits, or mice; the minimum lethal human dose was cited as 140 mg/kg.[50] The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), US Department of Health and Human Services states the fatal dose for ingestion of phenol is from 1 to 32 g. [67]" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol)

Water has a tendency to dilute pollutants. So, for there to be enough fumes to burn eyes and throats when on the beach, and for this number of animals to die, this cannot have been a small leak. This was more likely a huge amount of fuel] or other chemical contaminants leaking from the ship or ships.

Presently, it is suspected phenols and oil are involved. If it was from a ship it may not be crude oil and there may be more substances potentially being spilled or leaked than what we know, because of all the wildlife death, and the strong, irritating smells on the beach. - Mod.TG
