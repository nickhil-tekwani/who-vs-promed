[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 7329 birds submitted for
testing, 6733 birds tested, and 206 confirmed West Nile virus-positive. In
addition there were 1989 sightings of dead birds recorded. This represents
an increase of 952 birds tested and 73 more birds confirmed positive since
the last update on Thu 24 Jul 2003.
Equine cases (5) and a human case are reported fro the first time, and the
number of positive mosquito pools has increased by 2.
No positive West Nile virus results have been reported yet from the
peripheral provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island,
Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut --
not surprising for the last 3 areas since it is still pretty cold up there
around the Arctic Circle, & mosquitoes arenÂ´t flying there yet. - Mod.CP/JW]
