Q FEVER, WORKPLACE SAFETY: REQUEST FOR INFO
*******************************************
Date: Wed, 9 Jul 1997
From: Ross Tancred <rosst@ozemail.com.au>
In an attempt to implement new requirements of the Division of Workplace
Health and Safety (Queensland, Australia) we are trying to find out as much
information as possible regarding the transmission and contraction of the
disease. There are 2 things I would like:
1. Any information that any readers could refer or send to me
2. Contact details for a relevant expert whom I could discuss the
problem with and who may be able to visit our sites if required. (Local
Queensland, Australia would be more appropriate.)
One of the issues is to perform a "risk assessment" of our workplace, but a
few other issues are on the table and need resolving.
Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.

[I assume that this person is primarily interested in information about the
risks of Q Fever to abbatoir (slaughter house) workers. There is much
information available about Q Fever in standard public health references.
Can anyone recommend experts and sources available in Australia?
Please send your replies directly to Mr. Tancred. - Mod.MDM]
