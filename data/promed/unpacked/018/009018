Foot and Mouth Disease confirmed in Surrey
-------------------------------------------
Initial laboratory tests on the samples taken
this morning [12 Sep 2007] from the cattle on the
holding in Surrey where disease was suspected
have indicated the presence of Foot and Mouth Disease [FMD].
On the basis of these initial laboratory results
and clinical symptoms Debby Reynolds, UK Chief
Veterinary Officer (CVO), has confirmed FMD. The
farm comprises a number of separate parcels of
land and a single Protection Zone will be put in
place which extends a 3 km [1.86 mile] radius
from each of them, and a Surveillance Zone of 10
km [6.2 mile] radius beyond that. Footpaths will
be closed in the Protection Zone.
The farm itself has been under restrictions since
last night [11 Sep 2007]. This morning the
decision to cull the cattle was taken on the
suspicion of disease based on clinical signs, and
an initial 10 km Temporary Control Zone was put in place around the premises.
A movement ban of cattle, sheep, pigs and other
ruminants has now been imposed in England and
parallel arrangements are being made by the
Scottish and Welsh administrations. No movements
of susceptible animals are allowed except under
licence. The licence conditions may vary between England, Scotland and Wales.
In England, controls are in place on movement of
animal carcasses, animal gatherings, shearing and
dipping are restricted, and all farms must
increase levels of biosecurity. In both the
Protection and Surveillance Zones, there will be
requirements for increased levels of biosecurity
on farms, movement controls, controls on
transportation of dung/manure and treatment of
animal products to ensure destruction of the FMD
virus. Confirmation of the movements which will
be permitted under licenses will be issued later today.
Secretary of State for the Environment, Hilary
Benn, said, "This is news that no one wanted to
hear, least of all the farming industry. The
immediate establishment of both a Protection
Zone, with footpaths closed within it, and a
national animal movement ban shows our
determination to contain and eradicate this
latest outbreak. Having spoken this morning to
farming industry representatives, I know they
share this view and the utmost vigilance is now needed from everyone."
CVO Debby Reynolds said, "At this stage we have
not identified the strain or origin of this
outbreak. The situation remains uncertain, and I
urge all animal keepers to be vigilant for signs
of disease, practice stringent biosecurity
measures, including the movement ban and licensing conditions."
All animals currently in transit should continue
to their destination where they should remain in place.
The European Commission has been informed.

Foot and Mouth Disease update: national movement ban and slaughter on suspicion
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Limited movements of animals susceptible to FMD
will be allowed under strict biosecurity
arrangements to address immediate welfare issues,
in line with the contingency plan. The ban on
movements of animals susceptible to FMD,
announced earlier today, remains in place.
In addition, a decision has been taken to
slaughter on suspicion animals on a farm adjacent
to the Infected Premises in Surrey that was
confirmed earlier today. This is a precautionary
measure and was identified by Animal Health during surveillance this afternoon.
Debby Reynolds Chief Veterinary Officer said,
"This is a developing situation. Our objective is
to contain and eradicate the disease. As with the
outbreak last month [August 2007], we will be
seeking to take a staged and risk-based approach
to controls. I urge all animal keepers to remain
vigilant and follow the most stringent of biosecurity measures."
Under the national movement ban rules the
decision has been taken to permit under general licence:
- Movements of dairy cattle across or along
public highways for the purpose of milking;
- Movement of FMD susceptible animals for emergency veterinary treatment;
- Movement of animals from markets and shows will
be allowed to farms under specific licence issued
by Animal Health and subject to veterinary inspection.
Some very limited movements are necessary for
immediate welfare and practical reasons where
animals have been at markets or at shows.
Movements and collections will only be permitted
to take place in accordance with strict licensing
conditions, in particular biosecurity measures.
Similar arrangements are in place in Scotland and Wales.

EU declares UK 'high risk' area
-------------------------------
Europe's veterinary experts today agreed
emergency measures declaring the whole of Britain
a "high risk" area until mid-October [2007].
The move came after the Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health, holding its regular
weekly meeting in Brussels, received confirmation
of the latest foot and mouth outbreak.
Earlier the committee, made up of national
government veterinary experts from all EU
countries, reversed yesterday's [11 Sep 2007]
decision to lift a ban on British beef export
trade from the infected Surrey area because the
earlier outbreak of the disease seemed to have been contained.
British government officials went to the
committee this afternoon, updating the experts
and European Commission officials on security
precautions now in place once more.
The measures -� automatic under EU rules once an
outbreak strikes -� include culling of all
animals on the infected holding, a 3-km
[1.86-mile] protection zone and a 10-km
[6.2-mile] surveillance zone around the infected farm.
A Commission statement this afternoon said:
"Stringent movement restrictions and biosecurity
measures are being applied in these zones. In
addition, a movement ban on all ruminants and
pigs has again been imposed across Great Britain."
The statement went on: "The Standing Committee
adopted an emergency decision confirming these
measures and extending the categorisation of
Great Britain as a high risk area until 15 Oct
2007, subject to review. This means that live
animals susceptible to FMD cannot be dispatched
from Great Britain, nor can their products. The
only exception is for products which have been
treated in a way which inactivates the virus
(e.g., heat treatment), which were produced
before the restrictions applied or with materials
sourced from outside the restriction zone."
The restrictions mean no live animals can be sent
to Great Britain from other EU countries,
although live animals can be exported to the rest
of the EU from Northern Ireland, subject to the necessary health certificates.
A Commission spokesman added, "The Commission
will remain in close contact with the UK
authorities to monitor the development of this
latest outbreak over the coming days."

On 12 Sep 2007 FMD was confirmed at a farm in
Surrey. The farm comprises a number of separate
parcels of land: a single Protection Zone has
been put in place extending 3 km [1.86 miles]
around each of them, with a Surveillance Zone of
10 km [6.2 mile] radius beyond that. Footpaths
are being closed in the Protection Zone. Cattle
on the affected farm are being culled, together
with animals on an adjacent farm.
A national movement ban -- affecting cattle,
sheep, pigs and other ruminants -- has been
imposed throughout England, and parallel
arrangements are being made by the Scottish and
Welsh administrations. No movements of
susceptible animals are allowed except under
licence; some licences have now been made
available, however licence conditions may vary
between England, Scotland and Wales. All farms --
particularly those in the Protection and
Surveillance Zones -- must implement increased biosecurity.
A Temporary Control Zone has been placed around a
premises in Dereham, Norfolk. This is a
precautionary measure. An assessment of clinical
symptoms by Animal Health veterinary staff has
been carried out, and laboratory test results are awaited.

Pirbright back in spotlight over foot and mouth
-----------------------------------------------------
Analysis
Only last week [3-7 Sep 2007] the chief
veterinary officer Debby Reynolds confidently
announced that FMD had been eradicated following
the disastrous outbreak linked to a
Government-run laboratory in Pirbright, Surrey.
The Department for the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs assured farmers that its response
to last month's [August 2007] outbreak had been
so thorough that there was no danger of further infection.
However, those pronouncements have come back to
haunt Environment Secretary Hilary Benn as FMD
was discovered on a farm just 10 miles [16 km]
from Pirbright -- news met with anger and
disbelief in equal measure in the farming community.
So just how could FMD have returned to the UK?
Tony Wilsmore, a veterinary epidemiologist from
the University of Reading, said it was "highly
unlikely" that yesterday's outbreak in Egham
could have come from anywhere other than
Pirbright or the 2 farms near the laboratory
which had been infected. "The big question now is
how it could have been transferred despite all
the precautions that were taken."
Graham Brooks, president of the British Cattle
Veterinary Association, said it was possible
there had been a biosecurity breach either from
the Pirbright site -- where FMD vaccine is
handled -- or the 2 neighbouring farms after FMD
was identified last month [August 2007].
"If it turns out [to] be the same strain of the
virus as Pirbright, then it can only have been
transferred by the movement of people or vehicles
from the Pirbright site or the 2 farms nearby,"
he said. "It is unlikely to have been passed
directly from livestock to livestock because of
the distances involved. "If it subsequently
emerges that such a transfer happened after the
Pirbright infection, then the precautions which were taken have failed."
Mr. Wilsmore said a more likely scenario was that
the FMD virus had been transferred to the fields
in Egham before the Pirbright outbreak was
discovered. "Studies have shown that the FMD
virus can survive for up to 20 weeks given the
right conditions, particularly in cool, damp,
dark places such as hay bales. It can also
survive in water for around 50 days, so we are
within those parameters. "My guess is that the
virus may have been transferred from the
Pirbright area to Egham before the Pirbright
alert, and that the virus has survived in Egham
until, perhaps, the farmer put his cattle in an
infected field where they contracted it in the last 3 to 7 days."
Intriguingly, the last restrictions on livestock
movement were lifted on Saturday [8 Sep 2007] --
meaning the farmer whose cattle have been culled
may have moved them to the infected field over
the weekend, thinking they would be safe.
Such a scenario would suggest the Government had
lifted the ban on livestock movements too soon.
It would also mean there is a danger that the
virus is lying undiscovered on other farms,
almost anywhere in the country, where it could yet infect more livestock.
Microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington, of
Aberdeen University, suggested the virus could
have spread from Pirbright through streams. "We
suspect last month's outbreak came from a waste
pipe in the Pirbright laboratories which was
swamped by flood water that was then picked up on
the wheels of lorries," he said. "I don't know
the geography of Surrey, but investigators will
look at whether the infected water could have
found its way to Egham, where it has contaminated
material that the animals there have come into contact with."
There is likely to be fierce debate over the
Government's decision not to vaccinate or cull
animals on farms near the last outbreak, said Mr. Wilsmore.
"The Government's view was that a contiguous cull
was not necessary, and that vaccination would be
the wrong thing to do because vaccinated animals
can still catch FMD but not display the symptoms
for a considerable time. The feeling was that it
was better not to vaccinate, so that any outbreak would be identified quickly.
"Obviously the Government will now face serious
questions over whether that was the right
decision." Mr Brooks said the investigation into
the cause of the latest outbreak would centre on
vehicle and livestock movements to and from the
Pirbright area. "The Health and Safety
Executive's report into the August outbreak
concluded that FMD was transferred from the
Pirbright laboratories to neighbouring farms via
soil on lorries which went in and out of the site.
"The investigation into today's events will focus
on whether any vehicles could have picked up
infected material in the Pirbright area and
transferred it to Egham. It will also try to
discover whether the farmer in Egham bought
animals from the Pirbright area before that
outbreak was discovered, and of course the
movement of vehicles in and out of his fields and
farm will be tracked to see if the virus has spread elsewhere."

[On top of the stamping out and other containment
activities on the affected holding(s), another
crucial task on the hands of the UK Veterinary
Services is the rapid investigations of any
movements of animals, fomites, humans or vehicles
from the affected site to other locations during
the recent period. It is not clear if the
"Temporary Control Zone," reportedly placed
around a premises in Dereham, Norfolk, as "a
precautionary measure." has been applied due to
such contact or suspicion thereof.
The analysis in item [5] includes several
speculations on the time, source and route of the
FMD virus introduction into the Egham farm. The
list of speculative scenarios can be even more
exhaustive but it seems preferable to await the
results of the epidemiological investigation
which is certainly being carried out.
Subscribers may consider viewing the map which
shows the boundaries of the protection and surveillance zones, available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/pdf/declaration-pzsz120907.pdf>.
According to DEFRA's update, the affected farm in
Egham "comprises a number of separate parcels of
land." As it appears on the map, there are about
10 amalgamated protection zones, each with a
radius of 3 km around a parcel or holding. - Mod.AS]
