Largemouth bass virus found in Sutton Lake
-------------------------------------------
A virus that kills largemouth bass has been found in one of West Virginia's
most popular bass-fishing lakes.
Researchers making a routine check of state waters have found bass infected
with largemouth bass virus in Braxton County's Sutton Lake. Spot checks at
other popular bass-fishing waters have turned up no evidence of the disease.
Largemouth bass virus first gained attention in 1995 when it was implicated
in a fish kill on lakes Marion and Moultrie, the twin impoundments that
form South Carolina's Santee-Cooper Reservoir complex. The disease has
since been discovered in 19 states, mainly throughout the Southern and
Midwestern U.S.
The virus wasn't discovered in West Virginia until the state Division of
Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service teamed up in 2003
to begin looking for it.
Biologists sampled 10 Mountain State waterways: Sutton Lake, Bluestone
Lake, Stonewall Jackson Lake, East Lynn Lake, Mount Storm Reservoir, Elk
Fork Lake, Conaway Run Lake, Upper Mud River Lake, the Belleville Pool of
the Ohio River, and the Opekiska Pool of the Monongahela River.
Bass from Sutton Lake were the only ones that tested positive for the virus.
Bret Preston, the DNR's assistant chief in charge of warm water fisheries,
said the disease most likely reached the 1500-acre impoundment in 1 of 3 ways.
"It's possible that someone released a bass into the lake that had been
caught from an infected source," Preston said. "It's even possible that a
bait bucket transmitted the virus."
Preston added that there is no known danger to humans from the virus.
"There's no evidence that humans can catch the virus," he said. "But we're
recommending that people who eat bass from Sutton Lake make sure to cook
them thoroughly."
Sutton's depth and relatively cool water temperatures might be helping to
curb the disease's deadly effects. No fish kills or observations of sick
fish have yet been reported.
But Preston voiced concern that the lake's popularity as a
tournament-fishing destination might spread the virus to warmer, shallower
waters.
"Sutton is one of the state's top 3 tournament sites," he explained. "It's
very popular, especially with fishermen from Charleston and central West
Virginia."
He added, however, that tournament organizers are aware of their
tournaments' disease-spreading potential and are taking appropriate
measures to minimize the risk.
"The Bass Angler Sportsman Society's state federation is very active in
educating its membership in proper methods of handling fish during
tournaments," Preston said. "The federation has developed a number of good
techniques, and are doing a good job of making sure those techniques are
followed."
DNR biologists plan to continue monitoring lakes and rivers throughout the
state to see if the virus spreads.
"Just because we didn't get positive results at some of the waters we
sampled doesn't necessarily mean the disease isn't there," Preston said.
"We might only have caught bass that weren't carrying the virus. Because of
that, we're going to continue a broad-based sampling program -- probably 8
to 10 waters a year -- for a few more years."
