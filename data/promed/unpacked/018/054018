A new enemy has appeared in potatoes
------------------------------------
Golden potato cyst nematode was detected on more than 10 private
farms in Udmurtia. The regional authority for plant diseases
surveillance [Rosselkhoznadzor] has informed that the nematode will
persist in the ground if the 1st generation survives. Therefore it is
very important to plant nematode resistant cultivars of potato to
fight the disease.

He also said that 8 districts were put under quarantine in Udmurtia
last year [2009]. 3 districts are currently under investigation.
Samples have not yet been collected, but nematode symptoms have been
visually observed.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and
pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop
losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on potato include
stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root
system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first
occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease
management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host
species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and
nematicides. These control measures can be combined to keep nematode
levels below economic thresholds. Both PCNs have been included on the
alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Golden PCN is widely distributed in the Eurasian area and has been
reported previously from a number of areas in Russia. In recent
years, several south-central provinces as well as the extreme eastern
region reported PCN outbreaks (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed
below), but Udmurtia is geographically well separated from these.

Pale PCN has never been reported from Russia and its immediate neighbours.
