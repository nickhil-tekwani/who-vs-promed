Country / serotype / topotype / lineage
Egypt / A / Asia / Iran-05BAR-08
Iraq / A / Asia / Iran-05SIS-10
Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip) / A / Asia / Iran-05BAR-08
Turkey / Asia 1 / Asia / Sindh-08
Turkey / A / Asia / Iran-05SIS-10
Turkey / O / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
Turkey / O / ME-SA / PanAsia-2FAR-09
UAE / O / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10

In the meantime we note that the affected animals had been vaccinated twice with a trivalent vaccine A, O and Asia 1, and that the observed clinical signs were mild, while virus growth in the laboratory is slow. - Mod.AS
