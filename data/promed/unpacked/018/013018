Macao: enterovirus cases rise to 283
------------------------------------
According to the city's Health Bureau, 10 more enterovirus cases were
confirmed [in Macao], on Thursday [29 May 2008], bringing the total
number to 283 so far. These enterovirus cases comprise cases of
hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and cases of herpangina (mouth
blisters), but none of the patients was in serious condition, the
bureau said in a press statement. Of the 10 new cases, 4 were
detected in the same class of a local creche, according to the bureau.

Among the detected cases, 34 have been confirmed as EV71 (enterovirus
71) infections as of Thursday [29 May 2008]. Most of the enterovirus
patients were children enrolled in local creches and primary schools.

[The number of cases of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in Macao has
risen from 79 reported on 7 May 2008 to the current 283, reflecting
the general pattern throughout Asia. As elsewhere human enterovirus
71 has been identified as the predominant etiologic agent.

A statement from the Chinese Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organisation (WHO) on 21 May 2008 indicated that henceforth HFMD
cases would be reported on a monthly basis. However the following
Xinhua report of 23 May 2008 indicates that the epidemic in Anhui
province of China, the most severely affected region, may have
peaked. - Mod.CP]

Hand-foot-mouth disease declining in Anhui Province
---------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of hand-foot-mouth (HFMD) has ebbed in east China's
Anhui Province, which was worst hit by the viral epidemic since April
[2008], the provincial department of health said on Friday [23 May
2008]. The number of cases reported everyday dropped from a peak of
1160 on 1 May to 153 on 21 May [2008], and no further deaths had
occurred over the past 12 days, the department said in a circular. It
said 734 people were still hospitalized in Anhui, including 10 in
serious or critical condition. Doctors successfully treated 10 696
HFMD patients in Anhui, although 26 died in the outbreak.

Kindergartens in Fuyang City, the worst hit city, will resume classes
on Children's Day -- 1 Jun 2008 -- as the authorities considered the
situation was under control.

According to the Ministry of Health, HFMD can be caused by a host of
intestinal viruses, but human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and
coxsackievirus (Cox A16) were the most common. HFMD usually starts
with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and
rashes on the hands and feet. Those with EV71 often show serious
symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary
edema, and paralysis in some children. There is no vaccine.
