Following reports of leprosy in Volusia County, Florida last month [February 2015; see ProMED-mail post Leprosy, human, armadillo - USA: (FL) transmission, susp 20150303.3203338], an Alabama physician says one of his patients is the 1st known case of the bacterial disease in north Alabama, according to an AL.com report [see item 2, below: http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2015/03/leprosy_case_diagnosed_in_morg.html].

The Madison physician said his patient contracted the disease while outside the United States. According to Dr Angelo Mancuso, his patient is north Alabama's 1st known case of leprosy. The last reported cases were in south Alabama in 2012.

The patient has been referred to an infectious disease specialist and all appropriate health authorities, federal, state, and local have been informed.

According to the National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP), Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, is a chronic bacterial disease that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. Feared as a highly contagious and devastating disease, it is well established that Hansen's disease (leprosy) is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and, with early diagnosis and treatment, is not disabling.

Compiled statistics reveal that Hansen's disease (leprosy) is rare in the US. There are currently approximately 6500 cases; about 3300 require active medical management.

A Madison dermatologic surgeon has diagnosed north Alabama's 1st known case of leprosy.

Dr Angelo Mancuso announced [Wed 18 Mar 2015] that a patient of his has contracted leprosy while outside the country. This patient has been referred an infectious disease specialist. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta and the Alabama State Health Director have been notified.

This is north Alabama's 1st known case of leprosy. The last reported cases were in south Alabama in 2012, Mancuso said.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic bacterial infection that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. The disease has been long-feared as being extremely debilitating, fatal, and highly contagious. Mancuso said it is not highly transmissible and is very treatable. The doctor and former state representative said it may not be disabling with an early diagnosis and treatment.

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, treatments may last several years. In the meantime, patients can generally continue their work and everyday lives while undergoing treatment.

HHS [US Department of Health and Human Services] reports this is a rare disease in the US with only about 6500 cases nationwide and about 3300 of those requiring active medical management.

On the Hansen's disease page of the HHS website, it reads: "Yet Hansen's disease (leprosy) remains the most misunderstood human infectious disease. The stigma long associated with the disease still exists in most of the world and the psychological and social effects may be more difficult to deal with than the actual physical illness."

[About 70 per cent of people with leprosy in the US lived or worked abroad in regions where leprosy is prevalent and may have acquired their disease there. About 30 per cent of patients with leprosy in the US report no foreign residence and appear to have acquired their disease from within the US. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, where some people hunt, skin, and eat armadillos and where _Mycobacterium leprae_-infected armadillos can be found.

The armadillo population in the south-central states (Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) is derived from armadillos that migrated northward from Mexico and Central and South America and are naturally infected with _M. leprae_. Armadillos are particularly susceptible to leprosy due to their unusually low body temperature of 34 deg C (93 deg F), similar to human skin, which is hospitable to _M. leprae_.

A study reported in 2011 that 39 of 50 patients with multibacillary leprosy reported residence in Mexico or US states where leprosy-infected armadillos are found, and 29 of the 39 reported no foreign residence. Genotyping confirmed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in 28 of the 33 armadillos that were captured in the wild in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the US and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos (1). This genotype had not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had had direct contact with armadillos. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region.

The source of the armadillo population in Florida, which is reported to be _M. leprae_-free (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw362), is different from armadillos in the south-central states (Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama). Florida armadillos first arrived in Florida during the 1920s and 1930s, having been released from a zoo and escaped from a traveling circus (http://armadillo-online.org/expansion.html).

The news report above says that the north Alabama patient with leprosy is thought to have acquired the infection outside the US, but does not tell us where the infection is believed to have been acquired, or if this patient had any contact with armadillos. It would be interesting to learn if the Alabama patient had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions and if genotyping _M. leprae_ from this patient reveals the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ found only in the Western Hemisphere or has a genotype typical for the strains found in a foreign region.
