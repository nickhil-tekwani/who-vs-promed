Officials in Hamilton Township [Mercer County], New Jersey, confirmed yesterday, 1 Jan 2015, that 2 more residents have tested positive for hepatitis A. A food handler at Rosa's Restaurant in Hamilton tested positive for hepatitis A in November 2014.

The Hamilton Township Division of Health was informed of the 2 cases over the New Year's holiday, officials said. In the 1st case, an employee of The Hair Port Salon on South Broad Street in Hamilton tested positive for hepatitis A, has been released from the hospital, and is recovering at home, officials said. Hamilton Township Health officials say all staff members and patrons who visited the salon from 4 to 31 Dec 2014 may be at risk for developing hepatitis A if they have not been previously vaccinated with the hepatitis A vaccine. Unvaccinated individuals who have visited the salon during that time period should receive an injection of immune globulin or a hepatitis A vaccine as soon as possible.

In the 2nd case, the Hamilton Township Division of Health was informed by the New Jersey Department of Health on 1 Jan 2015 that a part-time fitness instructor at the Hamilton Area YMCA JKR Branch on Whitehorse-Mercerville Road tested positive for hepatitis A. The person is also a fitness instructor at the New Jersey Athletic Club on Quakerbridge Road in Lawrence, and an employee of the Mercer County Board of Social Services on Woolverton Street in Trenton. This fitness instructor is recovering at home. Hamilton Township Health officials caution that all staff members and patrons who visited the Hamilton YMCA JKR Branch, the New Jersey Athletic Club in Lawrence, or the Mercer County Board of Social Services in Trenton between 5 and 29 Dec 2014 may be at risk for developing hepatitis A if they have not been previously vaccinated with the hepatitis A vaccine.

Health officials determined that in both cases, the individuals had eaten food from Rosa's Restaurant in November 2014. But officials say they cannot be sure that the 2 additional cases were a direct result of the Rosa's case.

"HAV [hepatitis A virus] is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, either by a direct contact with a contagious person infected with HAV or by ingestion of HAV-contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces [2]. The average incubation period of HA is 28 days (range: 15-50 days) [3]. The period of highest infectiousness is assumed to range from 2 weeks before until 1 week after onset of jaundice. Viral shedding with highest HAV concentration in stool occurs before jaundice [4].

Food items that have been described or assumed to have caused HA outbreaks include mussels, oysters, vegetables and salad fertilized with feces [5,6], fruits including raw blueberries [7], frozen raspberries [8], frozen strawberries [9], green onions [10] and shellfish [11]. Contamination of food by infected food handlers in restaurants has also been described [12]. Several HA outbreaks have been associated with bakeries [13]. In an outbreak observed in 1968 in Michigan, United States (USA), the vehicle of infection was pastries covered with glaze or icing [14]. In an outbreak in New York, US, HA was associated with sugar-glazed baked goods [15]. An HA outbreak took place in Germany in 2004 where a bakery employee most probably contaminated the products that caused the outbreak [13].

The tenacity of HAV is higher than of other non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. The ability of HAV to survive on hands and on inanimate surfaces plays an important role for HAV transfer from hands of infectious persons to food items and from contaminated surfaces to fingertips [16,17]. Disinfection with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide (3 percent and 6 percent concentration) has been found ineffective against HAV on surfaces [18]. According to Mbithi, unmedicated liquid soap was ineffective for reducing virus titer on hands [18], indicating that hand washing with ordinary soap is not sufficient to prevent HAV transmission. HAV is acid-stable [19] and seems to remain viable while passing through the stomach [1]. The minimum infectious dose is estimated to be very low with 10-100 virus particles. The amount of HAV shed by infected humans ranges from 106 to 108 virus particles per 1 gram of stool [20,21]." - Mod.LL
