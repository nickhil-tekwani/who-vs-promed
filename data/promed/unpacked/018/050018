The feared Tropical race 4 [TR4] of the _Fusarium_ fungus, which causes the so-called Panama disease in Cavendish bananas, has now also been found in Myanmar. It was previously found in Viet Nam and Laos [ProMED-mail post 20171108.5432554].

Genome research has [also] found connections between TR4 in various countries. Even more important is that it could be confirmed that there is a connection between the appearance of TR4 in Pakistan and the Philippines on one side, and Lebanon and Jordan on the other. Through determining the number and nature of mutations in the fungi, researchers were able to see exactly what branches were related.

"The necessity of quarantine measures to prevent international spread and the importance of sustainable solutions are once again underlined with this," according to Gert Kema, Wageningen University.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But in recent years, Tropical race 4 (TR4) has also been reported outside that area in the Middle East and Africa (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20131107.2044265, 20131206.2095450).

TR4 is of great concern worldwide and is estimated to have devastated around 100 000 hectares (40 468 acres) of bananas so far. Consequently development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries. New cultivars potentially resistant or tolerant to TR4 require lengthy testing under field conditions in the various production regions and need to be assessed for commercial suitability.

Genetic relationships of TR4 strains, especially those of Asian versus Middle Eastern variants reported here, will provide important information on the biology and epidemiology of the fungus, as well as possible 'hot spots' for emergence of new variants or/and potential routes of spread with their associated quarantine risks.
