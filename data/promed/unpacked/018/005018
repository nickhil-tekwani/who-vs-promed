Excess rains may lead to lower coffee output
--------------------------------------------
Excess rainfall in key coffee growing areas of Karnataka has hit plantations badly and growers expect the output to shrink by 10-30 percent over initial crop estimates.

Heavy and continuous rainfall in coffee growing regions of Coorg, Chikmagalur and Hassan districts has triggered berry dropping and [the] fungal disease black rot. These 3 districts accounted for over 72 percent of the country's coffee output last year [2012].

Karnataka Growers Federation, KGF, which represents the small coffee growers in the State, estimates the 2013-14 crop at a lower output. However, officials said it is too early to estimate the losses as the monsoon rains are still continuing till end-September. South interior Karnataka, where most of the coffee growing regions are, has received 30 percent more [than average] rains this year [2013].

[The fungus _Corticium koleroga_ (previously _Pellicularia koleroga_, _Ceratobasidium noxium_) causes thread blight (also called black rot or koleroga) of coffee and some other tropical or subtropical woody plants, including citrus species and henna. Symptoms include dark brown or black decay and rot of leaves, twigs, and berries followed by defoliation, berry drop, and dieback. Affected leaves may hang from strong fungal mycelial threads that can be seen on twigs and petioles. Whole plantings can be affected resulting in severe crop damage.

Disease development is favoured by heavy rainfall, high atmospheric humidity (95-100 percent), shade, and overhanging branches. Spread occurs by wind, water, plant, and other material, as well as mechanical means (including insect activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (trimming of vegetation to improve air flow, minimising human activities during monsoon season to reduce the risk of pathogen spread), phytosanitation (removal of infected plant material) to reduce available inoculum, and copper sprays whenever weather conditions permit.

Outbreaks of thread blight have been reported from Karnataka in previous years with extreme humidity (ProMED-mail posts 20110909.2745 and 20100903.3146). The name "koleroga" means "rotting disease" and is derived from the Indian Kannada language. The term is also used in the region for several other diseases on different crops, for example betelnut.

Other fungal species in the genus cause diseases in different crops, including black rot of tea (_C. invisum_ and _C. theae_), thread blight of cocoa (_C. salmonicolor_), and thread blight of apple (_C. stevensii_).
