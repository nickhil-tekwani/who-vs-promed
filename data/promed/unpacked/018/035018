Regarding the following article in ProMED-mail
> ANTHRAX, DISPOSAL OF STOCKPILES - RUSSIA (04)
My colleagues in the Department of Energy, Department of Defense,
University of New Mexico Department of Biology and I have met with the
Director of the National Center for Biotechnology [NCB in Stepnogorsk
(formerly the primary production site for anthrax in the former illegal
Soviet biological weapons program) to establish a research station on the
Kazakstani region near the Aral Sea for purposes of animal, human, and
environmental surveillance.
Among other things, we hope to address the question of future impact of the
anthrax stocks buried there and bring scientific data to enlighten the
debate on measures that might be taken to limit environmental hazard from
anthrax or other materials that may be buried on Vozrojdenia Island. In
addition, Director Lepyoshkin and the political leadership of NCB is
strongly supportive of this research as a means to strengthen
implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention.
We intend to make all research available through a website (probably based
at NCB in Stepnogorsk) as the Center is determined to enhance transparency
in all aspects of its biological research. If the ProMED-mail community is
interested, I will file periodic updates on our progress.
