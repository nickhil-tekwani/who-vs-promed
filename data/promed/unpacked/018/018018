The Kebbi State Government says it has vaccinated over 1.2 million livestock against suspected anthrax infection coming in from the neighbouring Benin Republic. Alhaji Adamu Ngaski, the state Commissioner for Animal Health, Husbandry and Fisheries, said this on [Tue 6 Jun 2017] at a news briefing, organised by NUJ in Birnin Kebbi.

Ngaski said that the Ministry of Animal Health had embarked on livestock vaccination in the areas so as to prevent the contagious animal disease from spreading to the state and other parts of the country. "We considered the fact that Arewa, Bagudo and Dandi Local Government Areas are bordering Benin Republic; hence the vaccination campaign as a measure to ward off suspected anthrax infections from Benin Republic,'' he said.

According to him, 1.2 million cattle, 500 dogs, 600 sheep and 500 goats have so far been vaccinated.

Besides, the commissioner said that the state government would soon start artificial insemination of livestock, adding that livestock consumption had increased because of the livestock business pact which the state had with Lagos State. "We also have plans to boost the production of fisheries and poultry products, as 10 rivers in Argungu, Birnin Kebbi, Bunza, Zuru and Yauri areas have been identified for breeding fingerlings. The fingerlings would be released into main rivers after 6 months to enable our fishermen to produce fish for the people's consumption,'' he said.

Ngaski added that the state government had earmarked about N600 million [approx. 943 341 USD] in the 2017 budget for the programmes. He also said that 25 hectares of land had been demarcated as cattle grazing reserves in the state. "We will provide veterinary clinics and hospitals for herdsmen there to promote animal and human health; the project will curtail herdsmen-farmers clashes,'' he said.

He, however, warned meat sellers from acquiring beef from outside the state, stressing that the people's health would not be compromised. He said that anybody who flouted the regulation would be dealt with according to the law.

[Kebbi is in the NW corner of Nigeria bordering both Benin & Niger; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebbi_State.

Nigeria has not reported an outbreak of livestock anthrax since 2004 and their vaccination has at best been minimal. On the other hand, Benin has reported outbreaks in Boukouba province regularly since 2007, but that province is on their NW border with Togo.

OIE has had no recent anthrax notifications from Benin so all one might presume is that the Nigerians are aware of something in neighbouring Benin which has yet to be formally revealed. Or Alhaji Adamu Ngaski, the state Commissioner for Animal Health, Husbandry and Fisheries, is up for re-election. - Mod.MHJ
