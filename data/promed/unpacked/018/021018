A mother took her 5-month-old son to Stormont-Vail Regional Health Center's breast-feeding clinic 12 Apr 2013 because he wasn't eating well, was unusually fussy and just wasn't acting like himself. Within 24 hours, the infant was in Stormont's pediatric intensive care unit, limp and weak, and finally needing a ventilator to help him breathe. As doctors filed in and out, eliminating possible causes of The rapid deterioration, both parents began to fear the worst.

Although it took more than a week for laboratory tests to confirm the finding, Muthukumar Vellaichamy, a Stormont-Vail pediatric critical care physician, and Daniel Katz, a Cotton O'Neil Clinic pediatric neurologist, were sure enough of their conclusion that they ordered the BabyBIG botulism antitoxin delivered from California to combat infant's illness.

Infant botulism is caused when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ingested by an infant, and germinate in the large intestine into the vegetative bacteria and produce botulin neurotoxin, according to a California Department of Health website.

The antitoxin had a hefty price tag of $60 000, the mother said. The California Department of Health had to have a guarantee of payment before it could ship, and thankfully, she said, insurance covered $45 000 and the rest was written off.

Vellaichamy said he saw a case of infant botulism when working in Wichita 2 years ago, and along with Katz, decided that was the most likely cause of the illness.

This case is just the 5th case of infant botulism reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment in Kansas since 2002.

Vellaichamy said he expects the infant to have a full recovery, since infant botulism rarely causes long-term effects.

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the USA. In many cases, the source of the spores is not found, although honey has been a common vehicle. Babies being breastfed as the only source of food may also develop the illness.

A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial note (with references removed) from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified." http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5202a1.htm. - Mod.LL]
