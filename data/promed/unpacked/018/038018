[Rabies is endemic in Armenia.

"Around 99% of human cases of rabies are due to dog bites and unlike many other diseases, we already have all the tools needed to eradicate it.

"Three key ways to eliminate rabies in humans:
- Mass vaccination of dogs in infected areas - the only way to permanently interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans.
- Preventative vaccination for humans.
- Administration of anti-rabies serum following a bite by a dog suspected to be infected.

"Mass vaccination of dogs is the method of choice, as this is the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans. It is estimated that by vaccinating 70% of the dogs where the infection is still rife, rabies could be eradicated in dogs and the number of human cases would rapidly drop to almost zero. Excellent anti-rabies vaccines for dogs, developed according to OIE standards, are nowadays available". Source: OIE Rabies Portal https://www.oie.int/en/disease/rabies/

A bitten person must quickly consult a medical doctor. - Mod.CRD
