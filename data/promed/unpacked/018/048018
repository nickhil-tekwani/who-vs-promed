[1] Vaccine updates
[A] EU: vaccine supply
Date: Fri 29 Jan 2021

The European Commission said on Friday [29 Jan 2021] that it had agreed on a plan to control exports of vaccines from the European Union, including to Britain, arguing it needed to do so to ensure its own supplies.

EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference the export monitoring and controls were "time limited," initially lasting until the end of March 2021, and applied to COVID-19 vaccines the EU had bought in advance.

The bloc could block the export of a vaccine if it determined that this could undermine the EU's own supplies.

"This is an insurance policy," EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides told a news conference. The commission has stressed that this is not an export ban.

Donations to COVAX, designed for poorer countries, will be exempted, as will a large number of EU neighbours, including Norway, Switzerland and countries of the western Balkans and North Africa. However, Britain will not be exempted.

Drugmakers will have to request export authorisation in the EU country where the vaccine is manufactured. That country would consult with the Commission to take a decision in 2 working days.

Belgium, where a large Pfizer plant is based, had already notified the commission of a planned export. The plant makes vaccines for Britain and Canada.

The measure, likely to take effect on Saturday [30 Jan 2021], has already come under criticism, seen as a repeat of criticised controls of protective equipment such as masks at the start of the pandemic.

The International Chamber of Commerce said the move risked triggering a chain of retaliatory action by other countries that would erode essential vaccine supply chains.

The European Union has publicly rebuked Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca for failing to deliver vaccine shots as promised, with a shortfall of up to 60% in the 1st quarter. EU countries have also received fewer deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines than expected.

Companies will also have to detail their vaccine exports over the past 3 months.

[The contract the European Commission negotiated together with the EU Member States was approved on 14 Aug 2020 and entered into force on 27 Aug 2020. It is financed by the Emergency Support Instrument. Through the contract, all Member States are able to purchase 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, with an option for a further 100 million doses, to be distributed on a population-based pro-rata basis. The contract also allows the Member States to donate their vaccine doses to lower- and middle-income countries or to re-direct them to other European countries [https://ec.europa.eu/ commission/presscorner/api/files/attachment/867990/APA%20-%20AstraZeneca.pdf].

According the agreement "AstraZeneca shall use its best reasonable efforts to manufacture the initial Europe doses within the EU for distribution and to deliver to the distribution hubs, and the commission shall have an option to increase its order on behalf and in the name of the participating member states of the vaccine doses by an additional 100 million doses ("optional doses"). - Mod.UBA]

Iranian health officials say the country's top COVID-19 vaccine candidate has been shown to work on the variant of the coronavirus 1st discovered in the United Kingdom.

Hassan Jalili, who oversees local vaccine production at Setad, a powerful state organisation under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, said on Saturday [30 Jan 2021] that tests on the blood samples of volunteers who received 2 doses of COVIran Barekat have yielded promising results.

"Tests have shown that the blood plasma of the people who were injected with the vaccine in human trials is capable of completely defusing the mutated virus of the English coronavirus," he said.

Minoo Mohraz, a senior member of the national coronavirus task force, also confirmed the news. "The health ministry gave a sample of the English mutated virus that has a 70 percent higher infection rate to Setad researchers, and tests on the blood plasma of the 1st 3 recipients of COVIran Barekat showed the virus was completely defused," she said.

Earlier this week, Iran's Health Minister Saeed Namaki said the 7th case of the UK variant was identified in Iran in a passenger from the Netherlands.

Iran injected its 1st 3 recipients of the local vaccine on 29 Dec 2020, the 1st of whom was the daughter of Setad's chief and the other 2 top Setad executives, in an effort to boost trust.

Since then, 32 others have received at least one shot of the 2-dose vaccine, and all 56 of the initial candidates are on track to receive their 1st dose by late February 2021.

Setad officials have said they aim to produce one to 2 million doses of COVIran Barekat before the end of the current Iranian calendar year in late March 2021 and boost production to more than 10 million doses 2 months after that.

Several other locally manufactured vaccines are also in the works, and officials have said they have a chance of reaching human trials.

Iran is also pursuing foreign vaccines from several avenues to start vaccinating health workers and vulnerable groups before the local vaccines are ready.

Earlier this week, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced during a diplomatic trip to Moscow that the Russian Sputnik V vaccine has been approved for emergency use in Iran.

The 1st doses of the vaccine will be delivered next week, Iran's ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said on Saturday [30 Jan 2021].

Iran is also trying to receive vaccines from COVAX, an initiative under the World Health Organization, and is negotiating with China and India for vaccines.

[COVIran Barekat is the 1st coronavirus vaccine made by Iranian researchers of the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, which was unveiled and injected into 3 volunteers during a ceremony on 29 Dec 2020 followed by a 2nd dose on 11 Jan 2021. So far, 35 people have received the 1st dose of the vaccine, and this number should reach 56 people in the 1st clinical study phase.

Additionally, on 18 Jan 2021, the 2nd homegrown COVID-19 vaccine developed and proposed by the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute was approved to begin a clinical trial.

Five Iranian institutions are on the list of the World Health Organization's candidates for the vaccine, as announced by Nora Kronig, Vice-Director General of the Federal Office of Public Health of Switzerland (https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/457534/Switzerland-negotiating-to-buy-COVID-19-vaccine-from-Iran).

Production of COVID-19 vaccine has pursued by 16 Iranian companies since the beginning of the outbreak, and so far, 12 companies applied to produce the vaccine, 8 of which are operating; one of the companies has entered the human trial phase, and 2 more companies will soon test the vaccines on humans, the Iranian Food and Drug Administration spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on 10 Jan 2021.

Furthermore, in addition to the 16.8 million COVAX doses for Iran, use of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine has been authorized as well, and the 1st shipment is expected to arrive in Tehran this week. - Mod.UBA]

[2] US Navy ship

A Navy warship docked in San Diego is contending with a COVID-19 outbreak, leaving its crew panicked amid what some insiders call inadequate safety measures on board, a report said.

Officials confirmed to The Navy Times that some members aboard the USS Chafee, which arrived in California from Hawaii last weekend, have tested positive for the virus.

An internal document from the ship obtained by the outlet shows 41 of the ship's 350 crew members are in quarantine with either a positive diagnosis or possible exposure.

Nonetheless: "The ship remains able to meet its mission," 3rd Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Sean Robertson told the Navy Times in an emailed statement. "No Chafee sailors have been hospitalized, and all positives are in isolation."

A petty officer aboard the ship told the outlet that the outbreak appeared to begin with the cooks.

"Before pulling into San Diego, we had 7 people in quarantine, and 3 tested positive, all the cooks that come into contact with the whole crew," the petty officer said. "Everybody was panicking. We come in close contact with them every day, and the test would have told us who is sick and who wasn't," the petty officer said.

The Navy does not intend to test the entire crew, Robertson said.

Another petty officer who spoke to The Navy Times said social distancing aboard the packed ship is "moot point," while another officer claimed the ship lacked enough face masks.

"A lot of people end up using the N95 more than once or risk getting chewed out or worse because the ship just can't get them fast enough," an officer said.

But Robertson refuted the claim of insufficient protective equipment. "USS Chafee has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment and continues to maintain protective measures for its crew," he said in an email to the outlet.

[USS Chafee (DDG-90) is an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer in United States Navy. She is named for Senator John Lester Hubbard Chafee (1922-1999), a Marine veteran of Guadalcanal who also served as the Secretary of the Navy.

The above report indicates that the implementation of social distancing, mask use, and disinfection although essential, can present challenges in closed/restricted environments, such as when aboard a ship.

In December 2020, a new study entitled "An Outbreak of Covid-19 on an Aircraft Carrier," was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), showing the dynamics of infectious spread within close quarters of an aircraft carrier [https://www.nejm. org/ doi/ full/10.1056/NEJMoa2019375].

Based on study results, "Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the 1st laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive, and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and one died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected."

The authors conclude that "SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms."

It would be prudent to consider all crew aboard the vessel as potentially exposed due to the unique setting and to quarantine/monitor and test them prior to resumption of regular operations.

This case study presents a rich opportunity to help us better understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2's transmission and thereby fine-tune present policies that aim to prevent its spread. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (140 732), Brazil (57 498), France (24 392), and the UK (23 275) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 459 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 29 Jan to late 30 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, UK, Russia (19 032), Mexico (16 374), Indonesia (14 518), India (13 065), Italy (12 715), and Portugal (12 435). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 13.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are just under 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 48 hours and over 103.0 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.22 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 4 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.UBA]
