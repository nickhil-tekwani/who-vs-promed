A nurse in Embu county was arrested after allegedly inspecting a cow and sanctioning it for consumption yet it had anthrax disease. She is currently being held at Itabua Police Station.

The incident is said to have occurred in Rukia village and led to 3 people being hospitalized at Embu Level Five Hospital.

Embu County Public Health Officer Rosaline Kaugi said the nurse is trained to treat people and works in one of the health facilities but had been engaged by residents to act as a veterinary officer. Kaugi said the nurse will be arraigned in court on [Mon 18 Feb 2019] after investigations are concluded. She further warned the residents against slaughtering and disposing animals suspected to have anthrax.

[Embu County is located in the former Eastern province and is northeast of Nairobi; see: https://goo.gl/pcUuf4 and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/15/Embu.html

That the folk of Rukia village were willing to have their village nurse act as their veterinarian tells me that the impact of the public and private veterinary services in the area was zero. And unfortunately, a medical education does not prepare one to adequate recognise and deal with animal diseases, One Health notwithstanding. The Embu County Public Health Officer needs to contact her veterinary opposite number so that someone is sent out to Rukia to oversee the proper disposal of the bovine carcass and work out how this cow got infected; plus get all the cattle in the village vaccinated PDQ [immediately]. This cow may not have been the only animal affected. This is a good opportunity to educate the villagers of the risks, human and bovine, of anthrax, and why regular annual livestock vaccination is important. Fortunately, this time nobody died. - Mod.MHJ
