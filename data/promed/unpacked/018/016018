The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service released a list of retailers that may have received shipments of chicken tainted with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis linked to illnesses in Minnesota. An initial recall notice issued on 24 Oct 2014 stated the product was shipped to retail stores and distribution centers in Minnesota. On 30 Oct 2014, FSIS published a list of retailer locations in 16 states that may have sold the products. Included on the list are Albertson's, Supervalu Foods, and Shaw's.

Aspen Foods, a division of Koch Meats in Chicago, IL, USA voluntarily recalled 28 980 lbs of chicken Kiev products on concerns the chicken may be contaminated with _S._ Enteritidis that sickened 6 individuals in Minnesota. One individual was hospitalized. The chicken Kiev was sold under the Antioch Farms brand and shipped to distribution centers and retailers in Minnesota.

Stores affected by the recall are located in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The complete list of retailers and locations can be found on the FSIS website.
