["CBPP is an infection caused by [ _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ SC (MmmSC)]. Individual infections may be sub-clinical or result in peracute to chronic disease. CBPP is an insidious disease that lingers in herds, causing significant morbidity and mortality. The principal clinical manifestation is respiratory insufficiency due to pneumonia, hydrothorax and fibrin deposition on pleural surfaces. The disease has an incubation period on the order of three to eight weeks, and recovery occurs through a process of abscess-like sequestra formation in the lungs. Sequestra, a nidus of viable MmmSC, may remain infected for up to six months. Repeated attempts to demonstrate that animals with sequestra can transmit disease have failed (Windsor and Masiga, 1977). Serological tests mainly detect active infection or vaccination within a period of weeks, which means that an infection instigates a short-lived antibody response. Naturally recovered animals are said to be immune for life. The disease is currently endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa except for several countries in southern Africa.

"In areas where CBPP is endemic, prevalence of infection can reach as high as 10 percent but is usually less than 5 percent. Considerable local variation in prevalence and impact is evident in the field. Some affected areas rank the disease as a high priority (e.g., South Sudan, northern Tanzania), whereas other areas indicate that the problem is only sporadic (e.g., Somalia areas). This is believed to be due to factors such as cattle density, herding patterns, and environmental conditions. In endemic areas with high prevalence, chronic infection is common, with affected animals showing poor body condition and productivity over several months. The disease is a barrier to trade in live animals, and countries such as Botswana and Namibia have invested heavily to maintain their [WOAH disease-free status] as part of the standard needed to export meat to Europe. On the other hand, CBPP is not transmitted in meat, suggesting that the value of a commodity-based approach to managing risk may be more appropriate.

"Farmers invest considerable resources in the purchase of antibiotics for the control of CBPP, and in some countries, areas affected by even just sporadic CBPP may experience restrictions on free movement or increased transaction costs, such as informal fees for movement permits within national markets. The indirect costs of control and reduction in the value of livestock because of the presence of CBPP are not well documented but are believed to be significant."
