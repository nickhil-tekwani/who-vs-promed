The following background data are abstracted from Gideon
(http://www.GideonOnline.com) and from references 1-2.

Time and Place:
--------------
- Tick-borne relapsing fever was 1st described in the USA in 1915 in
Colorado.
- Peak incidence is reported during the summer, with 47 percent of
cases from July to August.
- The disease is most common in Arizona, California, Colorado and
Oregon.
- Sporadic cases are reported from Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
- Most cases occur in the Cascade, Rocky Mountain, San Bernadino and
Sierra Nevada ranges.
- 40 percent of cases involve tourists to endemic areas (1977 to
2000).
- 450 cases (300 confirmed and 150 probable) were reported by 11
western states during 1977 to January 2000. Only one fatal case was
reported during this period, a neonate born to an infected mother.
- 285 cases were reported by California, Colorado, Idaho, Texas and
Washington during 1985 to 1996.
- The 1st case of louse-borne infection in the USA during the 20th
century was reported in 1976, imported from Ethiopia.

Additional geographic notes:
----------------------------
- Washington and Oregon reported 30 cases during 1965 to 1978.
- Colorado reported 2 cases during 1945 to 1976; 3 in 1977.
- Washington reported 24 cases during 1991 to 1994.
- Oregon reported 73 cases during 1964 to 1989; Washington 27; Arizona
74; Texas 25; Idaho 13; New Mexico 15; Oklahoma 2.
- California reported 251 cases during 1921 to 1941; 173 during 1964
to 1989; 95 during 1978 to 1998 (including 3 to 18 cases yearly during
1985 to 2002). Five cases were reported in the Lake Tahoe region in
2005, 3 during the summer of 2006.
- Texas reported 13 cases during 1990 to the 1st half of 1994.
- An American tourist acquired relapsing fever in Israel (1988
publication).

Infecting species:
------------------
- _Borrelia hermsii_ (vector _Ornithodoros hermsii_) and _B.
coriaceae_ in the western region.
- _B. turicatae_ (vector _O. turicatae_) in the southwest. There is
also evidence for the existence of _Borrelia turicatae_ in FL.
- _B. parkeri_ (vector _O. parkeri_) in the west.
- _B. mazzottii_ (vector _O. talaje_) in the south.
- _B. miyamotoi_ has been identified in ixodid ticks (_Ixodes
pacificus_) in CA (2006 publication).
- _B. coriaceae_ has been identified in _Ornithodoros coriaceus_, a
common parasite of livestock in the western USA.

Notes regarding transmission:
-----------------------------
- _Ornithodoros hermsii_ is nocturnal and feeds within 20 to 90
minutes, thus patients rarely recall the tick bite.
- _B. hermsii_ is maintained in small sylvatic rodents, notably
chipmunks (_Tamias_ spp.) and pine squirrels (_Tamiascuirus_ spp.)
above 1000 meters elevation.

Notable outbreaks:
------------------
All of the following outbreaks were associated with tick
(_Ornithodoros_ spp.) infestations of rodent nests in cabins.

1968 - An outbreak was reported in Spokane County, WA.
1973 - Outbreaks (62 clinical cases, 16 confirmed) were reported in
Grand Canyon National Park, AZ.
1989 - An outbreak (6 cases) was reported in San Bernardino County,
CA.
1990 to 1991 - Outbreaks (24 cases, 14 confirmed) were reported in
Grand Canyon National Park, AZ. No outbreaks were reported in this
area during 1992 to 1999.
1995 - An outbreak (23 family members) was reported among campers in
Colorado.
2002 - An outbreak (5 cases) infection was associated with a cabin in
western MT. 2002 - An outbreak was associated with a family gathering
in NM.

The following is a discussion from our posting of a 2002 outbreak
(20030829.2179):

"Relapsing fever is tick-borne in the USA but may also be louse-borne.
Louse-borne disease remains endemic in parts of central and east
Africa and the South American Andes. Although the clinical illnesses
can be quite similar, the tick-borne form is associated with more
relapses (as many as 13, but averaging about 3, as compared with the
louse-borne form, with as many as 5 but usually only one) and a much
lower mortality rate if left untreated (2-5 percent versus as high as
40 percent). In the USA, a majority of the reported cases are from
California and Washington.

As stated in the Emerging Infectious Diseases paper, a 1927 case of
relapsing fever diagnosed in Washington state was thought to have been
acquired in Montana (1), and soft ticks collected in 1936 in
southwestern Montana were found to be able to transmit _B. parkeri_ to
mice in the laboratory (2).

Although various species of _Borrelia_ (at least 15) can transmit
tick-borne disease, it is not entirely clear that in 1936, they could
be readily differentiated. More specific serologic identification is
now possible (3). It is important to note that only one species, _B.
recurrentis_, is associated with the louse-borne form.

Unlike hard ticks such as _Dermacentor_ (one of the vectors for Rocky
Mountain spotted fever) and _Ixodes_ (Lyme disease), _Ornithodoros_
soft ticks are night feeders, feeding quite quickly (5-20 minutes) and
painlessly. Outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever, like this one,
are often associated with sleeping in cabins.

The diagnosis can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright's
stain of the peripheral blood. Without any concentration of blood, as
shown in the Emerging Infectious Diseases case above, spirochetes can
be seen extracellularly. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism
readily picks up the Wright stain. The relapses appear to be caused by
changes in the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional
reading on the manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 3 and
4 are useful.

Louse-borne relapsing fever has been imported into the USA. In 1976, a
case of a woman from Ethiopia was reported from Dayton, Ohio in which
the organism was detected in her blood and in lice. It was claimed to
have been the 1st case of louse-borne relapsing fever in the USA in
the 20th century (5).
