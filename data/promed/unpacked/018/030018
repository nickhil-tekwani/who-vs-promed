Dengue infects 64 Ecija children (no deaths)
--------------------------------------------
The dengue fever-carrying mosquito has attacked 6 villages in this town,
sickening 64 children and prompting local health authorities to sound a
distress call.
Town health officer Dahlia Prado said the victims' ages ranged from 4
months to 9 years. There was no reported fatality. She asked the help of
the Department of Health regional office in Cabanatuan City, which, in
turn, sent workers to fog the area to drive the killer mosquitoes away.
The outbreak was reported last week with an initial 49 cases, but on Monday
15 cases more were reported in the predominantly farming barangays
[sectors] of Cablangan, Magsaysay, Osmena, Quezon, Quirino and Roxas in
this town.
Prado suspected that the main cause of the outbreak is the lack of proper
household water supply source, besides the usual lack of basic hygiene and
sanitation facilities in rural areas like Talugtog. Talugtog, some 56 km
northwest of Cabanatuan City, is a 5th-class town. It is one of the 19
Nueva Ecija towns that have no access to potable water supply as reported
recently by the provincial planning and development office.
The deprivation of water source of many Talugtog folk prompted them to
fetch their water from the pumps owned by a few better-off neighbors, if
not directly from rivers and creeks. They would then store their water in
drums and other containers, where the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes could have
bred.

Dengue fever kills more people in Viet Nam
--------------------------------------
As of 19 Jul 2004, dengue fever has claimed 50 lives in Viet Nam, a
year-on-year increase of nearly 100 percent. The disease has affected a
total of 31 700 people in the period, doubling the figure in the same
period of 2003, according to local newspaper Youth, on Tuesday.
Most of the dengue fever sufferers and deaths are from the country's
southern region, whose weather is most favorable for the development of
mosquitoes that are the main transmitter.
To deal with the situation, the Ministry of Health has just launched an
urgent program on dengue fever prevention nationwide, called for local
health agencies to promote information campaigns among residents, and
supplied localities with more mosquito-killing chemicals, medicines and
equipment.
Vietnam reported 35 073 cases of dengue fever infections, including 58
fatalities last year [2003], up 48 percent and 45 percent against the
previous year [2002], respectively.

Sri Lanka urged citizens Friday to prevent mosquitoes from breeding amid a
dengue fever epidemic in the tropical island country. Residents were being
told to keep their premises clean and ensure that water doesn't accumulate
in empty pots or other containers where mosquito larva can grow, said
Tissa Vitharana, an adviser to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakshe. "The
message is that we have a dengue epidemic right now," Vitharana told reporters.
At least 54 people have died from dengue in the past 6 months, compared
with 35 for all of 2003, Vitharana said. [This is an increase of 26 since
the last report dated 3 Jul 2004 on ProMED -- see update (20) below. - Mod.JW]
The mosquito-borne disease is most common during Sri Lanka's monsoon
season, which runs until late July.
Health authorities have reported 7000 cases of dengue fever since the
beginning of 2004, against about 3500 cases during the whole of 2003.

The number of dengue cases so far in 2004 is 2550, slightly lower than the
2780 cases reported for the same period in 2003, but still considered high.
NEA is continuing with surveillance and control in the area and working to
alert the residents about dengue through flyers and banners. Education
efforts are also underway on how to prevent mosquito breeding.
