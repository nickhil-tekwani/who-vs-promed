The gray fox that attacked several members at an Inman church Wednesday [5
Nov 2008] was rabid, a health official said on Friday [7 Nov 2008].
Spartanburg County environmental enforcement director Don Arnold said tests
conducted on the fox by the SC [South Carolina] Department of Health and
Environmental Control [DHEC] came back positive for rabies.

The fox bit a 6 year old girl several times on the leg after first
attacking a 20 year old woman. The fox attacked the woman when she opened a
door at the church's family life center. The fox also bit another woman's
ankle several times and scratched at least 4 people at the Bishop Road
church. "This fox was so aggressive, so persistent, I've never seen
anything like it," David Duncan, the church pastor, told the Herald-Journal
on Thursday [6 Nov 2008]. "The fox couldn't be spooked."

The fox ran into the fellowship building and was chased out but ran into a
hallway of the main church building before it was again chased out. Church
members relied on folding chairs to defend themselves, and the fox had been
severely injured when animal control officers arrived at the scene.

Arnold said DHEC will notify the persons who were bitten or scratched about
vaccinations that will be required to prevent the disease from harming
them. DHEC spokesman Thom Berry said in a message that victims will be
administered 6 vaccinations over a 28-day period. Though the shots sound
grueling, the process is better than the alternative, a degenerative
progression that can be fatal. There is no cure for rabies.

Eight cases of rabies have been confirmed in animals in Spartanburg County
this year [2008]. Last year, South Carolina recorded 162 confirmed cases of
rabies in animals.

A Chino Valley, Arizona, woman said she is receiving a series of shots
after she ran 1.5 miles (2.4 km) with a rabid fox hanging from her arm. The
30 year old woman said she encountered the fox while she was jogging in the
late afternoon Monday [3 May 2008] at the base of Granite Mountain, The
(Prescott, Arizona) Courier reported on Thursday [6 Nov 2008]. "I knew
something was wrong when its eyes locked in on me," the woman said. She
said the fox bit her foot before she grabbed it by the neck. "As soon as I
grabbed its neck, it started thrashing and grabbed my left arm," she said.
She said the rabid animal clamped down on her arm so hard that she had to
run the mile and a half back to her car with the fox in tow. She said she
managed to pry the fox's jaws open and throw it in her trunk before driving
to the hospital.

Dwight D'Evelyn, spokesman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office, said
the fox also bit a Yavapai County animal control officer who was trying to
retrieve the animal from the trunk of the car. D'Evelyn said the bitten
woman will require 5 rabies shots during the next few weeks, while the
animal control officer will only need 2 or 3 due to a pre-exposure rabies
vaccination.

Arizona is on pace to break its record for animals testing positive for
rabies virus, prompting state officials to urge people to protect
themselves and their pets. The Arizona State Health Laboratory has
confirmed rabies in 162 animals this year [2008], and those animals exposed
38 people and 119 pets to rabies, the state Department of Health Services
reported Friday [7 Nov 2008]. The current record was set in 2005, when the
lab confirmed rabies in 169 animals.

Many of the cases in 2008 of people and pets exposed to rabies have
occurred in the past few weeks. A prized hunting coon from Pima County had
to be euthanized last week after it was exposed to the virus and did not
have prior vaccinations. People are equally susceptible, and rabies has a
100 per cent fatality rate for those who don't seek immediate treatment.

Craig Levy, the Department of Health Services' program manager for
vectorborne diseases, said the rise has a lot to do with people being more
diligent about turning over animals for testing and with neighborhoods
being built closer to the wild. "We do have more and more people
encroaching into wildlife areas, which means more contact with wildlife,"
Levy said. But some rabid animals, like bats, can fall into a yard
regardless of the location, Levy said. Because grounded bats looks like
mice, children often want to pick them up. "Most people exposed in Arizona
this year [2008] were playing with bats," Levy said.

Recent incidents that led to Friday's [7 Nov 2008] warning included a hiker
attacked near Prescott by a rabid fox that also bit an animal control
officer [see preceding report]. A striped skunk and a fox found near
Flagstaff also tested positive for the rabies virus. Barbara Worgess,
director of the Coconino County Health Department, said other cases this
year [2008] have involved a bobcat and another skunk. The latest cases were
reported by people who noticed the animals hanging around neighborhoods.
"Someone noticed (the skunk) was out during the day and acting weird, and
the next day they found it dead," Worgess said. She said most animals in
the area that were found to have rabies were exposed to a variant of the
rabies virus carried by bats.

Owners can protect dogs and cats by making sure they receive rabies
vaccines and boosters. Dogs should be kept on a leash in the wilderness to
prevent contact with wild animals. Levy said children should be taught not
to touch or play with an animal that looks sick or is acting abnormally.
"The main message is to stay away from wild animals," he said.

[Apart from recording the added hazard of exposure to rabies virus
infection as a consequence of jogging, church going, and living on the
outskirts of towns, the most significant observation is that most
terrestrial animals in Arizona that were found to have rabies had been
exposed to a variant of rabies virus carried by bats.
