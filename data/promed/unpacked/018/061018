The number of horses killed by a viral disease called African horse sickness [AHS] in Pak Chong district of the north eastern province [Nakhon Ratchasima] has risen to 146. Provincial livestock development office chief Pasawee Somjai said on Saturday [4 Apr 2020] that 13 other horses also had severe symptoms. There have been no reports of deaths in other districts, he added [but see commentary]. Earlier, tests confirmed that 73 horses in Pak Chong had died of AHS, he said.

Nakhon Ratchasima governor Wichian Chantharanothai issued an order on 26 Mar 2020 prohibiting the movement of horses out of the area to prevent the spread of the disease. Five road checkpoints had been set up to block the movement of the animals following the deaths in Pak Chong district.

The province has 1455 horses at 110 farms. Of the animals, 1002 were in Pak Chong, 368 in Muang district, and the remaining in other districts.

All farms have given full cooperation to provincial authorities by not moving their animals. Pak Chong has 46 horse farms. All have been asked to spray disinfectant and insecticide. Mosquito nets were also erected at the stables [see comment].

African horse sickness is a deadly viral disease that originated in Africa. It mainly attacks horses and donkeys, with gnats being the carriers. The virus attacks the lungs and respiratory system quickly and can kill a horse within hours.

On 3 Apr 2020, Thai authorities reported 2 additional outbreaks on horse farms located in the provinces of Chon Buri (5 dead horses) and Prachuap Khiri Khan (10 dead horses), situated south west of Nakhon Ratchasima. No epidemiological details have been included; one could speculate that the 2 new outbreaks are related to the initial and bigger outbreak in Pak Chong.

The event's OIE summary with links to the 2 reports submitted so far and an interactive map presenting the locations of the 3 foci is available at https://tinyurl.com/saugj6h.

African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral disease affecting all species of _Equidae_ caused by an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_. Regular mosquito nets are not effective against these small midges; in affected countries, commercially available nets treated with insecticides are successfully applied. There are 9 different serotypes of the AHS orbivirus, all in eastern and southern Africa. OIE's distribution map for AHS (January-June 2019) is available at https://tinyurl.com/v2vqhtm.

AHS serotypes 9, 4, and 2 have been found in North and West Africa, from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean. Examples of outbreaks that have occurred outside Africa are in the Middle East (1959-1963), in Spain (serotype 9, 1966; serotype 4, 1987-1990), and in Portugal (serotype 4, 1989).

In the period 1959 to 1961, AHSV-9 expanded out of Africa and spread in a broad swathe across Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, Cyprus, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Nevertheless, by the end of 1961, in the face of a massive vaccination campaign and the death of over 300 000 equids, the disease in Asia ended. The inability of the virus to persist in these regions was suggested at the time to be attributed to a combination of factors including vaccination, vector-control campaigns, and adverse climatic conditions that reduced or prevented adult vector. This may have changed since. The serotype of the current strain, its source and mode of introduction to Thailand, and local spread are yet to be unraveled.

Attenuated (monovalent and polyvalent) live vaccines for use in horses, mules, and donkeys are currently commercially available; see https://www.obpvaccines.co.za/resources/products/4AR2ZW46HZAJAFDB/2063_AHS_PI.pdf. Subunit vaccines have been evaluated experimentally. - Mod.AS
