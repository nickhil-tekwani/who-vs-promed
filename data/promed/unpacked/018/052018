A Burmese vet who doesn't want to be identified told DVB (Democratic
Voice of Burma) that the latest bird flu outbreak in Rangoon was
caused by not properly 'clearing up' chicken and duck farms around
the affected area during the previous outbreak.
"At Nyaung Hnapin, there are 3 farms; Kaung Thukkha, a duck farm and
another farm nearby. As Kaung Thukkha was affected, they didn't clear
the nearby farms and when it was certain that the farms were affected
the number(of chickens) were reduced as they just sold the birds off
in advance," explained the vet.
He added that had the authorities compensated the farm owners at half
the price of the going rate, they would not have sold the chickens
illegally.
"Now that they have done thus, the disease has spread to the market
place and other meats," he said.
The comment of the vet came after the state-run newspaper, the New
Light of Myanmar, reported on 2 Apr 2007 a new outbreak of bird flu
in Rangoon's Htaukkyant township, where more than 900 chickens were
suspected to have died from the H5N1 virus on 28 and 30 Mar 2007.

[This, apparently peripheral and minor news item, illuminates a
significant phenomenon which is, unfortunately, not exceptional in
developing countries and which contributes to the difficulties in
controlling HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza). When adequate
compensation for culled poultry is not secured, owners will refrain
from reporting suspected cases, or alternatively get rid of their
poultry as soon as possible for any payments obtainable on the
market, with the resulting spread of the infection. - Mod.AS]
