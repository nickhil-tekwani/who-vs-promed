Health care authorities are investigating the source of a 3 Kings Day Cake that made nearly 40 people sick with unusual symptoms including hallucinations. Made by Cholula's Bakery in Santa Ana [Orange County, California], the fruit cake was delivered to 10 stores including 2 in San Juan Capistrano and one Long Beach.

Orange County Health Care Agency Spokeswoman Nicole Stanfield confirmed to Patch that the agency is testing the cake to determine what substance sickened so many people. Until the results come back next week, the agency will not rule out the possibility that the cake was laced or that a chemical was leached into it, she confirmed. The symptoms reported by those who ate the cake -- shortness of breath, hallucinations, dizziness -- are atypical of food poisoning, which typically focuses its fury on the gut.

"Assuming the ingredients were really wheat, salt, eggs, that sort of stuff, hallucinations would not be common. If you put LSD into something, you might see some of these symptoms," Dr. Carl Schultz, a professor of emergency medicine at UC Irvine told The Orange County Register on Friday [9 Jan 2015].

The "Rosca de Reyes" was delivered Monday and Tuesday (5-6 Jan 2015) and retailers and consumers were told to throw out any Rosca de Reyes from Cholula's. Wednesday night, 7 Jan 2015, Santa Ana police started getting word of multiple patients with stomach aches from Western Medical Center in Anaheim and St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. "The common denominator is they ate Rosca de Reyes," Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. Most of the calls came from St. Joseph's, and investigators later found 4 victims at Western Medical Center, Bertagna said.

The Orange County Fire Authority was notified when a family of 4 fell ill about 10:30 p.m., OCFA Capt. Steve Concialdi said. A man in his mid 40s, a teenager daughter and son, and a 4-year-old boy reported feeling nauseated and anxious as if they were under the influence of a drug, he said, adding that all 4 were taken to Western Medical Center in Anaheim.

Don't the "trinkets" included in these items typically consist of a small metal object? I was thinking that this was lead poisoning, and the symptoms noted certainly could be explained by consuming an item laced with lead. Please advise.

[ProMED thanks Lynn Lathan for her comment. Classically, the very short incubation period of foodborne illness from heavy metals such as copper, tin and cadmium occur from acidic liquids stored in metallic vessels which can leach the metal into the liquid, and the symptoms, thought to be caused by a central mechanism, are nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain and not neurological symptoms as seen here.

It is indeed possible that the cakes were contaminated with a substance that can cause a hallucinatory response such as with marijuana or LSD. It would be interesting to know how many of the holiday delicacies were made, how many people overall developed symptoms, and if there was any concentration of cases to particular retail locations. - Mod.LL
