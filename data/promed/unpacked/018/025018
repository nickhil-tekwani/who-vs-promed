Thousands of citrus trees will continue to fall victim through the New Year
to the largest citrus canker outbreak in the history of Central Florida.
In back yards as far north as Dover Estates in Orlando and as far south as
Buenaventura Lakes just below the Osceola County line, Orange County is
losing the remnants of its days as a citrus industry powerhouse.
Though commercial groves in Orange County are now all but extinct, state
workers are plucking healthy and infected yard trees out of the ground at
the rate of about 1000 a week in an effort to stop the spread of the
bacterial disease that causes blister-like lesions on citrus fruit, leaves
and twigs.
Hurricane-force winds that barreled through the area this year spread the
disease farther than agriculture officials anticipated.
A team of about 60 surveyors will continue to investigate more
neighborhoods, hoping to end the outbreak. "Fortunately, it's slowing
down," said Denise Feiber, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department.
"Within the next few weeks, we should be clearly delineating the extent of
the infection." In the meantime, residents will continue to lose even
healthy trees within 1900 feet of an infected plant under U.S. Department
of Agriculture regulations.
According to grower Angel Escribano, it will be 8 years from now until the
next orange can be picked from a tree, referring to the 2-year
citrus-planting quarantine that goes into effect in his Dover Estates
neighborhood once the trees are removed, plus the growing time needed to
produce fruit.
Infections appeared most rampant in the city of Belle Isle and communities
of Conway, Pepper Mill and Buenaventura Lakes, and as far north as
Escribano's neighborhood near Semoran Boulevard to the east and as far west
as John Young Parkway.
More than 10 600 trees will be cut down by March 2005, up from an estimated
9000 less than 2 weeks ago. More than 3 million trees statewide, mostly in
South Florida, have been destroyed since canker was discovered in 1995 near
the Miami International Airport.
In August, state officials lifted a 3-square-mile citrus-tree quarantine in
east Orange County between University Boulevard and east Colonial Drive. A
4-square-mile quarantine is still in place between Apopka-Vineland Road and
Turkey Lake Road from a small outbreak that was detected 2 years ago.
So far, no local residents have filed court challenges to stop removal of
their trees. A Florida Supreme Court ruling earlier this year upheld the
state's ability to take trees without the owner's approval.

[Citrus canker (CC) is one of the most destructive bacterial diseases
affecting citrus in Florida and other citrus-producing areas of the world.
Disease management depends on exclusion of the bacterium (_Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ [Xac]). CC affects all types of citrus, including
oranges, sour oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons and limes. Infected
citrus trees undergo progressive decline in health and fruit production
and, ultimately, cease to produce fruit. There is no known chemical
compound that will destroy the bacteria within the plant tissue. In order
to eradicate the disease, infected and exposed trees must be cut down and
disposed of.
