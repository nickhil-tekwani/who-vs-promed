Outbreak of brucellosis found in cattle in the Volgograd region

An outbreak of brucellosis in cattle at a private farm in Svetly Yar village in the Krasnopartisanskiy ["Red Partisans"] district, Volgograd region, has been reported by the government of the region.

It has been discovered that the source of infection are cows purchased in the neighbouring Rostov region. Their transportation was carried out without veterinary certification. Out of 70 cows, 8 have been found infected.

Preventive and control measures are being applied by the regional veterinary services.

[During the summer of 2012, 4 people were found to be infected in the Svetloyarsk district, Volgograd province; their sources of infection were small ruminants imported from the Republic of Kalmykia. In the summer of 2011, 5 people were infected with brucellosis in Gorodnischensky district, from cattle. Cases had been registered also during the previous year in animals and man. Thus, the epidemiological situation of Brucellosis in the region has been of concern for several years.

5 cases have been recorded during 2011-2012 in people on a cattle farm in the neighbouring Rostov oblast (Zernograd district). - Mod.NP]

[In the past, the information in media-derived reports from the above area, did not clearly identify the species involved. Clear data on the reservoir species -- cattle or small ruminants (sheep, goats)-- are needed. In addition, detailed information on the causative agent will be helpful: were these cases caused by _B. melitensis_ or _B. abortus_? - Mod.AS
