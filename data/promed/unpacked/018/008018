Reading many of the discussions about adequacy of pre- and post-exposure
rabies vaccination, it seems [that almost all are based on detection of
humoral immunity. What is the importance of cellular immunity for
protection against rabies, what studies [have been carried out in this
field, and which techniques may be used to detect it as [a routine?
I am a veterinarian, carrying out research on rabies epidemiology in the
State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and responsible for the immune status
against rabies of about 80 technicians and colleagues at our Animal Health
laboratory, at PESAGRO-RIO.

AK's reply:

a) What is the importance of cellular immunity for protection against
rabies. There is no simple answer to this question, "long-term
characterization of cellular immunity has not yet been investigated after
vaccination in man". This quotation is taken from Thraenhart, Marcus and
Kreuzfelder In: Lyssaviruses (Eds:C.E. Rupprecht, B. Dietzschold and H.
Kpoprowski) Springer-Verlag - a highly recommended little book which
contains several chapters concerned with the immunological aspects of
rabies viruses.
b) What studies are carried out in this field and which techniques may be
used to detect it as a routine? The same authors in the same book say "The
induction of cellular immunity may be measured by the increase in soluble
CD14 (sCD14) and interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) protein in the serum,
which indicates early T cell activation. Six hours after the first
vaccination with one dose of vaccine an increase in the concentration of
these proteins can be measured in some persons. A delay of the increase in
sCD14 is observed in low and late antibody responders and this is
correlated with the antibody induction.
Dr. Romijn goes on to state that she is responsible for the immune status
against rabies of about 80 technicians and colleagues. There exists a
wealth of evidence that protection afforded by vaccines which satisfy the
minimum potency requirements recommended by WHO (Expert Committee on
Rabies, Eighth Report, 1992 (WHO Technical Report Series 824)), properly
administered, gives protection for many years and can be re-stimulated by a
single booster. My own experience over a 20 year period is that, despite
the variation of individual responses and variations in titres measured
over time, re-stimulation always produced an immediate and substantial
response.

My question relates to the methods for proving immunity post-vaccination.
In all cases, immunity is determined by testing serum antibody levels, yet
many studies have demonstrated that high levels of antibodies do not
necessarily indicate immunity to disease - any more than low or
non-existent levels indicate susceptibility, Is there a better method for
determining what the true immune status of an individual who has received a
vaccine is?

true immune status of an individual who has received a vaccine is?" Apart
from the obviously unacceptable method of challenge, I know of no better
method that has been proven by analysis of a substantial number of test
cases. In view of the huge amount of data gathered from the success of
vaccination and/or post-exposure treatment when applied as recommended by
WHO, it will be a long time before any alternative test could be shown to
be better.

If the ID pre-exposure vaccine is so ineffective, why is it available?

AK's reply:

If the ID pre-exposure vaccine is so ineffective, why is it available? I
think there may be a misconception here, my reading of various reports on
the merits or otherwise of ID pre-exposure vaccination does not lead me to
the assumption that the method is "so ineffective". I believe that the
method was introduced because of the need to cut the cost of human
vaccination in relatively poor developing countries and, when a number of
people are being vaccinated at one and the same time, it certainly does
that. Clearly, a possible disadvantage of the method is that ID inoculation
requires a technique which is more demanding than IM inoculation. But there
is a lot of data to show that, although the half-life of measurable
antibody is less with ID than with IM vaccine administration, in one study
of 3-400 vaccinees, greater than 95% had an adequate titre two years after
ID administration. Dr. Price is recommended to read Dr. Dreesen's e-mail to
rabies@pasteur.fr of 2 June 1998 for more information. [See above Topic
