TOLUCA, Mexico -- Scientists Fight Global [Potato Fungus
-----------------------------------------------------
[Aggressive strains of potato late blight disease [caused by _Phytophthora
infestans_ are spreading around the globe. Now scientists on 2 continents
are fighting back by homing in on where the fungus apparently started.
Ground zero is Toluca, an industrial town just outside Mexico City tucked
into the lush mountain valleys surrounding the nation's capital. Scientists
are growing 5 acres of potatoes of every variety imaginable, trying to
develop ones resistant to the fungus. The fungus attacks the potato plant
and sometimes the tubers, devastating one of the world's most important food
staples. It can [also appear after harvest in warehouses.
Toluca is believed to be where the disease began, and it is still considered
one of the toughest places to grow potatoes because the fungus thrives in
the region's mountainous valleys and cool, wet climate.
[That same climate is also perfect for growing potatoes, which is what
U.S. scientist John Niederhauser tried to do when he arrived nearly [50
years ago to help boost Mexico's crop. He confirmed what local
residents said was true: potato plants mysteriously died here.
Niederhauser, who won the World Food Prize in 1990 for his work, helped
Mexico increase its potato production 6-fold from 1950 to 1980 by
developing resistant varieties. During the same period, per capita
consumption of potatoes more than tripled. Today, resistant varieties make
up 30 percent of Mexico's 185 300 potato acres.
Two programs - one based in Mexico, the other at Cornell University in
Ithaca, N.Y.,- are working to develop resistant potatoes. Under the
partnership, scientists from Russia, Poland and the United States breed new
potato varieties and send them to Mexico [where they are planted and
[tested for resistance to the fungus.
Scientists believe a resistant variety that will be widely popular with
farmers and consumers may be up to 10 years away.
Until then, [major growers are spraying [fungicides to try to control the
[disease. One or 2 applications of metalaxyl each growing season [was
usually enough to protect crops all over the world. [But with the
creation of metalaxyl 2 decades ago, scientists focused less on developing
potato varieties resistant to late blight, said Phil Nolte, a plant
pathologist at the University of Idaho. [However, in the past decade,
scientists began noticing a more aggressive strain that isn't halted by
metalaxyl. [As many as 12 applications of fungicide are sprayed on US
potato crops annually in attempts to control the blight, adding $200 an
acre to production costs, [and increasing environmental damage in cropping
systems.
The new strain has spread to almost every corner of the globe [via diseased
planting material and by windborne spores. It [emerged in the United
States in 1992 in New York and Maine, reaching Idaho by 1997. The strain,
likely among many that have always thrived in Mexico, [has also [been
found in Europe and Asia - particularly Russia [where it devastates small
garden potato plots - and Africa.
The disease appears to be a bigger threat in developing countries, where
small farmers dominate and money for combating it is tight, said Hector
Lozoya, technical director of Mexico's program.
"Potatoes are a sustaining food crop, the second bread for many parts of
Russia," said W. Ronnie Coffman, chairman of the Cornell University-based
program. "A severe late blight problem could harm millions of people and
possibly destabilize the region."
