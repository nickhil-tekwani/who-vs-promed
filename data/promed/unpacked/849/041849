'Serious threat' from bee disease
---------------------------------
Beekeepers in Scotland have warned of a serious threat to the
industry after a deadly disease was discovered. At least 4 hives and
3 apiaries in Perthshire have been found to be infected with American
foul brood (AFB).

The honeybee disease was discovered while investigating cases of
European foul brood (EFB) in the area. Colonies infected with EFB can
be saved if the case is not serious. However, those with AFB cannot
be treated with antibiotics and have to be destroyed.

Foul brood is caused by a bacterium, which gets inside bee larvae and
uses up their food supply, starving them to death.

EFB was discovered in Perthshire and Angus last month [June 2009].

Gavin Ramsay from the Scottish Beekeepers Association said: "It's the
worst problem in beekeeping in Scotland for very many years. It's
going to be very disruptive to beekeeping probably for a few years.
It's a notifiable disease, so that means if you have a suspicion that
you have it in your bees you have to tell the authorities and the bee
inspectors will come and have a look and test it.

"It's a new problem, it's something that we're not used to dealing
with here, so it means people are going to have to learn how to
identify it in the early stages so it can be treated, and also how to
change our beekeeping to minimise the likelihood it's going to appear."

So far, just over 1000 hives have been inspected for EFB and 61 of
those have tested positive. 40 hives have been destroyed.

[A 54-year-old beekeeper] has had to burn hundreds of his hives
because of the EFB infection, which can be detected by its bad fish
smell. He said: "Everyone has to be cleaner, better bee-keepers than
before, more observant and indulge in regular renewal of their equipment."

He said recent summers had been bad for the beekeeping industry --
bees were stressed and the varroa mite had also caused problems.
"The threat to the industry in Scotland is very serious," [he] said.
"There are a considerable number of the main commercial beekeepers in
Scotland concentrated within this area. If they're taken out of the
equation and the honey doesn't exist for these people then heather
honey, which is an iconic Scottish product, may cease to exist as a
mass market item."

A surveillance zone has been set up around the site of the AFB
outbreak and further inspections are being carried out.

Andrew Scarlett from beekeepers and honey packers Scarletts Scotland
told BBC Scotland that the industry had suffered so much.

"Already this year [2009] we've employed fewer beekeepers, we're
obviously going to produce less honey, but most of our overheads
remain the same."

He urged other beekeepers to inform the government as soon as they
suspected they had a foul brood infection.

[American foul brood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval
stage of the honeybee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp, and
occurs throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus
larvae_, the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that
can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The
bacterium is a round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which
varies greatly in size (0.5 micron wide by 1.5 to 6 micron long),
occurring singly and in chains and filaments; some strains are
motile. The sporangia are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal,
central to subterminal spores, which may swell the sporangia, are
often found free. The spores are extremely heat stable and resistant
to chemical agents. Only spores are capable of inducing the disease.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores
remaining at the base of a brood cell. Although the larval stages of
worker bees, drones, and queens are susceptible to infection,
infected queens and drone larvae are rarely seen under natural
conditions. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases
with increasing age; larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours
after the egg has hatched. The mean infective dose (LD50= spore dose
at which 50 percent of the larvae are killed) needed to initiate
infection, though very variable, is 8.49 spores in 24-48 hour-old bee
larvae. Exchanging combs containing the remains of diseased brood is
the most common way of spreading the disease from colony to colony.
In addition, feeding or robbing of spore-laden honey or bee bread,
package bees, and the introduction of queens from infected colonies
can also spread the disease. Wax contaminated with the spores of _P.
larvae_, which are used in the production of comb foundation, can
also spread the disease. The early detection of AFB helps to prevent
further spread.

The information above has been derived from chapter 2.2.2. "American
foul brood of honey bees" of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, 2009. The chapter, which includes
exhaustive, illustrated information on the diagnosis of AFB and
references, is available online at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf>.

The disease is notifiable in the UK and known to be present,
similarly to many countries in Europe, America, and elsewhere. - Mod.AS]
