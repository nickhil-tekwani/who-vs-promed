Romania detected a new suspected case of bird flu close to the border with
Moldova, in the eastern county of Vaslui, some 100 km (60 miles) north of the
Danube delta, the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday.
Earlier this month Romania became the 1st European mainland country to detect
the deadly H5N1 strain of the disease which has killed more than 60 people and
millions of birds in Asia.
The Danube delta on the Black Sea, Europe's largest wetlands, is a major way
station for migratory wild birds heading from Asia towards winter habitats in
North Africa.
"A sample coming from a heron found on the shore of the river Prut, in Vaslui
county, tested positive for bird flu antibodies," Agriculture Ministry
spokesman Adrian Tibu said.
The presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean the birds have the deadly
strain of the virus, and further tests including at a centre in Britain must
be carried to determine the type of the virus.
Farm Minister Gheorghe Flutur said the samples would be sent to a specialised
laboratory in Britain as soon as possible to see whether the new case is the
H5N1 strain of the disease.
Local officials said measures were being taken to help contain the virus.
"First of all we will tell people to keep chickens shut in their pens. We have
closed the bird and animal markets," Ioan Zaharia, the government's
representative in the Vaslui county, told private TV station Realitatea.
The farm ministry said earlier in the day that hundreds of samples tested over
the past few days across the country had proved negative, and that he hoped
the measures taken would help contain the disease.
So far the deadly strain was found in samples taken from 2 villages in the
Danube delta, 40 km (25 miles) away from each other. Authorities said 21 000
domestic birds in the 2 villages, which were quarantined, had been slaughtered.

[Our posting 20051020.3055 "Avian influenza, Eurasia (19): Taiwan ex China,
suspected" included the following remark: "it might be assumed that the
confiscated birds were probably not domestic poultry. Were they pet-birds?
Otherwise? Which species? Did they show disease symptoms? Any pathological
changes? Details, if available, will be appreciated".
In response, we received the following report which answers one of the said
questions. A similar report has been provided by Nati Elkin

The infected birds were hill myna, red-billed leiothrix and black-naped
oriole, according to the [Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine]
bureau's director Sung Hua-tsong.
It was the 2nd time Taiwan had seized pet birds smuggled from mainland China
since coastguards launched a dragnet in August [2005] to crack down on the
illegal trade.
The Chinese crew member who smuggled the birds has been detained in central
Taiwan while the authorities offered up to 3.6 million Taiwan dollars (USD 107
462) for tip-offs on bird smuggling.
Smuggling is rampant between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, which are
separated by the Taiwan Strait, 170 kilometres wide at its most narrow point.

[Clearly, this consignment included pet birds. According to encyclopaedic
data, Hill myna is a starling, _Gracula religiosa_,family: Sturnidae, order:
Passeriformes, native to Europe and North America. It has the capacity to
mimic human speech and often kept as a pet. Red-billed leiothrix, _Leiothrix
lutea_, family: Timaliidae, order: Passeriformes, is a babbler, native to
Southern Asia. The black-naped oriole,_Oriolus chinensis chinensis_, order:
Passeriformes, family: Corvidae, is a songbird, native to India, southeast
Asia and China. It will be interesting to note which of the said species was
found infected and whether they were clinically affected or asymptomatic.
The risk of H5N1 spread by smuggled birds has been raised in the past;
recently, the issue has been dealt with in updated European measures to
prevent the introduction of the virus (see items 3 and 5 below). - Mod.AS]

EU health ministers decided on Thu (20 Oct 2005) to extend a ban on poultry
imports to Russia, and impose new measures that would keep the Asian bird flu
threat under control.
The only areas to which the ban on Russia will not apply are Kaliningrad and
some regions on the border of Finland.
The ministers and the European Commission agreed on the 1st day of the 2-day
health council in England, that EU member states must make national
evaluations and identify what actions are needed to prevent contact between
wild birds and domestic poultry.
Member states must also inform the Commission Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) -- and each other -- about the measures taken.
Special permission will be needed to keep birds at markets and exhibitions,
shows and cultural events, and member states have to present special
programmes for keeping and vaccinating birds in zoos.
Chicken and chicken fodder must also be kept beyond reach of wild birds.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) and several experts in Europe have said
that the bird virus is likely to mutate into a form transmittable to humans,
and create an influenza pandemic in Europe.
But EU health ministers said at Thursday's council meeting that the pandemic
fears have been exaggerated.
Alarms about possible bird flu in Greece seemed to be false, the EU Laboratory
for Avian Influenza in Weybridge, UK reported on Thursday, saying that tests
showed the Greek birds had not died from the H5 bird flu virus.
The commission said that although the 1st results had proved negative, it did
not exclude the presence of the virus in the country.
Health ministers in England also discussed pandemic preparedness in the
different member states.
The commission has suggested that each member state should stockpile enough
virus treatment, like Tamiflu, to treat a fourth of the population.
"None of the countries reach those numbers today", Swedish health minister
Morgan Johansson told wires after the meeting.

The EU has said initial tests for bird flu in Greece were negative, in a
relief after outbreaks in Turkey and Romania, but stressed it cannot yet
exclude the presence of the virus in the EU state.
The provisional good news was also tempered by wrangling in Greece over
exactly which sample was sent for testing by European Union (EU) experts
following a suspected case on an Aegean island earlier this week.
Confirmation of the H5N1 strain in Greece would mark its 1st-ever arrival in
the 25-nation bloc.
While announcing the negative result, the EU's executive arm underlined that
precautionary measures slapped on the eastern Aegean Sea islet of Oinousses
[some 5 km from the region's main island, Chios] will therefore remain in
place, pending further tests.
A "preliminary test was carried out ... which proved negative but it is not
possible at this point definitively to conclude from this that the suspicion
of avian influenza" can be entirely excluded, said spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde.
"Therefore, precautionary measures remain in place," she added. "At this point
we cannot exclude the possibility of avian flu in Greece and in the area."
EU-certified laboratories in Britain and Greece have been testing samples from
birds in the same flock where a suspect case was found to determine if it was
the H5N1 strain of bird flu that has killed about 60 people in Asia.
The EU spokesman said that the tests, carried out at an EU laboratory in
Weybridge, southwest of London, had proved negative for the H5 strain of the
virus.
She also downplayed reports that there had been problems surrounding the
samples provided by Greece -- centred on the fate of a lone turkey that
originally sparked the scare.
Agriculture Minister Evangelos Bassiakos has drawn fire after his ministry
first said it sent tissues from the ailing bird to Britain for follow-up
tests, but then changed track, saying it sent samples from the general flock.
On Wed [19 Oct 2005] night, Supreme Court prosecutor Dimitris Linos ordered a
preliminary investigation on the procedure followed by the authorities.
But said the EU spokesman in Brussels: "I have nothing giving me reason to
complain about cooperation from the Greek authorities."
The Greek suspected case has come under the spotlight following the
confirmation of the H5N1 strain in Romania and Turkey last week, which
triggered the EU to bolster its defences against the virus.
EU member states have been ordered to take measures to ensure that poultry do
not come into contact with migratory birds which could carry the virus, and
have also been urged to stockpile anti-viral drugs.
In Greece itself, 3 EU experts arrived Thursday on the island of Chios to help
investigate the suspected case of bird flu, before heading for the Oinousses
later in the day. [Both Chios and its satellite island Oinousses have been
mentioned in newswires as sites of suspected avian influenza. Clarification
will help. - Mod.AS]
Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos on Wednesday said tests conducted
on 56 bird samples collected from across the country had turned up negative
for bird flu.
But ordinary Greeks have clearly been alarmed by the outbreak: sales of
poultry in Greece have plummeted by up to 70 percent since the suspected case
was reported on Monday, a union of Greek meat vendors said.
The Greek poultry industry is having difficulty adapting, said Spyros Nonikas,
general director of the association of Greek poultry companies.
In neighbouring Albania, meanwhile, local television reported that thousands
of Greek chickens were buried alive on the border after authorities refused to
let them enter the country for fears that they could carry bird flu.

A highly pathogenic H5 Avian Flu virus has been isolated in a parrot imported
from Suriname, South America. The birds were in quarantine with a consignment
of birds from Taiwan.
The H5 virus was discovered in samples taken from a bird that died in
quarantine. The bird was part of a mixed consignment of 148 parrots and "soft
bills" that arrived on 16 Sep 2005.
Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds said: "The confirmed case does not
affect the UK's official disease free status because the disease has been
identified in imported birds during quarantine."
The bird was in a biosecure quarantine unit. All the birds in the unit are
being culled humanely.
It is very difficult for humans to contract avian influenza. However, the
necessary actions to protect human health have been taken in this instance.
These include culling of the bird consignment and giving antiviral treatment
as a precautionary measure to the small number of people who have been in
contact with the birds.
Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds added "the incident showed the
importance of the UK's quarantine system. We have had similar incidents in the
past where disease has been discovered but successfully contained as a result
of our quarantine arrangements."
Another consignment of 216 birds from Taiwan, also housed in the unit, were
humanely culled.

[Subscribers are reminded that all H5 and H7 strains are regarded, by the OIE,
as Notifiable avian influenza (NAI) strains -- even if their pathogenicity is
found not to be high.
This week ProMED-mail has received several reports on suspected avian
influenza cases from various countries. We try to select for posting only
cases which seem to warrant credible suspicion. Fortunately, even selected
ones may eventually be found negative. Hopefully, the (awaited) final verdict
of the Greek case will be confirmed as negative.
Elevated alertness of inspection authorities and the raised public awareness
are enhancing detection of suspected cases. The recent discovery of infected
birds in quarantine stations and confiscations of smuggled birds are not
unrelated to the said trend. - Mod.AS]
