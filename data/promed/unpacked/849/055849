More than 100 people have contracted "mouse fever" in the Samara Oblast
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A increasing number of people in the Samara Oblast have contracted
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) -- still referred to
locally as "mouse fever." This is a consequence of an increase in the
population of rodents in the region, which are the vectors of the
infection. Approximately a 100 cases of HFRS have been recorded in
the region during the past summer.

[The most active natural foci of HFRS in Russia are located in the
Privolzhsky Federal Okrug of Russia. On average 80 percent of HFRS
cases occur in this Okrug annually. The Mariy El Republic and the
Samaar Oblast are the 10 most unfavorable regions of the Okrug. Other
affected regions include Bashkortostan, Udmurtiya, Chuvashia,
Mordoviya, Tatarstan, Penza, Orenburg, and Ulyanovsk regions.
Morbidity in these regions annually was in 3-22 times greater than
elsewhere Russia. - Mod.NP]
