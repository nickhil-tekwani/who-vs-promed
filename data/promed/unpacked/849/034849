From: Craig Dalton <CDALT@doh.health.nsw.gov.au>

To inform preparedness planning for SARS, we request information on
the following, particularly from the experience of primary care
providers in Canada and Hong Kong.
1. What role have family practitioners/general practitioners played
in the community in terms of triage of patients and referring cases
for further assessment?
2. Has there been any documented transmission of SARS to
community-based primary care doctors, nurses, or clerical staff?
3. Has there been a need to set up extra "fever clinics" in the
community or adjacent to hospitals to screen suspect SARS cases to
limit the burden on emergency departments?
4. Has home quarantine been managed via telephone contact or home visitation?
Any protocols/experience on the reality of managing the triage
interface between the hospital and the community would be useful.

[Dr. Dalton raises important questions relevant to SARS preparedness
planning at the local/operational level. In reviewing official
websites, one finds that these issues have been addressed to varying
extents by the health authorities of countries confronted with SARS
transmission. Transmission of SARS to health care workers, including
clerical staff, has been reported in Canada, Hong Kong, and
Singapore. Indeed, the newswires have periodically mentioned the
overburdening of the healthcare sector, and some areas have "closed"
hospitals in which transmission has been documented.
Please address all responses directly to Dr. Dalton using the contact
information for him given above. - Mod.MPP]
