In Saone-et-Loire, the Romenay school will remain closed until [Wed 28 Mar 2018]. For the moment, the health authorities still do not know what the cause is. Analyzes are in progress and a [suggested cause] has been discarded.

Last week [week of Sun 18 Mar 2018], more than a 100 students complained of itching and redness. Asked by our colleague from France 3 Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, the mayor confided that the children had felt the "same sensation as a sting of nettles". For the time being, the Regional Health Agency is still unaware of the origin of these symptoms but has rejected the cause of collective food poisoning.

A company has been designated to determine the causes and offer treatment.

[There has not been follow up regarding this supposed toxin or communal allergic reaction. It would be unusual for a food, even fed in a cafeteria, to produce this same odd reaction in a large number of school children.

The feeling of stinging nettles reminds me of exactly that: stinging nettle. Perhaps something like itching powder was dispersed in some fashion? Hopefully those affected are feeling better and we will get a follow up as to the cause. - Mod.TG
