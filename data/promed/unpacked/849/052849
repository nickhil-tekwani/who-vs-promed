The First Citrus tristeza virus Outbreak Found in a Relevant Citrus-
producing Area of Sicily, Italy.

Acireale Catania Italy. Plant Dis. 87:314, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0107-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 4 Dec 2002.
During a survey to select superior old citrus lines in the area of
Siracusa (Sicily, Italy), trees in several blocks of Fortune (_Citrus
reticulata_ Blanco), Nova (_C. reticulata_ Blanco), Satsuma (_C.
unshiu_ (Macfad.) mandarins Marc.), and Marsh grapefruit (_C.
paradisi_ Macfad.) propagated on sour orange (_C. aurantium_ L.)
rootstock showed stunting, decline, dieback, and small-sized fruits.
Stunting was particularly evident in grapefruit.
Decline-affected plants consistently showed pin-holing in the
cambial face of sour orange bark below the bud union line, which is
often associated with Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) infection. Young
shoots from 600 Fortune, 300 Nova, 400 Satsuma, and 20 Marsh
grapefruit plants showing decline were analyzed by DAS-ELISA
(Loewe Phytodiagnostica Biochemica, Sauerlach, Germany) and by
immunoprinting-ELISA (Agritest Srl Valenzano-Bari-Italy) using CTV
specific polyclonal antibodies.
All decline-affected tree samples reacted positively with both
techniques while healthy greenhouse controls were negative.
Total RNA was extracted from 25 Fortune and 15 Nova mandarins, 5
Satsuma, and 5 Marsh grapefruit (Qiagen RNeasy Plant minikit,
Qiagen S.P.A., Milan, Italy), and tested in RT-PCR using specific
primers for genes p20 (forward 5'-CGA GCT TAC TTT AGT GTT A-
3' from CTV T36 genomic position 17767-17786 and reverse 5'-TAA
TGT CAA ACT GAC CGC from CTV T36 position 18269-18286) and
p23 (forward 5'-ACT AAC TTT AAT TCG AAC A-3' from CTV T36
position 18347-18286 and reverse 5--AAC TTA TTC CGT CCA CTT
C-3' from CTV T36 position 19026-19044) (2).
In all cases, DNA fragments of the expected size were amplified.
Equivalent samples from CTV-free greenhouse control plants did not
react in ELISA and yielded no DNA after amplification with the
same primers. In trace-backs of plants in the affected blocks, it was
found that all Fortune, Nova, Satsuma, and Marsh grapefruit trees
had been propagated from budwood illegally imported from Spain 10
years before, suggesting the possibility that the imported buds were
infected with CTV.
The estimated number of infected plants in the area of Siracusa is
approximately 10 000, and some evidence suggests that the virus
might be spreading in the area (work in progress). Only scattered
CTV-infected trees had been detected in Italy previously (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of an important CTV
outbreak in Italy. Additional surveys are being conducted to get a
more accurate estimation of the CTV incidence, to determine
whether the virus is being dispersed by aphid vectors, and to
characterize the biological and molecular properties of the virus
strains present in the affected area.
Presently, there are approximately 100 000 ha of citrus in Sicily,
mostly grown on decline-susceptible sour orange rootstock. The
presence and potential spread of CTV is a major threat for this
citrus industry.

[CTV occurs wherever citrus is cultivated. It is probably the most
significant viral disease in citrus and is a major constraint to
production. The virus is spread by several species of aphid and by
grafting. The suggestion that CTV was introduced illegally into Sicily
is probably correct but not surprising, given the temptation by some
to smuggle new sources of budwood into production areas. Plant
quarantine agencies are constantly screening for infected sources. -
