In September 2006, the South Dakota Department of Health (SDDH) was
notified of WNND in a man aged 82 years with end-stage renal disease who
had received a kidney transplant on 25 Aug 2006. Four days after the
transplant surgery, the patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed
red blood cells (PRBC) for anemia. Twenty-one days after surgery, he had
onset of fever, lethargy, and a peri-incisional hematoma, prompting his
readmission to the hospital. The patient was treated empirically with
broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal agents. Two days after
readmission (i.e., 23 days after transplant and 19 days after PRBC
transfusion), his mental status deteriorated rapidly.
The next day, his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had 4 white blood cells
(WBC)/mm3, 46 red blood cells (RBC)/mm3 ; a protein level of 58 mg/dL, and
a glucose level of 67 mg/dL. Anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody was
detected in both serum and CSF by IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) performed at SDDH. When the patient was
discharged to a long-term-care facility (36 days after his transplant
surgery), his fever had resolved, and his mental status had improved.
Because the patient had been hospitalized during the 2 weeks before onset
of his WNV-related illness, WNV transmission by organ transplantation or
blood transfusion was considered more likely than transmission by mosquito
bite. The kidney donor's premortem serum was negative for both anti-WNV IgM
and WNV RNA by MAC-ELISA and reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
One other kidney transplant recipient from the same organ donor had no
symptoms of WNV disease, and serum from this recipient was negative for
both anti-WNV IgM and WNV RNA. Traceback investigation revealed that the
patient with WNND had received blood products from 6 different donors
during the 8 weeks before symptom onset. No donor samples from the time of
donation were available for testing. However, all donors consented to have
serum collected and tested for anti-WNV IgM. One donor, the source of 1
PRBC unit transfused into the patient with WNND 4 days after transplant,
was IgM positive.
After identification of the IgM-positive donor, the platelet and fresh
frozen plasma (FFP) co-components from his whole blood donation were
traced. The FFP unit had been transfused on 10 Aug 2006, into a man aged 60
years. On the same day as the transfusion, he had undergone surgical repair
of a spinal fracture caused by a fall. He received a transfusion of 15
blood products, including 6 units of FFP, one of which was from the blood
donor described in this report. Eleven days after the surgery, he had
onset of fever and was treated empirically with antimicrobial and
antifungal agents. Fifteen days after surgery, he had onset of tremors,
encephalopathy, and acute left arm paralysis unexplained by his previous
injury but consistent with WNV-associated myelitis. The patient's CSF had 4
WBC/mm3, zero RBC/mm3, a protein level of 171 mg/dL, and a glucose level of
52 mg/dL. Anti-WNV IgM was detected in the CSF by MAC-ELISA at SDDH.
The patient's fever, tremors, and encephalopathy resolved, but his left arm
paralysis persisted at the time of transfer to an out-of-state hospital 5
days after symptom onset (20 days after surgery). Three months later, the
patient remained in a long-term-care facility.
The implicated blood donor was a man from a rural area of South Dakota
where substantial WNV activity in birds, mosquitoes, and humans occurred
during the 2006 transmission season. He had not traveled outside of South
Dakota during the month before his last donation on 4 Aug 2006.
Editorial Note:
Nationwide blood screening for WNV has been successful in preventing
transfusion-transmitted WNV (3). However, as with all blood donation
screening, infections can be transmitted to transfusion recipients on rare
occasions despite negative donor test results. Although WNV transmission by
blood transfusion is rare, the cases described in this report underscore
the importance of clinical recognition, effective WNV blood screening
strategies, and investigation coordination.
Transfusion-transmitted WNND might be difficult to recognize, but
physicians should consider the disease as a possible diagnosis,
particularly when unexplained neurologic complications occur in
immunosuppressed patients after transfusion.

From: William Reisen <arbo123@pacbell.net>
[Dr. Reisen submitted this report in response to the previous report of
West Nile virus in California, archive No. 20070128.0370]

West Nile virus apparently overwinters in southern California byseveral
mechanisms, including continued low-level enzootic transmissionamong
_Culex_ mosquitoes and wild birds (Reisen et al. 2006). Multiple agencies
have been intensively looking for evidence of winter transmission, but this
is the 1st year when multiple indicators have been detected this early over
such a wide geographical distribution
[<http://maps.calsurv.org/gimf/imf.jsp?site=calpub>].
In addition to the dead American crow and single positive _Culex
quinquefasciatus_ pool found in Los Angeles as reported by the LA Times,
there has been a sentinel chicken seroconversion detected in Imperial
Valley and a positive pool of _Cx. tarsalis_ mosquitoes in the Coachella
Valley, Riverside County, along the Salton Sea. These findings follow the
recovery of positive dead American crows and mosquito pools in Los Angeles
through December 2006. Previously, WNV was found in January 2005 in a
single pool of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ collected by the Orange County VCD
and in a sentinel chicken bled by the San Bernardino County Department of
Health. These positives seemed to be the end of 2004 transmission season,
because WNV was not detected again until May 2005.
Despite widespread sampling again in early 2006, WNV was not found in
mosquitoes in southern California until multiple pools of _Cx. tarsalis_
collected in Coachella Valley along the Salton Sea tested positive in April.
The significance of these findings remains unclear and extended sampling is
ongoing to determine the extent and level of WNV activity. WNV enzootic
and epidemic activity has declined during the past 2 years in southern
California as has immunity levels in the peridomestic wild bird
populations. Detectable levels of widespread virus activity during
winter, declining avian "herd" immunity, an abundant American crow
population, and favorable warm temperatures could result in the resurgence
of West Nile virus to epidemic levels in the urban areas of southern
California. Ongoing surveillance continues to monitor amplification events
as they unfold.
The detection of early season transmission activity of West Nile virus
[WNV] in southern California during January 2007 was part of extended
surveillance done annually as part of collaborative research by the Center
for Vectorborne Diseases, University of California, Davis; the Coachella
Valley, Greater Los Angeles, Kern and Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector
Control Districts; and the California Department of Health Services, and
was sponsored, in part, by the National Institutes of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, NIH, and the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases, CDC, Ft. Collins.
