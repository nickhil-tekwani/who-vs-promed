Many Muslim countries are ill-equipped to tackle a bird flu outbreak
because of insufficient financial resources and the public's lack of
awareness about the disease, a UN health official said Wednesday [13
Jun 2007].
The Organization of the Islamic Conference, whose 57-member nations
comprise nearly one third of the world's population, should take a
more pro-active role in helping countries that are not adequately
prepared, said Hassan el Bushra of the World Health Organization
[WHO].
The health official suggested the OIC facilitate programs such as the
production of bird flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs.
"There is a big disparity between countries (within the OIC)," said
El Bushra, the WHO's adviser for communicable disease surveillance
and response in the eastern Mediterranean region.
"Some countries can do a lot but some countries are really in need"
of preparedness programs, he told reporters on the sidelines of a
meeting of OIC health ministers and officials.
He said Muslim countries that are of the most immediate concern are
the ones where there have been human cases of bird flu, such as
Indonesia, Egypt and Turkey.
Bird flu has killed at least 190 people since it began ravaging Asian
poultry stocks in 2003, with 79 deaths in hardest-hit Indonesia,
according to the World Health Organization.
El Bushra said Indonesia was the biggest challenge, especially as
many people do not understand the need to cull all the poultry in the
village after some birds are found to be infected with H5N1.
"They need a lot of education. It is a matter first of all of
changing the mentality of the people to really understand the
disease," he said.
In Indonesia, and other relatively poor, developing countries,
poultry is a crucial part of their cultural lifestyles and economic
livelihoods, El Bushra said.
"We need to find acceptable measures to support those who suffer
economic losses, especially when compensation is a problem," he said.

Bird flu-infected poultry in Indonesia that show no signs of the
disease may heighten risks to humans, though more research is needed
to establish the cause of their infection, scientists said.
Indonesia has recorded fewer poultry deaths from the H5N1 strain of
avian influenza this year [2007] than last year, and some fowl in
infected backyard coops haven't died from the lethal virus, Musny
Suatmodjo, Indonesia's director of animal health, told reporters in
Jakarta yesterday [11 Jun 2007].
Scientists are conducting surveys of poultry to gauge the frequency
of asymptomatic H5N1 infections, their cause and risks to people.
Four of every 5 human H5N1 cases have been fatal in Indonesia. Of 15
cases confirmed there last month [May 2007], doctors weren't able to
identify the cause of infection in 8 of them.
"If there's virus circulation and the animals appear clinically
healthy, then it can be a human health risk because people keep on
handling those animals" without being aware of the risks, said
Christianne Bruschke, a veterinarian leading an avian influenza
project for the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE].
Bruschke spoke in an interview yesterday [11 Jun 2007] in Jakarta,
where she addressed the International Avian Influenza Virus
Vaccination Seminar.
Indonesia is under international pressure to control H5N1, which
threatens to mutate into a form capable of spreading easily between
people, setting off a deadly pandemic.
During the past 2 years, 99 Indonesians are known to have been
infected with the virus, 79 of them fatally. Globally, 190 people
have died from H5N1 and a further 121 have survived infection,
according to World Health Organization statistics last updated
yesterday [11 Jun 2007].
It's possible that the H5N1 virus is capable of infecting humans more
easily than it used to, Bayu Krisnamurthi, chief executive officer of
Indonesia's committee on avian and pandemic flu, said last week.
Indonesians should be "cautious" when handling poultry because they
may be shedding the virus without showing symptoms of disease,
Krisnamurthi told reporters yesterday [11 Jun 2007]. "It can't be a
general conclusion yet," and further scientific studies are needed to
support the hypothesis, he said.
About 7000 chickens, quail and other poultry are recorded to have
died of H5N1 in Indonesia so far this year [2007], compared with 1.5
million in the whole of 2006, the agriculture ministry's Suatmodjo
said.
Fewer recorded poultry deaths from H5N1 could be attributed to many
factors, including immunity to the virus and changes in the virus
itself, said John Weaver, a senior adviser with the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Jakarta.
"At this stage, we haven't got clear evidence that there has been any
change" that has altered the virus's pathogenicity, he said. "Maybe
the public is less inclined to report the disease now because there's
no benefit" in doing so.
Indonesia's vaccination program aimed at controlling poultry
outbreaks may also be obscuring infections, said Bruschke of the OIE.
"If you implement a vaccination program, it's extremely important
that you also implement a monitoring program and keep checking
whether there's still virus circulation," she said.
The Indonesian government allocated 60 million doses of vaccine for
poultry this year [2007], enough to protect about 1/5th of the 285
million chickens raised in backyards across the country, an
archipelago of about 18 000 islands.

[The accuracy of the above information on the ostensible appearance
of asymptomatic H5N1 infections in chickens in Indonesia deserves to
be assessed with caution; it might have been based upon misquotations
of the officials interviewed.
Dr Peter Roeder, FAO, a veterinary virologist with long experience
with the Indonesian animal health situation and currently visiting
there, has kindly provided us with the following observations, which
are gratefully acknowledged:
"There have been some anecdotal accounts of increased survival rates
but nothing documented with supporting evidence. I have seen no new
information on this subject, and if there is any, it has not been
shared with me. Of course, one would expect the virus to change its
characteristics towards lower virulence over time, but, quite
remarkably, this does not seen to have happened in chickens. It is
well known that the situation in ducks is very different, with
widespread subclinical infection; could it be that which is being
reported?"
Indonesia's last official follow-up report (No. 14) was submitted to
the OIE on 25 Sep 2006.
In spite of the lacking reporting on H5N1 in poultry, WHO's avian
influenza map, titled "World: Areas reporting confirmed occurrence of
H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and wild birds since 1 Jan 2007,
status as of 8 Jun 2007 (latest available update)," shows the major
Indonesian territories of Sumatra and Java as infected. This might be
a reflection of the unfortunate situation when humans play the role
of H5N1 sentinels; see

On top of the said territories, ProMED-mail has posted, during 2007,
media-derived information on the disease observed in poultry in Bali
and Papua; see references. - Mod.AS]
