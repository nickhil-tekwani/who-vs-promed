The incidence of viral meningitis has increased dramatically in the
[Madrid] region in 2006. Since January it has afflicted 411 people, almost
3 times more than the total for the same period in 2005. Eighty per cent of
the patients are under 15 years of age, and 2 have died.
The disease generally takes a benign form and cyclical epidemic outbreaks
occur every 5-6 years There is neither a vaccine nor specific treatment.
The last [large outbreak] occurred in 2000 and affected 994 people. A
report of the Regional Department of Health reveals that the [current
outbreak] is exhibiting great virulence, with an average of 25 cases per week.
The term meningitis embraces a wide range of viral and bacterial infectious
agents which affect the membranes that cover the brain. The most serious
form, against which there is a vaccine, is meningitis C, caused by a
bacterium which can kill 15-25 per cent of patients, according to data from
the [Spanish (presumably. - Mod.SH)] Department of Health. More benign
forms of meningitis are associated with viral infection. Viral meningitis
can be caused by more than 20 different viruses which can infect the
meninges, such as chickenpox virus and herpes simplex virus. The Department
of Health has stated that the great majority of the cases of viral
meningitis take a mild course with no complications.
Ildefonso Hernandez, president of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, said
that: "Cyclical outbreaks of viral meningitis, like the present one, are
caused by enteroviruses, usually producing mild forms of disease."
Enteroviruses, like the other viruses that can cause meningitis, are
widespread and many people can be in contact with them without developing
health problems. By causes that are not fully understood, every few years
[such] viruses may undergo changes that enable them to reach and infect the
meninges.
"Perhaps as in the case of the influenza viruses, an accumulation of small
genetic changes enables the virus to escape previously acquired [host]
immunity. After the 2000 outbreak, the incidence in the region declined to
an average of between 200 to 300 annual cases, or about 4-5 cases a week.
[In the present outbreak] by the end of February/beginning of March, there
was a sharp increase to 18 weekly cases, follow by a decrease in incidence
to the more usual numbers. Subsequently, from the beginning of the last
week of May the [number] of cases of viral meningitis has [increased
again], reaching an average of 25 cases weekly, according to medical
reports. (The most recent data are for the week 16-23 Jul 2006).
The viral meningitis outbreaks of 2000 and the present one follow similar
patterns: mainly affecting younger people -- 81 per cent of the first 312
patients were younger than 15 years, with an average of age of 5 years; 61
per cent of patients are male. The symptoms of all the meningitis cases
include fever, headache, and neck stiffness.
Even in a mild case of viral meningitis physicians recommend a brief
hospital stay, to allow exclusion of the more serious meningitis B or C by
laboratory diagnosis. If the meningitis is confirmed as viral, the patient
is sent home with symptomatic treatment against the fever and the pains.
Very rarely the disease lasts more than 10 or 15 days.
Two people have died in the present outbreak: males of 5 and 45 years,
according to the report of the Department of Health. A spokesman of the
council said that: "Virus meningitis fatalities are usually patients who
presented/displayed other ailments or that had impaired immune systems. It
is very unusual for enteroviral meningitis to cause death."
The disease is present in a dozen schools and nurseries. The Department of
Health has kept parents informed. "It is important to [reassure] parents,
who are usually scared when they hear the word meningitis, and inform them
that the disease is mild, has a limited spread capacity, although there is
no vaccine available."

[The identity of the enterovirus responsible for the increased incidence of
meningitis in the Madrid region is not stated. Further information would be
welcomed. Aseptic (viral) meningitis has often been associated with
enterovirus 71, a virus currently responsible for a Malaysian (Sarawak)
outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease which can be responsible for an
appreciable incidence of neurological disease in young children.
It is suggested in the above report that the cyclical pattern of viral
meningitis may represent an evasion of host population immunity by
progressive mutation of the virus. Alternatively it may be that the current
heat wave and water shortages in Europe have facilitated the transmission
of viruses, such as enterovirus 71, that are transmitted predominantly by a
fecal-oral route. - Mod.CP]
