A government official says authorities are investigating cough syrup believed to have killed 33 people in eastern Pakistan in the past 3 days.

Abdul Jabbar Shaheen said Saturday [29 Dec 2012] that 54 other people are being treated at hospitals in the city of Gujranwala who are also believed to have consumed the syrup. He said those involved are thought to be laborers or drug addicts who drank the syrup to get high.

Shaheen said chemical samples collected from the victims' stomachs contained dextromethorphan, a synthetic morphine derivative used in cough syrup that can have mind-altering effects if consumed in large quantities.

Shaheen said it is being investigated whether the people affected by the syrup in Gujranwala drank too much of it or whether there was a problem with the medicine itself.

"We have received 54 patients at hospital who said their condition deteriorated after taking cough syrups, and 16 of them have died," local hospital chief doctor Anwar Aman told AFP.

The victims were between 20 to 40 years old, and a majority had a history of drug addiction, Aman said, adding that so far, the culprit syrup has not been identified.

Senior police official Azam Mehr confirmed the toll and said samples of cough syrups available at local pharmacies have been collected and sent to laboratories. "Police and health departments have started inquiries and investigations into the deaths," he added.

Last month [November 2012], at least 19 people were killed in Lahore after drinking toxic cough syrup. In January 2012, around 100 heart patients died in Lahore, Pakistan's 2nd largest city, after taking locally-made tainted medicine.

[It may be of interest to note that in November 2012, there was a situation with cough syrup in Pakistan, and we were not able to find the exact mechanism of the cause of the fatalities. This may be a continuing situation, or it may be a new one.

Dextromethoraphan is the active ingredient in many cough syrups. It is a cough suppressant. It is found in most over-the-counter products intended to suppress cough, such as syrup, tablets, lozenges and throat sprays.

Dextromethorphan has been used as a pain control agent and has some psychological applications. Doses for these conditions are higher than those found in cough suppressant formulations.

In its raw form, the drug is a white powder and in extremely high doses has produced hallucinogenic effects. This may be the affect that former or current drug users or addicts were seeking to re-create. At extremely high doses, the mechanism of action is similar to dissociative effects of ketamine or phencyclidine.

Dextromethorphan (DXM) when taken in high doses can produce gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, diarrhea, cramps) as well as hallucinations, dissociation, muscle spasms, blurred vision, fever, hypertension (high blood pressure), and a histamine release (itching sensations), and other neurological changes may occur as well.

When DXM is taken with MOA inhibitors, there can be a life-threatening serotonin syndrome in which an excess of serotonin buildup occurs.

It is well known that this drug has been abused, and warnings regarding many over-the-counter medications have been established in many countries. Some countries have warning labels including advice to monitor children and teens' use of the product.

It is also entirely possible that the original powdered DXM was laced with some other drug.

We look forward to a final report of the investigation.
