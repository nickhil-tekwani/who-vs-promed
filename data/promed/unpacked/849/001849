[1] USA: role of schools in the spread of COVID-19

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-03/testing-shows-schools-aren-t-propelling-covid-19-outbreaks


Schools across the US have been open for weeks, and so far relatively few appear to have spread COVID-19 among students or into wider communities. Now, with holiday travel ahead and infections surging, teachers and parents are waiting to see whether that success holds.

In New York City, the 1st major US city to fully reopen its public schools, random testing of students and staff in its most recent sampling 2 weeks ago, showed an extremely low positivity rate of less than 0.2%. Even as cases have spiked in some areas of Brooklyn and Queens, causing schools there to shutter, no outbreaks in schools have been reported. But the story is very different elsewhere. Michigan, where cases are surging, has reported more than 90 outbreaks of the virus at pre-kindergarten through high school classes. Of those, 29 were reported just last week.

"You can't really pull the school out from the community," said Walter Gilliam, an education policy researcher at the Yale School of Medicine. "The biggest part of this, really, is how do you keep transmission rates in a county to a level that the schools even have a chance? If the transmission rates are too high, there's just almost nothing they could do to keep it from getting into schools."

What these 2 extremes show is that school children probably are not major spreaders of COVID-19 among each other, their families, and the wider community, as had been initially feared. Instead, they are more likely accurate reflections of conditions in the broader community. A recent large-scale study co-authored by Gilliam showed that child-care programs that remained open throughout the pandemic did not appear to contribute to the spread of the virus among child-care providers. Other early evidence similarly suggested that schools don't inherently become virus hot spots. Insights for Education, an independent foundation that advises education departments and ministries, examined data from 191 countries between [10 Feb and 29 Sep 2020] and found "no consistent pattern between school status and infection levels."

In Spain, a 2nd wave of the virus began before schools reopened. One analysis there found that in one region cases dropped 3 weeks after schools reopened, in one region cases stayed flat, and in others case numbers continued rising at the same rate. A new project that is collecting data on reopenings in the US, the COVID-19 School Response Dashboard, examined data from more than 5000 schools across all 50 US states and found that at a late-September peak, about 3% of schools reported outbreaks of 5 or more infections.

Gilliam and others caution against reading too much into his and other studies. His own work, he pointed out, studies child-care settings, where groups of children are far smaller than a typical pre-k or kindergarten class, and where caregivers were perhaps better equipped to put in place extensive health and safety measures.

Some early evidence suggests that children over 10 may be more likely to catch and spread the virus. Those risks also increase as older kids move from classroom to classroom, attend larger classes, and expand their circles for socializing and mingling.

Insights for Education's chief executive officer, Randa Grob-Zakhary, said that schools around the globe "did not seem to be the provocateur" of outbreaks and that those that reopen gradually and with practices such as social distancing in place seemed to fare best.

Whether it's safe to open schools, said Rainu Kaushal, a clinical researcher at Cornell University's medical school, Weill Cornell Medicine, in New York City, depends largely on 2 factors: How serious the spread of the virus is in the community and how seriously the community is taking precautions against the virus.

She said schools also need to be nimble. "This virus situation evolves so rapidly that one can only make the best decision for the next few weeks," she said. "And then you really have to take stock again."

[At this point, the evidence is more tilted towards lesser potential of spread from pre and primary care schools, definitely not a trend seen with colleges and higher education facilities. A more plausible and relevant explanation is that schools are a component of the community and therefore likely to be reflective of the virus transmission in the population.- Mod.UBA]

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-03/covid-patients-show-key-immunity-gauge-after-six-months-in-study


A crucial type of defensive blood cell persists for at least 6 months in people after Covid-19, even in those who had no symptoms, in a new study that may ease concern about waning immunity and its implications for a vaccine.

The research on 100 people shows that all had T-cell responses against a range of the coronavirus's proteins, including the spike protein used as a marker in many vaccine studies, after half a year. Those who experienced symptoms had levels that were at least 50% higher than those who didn't.

As a handful of vaccines nears the finish line, it's still unclear how long any protection they afford would last. A small number of patients have fallen ill with COVID-19 twice.

"This is promising news," said Fiona Watt, executive chair of the UK's Medical Research Council. "If natural infection with the virus can elicit a robust T-cell response, then this may mean that a vaccine could do the same."

A previous study, published last month by Imperial College London, raised concern that immune defenses may wane, as it showed that the percentage of Britons with antibodies declined over time.

T cells aren't antibodies. They are white blood cells that can remember past diseases, kill virus-infected cells, and rouse antibodies to marshal defenses when they are needed. People infected with another coronavirus that was responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2003, for example, still have a T-cell response to the disease 17 years later.

The study, from a group of immunologists from 17 universities called the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, has not yet been peer reviewed. It may be the 1st to show that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for this long, the authors said.

None of the patients whose blood and serum samples were studied had been hospitalized with COVID-19.

[The human body responds to foreign antigens and infectious agents by activation of B cell (antibody based) and T cell (cell based) immune responses. Like B cells, which produce antibodies, T cells are central players in the immune response to viral infection. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infects target epithelial cells in the airways, it replicates inside the cells, using the host cell's biochemical machinery. This causes the host cell to undergo programmed cell death, releasing molecules called damage-associated molecular patterns. These molecules are recognized by macrophages and neighbouring endothelial and epithelial cells, causing them to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including chemokines such as interleukin-6 [IL-6]; interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10; also known as CXCL10]; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and 1beta; and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1, also known as CCL2].

Monocytes, macrophages, and T cells are then recruited to the site of infection by these chemokines and other cytokines and promote further inflammation.

Studies assessing the clinical features of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have reported an incubation time of 4 to 7 days before the onset of symptoms, and a further 7 to 10 days before progression to severe disease [1].

For many primary virus infections, it typically takes 7 to 10 days to prime and expand adaptive T cell immune responses to control the virus, and this correlates with the typical time it takes for patients with COVID-19 either to recover or to develop severe illness [2]. This raises the possibility that a poor initial T cell response contributes to persistence and severity of SARS-CoV-2, whereas early strong T cell responses may be protective.

Another unique feature in this regard is that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is lymphopenia (an abnormal reduction in lymphocyte numbers), which resolves when patients recover. There are reports of a correlation between disease intensity and lymphopenia; for example, in infected children, in whom the mortality rate is very low, lymphopenia is rarely observed, while in older adults, in whom the mortality rate is higher, lymphopenia occurs more often, particularly in severe cases.

The report above seems to be indicative of the former picture, where a more robust and long lasting T cell response is observed in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. This is further corroborated by additional studies that reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20 to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus [3-5]

[3] Virus mutations

https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/coronavirus-d614g-mutation-found-in-999-25-of-cases-at-us-hospital/ar-BB1aCN0g


A mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which now dominates the world may be more infectious than the original version.

A study of more than 5000 COVID-19 patients at a hospital in Houston, Texas, revealed that 99.9 per cent of infections were caused by this altered version of the virus, called D614G.

The finding adds credence to the theory the mutation, which accounts for 85 per cent of global cases, is more contagious than the original strain.

D614G is by far the most common strain of coronavirus affecting humans worldwide and first appeared in February [2020] in Europe. International travel allowed this variant to spread across the continent and into the Americas, Oceania, and Asia within weeks.

Scientists are still trying to determine why the D614G strain has become the principal form of SARS-CoV-2, and think it may be due to the mutation increasing the amount of virus in the upper respiratory tract. This makes it more likely to spread when the infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dominant guise of the virus was a variant now called the 'D strain'. However, the D614G mutation sprung up at one specific location, called position 614, on the spike protein of the virus.

This spike hijacks the human receptor ACE2 and this is how it infects human cells. The location of the mutation sits at a critical juncture which affects how the virus cleaves in half after infiltrating a cell.

The mutation is very small and simple, one amino acid is changed from a D (aspartate) to a G (glycine), hence the moniker D614G. It is believed the D614G strain emerged first in Europe at the start of February 2020 and spread quickly.
As Italians, Britons, and others from coronavirus hotspots travelled to Asia, Australia, and America, the D614G virus then took hold in these regions.

Data from a study published last week [week of 26 Oct 2020] shows a spike of the G strain in Europe at the start of February [2020], followed by another resurgence of the G variant a fortnight later. By the start of March, cases of D614G were spotted around the world and this specific mutation made up around a quarter of all cases. It continued to take over and constituted more than 70 per cent of all cases by May, and the number is now thought to exceed 85 per cent.

However, in some localised areas the virus is almost ubiquitous. A September [2020] study from the US found 99 per cent of cases in a New York hospital were of the G strain, similar to the latest figures from Houston.

The latest study, which was led by the Houston Methodist Hospital and has been published in the peer-reviewed journal mBIO found that, during the initial wave of the pandemic in the spring, 71 per cent of cases were D614G. By the time the 2nd wave of the outbreak hit Houston during the summer [2020], this variant had leaped to 99.9 per cent prevalence.

"The virus continues to mutate as it rips through the world," says co-author of the Houston study Dr Ilya Finkelstein from the University of Texas at Austin. There is much debate over why the D614G mutation became dominant but the prevailing theory is that it is more infectious than the original version.

While the new research does not show a direct link between the amount virus in the upper respiratory tract and the likelihood of it spreading, several studies have hinted that the D614G mutation is more contagious. In August [2020], Paul Tambyah, senior consultant at the National University of Singapore and president-elect of the International Society of Infectious Diseases, made headlines when he said D614G makes the virus more infectious but less deadly.

How one amino acid led to a major mutation in SARS-CoV-2
--------------------------------------------------------
The study by the Royal Society's SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking -- COVID-19) task force also studied the one major mutation SARS-CoV-2 underwent. It is located on the S-protein which sticks out from the surface of the virus.

This spike latches on to the ACE2 receptor of human cells tricks it into opening the cell and allows the pathogen to infect a person. At one specific location -- residue 614 on the S1 terminus -- the original form of the coronavirus had the amino acid aspartate, labelled with a D. However, a random mutation saw this amino acid replaced with a glycine, labelled with a G.

The so-called D614G mutation was seen in barely any samples taken in February [2020]. However, by March [2020], more than a quarter (26 per cent) of isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains contained the mutation. By May this figure had reached 70 per cent.

The D614G mutation is the most dominant one seen globally. This mutation appears to help more virus infect a person and for more efficient infection of cells. The D614G virus is also almost always accompanied by 3 other minor mutations. The role of these changes remains unknown. Many in the scientific community decried his comments as premature and founded in speculation, not evidence, but recent research shows he may have been at least partially correct.

A study published last week by the University of Texas looked at how the D and G strains compared with each other and how they altered the trajectory of a coronavirus infection. It found the G strain is more infectious and 'enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients'. The researchers studied the 2 strains in a laboratory in both hamsters and human cell models.

"We demonstrated that the spike substitution D614G enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract through increased virion infectivity," the authors write. "The replication differences were more dramatically observed in the human airway culture, with up to a 13.9-fold advantage in a head-to-head competition test."

The authors of this previous study speculate that the G strain causes more virus to be produced in the nose and throat, but not in the lungs. Reassuringly, however, the researchers believe the mutation is unlikely to impact the effectiveness of a vaccine, echoing the sentiment of 2 major reports from October and September [2020].

Viral mutations are common and can make creating vaccines difficult as it causes the virus to change shape, rendering previous vaccines useless, as is the case with seasonal flu. Researchers were concerned that if this was the case for SARS-CoV-2 a new vaccine would be needed for every time the coronavirus mutated.

However, a study from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) found the change from the D to G strain will not impact on vaccine effectiveness. If this was to occur, it could mean a new vaccine would be needed every time a new mutation emerged, similar to seasonal flu. Experts are also hopeful that any future mutations will also not impact vaccine efficacy.

"Despite this D614G mutation to the spike protein, we confirmed through experiments and modelling that vaccine candidates are still effective," said Professor Seshadri Vasan from CSIRO, who led the study. "We've also found the G-strain is unlikely to require frequent "vaccine matching" where new vaccines need to be developed seasonally to combat the virus strains in circulation, as is the case with influenza."

What is an ACE-2 receptor and what does it have to do with COVID-19?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ACE-2 receptors are structures found on the surface of cells in the lungs and airways which work with an enzyme called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) to regulate blood pressure. Its exact function in the lungs is not well understood but studies suggest it is protective against lung damage and low levels of it can worsen the impact of viral infections.

Scientists say that the coronavirus which causes COVID-19 enters the body through the ACE-2 receptor, which the shape of it allows it to latch on to. This means that someone with more ACE-2 receptors may be more susceptible to a large viral load -- 1st infectious dose of a virus -- entering their bloodstream. People who have higher than usual numbers of ACE-2 receptors may include those with diabetes or high blood pressure because they have genetic defects which make them produce more.

High levels of ACE-2 receptors may also be protective, however. They are thought to be able to protect the lungs during infection and a study on mice in 2008 found that mice which had ACE-2 blocked in their bodies suffered more damage when they were infected with SARS, which is almost identical to COVID-19.

Smoking has in the past been repeatedly linked to lower than normal levels of ACE-2 receptors, potentially increasing the risk of lung damage from COVID-19.

[The diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in many countries recapitulates its global diversity. 198 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome appear to have already undergone recurrent, independent mutations. Detected recurrent mutations may indicate ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. Monitoring the build-up of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to inform on targets for drugs and vaccines. - Mod.UBA]

- The Americas region reported 29.3% of daily case numbers and 24.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 20.8 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada. Peru and Chile reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 49.1% of daily case numbers and 52.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 11.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (4 Nov 2020) include Germany, Israel, Kazakhstan, and Sweden. France is dominant, followed by Italy, UK, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Romania, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Portugal, Armenia, Turkey, Georgia, Greece, Serbia, Slovakia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Croatia, Denmark, Azerbaijan, and Slovenia.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.1% of daily case numbers and 11.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 3.17 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Jordan, Morocco, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Pakistan, and UAE. Libya, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Yemen has not reported any cases in the past 72 hours.

- The African region reported 0.81% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia.
