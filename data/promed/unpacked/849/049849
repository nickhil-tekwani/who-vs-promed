A European report today [Tue 26 Feb 2019] on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria that can be transmitted between animals and people shows high levels of resistance to drugs commonly used to treat certain foodborne illnesses, along with worrisome levels of multidrug resistance.

The European Union (EU) summary report on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals, and food, released today by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), covers resistance data collected by EU member states in 2017 from humans, pigs, calves under 1 year of age, and beef and pork. The data focus on resistance levels in salmonella, campylobacter, _Escherichia coli_, and methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ -- the main infection-causing bacteria that can be acquired directly from animals through environmental exposure or consumption of meat.

Among the highlighted findings of the report are very high to extremely high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) in campylobacter isolates from humans, with levels so high in some countries that fluoroquinolones can no longer be used for routine empirical treatment of campylobacter, which is a common cause of gastroenteritis. The data also show that more than a quarter of human salmonella isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR).

Although campylobacter infections don't often require antimicrobial treatment, resistance in campylobacter is a concern because of the large number of infections reported and because treatment can shorten the duration of illness. Salmonella, the 2nd commonest zoonotic disease reported in Europe, also causes mostly mild infections, but effective antibiotics are needed for treatment of severe enteric or invasive infections.

"The report released today should ring -- again -- alarm bells," EU commissioner for health and safety Vytenis Andriukatis said in an ECDC press release. "It shows that we are entering into a world where more and more common infections become difficult--or even sometimes impossible--to treat."

Resistance common in campylobacter, salmonella
----------------------------------------------
An analysis of human isolates from 19 EU nations, plus Iceland and Norway, found that 57.7% of _Campylobacter jejuni_ -- the commonest _Campylobacter_ species identified -- were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 45.4% were resistant to tetracyclines. Resistance to erythromycin was low (2%).

In Cyprus, Portugal, Spain, Lithuania, and Estonia, resistance to ciprofloxacin was from 80% to 96.5%. In addition, 8 of 17 countries saw a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance and 7 of 17 reported an increase in tetracycline resistance from 2013 to 2017.

For _Campylobacter coli_-- the 2nd commonest _Campylobacter_ species -- resistance to ciprofloxacin (63.5%) and tetracyclines (68.3%) was even higher, as was resistance to erythromycin (12.8%). Increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines among _C. coli_ isolates over the previous 4 years was observed in many countries. A total of 13 countries reported ciprofloxacin resistance levels that were between 70.5% and 100%.

While the proportion of _C. coli_ isolates with combined clinical resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, both of which are considered critical for treating campylobacteriosis, was low overall (10.2%), Portugal, Spain, Malta, and Finland reported high levels of combined resistance.

High levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin (52.3%) and tetracyclines (51.5%) were also observed in _C. coli_ from fattening pigs, with lower resistance to erythromycin (15.6%). Combined resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was reported in 61.2% of _C. coli_ isolates from fattening pigs in Spain.

Analysis of human salmonella isolates from 24 EU nations and 2 non-EU nations found that high proportions were resistant to sulfonamides (32.8%), tetracyclines (30.2%), and ampicillin (27.5%). In addition, 28.6% of human salmonella isolates were resistant to at least 3 antibiotics. The proportion of MDR isolates was even higher in human isolates of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (39.7%) and monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (81.4%); 2 serovars that contribute significantly to the overall numbers of MDR salmonella in Europe.

The authors of the report note, however, that while multidrug resistance was high overall in salmonella from humans, few isolates were clinically resistant to the 2 antimicrobials regarded as the highest priority for treating human infections -- ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime.

The analysis also found high levels of multidrug resistance in _Salmonella_ Typhimurium and monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium isolates from pigs. Among _Salmonella_ Typhimurium isolates, 64.2% of isolates from pig carcasses and 59.3% of isolates from fattening pigs were MDR. Among monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium isolates, multidrug resistance was observed in 77.2% of isolates from pig carcasses and 78.9% of isolates from fattening pigs.

Other noteworthy findings from the report include high levels of resistance to tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and trimethoprim in _Escherichia coli_ from fattening pigs and calves under 1 year, and varying prevalence rates of presumptive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC producers in salmonella and _E. coli_ monitored in beef and pork, fattening pigs and calves, and salmonella monitored in humans.

Bacteria that produce ESBL and AmpC enzymes are usually resistant to many or all 3rd-generation cephalosporins, which are widely used to treat _E coli_ infections and certain invasive salmonella infections.

Abstract
--------
The data on antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria in 2017, submitted by 28 EU member states, were jointly analysed by EFSA and ECDC. Resistance in zoonotic salmonella and campylobacter from humans, animals and food, and resistance in indicator _Escherichia coli_ as well as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ in animals and food were addressed, and temporal trends assessed. 'Microbiological' resistance was assessed using epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values; for some countries, qualitative data on human isolates were interpreted in a way, which corresponds closely to the ECOFF-defined 'microbiological' resistance.

In salmonella from humans, as well as in salmonella and _E. coli_ isolates from fattening pigs and calves of less than 1 year of age, high proportions of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, sulfonamides and tetracyclines, whereas resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins was uncommon.

Varying occurrence/prevalence rates of presumptive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC producers in salmonella and _E. coli_ monitored in meat (pork and beef), fattening pigs and calves, and salmonella monitored in humans, were observed between countries. Carbapenemase-producing _E. coli_ were detected in one single sample from fattening pigs in one member state. Resistance to colistin was observed at low levels in salmonella and _E. coli_ from fattening pigs and calves and meat thereof and in salmonella from humans.

In campylobacter from humans, high to extremely high proportions of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines, particularly in _Campylobacter coli_. In 5 countries, high to very high proportions of _C. coli_ from humans were resistant also to erythromycin, leaving few options for treatment of severe campylobacter infections. High resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines was observed in _C. coli_ isolates from fattening pigs, whereas much lower levels were recorded for erythromycin. Combined resistance to critically important antimicrobials in both human and animal isolates was generally uncommon but very high to extremely high multidrug resistance levels were observed in _S._ Typhimurium and its monophasic variant in both humans and animals. _S_. Kentucky from humans exhibited high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin, in addition to a high prevalence of ESBL.

Summary

Highlights
Zoonoses are infections that are transmissible between animals and humans. Infections can be acquired directly from animals, via environmental exposure or through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. The severity of these diseases in humans can vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions. Zoonotic bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials are of particular concern, as they might compromise the effective treatment of infections in humans. Data from the EU member states are collected and analysed in order to monitor the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic bacteria isolated from humans, animals and food in the European Union (EU).

For 2017, 28 member states reported data on AMR in zoonotic bacteria to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and 24 member states reported data to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In addition, 3 other European countries reported data; Iceland and Norway reported to ECDC, while Iceland, Norway and Switzerland reported to EFSA. The enhanced monitoring of AMR in bacteria from food and food-producing animals set out in the Commission Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU was successfully implemented in reporting member states and non-member states in the EU during 2017. In accordance with the legislation, the 2017 AMR data on food and food-producing animals specifically targeted fattening pigs and calves under 1 year of age and meat derived thereof. EFSA and ECDC performed the analyses of the data, the results of which are published in this EU Summary Report on AMR. Data on resistance were reported regarding salmonella and campylobacter isolates from humans and fattening pigs, whereas data on indicator _Escherichia coli_ isolates were related only to fattening pigs and calves under 1 year of age and meat derived thereof. Some member states also reported data on the occurrence of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) in animals and food; the antimicrobial susceptibility of MRSA isolates was also reported by 3 countries.

Member states reported all AMR data on humans, fattening pigs and calves under 1 year of age and meat thereof at the isolate (or case) level. The information published in this report provides an overview of resistance in most member states with detailed consideration of certain important aspects, such as multidrug resistance (MDR), combined resistance patterns to critically important antimicrobials (CIA) and levels of complete susceptibility in both human and animal isolates not only at the EU level but also at the country level. More specifically, reporting data at isolate level allowed characterisation of important patterns of resistance, enabling _Salmonella_ serovars to be linked to particular resistance patterns and to identify high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones and important resistance phenotypes in both salmonella and indicator _E. coli_.

The continually evolving threat from emerging resistance underlines the need to review the data collected, interpret the findings and assess trends. This report has attempted to highlight some of the most important findings in 2017. This report highlights in particular include the continued monitoring of the spread of certain highly resistant _Salmonella_ serovars; 2 serovars in particular, _S._ Typhimurium and monophasic _S_. Typhimurium, contribute significantly to the overall numbers of multidrug-resistant salmonella in Europe.

The inclusion within the harmonised monitoring scheme of a supplementary panel of antimicrobials, to be tested when certain resistances to an initial panel of antimicrobials are detected, enabled detailed screening of resistance to 3 carbapenem compounds. Carbapenemase-producing _E. coli_ were detected in the mandatory, specific monitoring for ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase-producing _E. coli_ in fattening pigs in Germany The isolate from fattening pigs in Germany produced the carbapenemase enzyme VIM-1 and genes encoding for this enzyme have been previously detected in isolates from pigs in Germany (Irrgang et al., 2017). The detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the environment of a swine farrow-to-finish operation in the United States was also recently reported (Mollenkopf et al., 2017). These findings are important, because carbapenems are critically important in human medicine.

The supplementary testing also allowed, for the 2nd time, detailed characterisation of the beta-lactam resistance phenotypes occurring in salmonella and indicator _E. coli_ from fattening pigs and from calves under 1 year of age. It enabled further phenotypic characterisation of 3rd-generation cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance in salmonella and indicator _E. coli_, by inferring presumptive genotypes of ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase producers. The occurrence of presumptive ESBL/AmpC producers in salmonella and indicator _E. coli_ from fattening pigs and from calves under 1 year of age was assessed as being at low levels. ESBL- and AmpC-producing salmonella was detected at low levels also in humans, but in a significant proportion of some serovars, although this could be affected by selective sampling.

In 2017, specific monitoring of ESBL-/AmpC-/carbapenemase-producing _E. coli_, which is able to detect very low numbers of resistant isolates present within a sample, was performed on caecal samples from fattening pigs, calves under 1 year of age and meat derived thereof from these animals. The occurrence and prevalence of _E. coli_ showing a presumptive ESBL, AmpC and ESBL + AmpC profiles from these animal populations and kinds of meat were assessed at both the reporting MS group level and the individual MS level. Overall and in most but not all countries, the detection of ESBL-producing _E. coli_ exceeded that of AmpC-producing _E. coli_ in fattening pigs, calves and meat derived thereof. Prevalence figures observed for the 2 kinds of meat studied were remarkably similar in all reporting countries and overall much lower than those observed in animals. The prevalence of _E. coli_ with a presumptive ESBL phenotype in the animals tested varied widely, from low to very high levels, between reporting countries.
