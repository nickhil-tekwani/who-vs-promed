Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh has been affected by encephalitis once again, with 30 children succumbing to the disease in the past 5 days. Almost 100 deaths have been reported in August [2013] alone with more than 300 children admitted to the BRD Hospital.

A water and mosquito-borne disease, encephalitis sees a peak during the monsoon.

In 2012, more than 500 deaths were reported officially due to the disease.

The government has set up a GOM [Group of Ministers] and sanctioned Rs 4000 crore [Rs 40 billion; approx. USD 632 million, which seems extremely high] to fight the killer disease.

[The mosquito-borne component of these cases is doubtless due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections and the water-related to enteroviruses infections. No indication is given in the report above of whether the etiologies of these infections has been determined by laboratory tests, of the proportion of the cases that are due to JEV infections, or of the status of JEV vaccination efforts in this endemic area. As has been clearly pointed out in an international publication (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130821.1892929], until there is adequate and specific diagnosis of these cases, it will not possible to design and implement effective prevention campaigns, and additional cases and fatalities can be expected.
