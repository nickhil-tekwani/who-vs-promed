VHF patient isolated: South Africa (Eastern Cape)
-------------------------------------------------
A patient suspected of having a viral haemorrhagic fever was admitted
to East London's Life St Dominic's Hospital last night [12 Apr 2010].
Hospital manager Kurt Wylie said when the patient was admitted 3
patients were moved to Life East London Hospital because they were
occupying an area designated for isolating suspected highly
infectious cases.

Wylie allayed fears over the danger of the disease and said Life St
Dominic's was fully equipped to handle suspected and confirmed cases.
"There is no cause for alarm," he said. "The National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the Department of Health have been
notified of the suspected case. Until such time as the case is
confirmed (and thereafter if it is confirmed), the patient will be
nursed in accordance with the NICD protocols."

The identity of the patient or where he is from could not be
confirmed last night. Viral haemorrhagic fevers are a diverse group
of illnesses caused by 5 different families of viruses. All are
characterised by fever and bleeding disorders and all can progress to
high fever, shock and, in extreme cases, death. Some cause relatively
mild illnesses, while others, such as the African Ebola virus, can
cause severe, life-threatening disease.

[This report indicates a suspect viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) case
has been isolated in East London's Life St Dominic's Hospital.
Additional information on the case presentation, epidemiological and
laboratory findings will be appreciated.

[Previously outbreaks of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF] have
been recorded in Eastern Cape province (see: Crimean-Congo hem. fever
- South Africa (02): (EAS) 20080726.2282, and Crimean-Congo hem.
fever - South Africa: (Eastern Cape) 20080716.2162). Indeed CCHF is
endemic in many countries in Africa, Although CCHF virus is
transmitted by ticks, humans who become infected with CCHF usually
acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected
tissues from livestock during this time, and only rarely from a tick
bite. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a
risk of nosocomial spread of infection. In the past, serious
outbreaks have occurred in this way and it is imperative that
adequate infection control measures be observed to prevent this
disastrous outcome. - Mod.CP]
