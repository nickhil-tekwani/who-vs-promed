Since 23 May 2011 (start of the event), 21 outbreaks of LPAI H7N7
have been reported from Germany; an interactive map, showing all of
them, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10633.

The 5 new outbreaks are located close to the Karlovarsky province of
the Czech Republic. It will be interesting to note if surveillance in
domestic and wild birds has been undertaken there.

The similar LPAI H7N7 strain has caused this year (2011) outbreaks in
Germany's north western neighbour, the Netherlands; see maps at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10748
(turkeys), and
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10580
(free range laying hens).

During the 31 May 2011 meeting of the EU's Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), both countries presented their
early outbreaks in detail; the presentations are available at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/31052011_lpai_the_netherlands.pdf
and
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/31052011_lpai_germany.pdf.

According to OIE's Terrestrial Code, all influenza A viruses of H5
and H7 subtype that are not found to be highly pathogenic, are termed
'low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI)'. The Code's
requirements for the regaining of freedom from NAI (HPNAI as well as
LPNAI), are laid out in Article 10.4.3. at
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm.
