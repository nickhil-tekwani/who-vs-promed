Contaminated water kills 9 in Pakistan
--------------------------------------------
9 people have died, and 1600 have been sickened, after drinking
contaminated water from a state-operated reservoir in southern Pakistan,
officials, and witnesses, said Tue 25 May 2004.
Dr. Hadi Bakhsh, from the main hospital in the city of Hyderabad, 60 miles
northeast of the port city Karachi, said people suffering from diarrhea
began streaming in more than 2 weeks ago [2nd and 3rd weeks of May 2004].
The contaminated water is supplied by a state-run water agency, which gets
the water from Manchar Lake, outside Hyderabad, in Pakistan's southern
Sindh province. The source of contamination is unknown, and authorities
have ordered an investigation.
Since 10 May 2004, hospitals have treated some 1600 people, officials said.
Provincial Health Minister Naeem Ishtiaq told The Associated Press that 4
children, and a woman, died Mon 24 May 2004. The World Health Organization
is preparing a report, after taking water samples from the lake.

Contaminated water downs a dozen in Pakistan
-----------------------------------------------
Contaminated water from a state-run reservoir has killed at least 12
people, and made 2000 ill, in southern Pakistan, officials said on Tue 25
May 2004.
Naeem Ishtiaq, health minister for the southern province of Sindh, said
about 2000 people had been admitted to the hospital in Hyderabad after
consuming water from Manchar Lake, which lies just outside the city. He
said at least 8 people had died in the past 3 days. Other officials said 4
more had died before reaching the hospital.
Ishtiaq said the cause of contamination was under investigation. All those
affected lived in one of the poorest parts of Hyderabad, a city of 2.8
million people, about 120 km north-west of the port city of Karachi.
