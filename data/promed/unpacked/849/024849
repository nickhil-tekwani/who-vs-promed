This is the second call for participation for MEDNET 97, The World Congress
on the Internet in Medicine. MEDNET 97 builds on the successful MEDNET 96
which was attended by a large international and multi-disciplinary group of
delegates.
MEDNET 97 will take place in Brighton, UK between November 3-6, 1997.
Introduction
------------
MEDNET 97 will enable individuals to participate in a programme assembled
from numerous submitted papers providing a varied, stimulating and
informative cross-section of developments in the use of the Internet in
Medicine. The Congress will also contain a wide range of lectures delivered
by outstanding speakers.
Once again MEDNET will be simultaneously hosting a Virtual Congress,
workshops, Cyber-cafe and a commercial exhibition which will provide visitors
with the opportunity to witness the extensive involvement and innovations
made by commercial organisations in this rapidly developing field.
As well as providing the forum to exchange valuable information MEDNET 97
will provide delegates the opportunity to relax and enjoy the town of
Brighton with its exotic Royal Pavilion and narrow winding Lanes. Delegates
may choose to visit the local Sussex countryside containing many famous
landmarks as part of the varied social programme. The Congress Banquet will
again be held in the historic Old Ship Hotel where last year we were
fortunate to have as our guest speaker Professor Sir Harry Kroto, 1996 Nobel
Laureate in Chemistry.

Virtual Conference
------------------
All accepted presentations to MEDNET 97 will appear in a Virtual Conference

with the authors using e-mail and the World Wide Web. The Virtual Conference
Centre will contain a variety of electronic forums to facilitate
communication, and will be mirrored at key sites on different continents,
enabling participation by a world-wide audience.
The Virtual Conference Centre will also contain a virtual exhibition space,
where institutions and commercial companies unable to be physically present
may participate in the event.
While the Virtual Conference Centre will make use of state-of-the-art web
technologies, the organisers of MEDNET recognise that many virtual
particpants will be limited by band-width issues and older equipment. Every
effort will be made to provide alternative access to the key features of the
Congress for those who do not have the latest hardware and software.
