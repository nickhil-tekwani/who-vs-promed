Crews spray for plague-carrying fleas
-------------------------------------
A dead rabbit that tested positive for plague was found near Paradise
Drive and Platteville Boulevard in Pueblo West, Colorado. Pueblo
City-County Health Department crews on Friday [25 Jul 2008] dusted
prairie dog holes in north Pueblo West to kill fleas that can carry plague.

Plague was confirmed following tests on a dead rabbit found by a
resident recently in the area of Paradise Drive and Platteville
Boulevard, according to health department spokeswoman Mary Davis.
"All residents in the area have been alerted to that and employees
are dusting prairie dog holes in that area right now," Davis said Friday.

Plague is relatively common in rabbits and rodents. It can infect
humans and domestic animals if they are bitten by a flea that has had
contact with an infected mouse, rabbit, prairie dog or other wild animal.

That's why "everyone should be aware of the risk, no matter where
they live," Davis said. "Everyone should always be aware of the
guidelines for protecting themselves and their pets." Pets that spend
time outdoors, especially in rural areas, should be treated regularly
for fleas and should be kept on a leash in areas where rodents and
other potential plague carriers are known to live.

Homeowners should clear their properties of plant materials, lumber
or debris that provide attractive cover for rabbits, mice and rats.
Known rodent habitats should be treated with flea powder or other
insecticides. When spending time in rural areas likely to harbor
rabbits, prairie dogs and rodents, wearing insect repellent and long
pants, tucked into socks, can prevent flea bites. Humans should avoid
all contact with wild animals and rodents that are known to be
potential carriers of plague, and should never handle a sick or dead animal.

Signs of plague infection include a sudden fever, fatigue and general
malaise. The disease is treatable in humans and animals but is more
easily treated if caught early. For more information, or to report a
dead or sick animal, call the Environmental Health Division of the
Pueblo City-County Health Department at 583-4323.

[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when
infected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Rock squirrels (_Spermophilus variegatus_) are closely related to
California ground squirrels and are the most significant plague host
in Colorado. Their principal flea (_Diamanus montanus_) is an
aggressive parasite and will readily bite other animals and people.
Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague by infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
with cats, serve as a direct source of infection.

Often prairie dogs are considered sentinel animals. Cats are also
very sensitive. Owners should be alert to any swelling on their
animals and if found the pet should be examined by a veterinarian. - Mod.TG

ProMED has only ever reported one other rabbit with plague, which was
last year, also in Colorado -- see ProMED 2007 archive below. - Mod.JW
