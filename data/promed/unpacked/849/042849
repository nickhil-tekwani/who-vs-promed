There were 90 cases of malaria notified in Ireland last year [2009]
compared to the 82 that were reported the previous year [2008], new
figures show. One person died of the illness last year [2009] and most
of the others who were diagnosed with it had to be hospitalised.

Most of the patients were not Irish-born and had returned with the
disease after visiting family abroad, but Irish holidaymakers to
exotic destinations were also among the patients.

[Visiting Friends and Relatives, VFR, is a terminology used to group
immigrants returning to their country of origin. Many studies show
that immigrants living in industrialized countries returning to
low-income counties have a high risk of, for instance, malaria,
hepatitis A and B. This group poses a special challenge concerning
pre-travel advice and immunization, which is illustrated by these data
from Ireland. - Mod.EP]
