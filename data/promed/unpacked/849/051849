The Windsor Essex County Health Unit [WECHU] said that recently collected data has identified a single mosquito capable of transmitting the Zika virus. The routine mosquito surveillance program, conducted by WECHU in the summer and fall, tested the adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito found, and it has tested negative for any vector-borne diseases.

That type of mosquito is capable of transmitting Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. The 1st mosquito capable of transmitting these diseases was discovered in 2016. The 1st such mosquito was found in Canada in 2017 for the 1st time.

WECHU is also testing mosquitos collected for eastern equine encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease that has recently caused fatalities in Michigan and a number of other states.

"Until the 1st freeze hits, we are still at risk for mosquito bites, and it is important that everyone take steps to avoid being bitten," said Dr. Ahmed, medical officer of health.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes sporadically appear in north temperate zones in the Americas, this time in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As the above comment indicates, they will not survive the winter and will disappear with the onset of killing frosts, likely to occur in the next 2-3 weeks. The only way that local transmission of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya viruses could occur is in the unlikely event that a viremic individual came to a locality where there was a population of _Aedes aegypti_ large enough to permit ongoing transmission. - Mod.TY
