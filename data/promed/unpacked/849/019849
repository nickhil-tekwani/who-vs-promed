Arsenic in food chain raises health concerns
--------------------------------------------
A high concentration of arsenic in the water and soil is infiltrating
Bangladesh's food chain, raising serious health concerns for millions
of residents, specialists warn.

The acceptable level of arsenic in drinking water has been set at 50
parts per billion (PPB) or 0.05 microgrammes per litre of drinking
water in Bangladesh, while the approved global standard set by the
World Health Organization (WHO) is 10 PPB.

According to new field surveys of arsenic contamination in soil,
water and plants in various parts of the country by scientists from
Japan's Nihon University and local researchers, arsenic was found in
all types of crops in the worst-affected areas. An earlier survey by
scientists of the School of Biological Sciences, University of
Aberdeen, UK, analysed 330 samples of "aman" (rain-fed) and "boro"
(irrigated) rice, 94 vegetables and 50 pulse and spice samples for
arsenic and found that the districts with the highest mean arsenic
rice grain levels were all in the south-west.

The districts were Faridpur (boro) with 0.51, Satkhira (boro) 0.38
and (aman) 0.36, Chuadanga (boro) 0.32 and Meherpur (boro) 0.29
microgrammes per gramme. Boro rice contained significantly more
arsenic than aman rice, mainly because boro rice is irrigated with
ground-water containing arsenic. "Daily consumption of rice with a
total arsenic level of 0.08 microgrammes per gramme of rice would be
equivalent to a drinking-water arsenic level of 10 microgrammes per
litre of water," the research found. Rice represents about 70
percent of the daily calorie intake, according to specialists.

A long-standing problem
-----------------------
Levels of arsenic in the drinking water are so high in Bangladesh
that the WHO has described it as "the largest mass poisoning of a
population in history" [see:
<http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-55.html>].

In rural Bangladesh, many wells pump water with arsenic
concentrations exceeding 500 microgrammes per litre. Groundwater is
contaminated with arsenic in 61 out 64 districts.

According to a 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
report, people might be exposed to arsenic not only through drinking
water, but indirectly through food crops irrigated by contaminated groundwater.

"Where concentrations of arsenic in soil and water are high, we found
a correlation with high arsenic content in crops," said Sasha
Koo-Oshima, an FAO water quality and environmental expert.

Several studies have also reported a correlation between arsenic in
soil and reduction in crop yields, particularly in rice. Since rice
is the staple food, arsenic contamination could also negatively
impact food security if concentrations reach levels toxic to crops.

"Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh threatens the
health of up to 30 million people," according to the FAO.

But Ehteshamul Haque, chief engineer of the government's department
of public health engineering's (DPHE) arsenic mitigation project, is
less worried. "Arsenic is flowing into agricultural products via
irrigation water, but in very insignificant quantities," Haque told
IRIN on 19 Sep 2008. A lot of research is required before we could
ascertain how much arsenic is accruing into the food chain and what
harm it can cause to the consumers," he said. He also said the World
Bank-DPHE arsenic mitigation project expired in June 2007 and had not
been renewed. "What we are doing is continuing with the remnants of
the project," he said.

Cutting back on irrigation
--------------------------
"The Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) [see:
<http://www.brri.gov.bd/>] estimates that farmers could apply up to
40 percent less irrigation water without any yield losses," the 2006
FAO report said. "If water input can be reduced so that the soil
conditions become more aerobic, the solubility of arsenic -- and
therefore its uptake -- would be minimized as well." Another option
is to promote cropping patterns that require less irrigation water,
which could be done by replacing boro rice with wheat and maize, for
instance, which require less water, the report stated.

"Roughly 50 percent of the present boro acreage of some 4 million
hectares in Bangladesh is agro-ecologically suitable for non-flooded
dry-land crops like maize and wheat. These crops may be a good
alternative to boro rice in an arsenic management strategy because
boro rice is grown in an anaerobic [irrigated] environment where
arsenic becomes much more bio-available than in the aerobic [dry]
growing conditions for wheat and maize," Muhammad Panaullah, a
senior soil scientist, told IRIN. He played a lead role in
investigating the transmission of arsenic from ground- water to soil
to crops under a project of the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT), [see: <http://www.cimmyt.org/> US Agency
for International Development (USAID) [see: <http://www.usaid.gov/>]
and Cornell University (CU) in 2002-2006. sa/ds/mw

Arsenic poisons scenic China lake
---------------------------------
Arsenic has poisoned a lake in southwest China that was famous for
its hot springs, affecting the drinking water of at least 26 000
people, state media said on Friday [19 Sep 2008]. Trucks were
carrying 80 tonnes of water each day to affected areas near
Yangzonghai lake, in Yunnan province.

In June [2008] the local environmental protection bureau detected
dangerous levels of arsenic in the lake. A nearby firm had not built
proper containment pools for its waste, and years of accumulated
arsenic were leaching through into the groundwater and the lake, an
investigation found. The factory has been closed and its managers detained.

Odourless, tasteless, colourless and easily soluble, arsenic has long
been a feared poison. A heavy dose can kill, while small amounts may
also sicken people gradually. The water would not be safe for at
least 3 years, the official Xinhua agency said. China has been
struggling to clean up its battered environment after years of
promoting growth at almost any cost, but corruption and poverty mean
it still faces regular problems.

Earlier this month over 250 people were killed when a waste
containment pond at a mine collapsed, creating a roaring tide of mud
that engulfed homes and a market.

Many of China's major lakes are also choked with pollution or
over-exploited, including Dianchi which is also in Yunnan and has
been dubbed the "mother lake" of the nearby provincial capital.

The government has pledged to return them to their original state but
only set a target date of 2030.

[Arsenic is a relatively ubiquitous element within the earth, both
soil and water.

Arsenic (As) is a naturally occurring contaminant found in many
ground waters. It generally occurs in 2 forms (valences or oxidation
states): pentavalent arsenic (also known as As(V), As(+5), or
arsenate) and trivalent arsenic (also known as As(III), As(+3), or
arsenite). In natural ground water, arsenic may exist as trivalent
arsenic, pentavalent arsenic, or a combination of both. Although both
forms of arsenic are potentially harmful to human health, trivalent
arsenic is considered more harmful than pentavalent arsenic.

Arsenic exists in metalloid, arsenite (trivalent), and arsenate
(pentavalent) valences and in arsine gas. The inorganic (trivalent)
compound is absorbed more readily than the organic (pentavalent)
forms because of its high lipid solubility. Absorption primarily
occurs through the gastrointestinal tract; however, some absorption
occurs through the skin. Once arsenic is in the body, it binds to
hemoglobin, plasma proteins, and leukocytes and is redistributed to
the liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and intestines. Over a period of
weeks, deposits may be found in skin, hair, nails, bone, muscle, and
even nervous tissue.

Arsenic produces cellular damage through a variety of mechanisms.
Arsenic binds to enzyme sulfhydryl groups and forms a stable ring,
which deactivates the enzyme. The process of deactivating the enzyme
causes widespread endothelial cell damage, vasodilation, and leakage
of plasma. Massive transudation of fluid into the bowel lumen,
mucosal vesicle formation, and tissue sloughing may result in large
gastrointestinal fluid losses. Arsenic binds to dihydrolipoic acid, a
pyruvate dehydrogenase cofactor, blocking the conversion of pyruvate
to acetyl coenzyme A and inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Arsenic competes
with phosphates for adenosine triphosphate, forming adenosine
diphosphate monoarsine, causing the loss of high-energy bonds.

In some forms, arsenic is caustic, exerting a direct toxic effect on
blood vessels and large organs. Long-term exposure results in nerve
damage and may lead to lung, skin, or liver cancer. Once inhaled,
arsine gas combines with hemoglobin in RBCs, causing severe hemolysis
and anemia. Patients develop hemoglobinuria and hematuria within
several hours of exposure.

Trivalent arsenic is generally more difficult to remove from drinking
water than pentavalent arsenic. Trivalent arsenic can be converted to
pentavalent arsenic in the presence of an effective oxidant such as
free chlorine. The arsenic in water containing detectable free
chlorine or that has been treated with another effective oxidant will
be in the pentavalent arsenic form1. Treatment with chloramine
(combined chlorine) is not sufficient to ensure complete conversion
of trivalent arsenic to pentavalent arsenic.

Arsenic does not generally impart color, taste, or smell to water,
therefore, it can only be detected by a chemical analytical test.

Almost no information is available on the effects of organic arsenic
compounds in humans. Studies in animals show that most simple organic
arsenic compounds (such as methyl and dimethyl compounds) are less
toxic than the inorganic forms. In animals, ingestion of methyl
compounds can result in diarrhea, and lifetime exposure can damage
the kidneys. Lifetime exposure to dimethyl compounds can damage the
urinary bladder and the kidneys.

Chelation therapy is the definitive treatment for arsenic poisoning.
During chelation, arsenic is incorporated into a heterocyclic ring.
This stable, water-soluble, less toxic compound is more easily
eliminated from the body by the excretory system. Chelation is not an
effective treatment for arsine gas exposure, and it may increase
urinary arsenic excretion without preventing hemolysis.

Initiate therapy in all symptomatic patients and in all patients
whose speciated urine arsenic level exceeds 200 mcg/L. Patients who
are minimally symptomatic and have chronic arsenic poisoning may be
removed from the source of their exposure without chelation therapy.
Chelation may be of greatest benefit to patients exposed to high
levels of arsenic over short periods or to patients with chronic
poisoning who recently were exposed to high levels that were
superimposed on their chronic toxicity. Chelating agents are used
only when necessary because they are toxic and have many adverse
effects. If renal failure occurs, initiate hemodialysis and continue chelation.

Patients presenting with acute arsenic ingestion and evidence of a
radiopaque bariumlike substance on abdominal radiographs should
receive whole-bowel irrigation. If tolerated, polyethylene glycol
solution may be used for irrigation at a rate of 1 L/h and continued
until opacities no longer are present.

* Remove the patient from the source of exposure.
* For recent ingestion, decontaminate the patient with gastric lavage.
* Consider whole-bowel irrigation if lavage does not achieve desired results.
* Initiate supportive care with aggressive fluid resuscitation for
hypovolemia, and monitor the patient's electrolyte levels.
* Initiate cardiac monitoring for arrhythmia. Torsade de pointes may
be treated with magnesium sulfate or overdrive pacing with
isoproterenol in addition to the measures usually recommended to
treat ventricular tachycardia.
* Maintain high urine output with intravenous fluids (IVF) to
facilitate arsenic excretion. Consider adding bicarbonate to IVF to
maintain a urine pH of at least 7.5 in an attempt to prevent renal
failure secondary to myoglobinuria.

In the case of the exposures in Bangladesh, removal from the source
of exposure seems to not be possible at the moment.
