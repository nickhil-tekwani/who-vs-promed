The Colombian Ministry of Agriculture has initiated an information campaign about fusarium cubense race 4 (TR4) and has sent out personnel to monitor farms where musaceous crops are grown, given the possible presence of this pest in 2 Colombian plantations.

The farms in the department of La Guajira are declared as under phytosanitary quarantine because of the presence of symptoms "associated with _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ tropical race 4." Infected plants are surrounded by security zones which are again surrounded by zones "under observation."

The information detailing the situation on the affected farms and the degree of infection was initially published by the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) and subsequently erased, but recovered by sources in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian government has not given details of the situation in their country and has not informed Ecuadorian growers about the quarantined farms.

Bananas and plantains are amongst the most important crops in Colombia, cultivated on nearly 300 000 hectares [about 741 000 acres].

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

In recent years, tropical race 4 (TR4) has also been reported in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia and is of great concern worldwide (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). If the diagnosis above can be confirmed, this appears to be the 1st report of TR4 in the Americas.
