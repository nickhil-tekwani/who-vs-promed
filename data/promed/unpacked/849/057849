Swollen shoot disease has ruined at least 20 million trees in the
country's east and now poses a serious threat in the main western
producing region, officials said. Swollen shoot is a viral disease
which dries out plants' roots and leaf stems, causing them to produce
small pods and beans that are unfit for sale. It has traditionally
only flourished in the eastern region of Ghana, the world's 2nd
largest cocoa exporter. Once attacked, a tree has to be uprooted and destroyed.

In recent months, the disease appears to have spread to the Western
region of Ghana, which produces most of the country's cocoa. In the
Nsem district about a third of farms have been destroyed by swollen
shoot. "Now, the disease is beginning to take its toll on the western
region and it has been a major concern," the official said.

A source close to the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana said Cocobod
[Ghana Cocoa Board] had stepped up an anti-swollen shoot campaign in
the western region to forestall a calamity. The person said the
disease had been contained in the past under a EUR 700 000 (about USD
1 million) 4-year campaign funded by the European Union, which ended
in 2005 and has yet to be revived.

An official of the viral disease control unit of industry regulator
Cocobod said its researchers had discovered a hybrid cocoa variety
found to be tolerant of the swollen shoot virus. The disease does not
disturb its growth or development of the pods up to maturity and
harvest. All diseased trees were being replaced with the new hybrid,
he said. "We consider this not only as a major breakthrough in our
efforts to reduce the effect of the disease to the barest minimum,
but it brings some relief to the hardworking farmers that in the
event of any attack, they will not immediately lose their crop," the
official held. Apart from its ability to tolerate swollen shoot, the
hybrid is much quicker to mature for harvest, without pod quality
being compromised, he added. In addition to the hybrid, Cocobod was
making progress in the use of fungus or other biological controls.

Cocobod Chief Executive Isaac Osei had said the company was spending
up to [USD?] 90-million on disease and pest control, including the
campaign against swollen shoot, this year [2007]. Apart from swollen
shoot, Cocobod has undertaken mass spraying every year to rid cocoa
farms of fungal black pod and capsid infestation. The 2 officials
said the spraying and the use of hybrids has been effective and led
to a significant reduction in the impact of diseases throughout the
cocoa belt. "What we need now is enough funds to sustain the
replanting," the source said.

Ghana enjoys a premium for its cocoa, especially the main crop
harvest, which is mainly exported to Europe and Asia. "Obviously, if
sustained, we'll increase production -- first because the hybrid
matures and multiplies faster, and second because there will be
minimal impact of disease affliction on the crop," the source said.
Cocobod has set itself an ambitious 3-year target of harvesting one
million tons of cocoa by 2010 and has outlined measures, including
farmer incentives and the adoption of hybrid seeds and fertilisation,
to boost the crop. Ghana's yearly average production over the last 5
years is 600 000 tons.

[Cacao swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) is caused by _Cacao
swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) which was first
recorded in Ghana in 1938. Symptoms on cocoa (_Theobroma cacao_) vary
with different viral strains and may be interveinal chlorosis,
swollen stems and roots, root swelling only, and no symptoms at all.
The virus can also infect some species in the families _Bombacaceae_,
_Sterculiaceae_ (including cola nut), and _Tiliaceae_ (including
jute). CSSV is spread by several species of mealybugs in a
semi-persistent manner (retained when the vector moults, not
replicating in the insect, not transmitted congenitally). It may also
be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation, but is not
transmitted by contact between host plants, seed, or pollen. The
virus occurs in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka,
Togo, and possibly Trinidad and Cote d'Ivoire.

CSSV is indigenous to West Africa, present in forest trees and
appears to have transferred to cocoa following the introduction of
the crop. The virus causes crop losses (an estimated total of 50 000
tonnes annually in Africa), which have affected the economies of the
respective countries. It has forced migration of farmers resulting in
environmental damage due to increased clearing of forests. Disease
management has been based on a "zero tolerance" philosophy, which
required that all infected trees and neighbouring plants be removed.
In Ghana, this has resulted in the destruction of millions of cocoa
trees during the last 50 years, and many millions more are awaiting
removal. It is estimated that over 160 million trees have either died
from CSSV or have been eradicated in the whole of West Africa. With
new farms getting rapidly infected, breeding for virus or vector
resistance has become imperative.

Black pod is, at present, the primary fungal disease affecting cocoa
worldwide and is caused by _Phytophthora_ species. A major outbreak
was reported from Ghana and Ivory Coast earlier this year (2007). For
more information see ProMED-mail post no. 20070914.3043.

Cocoa-capsids are insects belonging to the group of _Miridae_,
including _Distantiella theobroma_ and _Sahlbergella singularis_,
which are the dominant species in West Africa. They cause serious
damage on pods, leaves, and shoots, and eventually trees are reduced
to bare trunks with numerous lateral shoots.
