HOG CHOLERA/SWINE FEVER VIRUS (2)
==================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD: Hog cholera/swine fever virus - RFI
Kjaere Dr. Sigurdardottir,
Two places to ask for immunohistochemistry protocols for CSFV:
Heinz-Jurgen Thiel
Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals
72001 Tubingen, Germany
Ed Dubovi
Diagnostic Laboratory
New York State College of Veterinary Medicine
Cornell University
Ithaca, New York 14853
(Thiel's: P.O. Box 1149)
Dubovi has an antibody, MAb 20.10, which is specific for NS3 of BVDV. It
will also pick up any other Pestivirus (at least by FA). He has a good
immunohistochemistry protocol also.
Thiel has been working on CSFV for a long time, and used to be in a
diagnostic lab. I don't know for sure that he has good immunohistochemistry
methods, but he would definitely know who does.
Good Luck,
Heidi Hoff
