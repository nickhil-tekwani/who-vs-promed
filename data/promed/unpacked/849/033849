[The 27 Jun 2014 edition of Clickanoo (http://www.clicanoo.re/426927-guadeloupe-et-martinique-30-morts-90-000-personnes-touchees-par-le-chik.html in French) stated that there are 90 000 cases of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection and 30 deaths in Guadeloupe and Martinique combined, higher numbers than in the WHO/PAHO report above.

The 25 Jun 2014 edition of ECDC Risk Assessment (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/chikungunya-caribbean-june-2014-risk-assessment.pdf) provides more recent totals for St. Martin, indicating that as of 20 Jun 2014, there were 5294 CHIKV infections there. That report also has a graph of CHIKV infection cases in the Americas over time and provides maps of Europe showing relative risk of CHIKV transmission should it be introduced.

[2] Cases in various countries:

Caribbean countries with ongoing transmission not mentioned in the WHO/PAHO report above.

Antigua - Barbuda. 28 Jun 2014. (susp.) 91 cases, (conf,) 15 cases. http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/topstory-Fifteen-confirmed-cases-of-chikungunya-in-Antigua-Barbuda-21777.html

[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Antigua-Barbuda can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2577899,30. - Mod.TY]

Dominican Republic. 24 Jun 2014. Of the 136 835 suspected cases, the provinces with the most cases are: Districto Nacional 4479 cases, San Cristobal 4241 cases, San Pedro de Macoris 3944 cases, Santo Domingo 2667 cases, Hato Mayor 2283 cases, Monte Plata 1489 cases, Duarte 1423 cases, San Juan 1346 cases, Barahona 1295 cases, Independencia 1070 cases.

Puerto Rico. 24 Jun 2014. Locally acquired 1 case, imported 2 cases.
http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/united-states.html

Grenada (Carriacou Island). 26 Jun 2014. (conf.) 5 cases.
http://www.gov.gd/egov/news/2014/jun14/26_06_14/item_5/chikungunya_grenada.html

[These cases are of unspecified locality of acquisition, but 5 cases in 2 different villages suggests local acquisition.]

US Virgin Islands. 23 Jun 2014. (susp., locally acquired) 1 case (conf., locally acquired) 2, (conf.) imported 2 cases.
http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/cdc-in-v-i-to-help-respond-to-chikungunya-1.1707420

Central America local transmission
---
El Salvador. 27 Jun 2014. (susp.) 1300 cases, (conf. by USA CDC) 6 cases.
http://www.ansa.it/ansalatina/notizie/notiziari/amcentr/20140627212135684435.html

[Confirmation of these cases is not good news. The confirmation of locally acquired cases and the increase of numbers of suspected cases from 1200 last week to 1300 this week indicates that virus transmission is continuing. If the virus spreads throughout El Salvador, there are no ecological or epidemiological barriers that will halt its continued dissemination through Central America and northward into Mexico and the southern USA.

South America with ongoing transmission
---
Suriname. 26 Jun 2014. (conf.) 17 cases (4 imported, 13 apparently locally acquired).
http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/17-chikungunya-cases-confirmed-in-Suriname--widespread-infection-expected and http://m.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/23878 [in Dutch]

Venezuela (Maracay). 26 Jun 2014. (conf.); 2 cases locally acquired.
http://www.entornointeligente.com/articulo/2730086/Confirman-dos-casos-locales-del-virus-Chikungunya-en-el-paA%C2%ADs-26062014

[This report is of concern. Dengue virus is widespread in Venezuela indicating presence of the mosquito vector that also transmits CHIKV. There is risk of CHIKV spreading widely as well in the country and beyond. Mod.JT shares this concern.

Countries with cases ex Caribbean but no ongoing transmission
---
Canada (Calgary, Alberta province). 24 Jun 2014. (conf.) 1 case ex Haiti. The patient, a previously healthy 46-year-old man, travelled to Port au Prince, Haiti, from 14-17 May 2014. During this visit, he remained exclusively in the downtown area, did not take malaria prophylaxis or use mosquito nets at night. On 19 May 2014, following his return to Calgary, he developed sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache, transient macular rash to trunk and extremities, and migratory polyarthritis involving multiple large and small joints; he denied respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had no evidence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination at the Emergency Department on 20 May [2014]. His symptoms persisted until 23 May 2014, when his fever resolved spontaneously, although the headache and polyarthralgias continued for the next 48 hours.

The following laboratory tests, dengue IgM and IgG serology, malaria smears and blood cultures were all negative and non-contributory to the diagnosis. A blood sample collected on 20 May [2014], a day after his onset of illness, was used to perform a pan-alphavirus RT-PCR.

France. There is no change from the previous week's report for cases ex the Caribbean. However, there is a 28 Jun 2014 report in La Provence (http://www.laprovence.com/actu/region-en-direct/2939302/un-cas-de-chikungunya-decele-a-aix.html in French) of one case imported into Aix en Provence from Sierra Leone. This is further evidence of CHIKV coming into France from countries other than those in the Americas.
