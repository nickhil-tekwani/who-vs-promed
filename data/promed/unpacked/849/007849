The Ministry of Health is investigating the largest outbreak of leishmaniasis in humans, which is centred in Fuenlabrada, Madrid.

The illness is usually restricted to dogs but can be transmitted to humans, and the number of human cases have increased from 15 in 2009 to 118 last year [2011]. At the end of February [2012], the number of cases reached 228.

Since 2010, residents and users of the parks at Polvoranca and Bosqu Sur have complained of increasing cases. It causes skin ulcers and, in severe cases, inflammation of the liver and spleen.

According to the Madrid Vets College, Colvelma, there were 101 cases in humans in 2003 in all of Spain, of which 24 were in the Madrid region. Now they say between 7-8 percent of the dogs in the region are infected, a condition which will almost certainly lead to them being sacrificed.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Spain. The subspecies is _Leishmania infantum_, and the reservoir is dogs. A recent review (Gil-Prieto R et al. Epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Spain based on hospitalization records (1997-2008). Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2011;85:820-5) identified 2028 individuals who were hospitalized with leishmaniasis, with an average hospitalization rate of 0.41/100 000 inhabitants. Control of leishmaniasis focuses on controlling the canine reservoir and the phlebotomine sand fly vector. - Mod.EP]
