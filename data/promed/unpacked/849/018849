[2] DEFRA: preliminary risk assessment
Date: Wed 19 Feb 2014

Preliminary outbreak assessment
-------------------------------
1. Disease report
The Polish Authorities have reported to the European Commission 2 cases of African swine fever [ASF] in wild boar, one in Podlaskie region less than 1 km [0.62 mi] over the border from Belarus and the other slightly further south on the border in Sokolski region [for a map, showing the said 2 1st cases and the previous ASF outbreaks in Belarus, Lithuania, Russia, and Ukraine during 2013/14, please refer to the source URL]. This is the 1st occurrence of ASF in Poland and the 3rd wild boar case in 3 weeks from this area of East Europe. The previous 2 cases were also reported along the border region with Belarus, in Lithuania. Disease control measures are in place in accordance with guidelines for control in feral pigs. The Polish Authorities have been carrying out a significant level of surveillance in this region for several months, hence the early detection so close to the border.

2. Situation assessment
In Lithuania, the Community Veterinary Emergency Team recently returned from a mission to provide assistance to the Lithuanian Authorities on surveillance and control of ASF. The team confirmed that the most likely hypothesis for disease incursion was wild boar ingesting infected material in the area, possibly from domestic waste bins or being fed by hunters rather than from wild boar roaming over large distances (the territorial range of a wild boar at this time of year is approximately 5 km [3.1 mi]). There was no sign of infection in domestic pigs in the backyard sector in the area.

Poland is approved for the trade in live pigs and products of animal origin. According to TRACES, the EU trade notification system, there have been no consignments of live pigs or pig semen destined for the UK from Poland in the last 12 months. Products of animal origin are not recorded in TRACES. Poland has a high domestic pig population (over 17 million head and 280 000 establishments according to OIE statistics for 2012) and wild boar density. In the last 3 years, Poland has tested over 13 000 wild boar from the border regions for ASF, with nearly 1400 for 2014 alone and these are the 1st positive cases.

3. Conclusions
It should be emphasised that this report concerns again wild boar cases close to the border with Belarus. There are no reports of disease in the commercial pig sector in Poland. Similarly for Lithuania, there have been no reports of further spread into or within the country or into the domestic pig population. If either of these situations were to occur, the risk level may increase.

This 2nd report of ASF incursion into wild boar in the EU again does not raise the risk of introduction of disease to the UK; the risk of incursion is very low and concerns for the most part, the movement of illegal products of animal origin and consequent swill feeding to backyard pigs, rather than a few single cases in wild boar. Efforts to control the disease in line with contingency plans before it becomes established give reassurance of the system of legal trade and animal health certification within the EU.

We will continue to monitor the situation and report on technical and political developments as part of exchanging information with other countries and sectors.
