Avian influenza (AI) was confirmed yesterday [27 Jul 2014] at a duck farm in [South Jeolla] Korea, local officials said.

The South Jeolla Livestock Sanitation Office said yesterday [27 Jul 2014] that a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, H5N8, was discovered Friday [25 Jul 2014] at a duck farm in Hampyeong in the southwestern province. Upon official confirmation, approximately 42 000 ducks at the farm were immediately culled, officials said.

To prevent the virus from spreading, an additional 2000 chickens at the poultry farms located within a 500-meter (0.3-mile) radius were also slaughtered, officials said. All farms within 10 km [6.2 mile] of the infected farm were also ordered to cease transporting their animals to outside regions for the next 30 days.

The virus was first detected Friday [25 Jul 2014] when officials from the sanitation office conducted an AI test on the farm before approving its products for sale. The birds tested positive for the virus the same day, after which officials reported it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs for a detailed inspection and official confirmation.

The restriction on transportation is worrying for farmers in South Jeolla ahead of the Chuseok [harvest festival] holidays from 7 to 9 Sep 2014, when consumer demand for meat typically increases. The transportation ban is expected to be lifted just before the holidays at the earliest if no further virus cases are confirmed there over the month.

The last time the province suffered an AI outbreak was in January [2014], when the local government culled approximately 2.36 million ducks and chickens.

An avian influenza outbreak appears to be in the making with the virus spreading all over the country.

The ministry confirmed Monday [28 Jul 2014] that ducks at a farm in Hampyeong, South Jeolla Province, were infected with the highly-contagious virus, the 3rd case this year [2014]. In June [2014], a poultry farm in Muan, South Jeolla Province, and another in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, tested positive for the virus.

The Hampyeong farm suffered the outbreak in March [2014]. Ministry officials suspect the farm did not properly remove excrement of the previously infected poultry.

''We think the farm did not adequately sterilize facilities before bringing in new birds in June,'' ministry official Kwon Jae-han said. ''It is likely that the virus remained dormant at the farm for months and was transmitted to ducks recently. We are now conducting tests to figure out the exact cause of the infection.''

[The outbreak above, in the South Jeolla Province (south-west South Korea), if officially confirmed, is to become the 30th since the start of the HPAI H5N8 epizootic in South Korea on 16 Jan 2014. The virus spread mainly within the western provinces, with the most recent (29th) outbreak officially notified on 2 Feb 2014.

For all OIE follow-up reports on this epizootic, which is considered "continuing", and an interactive map showing the location of all outbreaks, please go to http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668.

The disease control policy applied by South Korea during the event is "stamping out without vaccination."

Official confirmation of this outbreak, and of other outbreaks in case indeed recorded since 2 Feb 2014 according to the media, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
