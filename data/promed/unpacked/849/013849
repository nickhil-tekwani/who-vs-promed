[Brucellosis is zoonotic disease that can have a significant negative
impact on reproductive capacity on farms. It mainly affects cattle,
sheep, goats and pigs worldwide but also dogs, mice and even murine
species. Infections in feral pigs, bison, elk and European hares also
complicate the eradication picture and pose intermittent risks for
zoonotic transmission.

The Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State
University's College of Veterinary Medicine (see
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis.pdf>)
summarizes the geographic distribution as follows: _Brucella_ species
vary in their geographic distribution. _B. abortus_ is found
worldwide in cattle-raising regions except in Japan, Canada, some
European countries, Australia, New Zealand and Israel, where it has
been eradicated. Eradication from domesticated herds is nearly
complete in the U.S. _B. abortus_ persists in wildlife hosts in some
regions, including the Greater Yellowstone Area of North America.

_B. melitensis_ is particularly common in the Mediterranean. It also
occurs in the Middle East and Central Asia, around the Arabian Gulf
and in some countries of Central America. This organism has been
reported from Africa and India, but it does not seem to be endemic in
northern Europe, North America (except Mexico), Southeast Asia,
Australia or New Zealand.

_B. ovis_ probably occurs in most sheep-raising regions of the world.
It has been reported from Australia, New Zealand, North and South
America, South Africa and many countries in Europe.

In the past, _B. suis_ was found worldwide in swine-raising regions.
This organism has been eradicated from domesticated pigs in the U.S.,
Canada, many European countries and other nations. However, it
persists in wild and/or feral swine populations in some areas,
including the U.S., Europe and Queensland, Australia. Sporadic
outbreaks are reported in domesticated herds or humans due to
transmission from this source. _B. suis_ continues to occur in
domesticated herds in some countries of South and Central America
(including Mexico) and Asia. _B. suis_ biovars 1 and 3 are found
worldwide, but other biovars have a limited geographic distribution.
Biovar 2 occurs in wild boar in much of Europe. Biovar 4 (rangiferine
brucellosis) is limited to the Arctic regions of North America and
Russia including Siberia, Canada and Alaska. Biovar 5 (murine
brucellosis) is found in the former USSR.

According to the OIE WAHID database, _Brucella suis_ has sporadically
caused outbreaks in Europe over the last 5 years. It has occurred
both in commercial and feral swine populations. Armenia had an
outbreak in 2008; Croatia has reported outbreaks yearly since 2006 as
has been the case for the Czech Republic. France reported outbreaks
of _B. suis_ in 2006, 2008, 2009; Germany reported outbreaks in 2008
and 2009 as well as this year. Hungary report outbreaks in 2008 and
2009. Italy reported outbreaks every year including 2010 since 2006.
Romania reported outbreak in 2006 and 2008; while the former Serbia
and Montenegro reported an outbreak in 2006. Finally, both Spain and
Switzerland reported outbreaks in 2009. - Mod.PC]
