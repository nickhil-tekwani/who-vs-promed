Fourteen additional cases confirmed. Total tally stands at 122.
39-year-old pregnant female tests positive for MERS-CoV
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Ministry of Health and Welfare's MERS-CoV Task Force has confirmed 14 (with an additional 5 under epidemiological investigation) additional positive cases of MERS-CoV on [Thu 11 Jun 2015].

- 8 out of the 9 announced are confirmed to have been infected at Samsung Medical Center between 27-29 May 2015, while the remaining patient is believed to have come in contact with the virus through Patient no. 15 at Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Hospital.

- Test results for the 5 patients under epidemiological investigation have been transmitted to the Korean Center for Disease Control at early morning on 11 Jun 2015, and are currently under review.

- Reports also indicate that a pregnant woman (39 years old) is among the newly infected 8 at Samsung Medical Center:

- The Task Force has stated that whereas this is the 1st case of an infected pregnant woman out of the currently confirmed 122 cases and there is insufficient information regarding how the virus affects pregnancies and vice-versa even overseas, special precautions must be taken for the treatment of pregnant women afflicted with the virus.

*The CDC in the United States currently lists pregnant women under a special at-risk category alongside those with chronic disorders, the immunocompromised, and the elderly.

- In the case of pregnant woman, a more proactive method of symptomatic treatment involving constant supervision and monitoring of patient condition is required as the administration of anti-viral medication (such as Ribavirin) and interferon treatment has proven to be difficult.

- The patient is currently reported to be in stable condition.

[The addition of these latest 14 cases raises the total number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by South Korea to 122, including 9 deaths. It also reports on the 1st confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman.

For an excellent epidemic curve showing number of reported cases by date of onset, see the WHO/WPRO (Western Pacific Regional Office) MERS-CoV update page available at http://www.wpro.who.int/outbreaks_emergencies/wpro_coronavirus/en/. This curve is current as of today, 10 Jun 2015, with a total of 108 reported cases. While there are high numbers of cases continuing to be reported on a daily basis (in the past 7 days there have been 82 cases reported), the epi curve based on dates of onset reflects a possible decreasing trend with a peak number of cases with date of onset on 1 Jun 2015. Summary statistics from WPRO can be found at http://www.wpro.who.int/outbreaks_emergencies/mers_statistics_10jun2015.pdf and show that almost 2500 individuals have been tested for MERS-CoV infection, and over 3400 close contacts are being monitored (3259 on home monitoring, 180 monitored in facilities, and 641 have completed 14 days of monitoring following their known date of contact). Evidence of a massive effort on the part of the Korean MOH.

[2] Saudi Arabia, 1 new case, 1 death - MOH 10 Jun 2015
Date: Wed 10 Jun 2015
Source: Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health [edited]
http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2015-06-10-001.aspx


As of 12 noon today, 10 Jun 2015 there have been a total of:
1029 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
452 deaths
568 recoveries, and
9 currently active cases including one on home isolation

In the past 24 hours there have been:
1 newly confirmed case
1 newly reported fatality

[reported case fatality rate remains at 43.9 percent - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly confirmed case:
Hufoof: a 60-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other case(s) is under review.

Information on newly reported fatality:
Jeddah: a 55-year-old expat male, non-healthcare worker, with history of pre-existing co-morbidities [confirmed as case on 5 Jun 2015 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At time of initial report, denied contact with other case(s). - Mod.MPP]

[The outbreak in Hufoof continues with a total of 30 cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 14 deaths reported since 20 Apr 2015. Of note 4 cases were in healthcare workers, 6 cases were reported to be from the same large extended household, 15 reported contact with another case(s) in either the healthcare environment or the community (not specified), and an additional 8 had a possible history of contact with another case(s) that was under review. Hence, it is likely that all but the 1st case with onset on 20 Apr 2015 had known contact with other cases in either the healthcare environment or the community ... a similar profile to the ongoing outbreak in South Korea, except smaller in size.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - United Arab Emirates 9 Jun 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [3 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of 1 additional fatal case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:

A 77-year-old female from Abu Dhabi developed symptoms on 21 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 28 May [2015]. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [2 Jun 2015]. She has no history of contact with known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1219 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 449 related deaths.

[This case represents the 77th case reported by the UAE. In the past month there have been cases reported from the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia -- 3 of the 4 locations where the index case from the South Korean outbreak travelled. Only Bahrain has not reported cases of MERS-CoV infection. Hence, transmission could have occurred in anyone of the locations he visited.

As of today's (9 Jun 2015)report, the global number of cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed by WHO is now 1219 including at least 449 deaths (note that the Saudi Arabian MOH reports 452 deaths. The varying numbers available from the different sources continues to be confusing -- differing tallies of cases and deaths, resulting in differing reported case fatality rates etc.

[4] ECDC risk assessment - 5 Jun 2015
Date: Fri 5 Jun 2015
Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [edited]
http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-rapid-risk-assessment-5-June-2015.pdf


[This ECDC risk assessment is a good review of the global status of the MERS-CoV activity as of 5 Jun 2015. In the subsequent days since this was published there have been almost 70 newly confirmed cases reported from South Korea including an additional 5 deaths, an additional 5 cases and 2 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, and the newly reported case from the UAE. The full report with figures and graphics can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP]

Main conclusions and options for response
-----------------------------------------
This update of the risk assessment was triggered by a large cluster of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in South Korea generated by a primary case that was imported from the Middle East. The importation of a MERS-CoV case to South Korea is not an unexpected event. MERS-CoV cases with travel history to the Arabian Peninsula have been diagnosed outside of the Middle East in the past. Cases should also be expected in the future given the ongoing transmission in the region and frequent international travel to and from the region. On several occasions, notably in France, the United Kingdom and Iran, such importations have resulted in secondary transmission to patients, healthcare workers and visitors who were in contact with the primary imported cases and/or close relatives of a case.

Although the MERS-CoV cluster in South Korea is the largest that has so far been observed outside of the Arabian Peninsula, the cluster remains limited to patients, visitors to patients and healthcare workers in a few healthcare facilities and close relatives of the cases. The outbreak does not represent an increased risk of infection for travellers or visitors to South Korea. However, patients who present with severe acute respiratory disease in the EU and have recently been in contact with healthcare services in South Korea should be considered for MERS-CoV assessment, similar to patients having been in contact with healthcare services in the Arabian Peninsula.

The fact that the index case in the South Korean cluster does not have a documented history of exposure to camels or healthcare settings in the Arabian Peninsula is cause for concern. Continuous vigorous efforts are required to determine the likely source of infection and to ensure that other, undetected, transmission chains are not ongoing. WHO has stated that there is currently no indication that the virus is behaving differently to how it has behaved in the past and that there is no indication of sustained transmission from person to person. However, further details of the virus characterisation in South Korea are pending.

ECDC's assessment continues to be that the MERS-CoV outbreak poses a low risk to the EU. Because of the continued risk of case importation to Europe after exposure in the Middle East or South Korea, international surveillance for MERS-CoV cases among travellers remains essential. Moreover, rapid efforts to contain nosocomial clusters in the affected countries are vital to prevent broader transmission patterns. Although sustained human-to-human transmission is unlikely, secondary transmission to unprotected close contacts, especially in healthcare settings, remains possible, as now documented in South Korea. The vast majority of cases detected in the Middle East and South Korea continue to be due to nosocomial exposure.

The importance of eliciting a travel history from patients with severe respiratory disease cannot be overemphasised. The immediate, systematic and strict implementation of infection prevention and control measures in the hospital setting are essential to interrupt transmission and prevent clusters of healthcare-associated infection. Furthermore, the challenges of detecting rare imported cases of respiratory infection early on highlight the need for adequate infection prevention and control measures for all patients showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection.

WHO recommends that probable and confirmed cases should be admitted to adequately-ventilated single rooms or airborne precaution rooms. Healthcare workers caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection should use contact and droplet precautions (medical mask, eye protection -- that is, goggles or face shield -- gown, and gloves) in addition to standard precautions. Airborne precautions should be taken when performing aerosol-generating procedures [1].

Disease background information
------------------------------
Since it was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012, more than 1000 MERS-CoV cases have been detected in over 20 countries. In Europe, 6 countries have reported confirmed cases, all with direct or indirect connection with the Middle East.

Clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting in death. The clinical course is more severe in immunocompromised patients.

Although it is likely that a zoonotic transmission is the starting point of some clusters, human-to-human transmission is currently the dominant mode of transmission for MERS-CoV, and almost all new cases are generated in healthcare facilities or among family members. Nosocomial transmission has been a hallmark of MERS and the majority of cases has been reported from hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE).

There is growing evidence that the dromedary camel is a host species for the virus and that camels might play an important role in the direct or indirect transmission to humans.

Recent evidence
---------------
In a recent cross-sectional seroprevalence study that included 10 009 subjects in Saudi Arabia, the presence of antibodies against MERS-CoV was found to be 23 times higher (3.6 percent vs 0.15 percent, p less than 0.001) in slaughterhouse workers who are occupationally exposed to camels than in the general population [3]. The authors note that the higher prevalence in young males observed in this study is an indication of unrecognised infections with mild or no symptoms. These subclinical infections could then presumably act as a source of infection for patients not having been exposed to camels.

A serological study in Qatar [4] demonstrated the presence of neutralising antibodies in 7 out of 109 persons with occupational exposure to dromedary camels, a proportion similar to that found among slaughterhouse workers in the seroprevalence study in Saudi Arabia. The findings of these studies strengthen evidence of the role of dromedary camels as a source of infection and indicate that unrecognised asymptomatic or mild infections are likely to occur at low rates in occupationally exposed persons.

Event background information
----------------------------
Worldwide situation
Since April 2012 and as of 5 Jun 2015, 1211 cases of MERS-CoV (including 492 deaths) have been reported by health authorities worldwide [figures and tables can be found at the source URL for those who are interested.] ( Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by month and probable place of infection, March 2012 -- 31 May 2015 (n=1192)

Geographical distribution
-------------------------
Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran (Table 2).

Current epidemiological situation
---------------------------------
Since the previous update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on severe respiratory disease associated with MERS-CoV dated [8 Mar 2015], there have been 129 new cases and 53 additional deaths from MERS-CoV reported globally: Saudi Arabia (81 cases and 48 deaths), Qatar (3 cases and 1 death), Oman (one case), United Arab Emirates (2 cases), Iran (1 case), South Korea (40 cases and 4 deaths), and China (1 case).

South Korea and China
---------------------
South Korea
-----------
On 20 May 2015, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified WHO of the 1st laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in a 68-year-old man with recent travel history to the Middle East. According to WHO, the man had the following travel history: [18-29 Apr 2015], Bahrain; [29-30 Apr 2015], United Arab Emirates; [30 Apr to 1 May 2015], Bahrain; 1-2 May [2015], Saudi Arabia; 2 May [2015], Bahrain; and 2-3 May, Qatar. The case arrived at Korea's Incheon International airport via Qatar on 4 May [2015] and was asymptomatic on arrival. The patient has no history of exposure to camels or contacts with MERS-CoV patients, and he did not visit any healthcare facilities while travelling in the Middle East. Investigation of the source of infection is ongoing [5].

As of [5 Jun 2015], this primary case has resulted in 30 secondary cases. All secondary cases were exposed to the primary case before he had been diagnosed with MERS-CoV and before appropriate infection prevention and control measures had been implemented. Of the 30 secondary cases:
- 13 were admitted in the same ward or had contact with the index case as patients;
- 4 healthcare workers provided care for him;
- 13 were family contacts or visitors to patients admitted to the same ward or sharing the same room with the index case: the wife of the index case, and 12 visitors, one of whom travelled to China.

On [2-5 Jun 2015] the health authorities in South Korea reported 10 additional cases with no history of contact with the index case but contact with 2 secondary cases. One of these cases was a healthcare worker. Furthermore, the health authorities are reporting 4 fatal cases.

Onset dates range from 11 May for the index case, until [1 Jun 2015] for the most recent nosocomial cases where the onset date is indicated, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Figure 5. Transmission chain of 41 confirmed MERS-CoV cases in South Korea and China reported from 20 May to 5 June 2015

China
-----
On 30 May [2015], WHO notified of a case of MERS-CoV in China. The case is a 44 year-old male from South Korea. The patient is the son of the 3rd MERS-CoV case in South Korea and the younger brother of the 4th MERS-CoV case. He visited his father in the hospital, while the father was sharing a room with the index case. He developed symptoms on 21 May [2015] but decided to fly to Hong Kong, China on 26 May [2015] where he continued to Huizhou through an entry point in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province. The local health authority found him on 27 May [2015] and immediately transferred him to a designated hospital for isolation. This patient was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection on 29 May [2015] [6].

Of the 41 cases reported from South Korea and China 68 percent (28 cases) were males. Of the 28 male cases; one is the index case, 2 are healthcare workers, 9 are visitors and sixteen are patients. Three of the male cases have died.

Of the 41 cases reported 32 percent (13 cases) were females. Of the 13 female cases; 3 were healthcare workers, one is a close contact to the index case, 3 are visitors and 6 are patients. One of the female patients has died.

Saudi Arabia
------------
Since the last risk assessment on [8 Mar 2015] and as of [5 Jun 2015], Saudi Arabia has reported 81 additional cases of MERS-CoV (Figure 4). Of the 81 cases, 5 were identified as healthcare workers. 31 reportedly had contact with suspected or confirmed cases in hospitals or clinics or in the community. 6 of the 31 were clearly indicated as a nosocomial transmission, while 3 are currently under investigation for possible nosocomial transmission and the source of the infection is unknown for 47 cases.

Of the 79 cases, where age and sex is known, 78 percent are male (62), while 22 percent are female (17). The age ranged from 20 to 93 years, with a mean age of 54 for males. For females the age ranged between 24 and 77 years, with a mean age of 55 years.

11 of the 81 cases reported animal contact and 10 are reported to have drunk camel milk and to have had contact with to camels.

Figure 6. MERS-CoV cases with known city of infection in Saudi Arabia, 8 March - 2 Jun 2015

United Arab Emirates
------------------
On 18 and 24 May 2015, WHO notified of 2 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection in the United Arab Emirates. Both cases were asymptomatic and found through enhanced surveillance. According to WHO, both cases had a recent history of contact with MERS-CoV infected camels imported from Oman.

Qatar
-----
Since the last ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment update on [8 Mar 2015], there have been 3 additional cases and 1 death of MERS-CoV in Qatar. All the cases are males between the ages of 29 and 73 years. Two of the cases have had frequent contact with camels. One of the 2 cases frequently drinks camel milk. A relative of the 3rd case owns a camel farm and drinks raw camel milk, however he does not have direct contact with camels. The 3rd case has died.

Oman
----
On 31 May 2015, the health authorities in Oman reported a case of MERS-CoV in a 75-year-old male.

Iran
----
On 8 May 2015, the WHO notified of an additional case of MERS-CoV in a 61-year-old male with onset of symptoms on [18 Mar 2015].
