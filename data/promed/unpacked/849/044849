Hand, foot and mouth disease in South Alabama
----------------------------------------
Covington County is experiencing an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease, local pediatricians said Thursday (09 Feb 2012). Dr. Bhagwan Bang of South Alabama Pediatrics in Opp said other Alabama counties are reporting similar cases, as well. Hand foot mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 and can be contracted by not washing one's hands properly. Bang said the disease strain currently circulating locally has caused extensive and larger-than-normal lesions on the hands, feet and mouth. He said cases in adults have also been noted.

He said the same strain [virus species] -- Coxsackie A6 virus -- reportedly caused a 2008 epidemic in Finland, a 2004 and 2008 epidemic in Taiwan, and this year for the first time in the U.S.

"Hand, foot and month disease usually starts with a fever, poor appetite, malaise and sore throat, painful sores in the mouth, on the palms of hands and soles of feet," Bang said. "It also appears on the knees, elbows and buttocks, and can also cause dehydration due to the inability to swallow fluid." Bang said his office has seen several cases -- 2 of which were confirmed as the disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"This isn't something that should scare parents," Bang said. "They should just be aware of it and take precautions against it. The easiest way to stop the spread of this disease is by simply washing your hands after changing a dirty diaper, disinfecting a dirty surface and avoiding close contact with someone who is infected."

Those at Covington Pediatrics in Andalusia have seen similar cases, which they attribute to the unseasonably warm weather. The virus should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease), a disease of cattle, sheep and swine. The two diseases are caused by different viruses and are not related. Those concerned about symptoms should contact their health care provider.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease occurs globally. In developed countries hand, foot and mouth disease is generally mild and often associated with outbreaks of Coxsackie A16 virus infection. In East Asian countries in recent years, the disease has been associated with outbreaks of Enterovirus 71 infection and can be more severe, with a small proportion of children experiencing neurological complications, occasionally with fatal outcome. The appearance of Coxsackie A6 virus as a cause of hand foot and mouth disease in Alabama does not appear to be associated with the severe form of the disease. - Mod.CP]
