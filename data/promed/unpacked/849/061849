These curious rashes among American school children without any signs
of systemic illness remind me of a similar outbreak with hundreds of
people in Western Berlin, Germany, during the early sixties. At this
time I was working as a young doctor in the Department of Infectious
Diseases in the Rudolf Virchow Hospital.
At first we had no idea concerning the etiology. Since our department
was in charge of the management of the sick, we started to consider
the hypothesis of an unknown virus. To our own surprise, a
distinguished virological institute claimed to have isolated such a
virus (the details I cannot remember) from the material of some
patients.
It took about a week until we and our colleagues from the Department
of Health found out that the disease was caused by a nutritive
allergen. A big food company had just added a new emulsifier to a
brand of margarine that was only sold in the western part of Berlin
(at that time still separate). After that lot had been taken from the
market, the problem resolved immediately.

[Thank you Dr. Volkmer for this very interesting and
thought-provoking account of a similar type rash illness outbreak.
It would be of interest to know if a possible food allergen might be
the culprit in some or all of these current outbreak occurrences --
perhaps a common food preparation product distributed to schools for
use in school lunch programs. Reviewing the details of the
individual state outbreaks, some of the outbreaks seem to have more
of a contact dermatitis picture, suggesting an environmental
irritant, but the possibility of a common "food irritant" as
described by Dr. Volkmer remains very intriguing. We await further
information on these outbreaks. - Mods.MPP/JW
