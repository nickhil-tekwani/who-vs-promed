A primary school had to close yesterday due to an outbreak of strep A. Some 150 students -- around 40 per cent of the intake -- at Kingsbridge Community Primary School in Devon [England] had been absent due to illnesses, including infections linked to strep A. It made the decision to close as a result. The school, which also had 12 members of staff off sick, had a "deep clean" and was able to reopen today.

In a letter sent out to parents, the school said it was "experiencing a major outbreak of strep A" with 40 per cent of children and 23 per cent of staff absent. A closure notice for the school was issued via the council, Devon Live reports. Part of it read: "High levels of strep A. We have 147 children absent today and 12 members of staff." Devon County Council also confirmed that officials from the Devon Integrated Care Board (ICB) had assisted the school in supporting children, families, and staff.

Assistant Head of the school Miranda Martyn has confirmed that the school is open today (Wednesday [14 Dec 2022]) and staff shall work closely with public health experts and keep families informed as they move through this period. A statement said: "We're open. We're following all the public health guidance, and importantly we've got children and staff who are ready to resume learning. "We'll continue to work closely with public health experts and keep families informed as we move through this period."

A spokesperson for the UK Health Security Agency further told Devon Live: "Currently, no confirmed cases of invasive Group A strep linked to this school have been reported to UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency]."

Professor Dominic Mellon, Deputy Director for UKHSA South West, says the agency has contacted the school and offered advice on controlling the situation. He said: "We have been made aware that Kingsbridge Primary School has a high rate of absence due to illness circulating at the school. The school decided to close on Tuesday [13 Dec 2022] due to staffing levels and to enable a deep clean.

"We have contacted the school to offer school public health advice in controlling the situation and determine the cause of the illnesses circulating. We understand that they plan to reopen today (14 Dec 2022)."

Steve Brown, Director of Public Health Devon, said: "We're aware that a number of pupils and staff are off with illnesses currently. The UKHSA is in touch with the school regarding public health advice for students and staff. To help reduce the risk and spread of infection, we advise people to follow basic good hand and respiratory hygiene measures:
- wash your hands regularly using soap and warm water for 20 seconds
- use a tissue to catch coughs and sneezes and discard the tissue in the bin immediately
- not sharing eating utensils, clothes, bedding, and towels
- and avoiding close contact with others if you are feeling unwell."

[Devon is a county in South West England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon). The Kingsbridge Community Primary School has 375 students 4-11 years old in Kingsbridge (pop., 1661 residents in 2011), 17 miles (27 km) southeast of Plymouth, the most populous city in Devon. A map showing the location of the Kingsbridge Community Primary School in Devon can be found at https://www.devon.gov.uk/schools/school/kingsbridge-community-primary-school/.

Group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) commonly causes scarlet fever, pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections (impetigo, cellulitis), but can also cause invasive infections (iGAS), including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

ProMED has posted 3 reports of outbreaks of GAS infection in the UK since 26 Nov 2022, describing increasing numbers of upper respiratory tract involvement, scarlet fever, and invasive GAS infection that has been fatal in some patients. However, the above news report of a large GAS outbreak at the school in Devon says there have been no cases of iGAS at this school. Reports of similar outbreaks are also being reported in Spain and the USA (see also's below).

For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates.

More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
