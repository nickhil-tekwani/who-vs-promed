Lassa fever disease has claimed one life in Enugu state. Commissioner for health, Dr Fintan Ekochin, confirmed the incident, on [Mon 6 Aug 2018]. "We had a case of Lassa fever, unfortunately, he died. It's a confirmed case. As we speak, no other case has been confirmed or suspected. So, we pray it ends as it has already happened. However, there is no cause for alarm. When we [detect] any case, we do the needful regarding those at high, medium, and low risk. So, a certain number of cases identified are on drugs. The search continues because we have to equally go outside the hospital and look for the places, the family source, and food for the patient."

Following the resurgence of the disease earlier in the year [2018] in parts of south east, especially, neighbouring Ebonyi, the Enugu state government had, in January, embarked on sensitisation campaigns in parts of the state. Ekochin said though the disease was not prevalent amongst the population, there was concern about those who travelled to and from Ebonyi.

[This is the 1st Lassa fever case this year (2018) in Enugu state, bringing the number of states affected this year to 22. The circumstances under which the virus might have been acquired are not mentioned. Presumably the sensitization campaign carried out earlier in the year provided information to the populace about the danger of contamination of food and the environment by infected rats and how to avoid it. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent hosts (genera _Mastomys_ and _Hylomyscus_) or their excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus, _Mastomys natalensis_ (Natal multimammate mouse), _M. erythroleucus_ (Guinea multimammate mouse), and _Hylomyscus pamfi_ can be seen at https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/27025056/rats1.jpg.
