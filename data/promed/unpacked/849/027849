Dutch authorities have detected a low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI)
strain in a poultry farm in the central region of Gelderse Vallei, the
agriculture ministry said on Tuesday [1 Aug 2006]. "This strain is much
less dangerous than the strain that hit the Netherlands in 2003," the
ministry said in a statement. "But because it might mutate to a more
aggressive form... we have closed the farm and launched regular monitoring."
The Netherlands is one of the world's top poultry exporters and Europe's
2nd biggest producer after France. The statement did not say which strain
exactly was found in the farm. "It's not H5 for sure," said a ministry
spokesman but could not give other details.
The Netherlands was hit by an H7N7 avian flu strain in 2003, which led to
the culling of some 30 million birds, about 1/3 of the Dutch poultry flock.
It also infected around 90 people, including a veterinarian who died.
Dutch authorities have never reported any cases of the highly pathogenic
H5N1 avian flu strain found in several European Union countries.
Dutch veterinarians and scientists believe the 2003 outbreak of the
different H7 strain was caused by wild birds that infected outdoor poultry
in central Netherlands, [after which the disease] spread to the south and
into Germany and Belgium where it raged on a lesser scale.
Since the beginning of 2006, more than 30 countries have reported
outbreaks, in most cases involving wild birds such as swans.

[We are told that the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed, in the
meantime, that the virus strain has been found to be H7. Our sincere thanks
to Jan Braakman for his kind help in obtaining the information. An LPAI
virus strain H7N3 was detected in the UK earlier in 2006. Further details
of the current case in the Netherlands are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
