For the 1st time Japanese researchers have found and identified a tick as carrying the virus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) that has so far caused 8 deaths in the country since the summer of 2012. 15 people have been infected across 10 prefectures ever since the virus was reported in the country in January 2013.

The tick was discovered in a woman in her 60s at a national medical center in Iwakuni city, western Japan. She was hospitalized in early April [2013] and had high fever and slipped in and out of consciousness. She also complained that she found it hard to breathe and was once confined to the intensive-care unit. Her doctors found a 3 millimeter tick on her arm and the researchers at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed that it carried the virus. The tick is the kind that preys on animals in the wild. This virus was first discovered in China back in 2009 but the Health Ministry confirmed that the strain found in the infected patients has genetic origins in Japan. The symptoms for SFTS usually develop within 2 weeks of the initial stage of infection. No vaccine is available at this time but the discovery of the tick might lead to one being developed in the near future.

The Japanese Health Ministry said this week [week of 13 Mar 2013] that it had identified 3 more cases of people infected with a mysterious tick-borne virus. This brings the total number of cases to 8, and while the 1st 5 were all deaths, these 3 people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered.

The virus causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, and symptoms are said to usually develop within 2 weeks [of infection]. There is no vaccine at this time. The virus was first discovered in China in 2009 and until now has been seen as transmitted by mite or tick bites. But no bite marks were found in the people in Japan who died and they had no record of recent travel outside the country. Likewise, the Health Ministry has confirmed that the strain of the virus has genetic origins from Japan, not another country. The 1st death was reported in the summer of 2012 while the others were in the fall, but the identification of the tick-related virus as the cause wasn't made until February [2013]. The Health Ministry is still looking into another 5 suspected cases.

The 3 surviving infection cases all occurred before the summer of 2012 death. The 1st was a man in his 50s from Nagasaki Prefecture who became ill in November 2005, followed by a man in his 80s in Saga Prefecture in August 2010, and a woman in her 80s in Kochi Prefecture in April 2012. The 3 were hospitalized and received treatment, eventually recovering. As the 2nd and 3rd deaths were confirmed, an official from the Health Ministry said that he believed it wasn't necessary to be concerned about the infection spreading across the country. While levels of concern should certainly be kept in check as it is obvious the virus can be treated, it is also clear that the number of identified cases is rising faster than expected.

A woman from Gangwon Province passes away after sustaining tick bite while working in her garden. After reported cases in China and Japan, the 1st death after a bite by a virus-carrying tick has been confirmed in South Korea. Based on a review of research carried out in China, where the disease was first discovered in 2009, the South Korean government and the academic community believe that the fatality rate of the tick-borne virus is 6 percent.

The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported on [21 May 2013] that Seoul National University Hospital recently ran another test on the blood of a patient who had died after contracting a virus in August 2012. This test showed that the patient had been infected with the SFTS virus, the KCDC said. SFTS stands for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (a medical condition in which there are extremely low platelet levels in the blood).

The deceased was a woman in her 60s who had been living in Gangwon Province. She was bitten by a tick while working in her garden in July 2012. About a month later, when she began experiencing a high fever and diarrhea and the tick bite started swelling, she checked into a local hospital. Her high fever showed no signs of abating and she was transferred to Seoul National University Hospital, where she passed away 4 days later.

The doctors who had been treating her had not been able to identify the cause of the disease. They had suspected it might be some kind of fever-causing disease such as trombiculiasis or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), but the tests for these were all negative.

Tests were run on the bodies of 5 people who were suspected of being infected with the SFTS virus, the KCDC reported. These 5 had complained of high fevers, but doctors had been unable to determine what was causing the fevers. Of the 5, only the woman from Gangwon Province was confirmed to have been infected with the virus.

DNA [RNA?, the SFTS virus is an RNA virus] traces from the virus were also found in a recently deceased patient from Jeju Island. The case was suspicious to doctors because the patient's symptoms had been similar to those caused by SFTS, the KCDC said.

It is now still impossible to make a definite diagnosis, but it is very likely that the patient was suffering from SFTS. Kim Yeong-taek, head of the infectious disease division at the KCDC, said that the tests results would be available before long.

Of the other 4 cases that medical institutions had reported to the KCDC on the suspicion that they might be SFTS, 3 were discarded. In the other case, the fact that the symptoms were different led the KCDC to conclude it was a different disease. "The media have been referring to this as a 'killer tick,' but that's not really an accurate expression," Kim said. "We believe that the mortality rate for the disease is around 6 percent, which is similar to the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) that is caused by viruses carried by field mice."

"The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago," said Oh Myeong-don, a doctor of infectious disease and internal medicine at Seoul National University Hospital. "A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media was reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 percent is that at first they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected, and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 percent," Oh said. "While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks."

[The characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described first by Yu XJ et al in a publication in the N Engl J Med. 2011 Apr 21;364(16):1523-32, entitled 'Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China' (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095).

Heightened surveillance of acute febrile illness in China since 2009 has led to the identification of a severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) with an unknown cause. Infection with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ has been suggested as a cause, but the pathogen has not been detected in most patients on laboratory testing. Yu et al obtained blood samples from patients with the case definition of SFTS in 6 provinces in China. The blood samples were used to isolate the causal pathogen by inoculation of cell culture and for detection of viral RNA on polymerase-chain-reaction assay (PCR). The pathogen was characterized by electron microscopy and nucleic acid sequencing, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, and neutralization testing were used to analyze the level of virus-specific antibody in patients' serum samples.

The novel virus was designated as SFTS bunyavirus from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction. RNA sequence analysis revealed that the virus was a newly identified member of the genus _Phlebovirus_ in the family _Bunyaviridae_ . Electron-microscopical examination revealed virions with the morphologic characteristics of a bunyavirus. The presence of the virus was confirmed in 171 patients with SFTS from 6 provinces by detection of viral RNA, specific antibodies to the virus in blood, or both. Serologic assays showed a virus-specific immune response in all 35 pairs of serum samples collected from patients during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. It was concluded that this novel phlebovirus was responsible for the life-threatening illness associated with fever and thrombocytopenia in China. Subsequent work indicates that the SFTS virus is widespread in China in both the human population and domestic animals (especially goats) harboring ticks.

The press reports above suggest that the tick-borne SFTS bunyavirus isolated in Japan is a distinct strain of the virus. - Mod.CP]
