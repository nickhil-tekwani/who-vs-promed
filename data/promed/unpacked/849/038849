On [Sun 19 Feb 2017], 20 people, who were referred from Mehelkuna hospital (Surkhet district) visited outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) for the administration of rabies immunoglobulin. These victims were bitten by a suspected rabid fox in Mehelkuna and Maintada VCDs of Surkhet district of Nepal. This incidence occurred on [Fri 17 Feb 2017] in a 2-hour period, while there was load shedding (power outage). The villagers killed this suspected rabid fox and sent its head for rabies testing (to Central Veterinary Hospital, Tripureswor, Kathmandu).

Unfortunately, at present, rabies immunoglobulin is not available to administer beyond STIDH in Nepal, resulting in more deaths due to rabies, which are, perhaps, underreported elsewhere.

[Our thanks to Dr. Pun for informing about this strange episode. In Nepal, the sylvatic cycle is maintained by wild carnivores living in forest zones, national parks, or wildlife reserves, such as mongooses (family Herpestidae) and jackals (_Canis aureus_). The direct importance of this cycle is thought to be less important than the urban cycle maintained by dogs.

The report indicates it was a fox, not a jackal, the biting canid. In Nepal, besides jackals, there are Bengal foxes (_Vulpes bengalensis_), Tibetan sand foxes (_Vulpes ferrilata_) and red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_). - Mod.PMB
