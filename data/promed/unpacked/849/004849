The agriculture ministry said Saturday [26 Sep 2020] that classical swine fever (CSF) infections have been confirmed at a pig farm in the city of Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, marking the 1st outbreak of the infectious disease among farmed pigs in the country in about half a year.

It is the 1st classical swine fever case at a pig farm in Gunma since the 1st outbreak in Japan in 26 years was confirmed in 2018. The Gunma Prefectural Government will slaughter all of the roughly 5400 pigs at the farm in accordance with the law.

In the prefecture, vaccinations started for farmed pigs in October last year [2019], following the discovery of an infected wild boar. But the animals found with the disease at the affected farm, all piglets, had yet to be vaccinated.

Early this month [September 2020], piglets at the Takasaki farm started to die after suffering from diarrhea, and the number of deaths has reached about 200, according to the prefectural government. The prefecture conducted tests on pigs at the farm following a report from its operator on Friday [25 Sep 2020]. Infections were confirmed in 3 piglets who were each about 70 days old.

Pigs are vaccinated around the time when the antibodies they received from their mothers disappear. The 3 piglets were covered by the vaccination program, but had yet to be vaccinated as they were showing symptoms of diarrhea, according to the prefecture.

The culling of the pigs at the affected farm will be conducted over 3 days from Sunday, with the prefectural government set to get help from the Self-Defense Forces and others for the task.

The prefecture and the central government will jointly work to investigate the infection route. A wild boar infected with CSF has been found around 5 km [3.1 mi] from the Takasaki farm, according to the prefectural government.

[The CSF event in Japan, affecting predominantly wild boar with sporadic introductions to domestic swine holdings, started on 3 Sep 2018. The causative agent, identified as CSF virus strain genotype 2, subgenotype 2.1 was, most likely, introduced from China.

Since its start and as of 25 Sep 2020, 2696 outbreaks, in 18 prefectures have been reported to the OIE, including 2676 wild boar (of which 730 found dead and 1946 shot). A list of the prefectures in which the infected wild boar have been identified is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000035876_20200925_191542.pdf.

On farms, a total of 217 clinical cases have been reported, of which 38 died; the remaining, and all other animals on the farms, were killed and disposed of, totalling 146 683 pigs as of 25 Sep 2020. The most recent follow-up report, no 55, was submitted to the OIE on 25 Sep 2020, notifying 72 new outbreaks (= infected wild boar) in 11 clusters (prefectures); see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=35876. The report includes an interactive map. Cluster 3 in the report refers to Gunma prefecture (3 infected boars: one dead, 32 shot). Gunma is addressed in the news media report above, informing about the spread from wild boar to a pig farm. For the location of Takasaki see the map at https://tinyurl.com/y4r4wjb7.

On 15 Oct 2019, Japan amended the Specific Infections Livestock Disease Control Guidelines for CSF to allow vaccination in domestic pigs in designated prefectures ("vaccination recommended areas"). The vaccination of domestic pigs is practiced in the following prefectures: Aichi, Chiba, Fukui, Fukushima, Gifu, Gunma, Hyogo, Ibaraki, Ishikawa, Kanagawa, Kyoto, Mie, Nagano, Nara, Niigata, Osaka, Okinawa, Saitama, Shiga, Shizuoka, Tochigi, Tokyo, Toyama, Wakayama, and Yamanashi. - Mod.AS
