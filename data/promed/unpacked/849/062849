History of thymoma and yellow fever vaccination
-----------------------------------------------
Yellow fever vaccine has been successfully used to prevent the
disease since 1937. However, reports[1] of yellow fever
vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD), after
administration of 17D-204 and 17DD vaccines, suggest we need to
revisit the vaccine's safety profile, specifically with attention to
host-dependent risk factors.
Since 1996, 9 cases of YEL-AVD, a disease clinically and
pathologically resembling naturally acquired yellow fever, have been
reported in the USA; an additional 14 cases have been identified
worldwide as of July 2004. 14 (61 percent) of these cases have been
fatal. In several cases for which tissue samples were available,
results of immunohistochemistry indicated viral dissemination
throughout the body, including to the liver, lungs, spleen, lymph
nodes, brain, and smooth muscle; however, in many cases, tissue
samples were not available for histopathological review or detection
of virus. In the USA, the reported incidence of YEL-AVD is about 3
cases per million civilian doses distributed; a similar incidence has
been reported in the UK[2]. In a review of reports[1] made since 1990
to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,
<http://www.vaers. org>
a passive reporting system, advanced age was shown to be a risk
factor for YEL-AVD; individuals aged older than 60 years seem to be
at increased risk.
Because of the low incidence of YEL-AVD, identifying risk factors is
challenging. However, 4 (17 percent) of the 23 vaccinees reported
with this syndrome had a history of thymus disease, suggesting that
thymic dysfunction is an independent risk factor for YEL-AVD. One
fatal case of YEL-AVD involved a 67-year-old woman from the USA. The
patient had a history of thymectomy, for a malignant thymoma, about 2
years before vaccination. A 2nd US case involved a 70-year-old man
with a history of hyperthyroidism, myasthenia gravis, and thymectomy
for thymoma 20 years before vaccination. This patient survived. The
3rd individual was a 50-year-old man from Switzerland who had a
history of thymectomy due to thymoma 8 years before vaccination.[1]
He also survived. The 4th individual was a 44-year-old man who
developed fatal YEL-AVD with fulminant hepatic failure after yellow
fever vaccination in Colombia. 2 years previously, he had had a
thymectomy due to benign thymoma.
The thymus is important in regulating the integrity of T-cell and
B-cell function. Thymic tumours are rare and are associated with
various autoimmune disorders. When thymectomy is undertaken to
suppress such autoimmune disorders, administration of serum
immunoglobulin is recommended to protect against infection[3]. In an
adult mouse model[4], immune suppression induced by antithymocyte
serum potentiated lethal yellow fever 17D infection. Thymomas are
also associated with reduced numbers of circulating B lymphocytes and
hypogammaglobulinemia in adults. The incidence of thymoma increases
with age above 40 years up to age 80 years[3], and there is also
thymic involution during normal aging. This suggests that changes in
the thymus may contribute, in part, to the increased risk of YEL-AVD
observed in elderly individuals.
A retrospective study[5] looked at the effect of vaccination with
live viral vaccines in children with DiGeorge syndrome, which is
associated with thymic hypoplasia and diminished T-cell counts. These
children did not have a higher rate of adverse events when compared
with reports in the general population; however, children included in
the study did not have low T-cell counts, and yellow fever vaccine
was not one of the live vaccines assessed in the study.
Yellow fever vaccine provides essential protection to people
traveling to, or living in, areas where yellow fever is endemic or
epidemic. However, health-care providers should carefully consider
the benefits and risks of vaccination for elderly travelers, and
should ask about a history of thymus disorder or dysfunction,
irrespective of age, including myasthenia gravis, thymoma,
thymectomy, or DiGeorge syndrome, before administering yellow fever
vaccine. If travel plans cannot be altered to avoid yellow
fever-endemic areas, people with a history of thymus disease should
consider alternative means of yellow fever prevention, including use
of insect repellents, containing N,N-diethyl- metatoluamide (DEET)
and permethrin, and other behaviors to reduce mosquito bites. [For
countries that demand a yellow fever vaccination certificate, it is
possible for physicians to provide a letter showing that the vaccine
is medically contra-indicated. However, this does not guarantee that
a country will accept such a waiver. - Mod.JW]
We encourage health-care providers to report all cases of yellow
fever vaccine-associated adverse events, so more information can be
gathered about risk factors for YEL-AVD.
