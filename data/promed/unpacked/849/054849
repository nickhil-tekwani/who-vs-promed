The US Centers for Disease Control reports that an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to pork products produced by Long Phung Food Products appears to be over.

On [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C Corporation of Houston, Texas, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might have been contaminated with _Listeria_ bacteria.

Do not eat, sell, or serve recalled products from Long Phung Food Products. The full list of recalled ready-to-eat pork patty rolls is on the USDA-FSIS website [https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-116-2018-release]. Recalled products are labeled with establishment number "EST. 13561" inside the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] mark of inspection.

Recalled pork patty rolls were produced on various dates from [21 May 2018, through 16 Nov 2018]. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide. Recalled pork products should no longer be available in stores but may still be in home freezers.

Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators and freezers where recalled pork products were stored. Follow these 5 steps to clean your refrigerator [see https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html for specifics.]

Retailers should clean and sanitize deli slicers and other areas where recalled pork products were prepared, stored, or served. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sanitizer strength and application to ensure it is effective.

If you develop symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection [see https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/symptoms.html for specifics] after eating recalled pork products, contact a healthcare provider and tell them you ate recalled pork products. This is especially important if you are pregnant, age 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system.

As of [29 Jan 2019], this outbreak appears to be over.

A total of 4 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported from 4 states. _Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [1 Jul 2017, to 24 Oct 2018]. 4 people were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence [see https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/index.html for specifics] indicated that pork products from 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, were the likely source of the outbreak.

[An epidemiologic investigation had identified 4 confirmed cases of listeriosis in 4 states, linked to ready-to-eat pork patties. Whole genome sequencing results of samples collected at the Long Phung Food Products facility showed that _Listeria_ identified in the facility was closely related genetically to _Listeria_ isolated from the ill people. On 20 Nov 2018, 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, recalled ready-to-eat pork products. Listeriosis has a long incubation period, which ranges from 3 to 70 days. 70 days after the product recall on 29 Jan 2019, with no additional cases of listeriosis linked to the outbreak, the CDC declared the outbreak over. - Mod.ML
