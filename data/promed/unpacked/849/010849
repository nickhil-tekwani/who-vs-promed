The number of detected cases of polio among children in Pakistan rose
2 percent in relation to last year [2009]. Expanding vaccination
campaigns is constrained by the remoteness of some regions in
Pakistan, the aftermath of the floods and violence.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has recorded an increased
number of cases of polio among children in Pakistan in recent months.
The news is disheartening considering that it comes despite massive
vaccination campaigns undertaken this year [2010] that have been
estimated to have reached 9 million children.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative describes polio, or
poliomyelitis, as a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. The
virus, coming in through the mouth, attacks the body's nervous system
leading to paralysis in 1/200 cases. The disease affects children
under 5 years old the most, with roughly 50 percent of cases
occurring in children under 3 years old. In [5-10 percent] of cases,
the paralysis will be fatal, owing to the eventual paralysis of
breathing muscles. The vaccine prevents the virus from being able to
replicate and attack the body [presumably taken from

As of 14 Oct 2010, there were 78 cases of polio recorded,
representing a 2 percent increase from 2009. Of these cases, 57 were
recorded in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
These remote areas are home to many children who were missed by
vaccination campaigns. Part of the reason behind the neglect of the
FATA is that the region is prone to more violence, making it
difficult for international aid agencies to reach. Only on Sunday
[?17 Oct 2010], for instance, Pakistani authorities reported the
bombing of 3 schools in the Mohmand Agency, a district of the FATA.
One boys' school and 2 girls' schools suffered damage, but no child
or adult was injured.

Along with Afghanistan, India, and Nigeria, Pakistan is one of the
few countries left in the world where polio remains endemic. All
these countries except Pakistan have made significant progress in
reducing the number of polio cases, as well as in containing the
spread of the most deadly strains of the virus.

Pakistan, however, has been severely affected by the derailing impact
of natural disaster on health and development priorities. Pakistan
still lacks adequate funding to deal with the destruction caused by
the devastating floods that hit the summer [2010]. According to the
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there are
more than 20 million people affected by the floods and about 14
million in need of emergency relief services.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon last week [week of 11 Oct 2010]
called on the international community to inject an additional USD 2
billion into Pakistan relief projects.

[A review of the newswire alerts over the past few days reveals that
this coming Sunday [24 Oct 2010] will be World Polio Day (see
<http://www.eptrail.com/ci_16398109>). What is impressive is that
during 2010, the overwhelming majority of polio cases reported
through the official reporting systems have been associated with
transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) in Pakistan, and those
associated with the outbreak in Tajikistan (with spread to the
Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan) -- the former
representing 12 percent of reported cases to date this year (2010),
and the latter representing 65 percent of reported cases to date this
year (2010).

In the weekly summaries found on the polio eradication case count
weekly update page (available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>) there are the
following important highlights related to WPV activity in Pakistan:
- 10 new cases were reported this week [?week of 11 Oct 2010] (9 WPV1
and one WPV3), located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP -- formerly NWFP)
and Sindh.
- The total number of cases for this year [2010] is 88 (67 WPV1 and
21 WPV3), compared with 62 cases at this time last year [2009] (40
WPV1, 21 WPV3, and one WPV1/3 mixture). The most recent case (WPV1
case in Sindh) had onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2010].
- The 2nd phase of NIDs [national immunization days] was carried out
in the 45 worst flood-affected districts from 11-13 Oct 2010. NIDs
are planned from [8-10 Nov 2010], using trivalent oral polio vaccine
(tOPV), with SNIDs [supplemental national immunization days] planned
for high-risk districts from [13-15 Dec 2010], using bOPV [bivalent
OPV].
