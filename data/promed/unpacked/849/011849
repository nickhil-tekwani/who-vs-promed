"Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses, of the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, cause disease ranging from mild febrile reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses in Equidae and humans. They are transmitted by haematophagous insects, primarily mammalophilic mosquitoes.

"The VEE complex of viruses includes 6 antigenic subtypes (I-VI). Within subtype I there are 5 antigenic variants (variants AB-F). Originally, subtypes I-A and I-B were considered to be distinct variants, but they are now considered to be identical (I-AB). Antigenic variants I-AB and I-C are associated with epizootic activity in equids and human epidemics. Historically, severe outbreaks have involved many thousands of human and equine cases. The other 3 variants of subtype I (I-D, I-E, I-F) and the other 5 subtypes of VEE (II-VI) circulate in natural enzootic cycles. Equidae serve as amplifying hosts for epizootic VEE strains while enzootic VEE viruses cycle primarily between sylvatic rodents and mosquitoes. Enzootic variants and subtypes have been considered to be nonpathogenic for equids, but can cause clinical disease in humans.

"During 1993 and 1996 limited outbreaks of encephalitis in horses in Mexico were shown to be caused by enzootic VEE viruses of subtype I-E. More recently, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Mexico, Central America, and northern and western parts of South America. Human enzootic subtypes reach more broadly into northern Central America and South America." See http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.13_VEE.pdf.

Unfortunately human cases have also been detected in the same area where animal cases were identified (see report below).

"In humans, VEE is usually an acute, often mild, systemic illness. The symptoms caused by endemic and epidemic strains are similar. The initial signs are nonspecific and may include fever, chills, generalized malaise, severe headache, photophobia and myalgia particularly in the legs and lumbosacral region. Coughing, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may also be seen. A macular rash and arthralgia in the wrists and ankles were reported in some epidemics. Mild to severe neurological signs can be seen in a small percentage of affected children, and to a lesser extent in adults over the age of 50 years, but in few healthy adults (for example, less than 1 per cent of symptomatic young adults). VEE usually resolves within 1 to 2 weeks, with acute symptoms subsiding after 4 to 6 days, and deaths are rare.

"In pregnant women, VEE can affect the fetus; fetal encephalitis, placental damage, abortion/stillbirth or severe congenital neurological anomalies may be seen." See http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/easter_wester_venezuelan_equine_encephalomyelitis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
