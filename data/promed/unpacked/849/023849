The crop survey conducted by the directorate of cocoa, arecanut, and
spices development (DASD) has forecast that the output of pepper
during 2008-09 would fall by 10 percent over the previous year due to
erratic weather conditions and disease. The agency conducts an annual
survey of pepper plantations in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
"The combined output in the 3 states is likely to touch 51 000 tonnes
in 2008-09 against 57 000 tonnes in 2007-08," M Thamizh Selvan,
director, DASD, said.

Output is expected to fall by 21 percent in Kerala over the previous
year due to unusual early rains and a plant disease, he said. An
attack of gall wasps devastated plantations in Wayanad district. An
erratic monsoon also affected output in both Idukki and Wayanad districts.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is an important agricultural produce
of India, especially Kerala, where it is known to be affected by
several fungal and viral diseases. Both quick wilt caused by the
fungus _Phytophthora capsici_ and spreading rapidly, and slow wilt
caused by nematodes (_Radopholus similis_ and possibly _Meloidogyne_
species) were reported from this crop last year (2007) in Kerala.
Thus the yield drop reported above may at least in part be due to one
or both of these wilts. For more information on quick and slow wilt
please see the previous ProMED-mail post no. 20070807.2565 and links
listed below.
