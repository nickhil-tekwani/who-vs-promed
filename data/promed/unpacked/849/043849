Summary
-------
Since the introduction of the 2-dose MMR vaccination regime, the
incidence of mumps virus infections has substantially declined.
However, mumps outbreaks have recently been reported from several
countries. Here we report an ongoing mumps outbreak in Germany.
Between 1 Jul 2010 and 31 Oct 2010, 115 infections have been
laboratory-confirmed. Reported complications include one case of
meningitis and 21 cases of orchitis, suggesting a high rate of
complications. We suggest a vaccination campaign for young adults in
northern Bavaria to limit severe mumps infections.

Introduction
------------
Mumps virus infections may have a variable clinical outcome. Most
commonly they lead to fever and parotitis. However, up to 30 per cent
of male adolescent mumps cases develop orchitis. The German Standing
Committee on Vaccination (Standige Impfkommission, STIKO) recommends
that children be vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine within their
1st 2 years of life (between 11 and 14 months and between 15 and 23
months) [1]. Mumps is not a notifiable disease in Germany, therefore
information about mumps cases or outbreaks is scant. In other European
countries, the introduction of a 2-dose MMR vaccination regime
resulted in a strong decline of the number of mumps virus infections
[2-4]. However, resurgent outbreaks of mumps were recently reported
from several European countries [2-11], the United States (US) and
Canada [12-14]. Many of the outbreaks were seen in highly vaccinated
populations, calling mumps virus vaccine efficiency into question
[2-4, 6-9]. Here we report on an ongoing mumps outbreak in Germany.

Methods and Results
-------------------
The Synlab Medical Care Service Centre, Weiden, Bavaria, analyses
laboratory samples from about 40 hospitals and more than 2000
physicians serving outpatients predominantly from northern Bavaria
[15]. In this study, results of serological mumps tests were
evaluated. Data collected between January 2009 and October 2010 were
examined. In total, 1248 serum samples were examined for IgM
antibodies and 4824 samples for IgG antibodies. More than 99 percent
of these samples were derived from Bavarian patients.

Mumps antibody testing of patient sera was performed by using
Enzygnost ELISA (anti-parotitis-virus/IgM and
anti-parotitis-virus/IgG, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products,
Marburg, Germany). Results of IgM ELISA were given as negative,
borderline (equivocal), and positive. Results of IgG ELISA were given
as negative (under 230 U/ml), borderline (equivocal) (230-500 U/ml),
and positive (over 500 U/ml). In the present analysis, acute mumps
infection was assumed when patients were IgM antibody positive or when
patients either showed a borderline IgM antibody test result in
combination with typical symptoms or had detectable mumps virus
ribonucleic acid (RNA).

The German Reference Centre for measles, mumps and rubella virus at
the Robert Koch Institut performed PCR [polymerase chain reaction]
analyses from either throat swabs and/or urine samples. Genotyping of
detected mumps virus was performed as recommended in the Proposal for
Genetic Characterisation of wild-type mumps strains [16].

Clinical data from mumps patients with orchitis were recorded at the
Department of Urology at the St. Josef Medical Centre in Regensburg.
The Department of Urology is a facility of the University of Regensburg.

In the pre-outbreak period from January 2009 to June 2010, the number
of patients infected with mumps virus was low (median per month N = 1
(range 0-3)). However, this number has dramatically increased since
the outbreak started. In July 2010, 6 patients tested positive for
mumps IgM antibodies. In August 2010, 18 patients tested positive, in
September 2010, 22 patients and in October 2010, 32 patients,
respectively. Additionally, in August 2010, 11 patients exhibiting
mumps infection symptoms had borderline IgM test results. In September
2010, this number was 8, and in October 2010, the number was 13.

Furthermore, positive PCR results were obtained from 7 patients. Only
2 of the patients showed IgM antibodies, while all PCR-positive
patients exhibited IgG antibodies (median 14 000 U/ml). Genetic
characterisation of mumps virus detected in the clinical material of 7
cases revealed presence of genotype G.

In total, 115 mumps infections were confirmed positive at the Weiden
Synlab laboratory and at the Robert Koch Institute between 1 Jul and
31 Oct 2010. The median age was 24.5 years (mean 26.8 years, range
14-62 years). However, information on the vaccination status was
available from only 7 mumps patients. One of them was unvaccinated,
one patient had received one dose of MMR, and 5 patients had been
vaccinated twice.

The majority of the infections occurred in the city of Regensburg
(about 135 000 inhabitants) or in the surrounding area. This finding
was most prominent in August 2010, while in September and October
2010, an increasing number of cases were noted in the region located
northwest of Regensburg.

In August 2010, one patient was diagnosed with mumps meningitis and a
2nd case was suspected in November 2010. In total, 21 patients were
treated at the St. Josef Hospital in Regensburg (median age 26 years)
between July and October 2010, resulting in a total of 76 days of
hospitalisation.

Discussion
---------
We give a preliminary description of an ongoing outbreak of mumps
virus infection in northern Bavaria. Similarly to previous outbreaks
in Austria, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands, the present
outbreak affects mainly young adult patients [4, 5, 9,11].

We suppose that the actual number of affected patients is by far
higher than 115 cases, since certainly not every clinical case was
confirmed in our laboratory. Furthermore, the present case definition
in Germany uses positive IgM antibody and/or positive PCR results
[17]. Many patients with clinical symptoms displayed high IgG antibody
titres probably due to prior immunisation or infection. As known from
other viral diseases a viral re-infection is not necessarily
accompanied by a rise in IgM antibodies but rather by an increase of
IgG antibodies. Accordingly, during the outbreak months of July,
August, September and October 2010, the median IgG titres were
markedly higher than those observed in the previous months (January
2009-June 2010). This supports the hypothesis that many mumps
(re-)infections were accompanied by an increase of IgG antibody titre
and not by the formation of IgM antibodies. This may have resulted in
an underestimation in the number of mumps cases.

Absence of mumps virus-specific IgM antibodies in the majority of the
clinical cases, as determined in the current outbreak in Germany, is
concordant with the laboratory data reported by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention from an outbreak observed in a highly
vaccinated population in the USA [12].

In contrast to Germany, mumps is a notifiable disease in Ireland and
the Netherlands, where the collection of epidemiological data from
many patients has been possible. In these populations, the majority of
the patients had been vaccinated, and, at least in the Dutch group,
most patients had been vaccinated twice [9]. Although we could get
only limited information about vaccination status, our data support
the finding that most patients had been vaccinated completely,
indicating that complete vaccination does not prevent mumps infection
in an outbreak situation with absolute certainty.

The current outbreak in Bavaria was caused by mumps virus genotype G.
Previous analyses have revealed that this genotype was associated with
several mumps outbreaks in Europe and the USA [2,5,18,19]. The
possible emergence of a mutant strain of mumps virus has been reported
under the selective pressure of immunisation with limited or no
cross-protection induced by the vaccine strain [20]. A recent analysis
indicated that individuals possessing low levels of neutralising
antibodies may be at risk for breakthrough infections [21]. These
findings underline the importance of investigating whether the current
situation in Germany is due to a high degree of susceptible
individuals or to a breakthrough of a currently circulating wildtype
mumps virus.

In the present outbreak, predominantly young male patients have been
affected. Complications as mumps orchitis have resulted in the
hospitalisation of at least 13 young adult males. The outbreak started
in the city of Regensburg (about 135 000 inhabitants) and its
surrounding area. In September and October 2010, an increasing number
of cases was noted in the region located northwest of Regensburg. Due
to very recent observations, this trend also continued in November
2010, and it seems probable that the outbreak will soon reach the city
of Nuremberg (about 500 000 inhabitants) and surroundings with 1.2
million inhabitants.

Measures taken by public health service in Luxembourg were recently
proven to help in confining a mumps outbreak among the military staff
[5]. Furthermore, a mass-vaccination successfully stopped a mumps
outbreak in Austria [11]. Therefore, it appears highly beneficial to
initiate a vaccination campaign in northern Bavaria.

The analysis of this extensive continuing outbreak of mumps in
Bavaria, Germany raises some interesting questions. Most of the
patients had received 2 doses of (MMR or MMRV) vaccine previously,
indicating that complete vaccination does not always provide
protection against mumps virus infection in an ongoing outbreak
situation such as the current outbreak in Regensburg. It is still
unclear whether this represents a deficiency in the immunising
capacity of the mumps component of the vaccine, or a change in the
antigenicity of the outbreak strain. The latter seems less likely
since the outbreak strain is the ubiquitous G genotype.

Recent observations indicate that the outbreak has continued through
November 2010, and it is likely the outbreak will extend to the more
densely populated city of Nuremberg and its surroundings.
