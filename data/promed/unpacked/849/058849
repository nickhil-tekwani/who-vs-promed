DENGUE - SAIPAN: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
****************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: 20 April 1998
From: ProMED-mail <promed@usa.healthnet.org>

We have heard that dengue is occurring in Saipan and would appreciate it if
someone with information would let us know if this is true, which dengue
virus is involved, whether _Aedes albopictus_ or _Aedes. aegypti_ is
involved, date of first recognition, geographic distribution, whether there
have been cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, etc.
