[On 4 Aug 2020, Russia reported 2 outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 located in Chelyabinsk Oblast; the event is still continuing. According to the epidemiological comments: "A wild duck carcass was found during AI passive surveillance on the lake near the village just before the outbreak started. HPAIv H5N8 was detected in a sample of wild duck carcass". See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=35280.

For this new HPAI event from Russia, the neuraminidase has not yet been typed. There is a high likelihood that these new cases are caused by HPAI H5N8. Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important. - Mod.CRD
