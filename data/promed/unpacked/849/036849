Kids sickened by Anoka County _E. coli_ outbreak
------------------------------------------------
An _E. coli_ outbreak on an Anoka County beach has sent at least 2
children to the hospital, the state health department said Fri, 8 Jul
2005. The outbreak has so far affected children who went swimming on
Coon Lake Beach between 21-23 Jun 2005, the Minnesota Department of
Health said.
Health officials recorded 4 confirmed _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections
associated with the outbreak among children ranging in age from 2 to
13 years. 2 were hospitalized and released, the MDH said. The
children showed symptoms of infection between 1 and 5 days after
swimming in the lake, health officials said.
Symptoms include stomach cramps and diarrhea, health officials said.
Anyone who swam in Coon Lake and develops these symptoms is urged to
seek medical attention. _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections can lead to
hemolytic uremic syndrome and kidney failure. No such cases have yet
been identified with this outbreak, health officials said.
Anoka County closed the beach Fri, 8 Jul 2005. It will reopen when
water tests indicate it is safe, health officials said.

[In the summer, it often happens that cases of O157:H7 disease
are associated with poorly cooked hamburger (or sometimes other food
contaminated with cattle feces) or related to a petting zoo, but
readers should also remember that water -- either drunk or swum in --
may also be a vehicle for transmission. It is not stated, however,
whether _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from the water at the beach or
if just a high coliform count was found. It would be also
interesting to know how close the lake is to any cattle and if there
had been a lot of rain prior to the outbreak. It is still possible
that something eaten by the children may be involved here.
It should be noted that a recent (6 Jun 2005) article in the journal
Pediatrics reported that early recognition of infection with _E.
coli_ O157:H7, with the use of intravenous plasma expansion with
fluids, could lower the risk of developing hemolytic uremic syndrome:

Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections: association with intravenous
volume expansion. Pediatrics 2005; 115:673-80.
