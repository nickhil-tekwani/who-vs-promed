Earlier this month [February 2017], we told you about a recall of dog food that was potentially contaminated with Penobarbital, which is used as a sedative and euthanasia drug. Now, another dog food is being recalled for the same issue.

Against the Grain Pet Food is voluntarily recalling one lot of Against the Grain Pulled Beef with Gravy Dinner for Dogs. The product was manufactured and distributed in 2015, but the use by date is December 2019. Consumers may have this product in their homes.

Oral exposure to pentobarbital can cause drowsiness, dizziness, excitement, loss of balance, eyes moving back and forth in a jerky manner, inability to stand, and coma. No pet illnesses have been reported to the company to date.

The recalled product is Against the Grain Pulled Beef with Gravy Dinner for Dogs in 12 ounce cans. The expiration date is December 2019, and the 2nd half of the UPC number is 80001. The lot number of the recalled product is 2415E01ATB12. It was distributed to independent pet retail stores in Washington and Maryland in 2015. The lot is no longer on store shelves.

If you purchased this product, do not feed it to your dog. Throw it away or take it back to the place of purchase for replacement.

[The previous article from ProMED-mail post 20170207.4820427 indicated that one animal had died. We are not told whether any animals have died or had adverse effects that owners have reported.

It seems this company is a bit late in the recall, but given the long date on the food, it is clearly warranted. - Mod.TG]
