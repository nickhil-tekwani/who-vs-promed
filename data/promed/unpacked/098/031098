Monkeypox - Africa:
The largest cluster of human monkeypox cases ever reported has occurred in
the African rain forest of Zaire, health officials said Thursday. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said at least 92 cases
occurred last year in 12 villages in the Katako-Kombe zone of
Kasai-Oriental. Active cases were still being reported in February of this
year, the agency said.
Monkeypox is related to smallpox but cannot mutate into smallpox. Smallpox
vaccination is usually effective against monkeypox, but vaccination rates
have declined since the illness was eradicated in the late 1970s, the CDC
said. Monkeypox is found in wild animals in the African rain forest.
Previous cases in Zaire have been linked to tree squirrels. The CDC said
that in last year's outbreak the disease may have been transmitted from
person to person.
