Cases of measles among adults were registered for the 1st time during
the last 2 years in Krasnoyarsk. Russian Sanitary Surveillance
[public health] center (SSC) experts identified 5 cases. According to
Natalya Krasnopeyeva, press-secretary of SSC, it is thought that
these adults contracted measles due to contact with migrant laborers
from central Asia. All 5 cases had no contact with each other and
came from different neighborhoods. Consequently the 5 cases have been
designated an outbreak. All 5 are currently hospitalized in an
infectious diseases hospital.

Epidemiologists are now trying to identify people that have not been
vaccinated against measles in childhood [and consequently are
vulnerable and eligible for vaccination].

[A month ago, it was planned to declare Krasnoyarsk as a city free
from measles. Since no single case of measles had been registered in
Karsnoyarsk, the SSC hopes to obtain a document declaring that
Krasnoyarsk is a measles-free city. The chief epidemiologist of the
city, Natalya Bahareva, said in one of the interviews that 36 350
people aged 18-35 had never had measles before they were vaccinated
against measles. And after vaccination only solitary cases had been
registered since 2004; in 2008 as it has been mentioned in the
article there was no case. (see:
<http://www.sgzt.com/sgzt/archive/content/2009/03/010/sections/S002/articles/P06A0003P00>).

However as a consequence of these 5 cases in Krasnoyarsk, it may be
recommended to launch a selective measles vaccination program among
adults. - Corr.VM.
