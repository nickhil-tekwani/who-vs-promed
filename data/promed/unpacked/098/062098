Hawaii moves to stamp out banana virus
--------------------------------------
HONOLULU, May 3 (UPI) -- More than half of the commercial banana crop on
the Hawaiian island of Kauai will be destroyed in order to halt an
infestation of bunchy top virus.
The Honolulu Star-Bulletin said Wednesday that state agriculture officials
had designated an 8-square-mile area on Kauai that includes 60 percent of
the island's crop plus some 2,500 homes, many with banana trees planted in
the yards.
Commercial growers told the newspaper they were given the choice of wiping
out their groves with Roundup herbicide or allowing the trees to die
naturally. Most have decided to use the chemical.
"Unless the chemicals are used, the plants will never completely die. The
virus will remain in the roots and it will be impossible to ever grow
bananas in that area again," said grower Godwin Esaki.
Kauai produces 500,000 pounds of the 21 million pounds of bananas grown in
Hawaii annually.
This is the second appearance of the stubborn aphid-borne bunchy top virus
on Kauai. Two years ago, the virus appeared in a 1-square-mile area on
Kauai's north shore. Herbicide was used to eradicate the banana plants, but
only after state officials had to go to court against several organic
growers who refused to allow chemicals on their land.

[Banana bunchy top virus is transmitted, persistently, by the aphid
_Pentalonia nigronervosa_ Coquerel. Do any of our subscribers in Hawaii
have additional information on why bunchy top has emerged to cause these
production problems in recent years? - P.K. Anderson]
