The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported today [Thu 13 Feb 2020] that 4 people have been referred to their health care providers after being potentially exposed to rabies by a stray cat testing positive for the disease.

The potential exposure occurred on [Mon 10 Feb 2020] when the victims were potentially exposed by a black and white stray cat near the Celanese Road exit off Interstate 77 in Rock Hill, SC. The stray cat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on [Tue 11 Feb 2020] and was confirmed to have rabies on [Thu 13 Feb 2020].

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal, however, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division. It's important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. "To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space," Vaughan said. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

If you believe yourself, family members or pets have come into contact with this stray cat or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Rock Hill Office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Mon-Fri). Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body possibly having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention. To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

This cat is the 1st animal in York County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 13 positive cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged about 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, 4 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in York County.

Contact information for local Bureau of Environmental Health Services offices is available at <www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices>. For more information on rabies visit <www.scdhec.gov/rabies> or <www.cdc.gov/rabies>.

A hiker is being treated after being bitten by a gray fox on Saturday at Sabino Canyon. According to the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD), the hiker was treated for rabies at Tucson Medical Center as a precaution. Wildlife officials say the fox may have been illegally fed.

Foxes are among the commonest rabies carriers, AZGFD says. You can report wildlife feeding to 800-352-0700. You can remain anonymous.

[3] Texas - cow, human exposure

The Texas Department of State Health Services (TXHHS) is notifying people who visited the cattle barn at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo on [11 to 13 Feb 2020] they may need to be assessed for a possible rabies exposure. A cow in the cattle barn developed rabies and was capable of spreading the virus causing it during those dates, according to TXHHS.

The solid black cow was being shown by a student from the Miller Grove ISD in Hopkins County. The cow was only outside of the barn while being shown and loaded and unloaded for transport, said TXHHS. Public health officials have been in contact with the people who were caring for the cow and the animals in nearby stalls, so their risk can be assessed.

Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals. Anyone who put their hand in the cow's mouth or nose or had contact between the animal's saliva and an open wound or mucous membrane like the eyes, nose or mouth should be evaluated for a rabies exposure. Someone in such a situation should contact their health care provider as soon as possible and explain the situation. People who didn't have such contact with the cow are not at risk of contracting the disease.

Rabies can be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms begin, however, once symptoms start, it's almost always fatal. It usually takes between 3 weeks and 3 months for someone exposed to rabies to get sick.

Bexar County residents who visited the cattle barn on those dates and have questions may contact the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District at 210-207-8876. People who live elsewhere may contact their DSHS regional Zoonosis Control office.

[If you have animals, of any kind, or work with them in any way, including showing them, it is critically important to get your animal vaccinated against rabies. Yes, livestock, such as horses, cattle, sheep and goats can be vaccinated against the disease. Dogs and cats should be vaccinated and in many counties it is mandatory, as this protect you and your family and helps break the spread of this disease.

Owners of animals suspecting or knowing an animal has been exposed or is showing clinical signs of rabies should take extra precaution. Call animal control in your area or your local veterinarian.

Bites from any rabid animal can be especially dangerous, but more so from large farm animals as horses and cows can also inflict much damage on the human body with their feet and legs and even by slinging their heads and connecting with a human being. We are small and frail compared to these animals.

A frequent scenario is a rabid skunk comes through the pasture. Our animals are curious about this odd creature and so stick their noses down to investigate. Then they are bitten on the nose or leg, most frequently. We may not know this has happened until clinical signs appear. This may be an abnormal aggression and possibly with slobbering. It may be an uncharacteristic withdrawal from other animals or human care takers. Bats and skunks are quite capable of finding their way into a barn and back out.

Vaccinating your livestock is cheap compared to losing your life or that of a loved one, or a beloved pet. Pets without vaccinations who may get bitten or get in a fight with a wild animal may well be euthanized out of precaution to keep people safe. It is a painful way to lose a companion. Even young puppies and kittens can be infected with rabies.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start.

After a bite or other rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel through the body to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period, and it may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain), the type of rabies virus, and any existing immunity.

The 1st symptoms of rabies in human beings may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2-10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. To date, less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented, and only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the bite/scratch with copious amounts of soap and water. Seek medical attention.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient-assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html. - Mod.TG
