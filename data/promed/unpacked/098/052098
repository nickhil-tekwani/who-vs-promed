Coronavirus has been detected on another mink farm in the Netherlands, bringing the total to 25.

The agriculture ministry confirmed that cubs being prepared for transport on the farm in Westerbeek, Noord-Brabant (North Brabant), tested positive for the virus. All 1100 adult females and their young will be put down. The government tightened transport restrictions for mink on 10 Jul 2020 in the light of previous outbreaks. So far, more than one million animals have been destroyed as a result of coronavirus infections.

The mink farming industry is being scaled down and is due to be abolished in 2024.

[On 16 Jul 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality - Animal Supply Chain and Animal Welfare Department addressed a letter to the OIE updating the situation regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink. Infected farms (n=25) are located in 2 provinces: Noord Brabant and Limburg. More information regarding the mandatory screening, epidemiological investigation and control measures implemented can be found at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Letter_16_July_2020_to_OIE_update_SARS_CoV_2_in_mink_in_The_Netherlands.pdf. - Mod.SF]

[From the mentioned/linked 3rd "COVID-19 in mink" informational letter from the Dutch CVO, Dr Christianne Bruschke, to OIE's director general, Dr Monique Eloit, submitted 16 Jul 2020, some points of interest follow:

1. Out of the 25 farms recognised to be CoV-SARS-2 infected so far, in 8 farms, the owner noticed clinical signs and reported the suspicion to the competent authority. No clinical signs were observed on the majority (17) of the affected farms. They were detected mainly by the implemented "compulsory early warning survey (EWS)" policy: weekly submission of dead animals. The 25th event was identified by (compulsory?) tests of cubs prior to their planned transport. Notably, in the recent COVID-19 event in Spain, no clinical signs were observed (20200717.7584560).

2. The Dutch investigators carried out tracing activities to identify possible sources of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Based on sequence analyses, the route, "infected employee to mink", seems likely for some farms, but, for other farms, the source of infection remained unknown. Sequence analysis of the isolates from mink showed clustering of the viruses, but no clear links were identified between the various farms. As it is important to gain more insight into the routes of transmission, they are, reportedly, about to carry out additional research with respect to possible sources of virus introduction and epidemiological links between the infected premises.

3. A serological screening was carried out in May 2020 in all mink farms "to get an overview of the situation"; this will be repeated later this summer [2020].

4. On some uninfected farms, the owners have problems with the storage of the manure. Owners of uninfected farms are allowed to transport manure under specified conditions.

5. EWS is to be continued the next couple of weeks; future developments are to be similarly published.

The COVID-19 event in the Dutch mink sector and its continued "natural" spread within a susceptible, relatively large animal population have provided a unique opportunity to try gaining new science-based information on virus qualities and spread capacities, including airborne spread. Results are anticipated with interest.

One wonders whether the possibility of using this (still spreading) epizootic in animals for field trials of candidate vaccines has been considered. - Mod.AS
