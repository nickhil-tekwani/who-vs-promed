Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw and Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian issued a statement Wednesday [4 Nov 2020] on the case of variant influenza A (H1N2)v found in a central Alberta patient.

Alberta public health and agriculture officials are investigating after the 1st case in Canada of a rare swine flu variant was detected last month [October 2020] in a central Alberta patient.

The case is only the 27th in the world since 2005, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said in a joint statement Wednesday [4 Nov 2020] with Dr. Keith Lehman, chief provincial veterinarian.

"A confirmed case of variant influenza A (H1N2)v has been detected in central Alberta," Hinshaw and Lehman said in the statement.

"This currently appears to be one isolated case and there is no increased risk to Albertans at this time. This is the only influenza case reported in Alberta so far this flu season." At a news conference Wednesday [4 Nov 2020], Hinshaw said the virus was detected in mid-October [2020] when a patient with influenza-like symptoms sought medical treatment at a hospital emergency department.

"We are taking this seriously, as any human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus needs to be followed up under our international obligations," she said. A sample collected from the patient was tested for influenza and for COVID-19 as part of a routine process, Hinshaw said.

[According to the WHO risk assessment, to date (7 Nov 2020), 26 cases (excluding the above report) of influenza A(H1N2)v have been reported to WHO since 2005. Most of the cases have presented with mild illness, and there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.

WHO advice
----------
Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such changes for risk assessment.

In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.

General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

This report highlights the need for influenza surveillance in humans and animals, as well as in their interface, especially during the influenza season when transmission is high. To ensure early detection, surveillance should focus on geographic areas where influenza A viruses subtypes co-circulate and where human-animal contact is frequent. - Mod.UBA
