Foot & mouth disease in Kibbutz Shamir
--------------------------------------
1. On Wednesday, 29 Jun 2011, a suspicion on FMD was reported from a
cattle fattening unit in Kibbutz Shamir, Northern Galilee, about 9 km
south east of the city Kiryat Shmona. The unit includes about 600
bull-calves of various breeds and ages. Clinical inspection discovered
mild oral lesions in 10 animals aged 10-12 months.

2. From samples, sent to the department of virology at the Kimron
Veterinary Institute [KVI], Beit-Dagan, FMD virus was isolated
yesterday [2 Jul 2011], serotyping not yet accomplished.

3. A zone in radius of 10 km [6 mi] around the outbreak [within
Israel's territory] has been declared infected (a map is included).

4. All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10 km zone are
void.

5. In entrances to the quarantined farms, disinfection drive-through
pools for vehicle wheels should be activated.

[The circular includes additional information and guidelines such as
surveillance activities, revaccinations, special arrangements for
slaughter within the region etc. - Mod.AS]

[It has been reported that vaccinations had been applied in the
affected herd in Oct-Nov 2010 and some vaccinations in Apr 2011. The
mode of vaccination and full coverage of all animals deserve
validation; the efficacy of the vaccine has been demonstrated by the
fact that not a single dairy animal has been (clinically) affected in
Israel since the start, in March 2011, of the epizootic, and in spite
the fact that in several cases such animals were held close to
affected young stock.

The fattening unit of Kibbutz Shamir, close to the Lebanese border,
has been infected several times in the past. One of the strains
isolated there in the past has become a vaccine strain ("Asia 1
Shamir").

We are informed that 6 (serotype O) isolates, sampled in Israel from
cattle and sheep between 30 Apr and 30 May 2011, have already been
sequenced by the WRLFMD; their publication is expected soon. An
earlier sample (23 Mar 2011) was genotyped by WRLFMD as topotype
ME-SA, genotype/strain PanAsia-2ANT-10 with the most close reference
virus being 'O/IRN/88/2009'.

The outbreak in Shamir is to become Israel's 15th since the start of
the epizootic in March 2011. Serotyping results are expected soon,
most probably similar to the 14 1st outbreaks, namely FMDV serotype
O.

The location of Shamir, Hazafon district, adjacent to the Lebanese
and Syrian borders, can be seen at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Shamir.html. There is a dense
wild boar population in the vicinity of Shamir. Results of tested
samples, in case performed, would be of interest.

The location of the 1st 2011 outbreak is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345;
the 13 later outbreaks are indicated in
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529.
