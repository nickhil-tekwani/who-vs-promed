Publix [supermarket chain] is recalling ground beef products sold this summer [2018] after 18 cases of _E. coli_, mostly in Florida, can be traced to the beef, according to the USDA. The list of counties that received the tainted beef did not include Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach or Monroe counties. But it did include Brevard; Charlotte; Citrus; Collier; DeSoto; Flagler; Hernando; Highlands; Hillsborough; Indian River; Lake; Lee; Manatee; Marion; Orange; Osceola; Pasco; Pinellas; Polk; Sarasota; Seminole; St. Lucie; Sumter; and Volusia.

The list of products, which were sold from 25 Jun 2018 through 31 Jul 2018, includes ground chuck; ground chuck burgers; gourmet burgers (Jalapeno & Cheddar, Pimento & Cheese, Bacon & Cheddar, Bacon & Fried Onion, Blue Cheese, and Swiss & Mushroom); seasoned ground chuck burgers (Badia, Mesquite, Montreal, and Steakhouse); meatballs (Bacon & Cheddar, Bacon & Fried Onion, Blue Cheese, Jalapeno & Cheddar, Swiss & Mushroom, and Spanish); Meatloaf (Seasoned and Grillers); sliders (Bacon & Cheddar, Bacon & Fried Onion, Ground Chuck, Blue Cheese, Jalapeno & Cheddar, and Swiss & Mushroom); and stuffed peppers.

This is a class 1 recall, defined by the USDA as "a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death." Unless frozen, the products should have already been consumed or tossed. The USDA and Publix worry is about what's in home freezers across the counties above.

"Food safety is our top priority. We have been working closely with various federal agencies as we share the common goal of maintaining food safety and public health. We urge our customers to make sure they no longer have ground chuck products purchased in the affected Florida counties from 25 Jun through 31 Jul 2018 in their freezers," said Maria Brous, Publix media and community relations director in a company website statement. "Customers should dispose of the product or bring it in for a full refund."

People can become sick 2 to 8 days after eating the contaminated meat. Most _E. coli_ [the enterohemorrhagic cases related to Shiga toxin producing strains - Mod.LL] issues deal with _E. coli_ O157:H7. This is _E. coli_ O26, a similar strain. "Most people infected with O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting," the USDA said. "Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but rarely, some develop a more severe infection.

"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is uncommon with the O26 infection."

Publix Super Markets Inc. recalls ground chuck products due to possible _E. coli_ O26 contamination
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Publix Super Markets Inc., a Lakeland, Florida, retail grocery store chain is voluntarily recalling an undetermined amount of ground beef products made from chuck that may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O26, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 30 Aug 2018.

The ground chuck items were purchased by consumers from 25 Jun 2018, through 31 Jul 2018. The following products are subject to recall: https://tinyurl.com/y96wsd2h

These items were shipped to Publix Super Market retail locations in the following Florida counties: https://tinyurl.com/yck46ylb

On 16 Aug 2018, FSIS was notified of an investigation of _E. coli_ O26 illnesses. FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health and agriculture partners determined that raw ground chuck was the probable source of the reported illnesses. The epidemiological investigation identified 18 case-patients, predominantly from Florida, with illness onset dates ranging from 5 to 25 Jul 2018. Traceback information indicated that case-patients consumed ground chuck products purchased at various Publix Super Markets that was supplied by a yet-to-be determined source. As this investigation further develops, FSIS will continue to work with the supermarket, suppliers and public health partners, and will provide updated information should it become available.

_E. coli_ O26, like the more common _E. coli_ O157:H7, is a serovar of Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). People can become ill from EHECs 2-8 days (average of 3-4 days) after exposure to the organism.

Most people infected with EHEC O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. Most people recover within a week, but rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, is uncommon with EHEC O26 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F [71 C]. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature (http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ). Consumers should take proper precautions when handling raw meat products. Proper hand washing after handling raw meat, poultry and eggs can greatly reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination to other foods and kitchen surfaces. It is important to prevent cross-contamination by washing counter tops and sinks with hot, soapy water.

Media with questions can contact Maria Brous, Publix Super Market's Director of Media and Community Relations, at (863) 680-5339. Consumers with questions can contact Publix Super Market's customer care department at 1-800-242-1227 or visit their website at http://www.publix.com/contactus [the site is not fully available outside the USA].

Florida county map: https://www.mapofus.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FL-county.jpg

The FSIS report states that not all cases were identified in Florida.

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. Five (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.
