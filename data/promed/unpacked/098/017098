Farmers have warned walkers to clean up after their pets after cows contracted a deadly parasite spread by dogs. It comes after dairy cows aborted 11 calves on a farm in West Yorkshire.

The disease is caused by a single-cell parasite called _Neospora caninum_, which lives in both dogs and cattle but only reaches full maturity and reproduces in its canine host. Once transmitted to cattle, it can result in abortion or the birth of premature, impaired or infected calves. There is no vaccine and no treatment, and the only way of eliminating neosporosis from a herd is to cull infected animals.

The farm in Barkisland has experienced few cases over the last 3 years, but the situation reached a critical point recently when 15 heifers aborted their 1st calves in the last few months and 11 cows aborted calves in the last 3 weeks.

NFU regional livestock adviser Richard Potts said estimates showed 12.5 per cent of abortions in dairy cattle in England and Wales could be attributable to neosporosis. "Although it is rare, it is not insignificant," he said.

"We appreciate that generally people know very little about it and have little thought that their dog might carry the parasite, especially as there is no obvious impact on the dog itself. However, they can unwittingly spread it to cattle, where the results can be devastating, and that's why it is important for people to clean up after their pet when out walking in the countryside, especially on pasture land."

Mr Potts added that if dog waste is left in situ, not only can cattle contract the parasite from grazing, but it can also potentially get into grass silage. He said: "In that instance, the risk of spreading the disease to many more animals is significantly increased."

[_Neospora caninum_ is a protozoan parasite of animals. Until 1988, it was misidentified as _Toxoplasma gondii_. Since its 1st recognition in dogs in 1984 and the description of the new genus and species _Neospora caninum_ (Apicomplexa: Eimeriina: Sarcocystidae) in 1988, neosporosis has been detected in various species of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses and deer. Neosporosis belongs to the most frequently diagnosed causes of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide. Furthermore, _N. caninum_ infections in dairy cows may also be associated with premature culling and decreased milk production.

In general, _N. caninum_ is very similar in structure and life cycle to _T. gondii_, with 2 important differences: (i) neosporosis is primarily a disease of cattle; dogs and related canids are the definitive hosts of _N. caninum_, whereas (ii) toxoplasmosis is primarily a disease of humans, sheep, and goats; felids are the only definitive hosts of _T. gondii_.

Although antibodies to _N. caninum_ have been reported, the parasite has not been detected in human tissues. Thus, the zoonotic potential is uncertain.
