Some horses at Turfway Park will undergo another series of tests
Wednesday after officials euthanized a horse infected with equine
herpes Saturday.
Horses in Barn 26, where Coupe Aux Marrons was housed, tested
positive for being exposed to the virus. None that have the virus
showed symptoms, according to track officials.
"We have reports that each of those horses appears to be in
satisfactory condition with no negative effects resulting from
exposure," stated Dr. Robert Stout, a Kentucky state veterinarian
with the Department of Agriculture. Those horses will be tested again
Wednesday.
Officials found no evidence the virus spread outside Barn 26.
Officials from the Florence raceway, Kentucky Department of
Agriculture, Kentucky Horse Racing Authority and Kentucky Horsemen's
Benevolent and Protective Association met Monday to discuss the
track's herpes outbreak. Park officials announced new requirements to
prevent further infections. Beginning Wednesday, all horses shipping
to or from Turfway Park must show health certificates issued within
24 hours.
Beginning 11 Jan 2006, all horses providing pony-to-post services or
shipping onto the grounds must show proof of inoculation against
equine herpes. The inoculation must have occurred within 90 days, but
no sooner than 4 Jan 2006.
"These steps, while perhaps inconvenient, will continue to provide
confidence to our horsemen and other racing jurisdictions that we are
taking whatever steps necessary to ensure the safety of these
animals," stated Turfway Park president Robert N. Elliston.
Horse racing resumed Monday after the holiday weekend.
This is not the first herpes outbreak at Turfway Park. 80 horses were
quarantined in March 2003 for 3 weeks -- just days before the Lane's
End Stakes, a Kentucky Derby prep race -- after 3 contracted equine
herpes.

[Infection with Equine Herpesvirus is also known as Rhinopneumonitis.
It may present as a severe respiratory infection, but it may also
cause a neurological disease, or abortion in pregnant mares. There is
a vaccine for it. The immunity conferred by the disease or the
vaccine is relatively short. Horses on the show or racing circuit are
often vaccinated every 6 months. - Mod.TG]
