Superior Lettuces Fend Off 2 Destructive Viruses
-----------------------------------------------
Iceberg lettuce ranks as one of America's top-5 favorite veggies.
However, this delicately flavored, slightly sweet crisphead and its
relatives -- the romaine of Caesar salads, the softer textured leaf
lettuces, or the creamy butterheads like Boston and bibb -- are
vulnerable to attack by an impressive array of stealthy viruses and
other natural enemies.
But 5 kinds of superior iceberg lettuces, developed several years ago
by Edward J. Ryder of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), are
today still holding their own against attack by 2 of these daunting
villains: big vein virus and lettuce mosaic virus. A world-renowned
lettuce breeder, Ryder, now retired, did the work while based at the
ARS Crop Improvement and Protection Research Unit in Salinas, California.
In 2004, the plants became the 1st publicly available iceberg
lettuces to boast resistance to both diseases. That's why lettuce
breeders and seed companies in California and elsewhere were quick to
request samples of the tiny black seeds.
Dual-resistance enhances survival because a lettuce field can easily
be besieged by both viruses at once. That's according to research
horticulturist James D. McCreight, who is in charge of ARS research at Salinas.
Equipping lettuce plants with genes that enable strong, natural
resistance is still the most economical, eco-friendly way to defend
vulnerable plants from the viral diseases.
Lettuce big vein gets its name from the unhealthy, enlarged
appearance of veins in infected lettuce leaves. These lettuces may be
bushy-looking or undersized.
The likely culprit is Mirafiori lettuce big vein virus, which makes
its way to lettuce roots via a soil-dwelling, fungus-like microbe.
Lettuce mosaic, caused by a virus of the same name, results in
stunting and unattractive mottling. Green peach aphids can spread the
virus as they move about a lettuce field, sipping plant juices.

Most isolates of Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) can infect and are
seed-borne in cultivars containing the mo1 gene. A reverse
transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based test was
developed for the specific detection of LMV-Most isolates. Based on
the complete genome sequences of 3 LMV isolates belonging
respectively to the Most type, the Common type and neither of these 2
types, 3 different assays were compared: (i) presence of a diagnostic
restriction site in the region of the genome encoding the variable
N-terminus of the capsid protein, in the 3' end of the genome, (ii)
RT-PCR using primers designed to amplify a cDNA corresponding to a
portion of the P1 coding region, in the 5' end of the genome and
(iii) RT-PCR using primers designed to amplify a central region of
the genome. The assays were performed against a collection of 21
isolates from different geographical origins and representing the
molecular variability of LMV. RT-PCR of the central region of the
genome was preferred because its results are expected to be less
affected by natural recombination between LMV isolates, and it allows
sensitive detection of LMV-Most in situations of single as well as
mixed contamination
LMV-Common and LMV-Most are 2 seed-borne types of Lettuce mosaic
virus (LMV), genus Potyvirus. LMV-Most, but not LMV-Common, overcomes
the resistance afforded to lettuce by 2 recessive genes, mo1 1 and
mo1 2. An RT-PCR-based assay thought to be specific for LMV-Most also
amplified LMV-Tn2, previously typified as LMV-Common. The sequence of
selected regions along the genome indicated that LMV-Tn2 is a natural
recombinant between LMV-Most and LMV-Common isolates, with a putative
recombination site located within the P3 coding region. This is the
1st evidence of a naturally occurring LMV recombinant isolate.
SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of lettuce mosaic vary greatly. Leaves of plants that are
infected at a young stage are stunted, deformed, and (in some
varieties) show a mosaic or mottling pattern. Such plants rarely grow
to full size; head lettuce varieties infected early fail to form
heads. Plants that are infected later in the growth cycle will show a
different set of symptoms. These plants may reach full size, but the
older outer leaves will be yellow, twisted, and otherwise deformed.
On head lettuce, the wrapper leaves often will curve back away from
the head. Developing heads may be deformed. In some cases brown,
necrotic flecks occur on the wrapper leaves.
COMMENTS ON THE DISEASE
There are several sources of the lettuce mosaic virus. Since the
virus is seedborne in lettuce, infected seed is a primary way of
introducing lettuce mosaic to fields. The virus can infect numerous
crops and weeds, thereby creating reservoirs of the virus. Lettuce
mosaic virus can also be vectored by aphids, which spread the virus
within a lettuce field and introduce it into lettuce fields from
infected weeds and crops outside the field.
MANAGEMENT
Cultural Control
A lettuce mosaic control program is a good example of an integrated
way of controlling a plant disease. Plant lettuce seed that has been
tested for the virus and that contains no infected seed/30 000 seed
tested (Imperial and Monterey counties mandate via ordinance that
only tested, clean seed can be planted in the county). Remove
potential virus reservoirs (see lists below) by practicing good weed
control within and outside lettuce fields, and by plowing down
harvested lettuce fields in a timely manner. A lettuce-free period
during winter months helps break the virus cycle (again, some
counties mandate such periods via county ordinances). Good aphid
management should be practiced. Some resistant varieties are available.
Lettuce big-vein is a soilborne viral disease characterized by vein
clearing and leaf shrinkage, resulting in plants of poor quality and
reduced marketable value. The disease commonly occurs at temperatures
below 20 C, typical of temperate climates. Recently, Mirafiori
lettuce virus (MiLV), a possible ophiovirus, has been found to be the
causal agent of the disease, whereas the historically associated
Lettuce big-vein virus (LBVV, genus Varicosavirus) causes only a
latent infection (Roggero et al., 2003). No synergism has been
observed between these 2 serologically unrelated viruses, although
both are transmitted by the chytrid, _Olpidium brassicae_. MiLV has
been detected in samples from several European countries, USA and
Japan. Mixed infection by both MiLV and LBVV are common in samples
from lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) crops in northern Italy and France
(Roggero et al., 2003). Molecular sequences for both viruses are now
available (Sasaya et al., 2002; Van Der Wilk et al., 2002).
During recent years, typical big-vein symptoms have been observed in
Sao Paulo State, Brazil on various lettuce cultivars grown both
directly in soil or hydroponically. Symptoms were observed mainly
during the cooler season, with day temperatures ranging from 18 to 22
C and night temperatures from 10 to 16 C. Samples collected in
different areas of Sao Paulo State (Biritiba-Mirim, Embu-Guacu,
Guarulhos, Itapecerica da Serra, Mogi das Cruzes, Monte Alegre do
Sul, Vargem Grande Paulista) were tested by DAS-ELISA with antisera
specific for MiLV and LBVV (Roggero et al., 2003) and examined by
electron microscopy (EM) using negative staining for the presence of
viruses. Most samples with big-vein symptoms tested positive by ELISA
for both viruses and a few only for one of the 2. Using EM, only LBVV
virus particles were observed; virions were observed in only a few
samples, confirming the difficulty in EM visualization of both LBVV
and MiLV particles. These surveys in this subtropical area of Brazil
had similar findings to those in the temperate climate of Europe,
where both viruses are commonly found. The presence of _O. brassicae_
was already reported in Brazil (Lin, 1979). This is the 1st report of
the occurrence of lettuce big-vein disease and the associated viruses
MiLV and LBVV in a subtropical area.
Most batches of lettuce seedlings taken over an 18-month period from
a vegetable nursery were infested with lettuce big-vein disease
(LBVD) with an up to 31 percent incidence. Using lettuce seedlings in
bait tests, contamination was detected at the nursery in potting mix
composted for different periods and in dirt from under the benches,
and at the bark supplier's site in this ingredient of the potting mix
and waste "bark" from the ground. In a field experiment in which
lettuce seedlings from the infested nursery were inoculated with
infested roots or left uninoculated before transplanting into
subplots on land with no history of lettuce planting, disease
progress followed a sigmoid curve with the former but an almost
straight line with the latter. However, significant clustering of
symptomatic plants was found only in the subplot with the
uninoculated plants. Leaf symptoms of LBVD were more severe in
lettuces infested later, whereas symptoms in those infested earlier
were obvious initially but then became milder. The disease impaired
formation of hearts: the proportion of symptomatic plants that lacked
hearts was 24-36 percent when leaf symptoms 1st appeared 5-7 weeks
after transplanting but 14-16 percent after 8-9 weeks. When leaf
symptoms 1st appeared at 5-6 weeks, there was a fresh weight loss of
14-15 percent for heads (all plants) and 39 percent for hearts
(excluding plants without hearts). When leaf symptoms 1st appeared 7
weeks after transplanting, there was no significant yield loss for
heads and only a 14 percent loss for hearts. At 8-9 weeks, there were
no significant yield losses for heads or hearts.
