Shanghai reported on Saturday [13 Apr 2013] a new case of H7N9 bird flu infection, the country's 49th such case so far, local health authorities said. The 56-year-old patient is husband to a woman who had been confirmed with H7N9 infection and died on 3 Apr 2013.

Health experts, however, say there is not sufficient evidence to show that the husband has acquired the virus from his wife.

A 7-year-old girl in Beijing was infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu, the 1st such case in the Chinese capital, local health authorities said Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

The case was confirmed following a test by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention early on Saturday [13 Apr 2013]. The child is being treated at the Beijing Ditan Hospital and is in stable condition, Zhong Dongbo, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, said in a press briefing. The girl developed flu symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, and headache on Thursday [11 Apr 2013] morning. She was brought to the Beijing Ditan Hospital to seek medical treatment around noon and was then hospitalized for lung infection.

The child received the drug Tamiflu as well as intravenous drips on Thursday [11 Apr 2013] night and later was transferred to an intensive care unit after her condition worsened. After oxygen therapy and other treatment, her suffocation and coughing symptoms eased markedly, and her body temperature fell to 37 C [98.6 F] from 40.2 C [104.36 F], a spokesman with the Beijing Ditan Hospital said.

Two people who have had close contact with the child have not shown any flu symptoms, a spokesman said.

[According to Chiu Chui-chang, a bureau section chief at the Council of Agriculture, the H7N9 virus in birds shows only weak toxicity. Beijing's 1st H7N9 case might be the result of bird-to-human transmission because it is the season for many migratory birds to pass through the area on the way to their summer breeding grounds in the north, Chiu said.

East China's Zhejiang province reported on Saturday [13 Apr 2013] 2 new cases of H7N9 bird flu infection, bringing the country's total to 48, local heath authorities said.

Two more people in east China's Jiangsu
------------------
Province were confirmed infected with a new strain of bird flu, the provincial health authorities said Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

The number of H7N9 infections in China has been raised to 46 to date [13 Apr 2013], with one reported in Beijing Saturday and all the other 45 in the eastern parts of the country. The 1st known human infections of the deadly virus have claimed the lives of 11 people, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The 2, a 77-year-old woman from Nanjing and a 72-year-old man from Changshu, are in critical condition and are under emergency treatment at hospitals in Nanjing and Suzhou, the provincial health department said in a statement.

A total of 16 people who have had close contact with the two have not shown signs of flu symptoms.

[5] WHO risk assessment
Date: Sat 13 Apr 2013
Source: World Health Association (WHO), Influenza human and animal interaction [edited]
http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html


As of 13 Apr 2013, a total of 49 confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported to WHO by the China National Health and Family Planning Commission. Among these cases, the ages range from 4 to 87; 15 are female. Eleven persons have died, and the majority of the additional cases are considered severe. Of the 49 cases, 6 have been reported today [13 Apr 2013], and further investigations are taking place. The cases have been reported from 3 provinces: Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and 2 municipalities, Beijing and Shanghai. All locations are in eastern and northern China.

Two confirmed cases have been associated with possible family clusters in which one and 2 additional family members, respectively, developed severe pneumonia. Close contacts of confirmed cases and health care workers caring for cases have been monitored for infection. So far, among the contacts who have been tested by polymerase chain reaction, none have been shown to have the infection.

This is the 1st time human infection with this influenza subtype, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, has been detected. Previously, sporadic cases of human infection with other influenza A(H7) viruses have been reported. Those cases were associated with outbreaks of infection in poultry in other countries. These earlier influenza A(H7) human infections generally resulted in mild influenza illness with some conjunctivitis.

Genetic and laboratory characterization of the 1st 3 of these H7N9 viruses isolated from humans indicate that:
- the virus contains a group of avian influenza virus genes from 3 different avian influenza viruses;
- to date, genetic analyses of the isolates have shown certain changes, including amino acid substitutions associated with increased affinity to alpha 2-6 receptors, which suggest that the H7N9 virus may have greater ability to infect mammalian species, including humans, than most other avian influenza viruses;
- there are sequence variations among the genes of 3 isolates that suggest there has been more than one introduction of this virus from animals into humans;
- these viruses are expected to be sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant to the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine;
- the isolates have a haemagglutinin structure that is associated with low pathogenicity in birds.

There are several gaps in critical information at this time, including the animal reservoir(s) in which this virus is circulating, the main exposures and routes of transmission for how human infections have been acquired, and the current scope of the spread of this virus among animal and human populations. Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses have now been isolated from poultry (including ducks) and pigeons in the live bird markets in some areas of China, but whether other potential reservoirs of this virus may exist, including in other domestic and wild bird species and mammalian species such as pigs, has not yet been determined clearly.

So far, this virus has not been associated with reports of severe disease in poultry.

Risk Assessment:
-----------------
This initial risk assessment, which has been prepared in accordance with WHO's published recommendations for rapid risk assessment of acute public health events(1) will be updated as further information becomes available.

What is the risk of the occurrence of further cases in the affected areas of China and other areas?

The epidemiology of this virus among animals, including the main reservoirs of infection among animals and the extent of geographic spread, is not yet established. However, it is likely that most human H7N9 infections so far are associated with infection among yet to be determined animals and that further human cases of infection should be expected.

What is the risk of human-to-human transmission?

There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, the 2 possible family clusters suggest that limited human-to-human transmission may occur where there is close contact between cases and other individuals, as occurs in families and, potentially, healthcare settings. Moreover, the genetic changes seen among these viruses suggesting adaptation to mammals are of concern, and further adaptation may occur.

What is the risk of international spread?

At this time, there is no information to indicate international spread of this virus. However, it is possible that an infected person, who may or may not have symptoms, could travel to another country. However, if the virus cannot sustain human-to-human transmission, as appears to be the current situation, then extensive community spread is unlikely. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[As of 6 PM local time in Beijing, the total number of human cases of H7N9 infection is 49, with 11 fatalities reported. Cases have occurred in 3 Provinces -- Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang -- and 2 municipalities -- Shanghai and now Beijing. There are also 2 possible instances of human to human transmission, one involving a single contact and the other involving 2 contacts. Further information on these events are awaited.
