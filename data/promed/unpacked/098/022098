A court in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan has found 21 medical
workers guilty of causing an HIV outbreak, which has so far killed 10
children. At least 119 children and babies contracted the virus after
receiving treatment in hospitals in Shymkent. The judge said that the
accused had acted recklessly, and that corruption and malpractice led to
the outbreak. The HIV outbreak was 1st discovered last year [2006], but the
number of cases is still rising. The night before the verdict, another
child died. He was 2 years old.
The judge announced that all 21 medical workers on trial were guilty. But
for each defendant he announced a different punishment. Medical workers
accused of trading illegal blood were sentenced to 8 years in prison.
Several doctors were sentenced from 3 to 5 years. But the former head of
the regional health department and 4 of her deputies had their sentences
suspended. Many said that this was not the kind of justice they were hoping
for, and added that they would appeal.
An investigation into the outbreak found that many children had unnecessary
and often multiple blood transfusions. Medical equipment was often not
sterilised properly. One boy, who is now aged 2, contracted the virus after
receiving a blood transfusion prescribed to treat pneumonia. It is unclear
why the suspected infected transfusions affected only children.

[It must be presumed that the practice of treatment of illness in children
by transfusion of blood, together with inadequate screening of blood
products, has contributed to this unfortunate incident. It is to be hoped
that the practice will now be abandoned. - Mod.CP
