This report in the Chronicle states that the latest count showed 316 cases.
Although harvesting oysters in Galveston Bay stopped June 25, the cases had
been increasing by more than 50 per day.
Texas Department of Health (TDH) spokesman Doug McBride said Monday that
the voluntary recall of oysters was having an effect, and so they are no
longer accepting illness reports over the 800-telephone number. He asks
that those who think raw oysters made them sick call their local health
department, who will forward the information to TDH.
This outbreak has surpassed the US record of 209 cases, which was
established last summer in the Pacific Northwest and was also associated
with oysters. While one fatality was reported in the Pacific Northwest
outbreak, none has been associated with this Galveston Bay outbreak.
McBride was quoted as saying three or four people have been hospitalized
however.
The health department continues to monitor the water and oyster population
to determine when it will be safe to resume oyster harvesting.

flush Galveston Bay and reduce the salinity of the water in the oyster
bays. - Mod.MHJ
