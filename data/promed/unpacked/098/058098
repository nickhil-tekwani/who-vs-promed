Tests find bird flu at 4 markets in Jersey; strain is not same as deadly
Asian virus
-------------------------------------------
Bird flu [Avian Influenza] has been found at 4 live chicken markets in
North Jersey, days after outbreaks at farms in Delaware led to the
destruction of 80 000 birds and restrictions on USpoultry imports in 8 nations.
The findings are not unusual for the state's live poultry markets, and the
strain of avian influenza found, unlike the one suspected of killing 18
people in South East Asia recently, is not known to be harmful to humans,
state officials stressed. Nevertheless, it was the same strain found in
Delaware, and large chicken producers said it was the latest indication
that the virus threatening to devastate the US poultry industry festers in
New Jersey poultry markets.
"Our theory is those live markets in northern New Jersey and New York City
keep it circulating," said Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council,
which represents the country's largest poultry producers. "It backtracks to
small farms and from there it spreads."
Nancy Halpern, the state veterinarian, disputed that, saying the markets
likely got the virus from one of the many farms and distributors who supply
them. "We believe the virus is coming to them," Halpern said of the
markets. "They can be doing everything right and still have a market that
tests positive."
As far as the risk to humans, health officials said there is a chance --
albeit a small one -- that the weak strain of bird flu could mutate into a
stronger form that could harm humans. "There is some risk of it mutating to
a more pathogenic form," said Clifton Lacy, a cardiologist and commissioner
of the state Department of Health and Senior Services. "The key is
stringent sanitary measures on farms and culling the flocks."
Bird flu usually resides in waterfowl. Now and then, though, it finds its
way onto chicken farms and decimates a region's poultry production, as is
happening now on the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware.
A flock of 12 000 birds at a farm in Delaware was destroyed on Saturday, a
day after 2 of its birds tested positive for the virus. On Tuesday, an
outbreak was found 5 miles away at a Perdue Farms grower, and 73 800 more
birds were depopulated. Delaware officials quarantined 75 farms within a 6
mile radius and began more testing.
The first farm regularly supplied live poultry markets in the New York City
area, Delaware officials said. New Jersey has 35 live chicken markets, in
cities such as West New York, Jersey City, Passaic, and Clifton. They are
popular among some Hispanic immigrants who prefer freshly killed poultry.
Halpern said the state tested the markets in late January 2004, as it
typically does every winter. So far, results are in for about half the
markets, with 4 positives, Halpern said. She would not identify the
markets. It is likely at least one bird was infected at each market, though
the virus also might have been found on cages, Halpern said. The finding is
not unusual, Halpern said.
The state typically finds bird flu at about 40 per cent of the markets,
despite strict controls designed to prevent the virus from reaching them,
Halpern said. She attributed that to the fact that the markets buy chickens
that distributors have collected from many farms.
"We can't necessarily control what happens in sister states," Halpern said.
"Beyond that I think the markets serve a purpose. The people who utilize
them like them. They're also regulated by local health departments so that
they're clean and sanitary." When a market is found to be infected, the
proprietor is instructed to sell off all birds, then sanitize the cages and
other equipment before reopening.
A find of bird flu is a much more costly proposition for farmers, who must
depopulate all their chickens. Though scientists do not fully understand
how bird flu spreads, it is believed to travel on equipment, people's
shoes, migrating wild birds, and perhaps even through the air.
Lobb, whose Washington DC based group represents Perdue, Tyson, and other
major producers, said he believes the virus festers on poorly controlled
farms, makes its way to the live markets, then travels to other farms on
cages or in trucks. "It's kind of a loop that keeps this virus
circulating," Lobb said. "We take responsibility for our product, and we
would like to see the live markets and farmers who supply them take
responsibility for their product."
US chicken producers export more than 15 per cent of their birds annually
for more than a billion dollars in revenue. In the wake of the findings in
Delaware, China banned all US poultry imports, and Russia, the largest
market for US poultry, banned all poultry from Delaware. Japan, Korea,
Mexico, Poland, Singapore and Malaysia have placed various restrictions on
US poultry. The strain found at the first farm in Delaware and in New
Jersey markets is called H7N2. The tests are not completed on the strain
found on the second farm in Delaware.
A more serious strain -- H5N1 -- has been blamed for 18 human deaths in
South East Asia in recent weeks. Barring unusual mutations of the virus,
the flu found in birds in New Jersey is not a great concern, Lacy said.
"The people of our state should not be especially concerned," Lacy said.
"They should continue to monitor the news."
