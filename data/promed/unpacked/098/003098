To rebound from the impact of lethal yellowing disease [LY], the Antigua and Barbuda government has put plans in motion to import 100 000 coconut seeds from Costa Rica. The Plant Protection Unit [PPU] assures that they have been thoroughly vetted to prevent a recurrence of the devastation over the past years. LY, first discovered on the island in 2012 [ProMED post 20120801.1223614], has decimated the coconut population. During the worst of the outbreak, oxytetracycline [was used for LY] control. However, that was rather costly and many trees were deemed too far gone. The seeds from Costa Rica are to "produce trees resistant to [LY], grow about 6 feet [1.8 m] tall, and begin producing fruit after 3 years".

Consideration was given to acquiring seeds/seedlings/saplings [previously], most recently from Suriname. PPU opposed that idea amid concerns of pests being introduced. Chief Plant Protection Officer, Dr Janil Gore-Francis, said, "We have done risk assessment [for] the seeds from Costa Rica via the US. They must have import permission, be certified [and] unsprouted, coming through under very stringent conditions." She also [said] that LY is not as prevalent as in the past. "I guess palms that have some sort of tolerance or just have not been infected are what remains now." Some of the seeds have already arrived, but there is no indication as to when the entire bunch will be on the island.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (16SrIV; _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae strains) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. LY-type diseases like Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) in Ghana, the "maladie de Kaincope" in Togo, and Awka disease (lethal decline, LD) in Nigeria, previously included in the 16SrIV group, have been reclassified as the new group 16SrXXII (Nigerian coconut lethal decline group, _Ca._ P. palmicola strains; see link below).

Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities.

While LY affects many palm species, at least for coconut palm susceptibility may vary between cultivars or even within cultivars, depending on the region where they grow. Symptoms can be suppressed by tetracycline treatments (as mentioned above), usually applied as trunk injections. The antibiotic inhibits multiplication of the pathogens but does not eliminate them. Therefore, treatments need to be repeated regularly. Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids (ProMED post 20070522.1643) is causing great concern.

In Antigua, large scale death of coconut palms was first noted early in 2012 and attributed to a "mystery insect pest"(ProMED post 20120801.1223614). The possibility was suggested that the insect infestation may have consisted of infectious LY planthopper vectors having arrived from elsewhere in the region. Importing seed nuts from central America via the US, with LY present in both areas, poses a considerable risk. Even with strict controls and certification of the nuts, as well as their parent trees, excluding infectious vector insects will require a large effort. It is not clear from the report above which resistant cultivars are being imported.
