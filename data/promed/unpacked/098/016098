[Subscribers are again encouraged to refer to the FAO EMPRES Watch (September 2016; 35: 1-6) entitled "H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4 detected through surveillance of wild migratory birds in the Tyva Republic, the Russian Federation -- potential for international spread," available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6113e.pdf, where from which the following commentary is quoted:

"The detection of clade 2.3.4.4 virus in the south of the Russian Federation represents an early warning for countries to the west of this location that this H5N8 virus can, once again, emerge in the Afro-Eurasian flyway systems as waterbird breeding and moulting seasons progress and are followed by the fall migration to the overwintering areas. The findings at Lake Ubsu-Nur correspond broadly with the breeding season of resident species and onset of moulting and postbreeding aggregation of waterfowl.

"This repeated pattern whereby Goose/Guangdong/96-lineage H5 is detected in wild birds in the southern Russian Federation (Ubsu-Nur or other Siberian wetlands to the west of Ubsu-Nur) can trigger HPAI occurring in other wild birds and poultry populations later in the season (from September to December onwards). Countries bordering the Caspian and Black seas (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Ukraine) and possibly also Western Europe, should be on high alert given virus spread to these places in the winter of 2005/06 (Ottaviani et al, 2010) and subsequent years (Sharshov et al, 2012)."

To date, HPAI H5N8 has been confirmed in Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Sweden, Finland, Romania, and France (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/H5N8/situation_update.html). - Mod.CRD
