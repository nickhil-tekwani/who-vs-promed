A Franklin County resident has fallen victim to hantavirus, the fifth person
to die in Idaho from the disease. The victim contracted the virus after
handling material contaminated by dried rodent urine or feces. Hantavirus is
carried by deer mice.
"It usually occurs when someone is in the garage or cabin or someplace with
poor ventilation doing some cleanup," said Angela Markham, disease
intervention specialist with the Southeastern District Health Department.
"When they start pushing a broom around, the dust becomes airborne and
that's when people breathe it in."
Since 1993, 15 people in Idaho have been infected with the disease, 8 in
southeastern Idaho. Five have died. Markham said half of the reported cases
nationwide have been fatal. "It has a very rapid onset. If somebody is
going to die from hantavirus, they die rather quickly, usually of
respiratory arrest."
Those infected generally begin to feel flu-like symptoms within 4 to 10 days
of coming into contact with the virus. They may experience a high fever,
nausea and pain in the joints and back. There is no [specific medical
treatment for the virus. But several treatments can help victims survive the
attack.
