The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday [7 Sep
2010] that 25 cases of indigenous dengue fever were recorded last
week [week of 30 Aug 2010], the highest weekly number this year. All
25 cases were in southern Taiwan. In the last 6 months, 80 cases of
indigenous dengue fever have been recorded in Taiwan, it said. The
number of imported cases also rose in the last week, bringing the
total to 182 so far this year, the CDC said. CDC statistics show that
23 cases of imported dengue fever were recorded last week and the
total number for August was 66, the highest in a single month since
1998. "These numbers basically tell us that the dengue fever
situation, in terms of both indigenous and imported cases, is quite
serious," said Dr Kuo Tsung-wen of the CDC.

As of August this year [2010], dengue cases all over the country
reached 62 503 with 465 deaths. In the same period in 2009, cases
reached only around half of the number of cases this year which is 33
102 with 350 deaths. Western Visayas tops the list with 11 896 cases
among other regions in the country, while Negros Occidental has 3158
cases and Bacolod City 1526 cases recorded. The Provincial Health
Office records revealed dengue cases affect mostly those aged 1-19
years old and are mostly males.

"Dengue is an all year round disease and peaks 2 months after the
onset of the rainy season which is also the time when school children
go back to school," [said] Dr Ernell Tumimbang. Tumimbang also
appealed to the public to clean their surroundings and destroy
breeding grounds of mosquitoes. The Provincial Health Office is also
coming up with a comics type information education materials that
will appeal to children and will be easily understood in far flung
areas in the province.

(<http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=17615>) indicated
that Department of Health data show that dengue cases nationwide have
now reached 69 594 from January to August (2010), almost double the
34 997 cases in the same period last year (2009). Dengue-related
deaths rose to 501 as of August (2010) from 369 year on year. The
spike in number, the department noted, was blamed on the long dry
spell that forced people to store water -- the breeding site of the
dengue virus vector mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. Despite the increase in
cases, the DoH has not yet decided to declare a health emergency.

More than 2300 residents of Buri Ram province have caught dengue
fever. The Ministry of Public Health is deploying village health
volunteers to help combat the disease in local communities. Buri Ram
Provincial Public Health Officer MD Sompong Jarungjittanuson stated
that the outbreak of dengue fever in the province remained a cause
for concern mainly due to ongoing rainfall and widespread inundation
in the area during this period.

According to the record, the number of people infected with dengue
fever within Buri Ram has reached 2354 since the beginning of this
year [2010] with one fatality. Children between 5 and 10 years of age
are at the highest risk, followed by those between 10 and 14 years
old. Areas with highest infection rates are Nang Rong, Phutthaisong,
Na Pho, Ban Mai Chaiyaphot, and Lahan Sai districts.

MD Sompong hence suggested parents dwelling in the mentioned
districts to closely monitor their children to keep them safe from
mosquito bites. As for preventive measures against the spread of the
disease, he said relevant authorities in the province as well as
village health volunteers were being dispatched to remove all
stagnant waters which could become mosquito breeding grounds. The
teams are also educating local residents on how to eradicate mosquito
larvae and prevent the disease outbreak.

The Cycling Federation of India (CFI) has decided to shift its
Commonwealth Games camp from Delhi to Patiala following an outbreak
of dengue fever among the cyclists. Delhi is reeling under dengue
attacks since June [2010] and nearly 1500 cases have already been
reported in local hospitals. While 25 participating nations have sent
letters to the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (CGOC)
enquiring about the disease, a host of countries including Australia
and Malaysia have recently issued travel advisories for their
citizens coming to Delhi for the Games.

[Summary]
---------
In July and August 2010, 2 cases of dengue fever were diagnosed in
travellers returning from Benin to France. These 2 cases exemplify
that dengue fever should be considered in febrile travellers, even
those returning from areas where the infection is not usual.

[Perhaps it would be more accurate to indicate that reporting of
cases is unusual, rather than that cases per se are unusual in
countries where surveillance is limited to absent. Clinical and
details and laboratory results of these 2 cases of dengue virus
infection acquired in Benin can be seen at the source URL above.

Interestingly, there was another case of dengue virus infection
acquired in Benin and diagnosed and treated in Japan. Dengue virus
type 3 was detected by real-time PCR and isolated by cell culture
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100826.3010).

Just to give the situation about dengue surveillance data since 1
Jan-5 Sep 2010: total of suspect cases of dengue 355. Some of these
cases were confirmed.

Concerning week 35 (30 Aug-5 Sep [2010]) -- health facilities
notified 7 cases (5 from concelho [municipality] do Tarrafal, 1 from
concelho of Santa Catarina (in Santiago island), and 1 from concelho
de Sao Filipe (Fogo island).

In Praia around 5 suspected dengue cases are tested daily and the
results are negative.

The previous week (34) only 1 case was notified from (Santa Catarina).

Last month (August 2010) 15 cases were notified (6 from Praia, 3 from
Santa Catarina, 1 from Tarrafal , 4 from Sao Filipe, and 1 from
Mosteiros.)

The health facilities strengthened the surveillance of fever cases
and the antivector fight. Other partners are the field to fight
mosquitoes and to give preventive information to the population.

classical [dengue fever] and 2 deaths from DHF this year [2010].

According to the official sector representative, Joy St. John, the
island experienced an alarming increase in people, especially
children, who have attended [medical] consultations, emergency rooms,
or are hospitalized, suffering from the disease in the past 3 weeks,
when there have been heavy rains.

The high temperatures and frequent rains registered in the region
since June [2010] have also favoured the reproduction of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito in the Caribbean islands of Dominica, Trinidad and

Due to an alarming increase in cases of dengue fever in Honduras this
year [2010], Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
has launched an emergency intervention in Tegucigalpa, capital of the
Central American country where the majority of cases have been
reported. MSF is supporting local health services with a 3-pronged
approach focusing on medical care, vector control, and community
education. Such dengue intervention is relatively new for MSF. More
than 80 children have already been treated in an emergency pediatric
ward set up by MSF. Mobile teams are also working with the local
health authorities to identify and eliminate sources of mosquitoes in
4000 households in the Tegucigalpa area.

The Ministry of Health has been responding to the high number of
cases of dengue by making more hospital beds available and setting up
specialized units in health centers in outlying areas. Despite this,
the main referral hospital has still been overwhelmed by the upsurge
in patients. Until recently, children with dengue fever had all been
transferred to the referral hospital, as the decentralized units were
only receiving adult patients. To ease the overcrowding, MSF has set
up an emergency ward at the San Felipe Hospital, on the outskirts of
Tegucigalpa, where children under 15 with symptoms of the disease can
be cared for. Already, on its 2nd day of activity, the 23-bed ward
was working at full capacity.

In Honduras, cases of the simple form of dengue have significantly
increased in 2010 compared to the previous year, with more than 50
000 cases already reported. However, the most alarming feature of
this outbreak is the prevalence of hemorrhagic dengue, with more than
1500 cases reported and 160 deaths -- a massive 1850 percent increase
from 2009.

In addition to providing medical care, MSF is fighting the dengue
outbreak with vector control. This means tackling the mosquitoes that
spread the disease. Along with the Ministry of Health's vector
control body, MSF mobile teams are at work in the Manchen settlement,
on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa, where the highest rates of affected
people have been reported. So as to raise awareness and educate
people on how to keep stored water free from mosquito larvae and
avoid rubbish accumulating, an MSF team is going from house to house
through the neighborhoods, looking for potential sources of infection
and explaining how to stop mosquitoes breeding and spreading the
virus. The challenge is to change people's habits and social customs,
and to involve them in the fight against dengue. The MSF teams going
from house to house also apply a larvicide called Abate: this process
uses a chemical to treat any standing water and prevent mosquito
larvae from hatching.

Contrary to the information released during recent weeks by the
Minister of Health, Eugenia Sader, and representatives of this
agency, the index of infected individuals in the country remains on
the rise. To date, it is estimated that [the number of dengue cases]
exceeded that of the peak of the decade of 84 000 registered cases in
2001.

According to Epidemiological Alert no. 148, published by the Network
of Scientific and Medical Societies of Venezuela (RSCMV), up to
[epidemiological] week no. 33 (15-21 Aug [2010]), the cases continue
to increase, reaching 79 335, 3 times more that that reached during
the same period last year [2009]. These unofficial data were obtained
by the Network.

For her part, the Minister of the Ministry of Health [MoH] pointed
out this Tuesday [7 Sep 2010] the reduction of more than 300 cases
during this past week, emphasizing 5 states specifically (Bolivar,
Monagas, Cojedes, Portuguesa, and Barinas), which, she said, "are now
out of the epidemic and are now in the so-called safe zone."

[The explanation for the discrepancy between the MoH figures and
those of the Network are not given. It will soon be clear if the
epidemic is declining or not.

[14] Brazil (Minas Gerais)

The number of dengue cases has tripled in Minas Gerais and went from
83 000 in 2009 to about 240 000 just in the first 8 months of 2010.
Already 54 people died compared to 13 last year [2009]. Currently, 20
municipalities have 60 percent of the number of registered cases.

The Minas Gerais capital [Belo Horizonte] leads with more than 65 000
infected individuals. The prefecture created a specific program to
counter the dengue advance, "Operation Hunting the Dengue Mosquito",
and maintains a health agent for each group of 814 buildings.

Given the risk of an epidemic, the Minas Gerais government tries to
get help from the Armed Forces, with the release of troops to combat
foci of the vector mosquito.

[My personal experience is that the use of soldiers for this purpose
does not present a good cost/benefit relationship. The efficiency of
the work of those who were neither trained nor have experience is
bad. - Mod.LJS]
