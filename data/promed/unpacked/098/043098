According to the Fars News Agency from 31 May 2018 (https://bit.ly/2su3Q9z):

"Mohammad Mahdi Goya, head of the Iranian CDC, denied the deaths of 10 people from CCHF, saying that since the beginning of the current year [2018], 24 people have suffered from the disease, and 2 died. One of them was a 72-year-old man with a background blood disorder. He added that the person was in one of the rural areas of Bandar Abbas and was under treatment for a week and eventually died the previous morning."
