Herd of sheep infected with brucellosis
---------------------------------------
In the village of Ruminu in the municipality of
Hrvace [southwest Croatia, northeast of Split,
adjacent to Bosnia-Herzegovina], a new outbreak
of brucellosis has been discovered. According to
the Hrvace veterinary office, a herd of sheep has
been infected, and all 220 sheep and 80 lambs
will be put down.

[This information, if verified, might mean a
reintroduction of _Brucella melitensis_ into
Croatia 13 years after its eradication;
confirmation or otherwise is anticipated.
According to Croatia's annual report to the OIE
for 2003, the country has been regarded free of
caprine and ovine brucellosis (_B. melitensis_)
since 1993 (1992 indicated as the last year of
occurrence).
Additional data are available in Taleski et al's
paper "An overview of the epidemiology and
epizootology of brucellosis in selected countries
of Central and Southeast Europe", Vet Microbiol.
2002 Dec 20;90(1-4):147-55.
According to said paper, Croatia was free from
brucellosis from 1961 until 1990, when an
outbreak of _B. melitensis_ was reported among
sheep and goats in Istra. During the following 2
years, outbreaks were reported in 2 additional
regions, namely in goats in the region of
Varazdin (1991) and in goats in the region of
Bjelovar (1992). There were also 2 serologically
positive sheep in 1993, but no outbreak was
confirmed.
1091 clinical cases of Malta fever have been
reported in humans between 1990 and 2000. 96 of
these cases have been laboratory-confirmed by the
isolation of _B. melitensis_ (biovar not
specified). 90 of the isolations were carried out
during the outbreak in sheep and goats in
1991-1992. The remaining cases, 1 in 1996 and 5
in 2000, were detected in patients from Bosnia
and Herzegovina hospitalised in Croatia.
The report also includes data on the presence of
_B. suis_, biovar 2, in Croatia; for further
details, see the paper. - Mod.AS]
