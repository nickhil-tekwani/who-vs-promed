Hundreds of pigs have died from African swine fever [ASF] in Bali, authorities said on Wednesday [5 Feb 2020], marking the Indonesian holiday island's 1st recorded outbreak, after the virus claimed some 30 000 hogs in Sumatra. Ida Bagus Wisnuardhana, Bali's agriculture and food security agency chief, said that nearly 900 pigs succumbed to swine fever since mid-December [2019]. "The results are positive for African swine fever," Ida told reporters, referring to tests performed on the dead animals.

The string of deaths had appeared to stop over the past week, Wisnuardhana said, adding that Bali would go ahead with a pork festival on Friday [7 Feb 2020] in a bid to ease concerns over the outbreak. The announcement comes after Indonesia said this week it would temporarily ban some livestock imports from China over fears about the coronavirus, which has killed almost 500 people in China, where it originated.

In December [2019], Indonesian officials said tens of thousands of pigs died from ASF in North Sumatra province.

While Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation, the country also boasts a small Christian majority in North Sumatra, and Bali is a Hindu island whose signature dish is roast pig.

ASF cannot be transmitted to humans, but it is almost 100% fatal in pigs and has devastated swine herds in China and elsewhere in Asia.

Unlike China, where huge herds are reared and processed in factory-like conditions and outbreaks can be contained, in Indonesia most pigs are raised in backyard sites or on small farms and sold at markets where the virus can easily spread.

Outbreaks of ASF have also been recorded in Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and East Timor.

[Since the ASF outbreak started on 4 Sep 2019 in Indonesia's North Sumatera Utara Province, about 42 000 pigs reportedly died. This refers to a total of 857 ASF outbreaks in backyard farms, in 18 of 33 districts in the province: Batu Bara, Central Tapanuli, Dairi, Deli Serdang, Humbang Hasundutan, Karo, Langkat, Mandailing Natal, Medan, North Tapanuli, Pakpak Bharat, Pematang Siantar, South Tapanuli, Samosir, Simalungun, Tebing Tinggi, and Toba Samosir.

FAO's most recent weekly update of the ASF situation in Asia, published on 6 Feb 2020, which includes the above data, also mentioned the "more than 1000 deaths of pigs reported in 9 districts/cities of Bali province"; at the time of publication, the results of the (ASF-positive) lab investigation were not yet available. The following section from the FAO update, "Actions taken by Indonesia", is herewith copied:

"On 19 Dec 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) recommended the public to: isolate sick animals and equipment, and de-stock pig pens for 2 months; put pigs that died from ASF in a bag which must be buried immediately by officials; refrain from selling/consuming pigs/carcasses affected by ASF; and concluded that the main strategic steps to prevent ASF from occurring are through the application of biosecurity and good management of pig farms, as well as strict and intensive monitoring of high-risk areas. It advised provinces with high pig populations -- for example, Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, West Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, Bali, Central Java, Central Sulawesi, Riau Islands, and Papua, to be alert to the possibility of ASF disease. MoA suggested enhancing awareness raising with farmers and advocacy to local leaders regarding the ASF threat. The Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services (DG PKH) has formed 102 Emergency Posts with Rapid Response Teams at all levels, in response to the Minister of Agriculture Decree (No.820/Kpts/PK.32/M/12/2019, 12 Dec 2019). ASF control in North Sumatra has been carried out in an integrated manner by a Joint Team involving regional agencies (the Rapid Response Team, the Medan Veterinary Service, the Provincial Food Safety and Livestock Service, the Office of Public Works, the health service and the police). On 30 Dec 2019, the MoA and the regional government of Humbang Hasundutan Regency, North Sumatra Province collaborated in conducting a 'Safe and Healthy Pork Eating Campaign', advising that ASF was not a zoonotic disease, and pork and its products were safe for consumption. The government through the MoA has also allocated a budget of IDR 5 billion (USD 357 938) to support ASF control, carcass disposal and containing the spread of the virus. The director-general of animal husbandry and animal health, Ministry of Agriculture, instructed local experts to develop an ASF vaccine following an outbreak of the disease in North Sumatra in 2019, aiming to provide a solution for ASF control and prevention."
