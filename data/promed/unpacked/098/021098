[1] China - Increase in deaths

The Chinese mainland saw a faster increase in deaths from [pandemic
2009] A/H1N1 influenza in the past weeks, according to the Ministry of
Health. A total of 74 deaths were reported in the week from 23 to 29
Nov 2009, stated a notice issued on the Ministry's website on
Wednesday [2 Dec 2009]. Reported deaths in the previous 2 weeks were
28 and 51, respectively.

About 91 percent of all the flu cases reported last week were of the
[pandemic] A/H1N1 strain, compared with 89.8 percent in the previous
week, the notice stated. The Ministry advised the public to keep warm
in the cold weather, wash hands frequently and keep rooms ventilated.

As of Mon [30 Nov 2009], more than 27 million people nationwide had
been inoculated with China-made A/H1N1 vaccine, according to the
Ministry. Four deaths had been reported after vaccination, and 3 had
been confirmed as unrelated to the vaccine, while the cause of the
other is not yet clear, the Ministry said.

[2] Japan - Abnormal behavior

The Health Ministry has reported that 151 flu patients up to age 17
demonstrated abnormal behavior between late September and mid-November
[2009], including acting violently or uttering gibberish. Most of the
cases are believed to have involved patients with swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection], and the strange behavior is
thought to have occurred regardless of whether the patients were given
the drug Tamiflu, according to one report submitted to a research
group at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

The number of cases, coming in a period of less than 2 months, is
already close to the total of 179 seen in all of last year's [2008]
[seasonal] flu season. A Ministry official said cases this year have
been on the rise in line with the spread of the new [pandemic] H1N1
flu, and young patients should be watched carefully for at least 2
days after developing a fever.

Of the 151 patients, it is known that Tamiflu was used in 26 cases,
Relenza in 36, and neither of them in 16. Tamiflu has been banned for
use among teenagers out of fear it may cause abnormal behavior, though
it can still be used in some situations.

[This is an unusual observation, not previously reported from
elsewhere. Although the abnormal behavior was observed most frequently
in pandemic H1N1 virus infected patients, it cannot be caused
specifically by this virus, as the phenomenon was reported in the
preceding year before the appearance of the pandemic virus. It would
be interesting to know if similar behavior patterns have been observed
in other communities before and/or after the appearance of the
pandemic virus. - Mod.CP]

[When reading the case reports on encephalitis, encephalopathy and now
"abnormal behavior" following infection with the pandemic H1N1 2009
influenza virus, this moderator can't help but remember medical dogma
in the past that linked infection with the 1918 influenza virus and
neurologic disease such as encephalitis lethargica and parkinsonism.
A review of the literature today presents a different picture where
that association is now at best controversial, with the main focus
being a lack of evidence for any such association. Perhaps there will
be some good prospective cohort studies to address these issues.

[3] USA (NM) - Native Americans
Date: Wed 2 Dec 2009 [edited]

Swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] is killing
Native Americans in New Mexico at a higher rate than other ethnic
groups, and a top state Department of Health official says chronic
disease and the distance many Native Americans have to travel to
medical care could be part of the reason.

Native Americans make up 10 percent of New Mexico's population but 20
percent of the state's swine flu deaths. Mike Landen, deputy state
epidemiologist, said a number of factors may explain the incongruity.
"We know American Indians [Native Americans] have higher rates of
diabetes in New Mexico, and that may partly contribute to what we're
seeing," he said. "We also know American Indians have higher poverty
rates as a group than other population groups. We also know that in
the West, American Indians may be living in relatively remote places
with longer distances to medical care. All of these may be possible
explanations."

Reports in the past also have pointed to higher influenza death rates
among minorities. New Mexico reported 40 swine flu deaths through last
week, 8 among Native Americans. Five of the Native American victims
were adults, Landen said. Three of those adults had diabetes and a 4th
had another underlying health problem. One of the children who died
had asthma. The other 3 victims did not have any risk factors, "but
that has been true of some swine flu deaths in the general population
as well," he said.

Landen said a paper in the 1970s showed higher death rates among
Native Americans from pneumonia and influenza, and a paper published
in Alaska this year [see ProMED-mail report: Influenza pandemic (H1N1)
2009 (118): USA (AK) ethnicity 20091201.4108] found higher death rates
for pneumonia and influenza among Alaska Natives than among whites.
Pneumonia and influenza often are tracked together in death statistics.

New Mexico health officials plan to target Native Americans in the
state with school-based vaccination clinics once the state accumulates
enough vaccine for such clinics, Landen said. The Health Department
has ordered 334 860 doses, which have been arriving in small amounts
and are being distributed to public health offices statewide.

[Previously, it was reported that Native Americans (and also Asians
and Pacific Islanders) living in the state of Alaska were more
severely affected by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection than the
rest of the population -- see 1st ref. below. Since Native Americans
living in either Alaska or New Mexico are similarly disadvantaged, it
is difficult at present to determine to what extent ethnicity, rather
than demographic or socioeconomic factors, is a determining factor. At
least geographical location can be excluded. - Mod.CP]
