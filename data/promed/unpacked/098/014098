A Comment on the Validity of SARS Diagnostic Tests
--------------------------------------------------
Watchfulness and caution are important. However, is too much weight being
placed on the lab tests?
Do we have any good idea of the sensitivity and specificity of these
tests? Perhaps they may be helpful in an outbreak. But what is the
positive predictive value for a sporadic case with no epidemiological link
to other cases and with nonspecific symptoms that may be similar to many
other viruses? Turning the health care system upside down for a cold isn't
appropriate either.

Viral Etiology of Acute Respiratory Illnesses in Patients with Suspected
SARS in Switzerland
--------------------------------------------------

Most acute viral respiratory illnesses share clinical features with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and detection of the SARS-associated
coronavirus may be negative in the course of the disease. It is thus of
interest to identify other viral infections to ensure a better assessment
of the epidemiological situation and avoid unnecessary isolation and
contact tracing.
Patients considered potential SARS cases in Switzerland were tested
systematically for 10 different respiratory viruses. RT-PCR for the
SARS-associated coronavirus was negative in all cases. In contrast, other
respiratory virus infections were identified in 62 percent of cases
(21/34). Influenza was the most frequent, being recovered in 14 cases (41
percent); other viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. A negative
coronavirus RT-PCR, together with a positive result for another respiratory
virus and a consistent clinical course, made it possible to avoid
unnecessary isolations and contact tracing. Our findings are also
consistent with the absence of large outbreaks of SARS in Europe during
this period.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has provided a case definition for
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on travel history (or
contact with a known SARS case) and a spectrum of clinical symptoms in
persons presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness. It is within the
aims of this definition to be highly sensitive and thus allow prompt
identification of cases. However, due to its lack of specificity, this
strategy has several limitations and may result in an inaccurate
description of the epidemiological situation, particularly in
low-prevalence countries. Indeed, many common acute viral respiratory
illnesses, such as those caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,
parainfluenza or human metapneumovirus, share clinical features with SARS.
Furthermore, the spectrum of the disease following SARS-associated
coronavirus infection is not yet fully established, and self-limited
respiratory tract illnesses not fulfilling WHO criteria are likely to
occur. Methods for the detection of SARS-associated coronavirus have only
been partially validated, and RT-PCR specific assays may be negative in the
course of the disease. For these reasons it is important to diagnose other
viral aetiologies in patients with suspected SARS, to avoid both
unnecessary investigations and quarantine.
We present here the results of virological investigations in potential SARS
patients in Switzerland. Patients identified as potential SARS cases
according to WHO criteria, and those not fulfilling all the criteria but
presenting with acute respiratory illness and either a recent travel
history in a country or in an affected area or a documented contact with a
suspected SARS case, were tested for a wide range of viruses in upper
respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swabs). Nasopharyngeal specimens
were inoculated for virus culture on 6 different cell lines (human
fibroblast, A549, MDCK, LLC-MK2, Rita and Vero cells) in tubes and
incubated at 2 different temperatures (37 deg C and 33 deg C). RNA was
extracted from 200 ml of each specimen using 400 ml lysis buffer (HCV
Amplicor Specimen Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostics Corporation,
Indianapolis, ID). Retrotranscription was performed using the SuperscriptTM
II RNase H­ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Switzerland) and random
primers (dN)6 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) for 60 minutes at 42 deg C.
Real-time TaqmanPCR (ABI Prism 7900 HT, Applied Biosystems, Switzerland)
was performed for detection of respiratory viruses using specific primers
and probes validated in our laboratory.
Screening for the presence of the following viral RNA genomes was conducted
(target gene in brackets): influenza A (M gene) and B (haemagglutinin
gene), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N gene), parainfluenza 1 and 2
(haemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene), human metapneumovirus (polymerase
gene), rhinovirus (5 non-coding-region) and enterovirus (5 non-
coding-region), and the SARS-associated coronavirus (polymerase gene). The
following primers and probe were used for SARS-associated coronavirus
detection: forward 5-TCACCGCGAAGAAGCTATT-3; reverse
AGTTGCATGACAGCCCTCTACA- 3; and probe 5CGTTCGTGCGTGGATTGGCTTTG-3 based on
available sequences of the polymerase gene [7, 8]. In preliminary
experiments this assay proved capable of detecting fewer than 10 RNA
copies/mL. Positive and negative controls were included in each run.
In Switzerland during the first 6 weeks of surveillance following the WHO
SARS alert, we identified 34 subjects with a median age of 36 years (range
2 to 81), comprising 20 males and 14 females. On the basis of WHO criteria,
3 cases were probable SARS, 16 were suspect cases, and in 15 the diagnosis
of SARS was considered, but the WHO criteria were not met. All patients
recovered without suffering severe disease. RT-PCR for detection of the
SARS-associated coronavirus proved negative in all subjects (median day 4
of illness, range 1 to 9). In contrast, other respiratory virus infections
were identified in 62 percent (21/34). Among the 19 suspected or probable
SARS cases according to WHO criteria, a virus was identified in 11 (59
percent). In the overall population influenza viruses were identified in 14
cases (41 percent), rhinovirus in 3, respiratory syncytial virus in 1,
parainfluenza 1 in 1, human metapneumovirus in 1 and adenovirus in 1.
RT-PCR for enterovirus and parainfluenza 3 were all negative. Among the 21
positive cases, 11 were identified by RT-PCR only, 2 by cell culture only
(parainfluenza 1 and adenovirus), and the remaining 8 by both methods
concomitantly.
Our study showed that all subjects with suspected SARS in Switzerland
tested negative for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. However,
following extensive testing, a viral aetiology was documented in the
majority of cases. Although a viral aetiology was likely in most of the
remaining cases, we failed to identify a virus. This limited sensitivity
was related to several reasons including the delay between the onset of
symptoms and the time of sampling, and the type of the specimen.
As some recent observations suggest that RT-PCR may be negative in the
course of SARS, it is essential to provide an alternative diagnosis to SARS
if a negative result is obtained. In our series a negative RT-PCR together
with a positive result for another respiratory virus and a consistent
clinical course made it possible to avoid unnecessary isolations,
investigations, and contact tracing. In addition, in some instances
suspicion of local secondary transmission of SARS could be ruled out when
influenza was documented in the index case. The epidemiological situation
could be better evaluated, since the number of cases remaining suspect for
SARS was considerably reduced. Influenza virus was the most frequent cause
of respiratory illness in this population, an observation consistent with
the fact that the SARS alert coincided with the peak of the influenza
outbreak in Switzerland. However, since the majority of cases reported
recent travel to Asia, this observation also demonstrates the risk of
acquiring influenza and other respiratory viruses abroad and their capacity
for subsequent transmission locally. Finally, our findings are consistent
with the observation that during this period SARS did not cause serious
outbreaks in Europe.

Outbreak That Wasn't: A SARS False Alarm
----------------------------
It seemed like the typical viral "summer cold" as it began spreading
through a nursing home in the Vancouver area in early July. Then in August,
test results from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory suggested
that the "cold" might be from a mutated SARS coronavirus.
Just the hint created deep concerns in a country that had already been
hobbled by an outbreak in Toronto last spring. British Columbia officials
temporarily imposed infection control and quarantine measures that had
contained the Toronto outbreak.
The disruptive and costly actions turned out to be excessive. British
Columbia officials have since determined that the SARS coronavirus did not
cause the outbreak. Rather, they said, its virological cousin, the OC43
coronavirus, which commonly causes colds, was the probable culprit.
Disputes among Canadian officials over the virological findings have
exposed deep flaws in the systems available to detect and monitor any
potential outbreak in Canada and elsewhere. Not only did they underscore
the need for more uniform laboratory testing, but also prompted health
officials to renew calls for reliable tests to detect SARS, or severe acute
respiratory syndrome, in its earliest stages of infection.
"The safety net for detecting the possible return of SARS is pretty
fragile," said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the World Health
Organization, the United Nations agency in Geneva with responsibility for
controlling the disease. "It holds together, but it is spit and luck."
Examination of the disputed findings in Canada is also occurring as the
world is bracing for the possible resurfacing of SARS. A recent report from
the United States National Intelligence Council  which consists of experts
from the academic and private sectors and which reports to the director of
central intelligence, George J. Tenet  lays out 3 bleak possible
situations for the virus's re-emergence.
The 3 situations outlined in the report are disconcerting. One is a
resurgence in countries with major trade centers as international travelers
spread SARS the way they did this year. A second is that SARS cases will
occur sporadically but will be detected before the disease can spread,
creating more of a public health nuisance than a crisis. The third unfolds
in developing countries with weak public health systems.
All make early detection a priority. Canadian and United States health
officials and SARS experts are expected to discuss what steps may reliably
be taken to identify possible new SARS cases, among other topics, at a
2-day closed meeting in Ottawa that begins tomorrow.
To some health officials, the outbreak at the Kinsmen Place Lodge nursing
home in Surrey, British Columbia, has not only revealed important gaps that
need to be addressed, but it may also provide lessons that can be used in
the face of a recurrence of SARS.
"In a way, it was lucky that this outbreak happened before the influenza
season because it is better to learn about the problems now than then,"
said Dr. Katrin Leitmeyer, a W.H.O. epidemiologist and virologist who went
to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg to review its findings.
One of the most glaring problems uncovered by the nursing home outbreak was
the absence of a formal agreement among scientists about precisely what
steps and laboratory methods should be used to make a definitive diagnosis
of SARS.
For example, many test results remain in dispute, largely because the
scientists involved in different laboratories did not use the same methods
to test each specimen to try to identify the virus and to determine whether
the patients' immune systems had produced antibodies against it. And partly
because little is left of the specimens collected from the nursing home
patients, it will take weeks more to prove that the suspected OC43
coronavirus, is the cause.
The conflicting laboratory results have led Canadian scientists and
officials to clash over the validity and meaning of the tests performed on
the lodge residents and staff members.
"We're at loggerheads with the National Microbiology Laboratory," said Dr.
Mel Krajden, the chief virologist at the British Columbia Center for
Disease Control.
The center's chief epidemiologist, Dr. David Patrick, said that from 1 Jul
2003 through 5 Aug 2003, 95 of the 142 lodge residents, or 67 percent,
developed the summer cold and that 8 deaths were related to the outbreak.
Of the 160 health workers there, 53, or 33 percent, developed the summer flu.
Initially, Dr. Krajden's team found no evidence of viruses like influenza,
parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus that are common causes of
upper respiratory illness.
SARS was low on the candidate list because the death rate among lodge
residents was 8 percent, far lower than the rate of 50 percent or more
found among people 60 and older in the SARS epidemic last spring.
But when a second wave struck the nursing home and the center still could
not identify a virus, health officials reconsidered SARS. "So, having come
up empty-handed, we said why not send some of the very limited remaining
materials to" the national laboratory, Dr. Krajden said.
It was a step that many laboratories less concerned about the threat of
SARS might not have taken under the same circumstances, health officials said.
The surprise came when Dr. Frank Plummer, the director of the National
Microbiology Laboratory, said that his team had found tentative evidence of
what might be a mutant SARS virus.
Then on 22 Aug 2003, provincial officials said the latest findings from the
British Columbia Center for Disease Control and the British Columbia Cancer
Agency's Genome Sciences Center "provide conclusive evidence" that the
virus responsible for the nursing home outbreak was not the SARS
coronavirus, but probably its cousin, OC43.
"We have clearly found large sequences of the virus that are not present in
the SARS coronavirus," Dr. Patrick said.
Last week, Dr. Larry J. Anderson, an expert on respiratory diseases at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta, said his team
had completed tests to detect antibodies to the SARS virus in the blood
specimens sent by Dr. Plummer. The CDC tests did not confirm the Canadian
National Microbiology Laboratory findings that SARS antibodies were present.
Dr. Plummer said he agreed that the virus was not the classic SARS virus,
but that his team had found no evidence of OC43.
"We do not dispute their results, but we also believe our results," Dr.
Plummer said. "Now what produced them is a puzzle."
Among the possible explanations for the conflicting results is that 2 or
more viruses were simultaneously affecting the nursing home. Another
possibility is that the specimens from the lodge were inadvertently
contaminated with SARS virus in the Winnipeg laboratory. Dr. Plummer said
he considered that unlikely because of the pattern of his test findings.
"All these diagnostic tests are new and every laboratory has developed its
own test," he said.
"We have a limited understanding of their performance, so comparing what
one laboratory is talking about to another is problematic," Dr. Plummer
said. "This is obviously new territory for all of us. We are probably at a
normal state of development for a disease that has been around for a few
months, and we will be learning every time one of these things happen."
The Canadian laboratories have not succeeded in growing the nursing home
virus and then fully mapping its genome -- 2 findings that would provide
the most definitive evidence of the causative agent. But virologists say
that growing the coronavirus apparently involved in the nursing home
outbreak is more difficult than growing the SARS virus in the laboratory.
The threat of SARS may prompt several changes in laboratory practices,
virologists said. For example, diagnostic laboratories rarely include
coronaviruses in screening tests for the cause of outbreaks of respiratory
illness because they generally cause mild illness and because budgets
preclude searching for every virus.
"No one ever cared that much," said Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes, a professor of
microbiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver
who has studied coronaviruses for 20 years.
Dr. John MacKenzie, an Australian virologist who is temporarily helping WHO
deal with the threat of SARS and other emerging diseases, said the nursing
home episode pointed out 3 major worries about laboratory testing for SARS
that an advisory panel of WHO would need to address in October.
One is the lack of quality assurance. The various methods have not been
tested in different laboratories under different conditions, Dr. MacKenzie
said, and "this is a big concern."
Second, there is no internationally accepted standardization of the
biological materials known as reagents used in testing in different
laboratories. Dr. MacKenzie said he was particularly concerned about the
lack of standardization of the control tests, which play a routine part in
laboratory testing.
Third, Dr. MacKenzie said, "we need to look very carefully at what we do if
we have a positive case."
"What's crucial is that a second laboratory, preferably an international
reference laboratory outside the country that found the positive, confirms
the tests," Dr. MacKenzie said. "Some countries are not keen on this," he
added, yet "it is a major issue."
At the October meeting, he said, "We're going to go into detail about what
is known, what isn't known, what needs to be done, and then prioritize some
things that need to be looked at."
But because the WHO meeting will not be held until late October, it may be
too late to be effective, Mr. Thompson, the agency spokesman,
acknowledged. By then the Northern Hemisphere may be experiencing the
usual seasonal outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory illnesses.
Under such circumstances, the continuing lack of a reliable diagnostic test
for SARS could create chaos from the continuing inability to distinguish
SARS from other illnesses that, by coincidence, were producing similar
symptoms like fever, headache and cough.

[Dr. Gould points out the recognized and well discussed dilemma with
respect to the interpretations of laboratory testing conducted for
identification of infection with the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS CoV)
-- the deficiencies in knowledge on the sensitivity and specificity of the
laboratory tests currently available. (Dr. Gould's comment was submitted
in response to the ProMED-mail posting on a suspected case of SARS in
Singapore "SARS - worldwide (169): Singapore, suspected, RFI
20030908.2249). The information from a letter to the editor of the Swiss
Medical Weekly by L Kaiser et al and provided by Chris Griot further
highlights how in the absence of a clear cut outbreak of SARS,
approximately 62 percent of patients clinically/epidemiologically
classified as potential SARS cases (including suspected, probable and
others with a history of epidemiologic potential exposure and an acute
respiratory illness) were found to have other viral etiologies for their
respiratory illness (a reminder of earlier definitions of SARS as "a
diagnosis of exclusion").
The New York Times article gives a good overview of the dilemma faced in
Canada following the initial laboratory reports that the SARS CoV (or
mutant) was the etiologic agent of an outbreak of mild respiratory illness
in a nursing home. This was later ruled out after further testing was
done. The points raised by Dr. MacKenzie in the interview with the NY
Times on the issues confronting the laboratories are very valid
points. First, the lack of quality assurance. The various methods have not
been tested in different laboratories under different conditions. Second,
there is no internationally accepted standardization of the reagents used
in testing in different laboratories. and third there is the need to look
very carefully at what is done if there is a laboratory positive case. He
also points out the crucial need of a second laboratory, preferably an
international reference laboratory outside the country that found the
positive, confirms the tests.
That being said, the probable case of SARS CoV infection being monitored
and investigated in Singapore right now will further add to the above
mentioned discussion as more information becomes available. At present the
initial laboratory tests have been validated by a second laboratory in the
same country. We await the results of further testing by an international
reference laboratory outside of Singapore. To use a popular expression ...
