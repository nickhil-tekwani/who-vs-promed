Italy reports BSE cases similar to Japan's 8th
----------------------------------------------
2 cows in Italy that were found to have bovine spongiform encephalopathy
{BSE}, or mad cow disease, in 2002 were infected with abnormal prions -- the
protein molecules believed to cause the disease -- similar in structure to
the ones found recently in a cow in Ibaraki Prefecture in the nation's 8th
BSE case, the Yomiuri Shimbun learned Saturday.
The finding was revealed by an Italian researcher at an international
conference on prion-caused disease held recently in Germany.
The Ibaraki cow was described as suffering from an atypical case of mad cow
disease, as it was infected with prions structured differently from those
of BSE cases discovered so far, either in Japan or elsewhere, leading to
fear that there could be an unknown source of BSE infection in the nation.
Japanese experts expressed hope that they could narrow down possible
sources of infection through joint research with Italian experts.
According to Tokyo University Prof. Takashi Onodera, who attended the
conference, the 2 infected Italian cows were 11 and 12 years old.
The Italian researcher was cited as saying at the conference [that] the
results of BSE tests that checked the prions' structure, and the locations of
prions concentrated within the cows' brains, showed that the prions were
clearly different from those of "typical" cases of BSE previously found. The
researcher also said there could be undiscovered cases of BSE within Italy.
Prof. Onodera and a team of Italian researchers compared data and agreed
that it was highly likely that the latest case found in Japan and the 2
cows found in 2002 in Italy had the same type of BSE.
After reporting the latest findings to a BSE study panel in the Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, Prof. Onodera plans to proceed with a joint
study with the Italian experts on infectivity and pathogenicity of the 3
cases to try to identify the route of infection.
The ministry panel in September 2003 said it was highly possible that the
source of infection in the previous 7 cases was feed mixed with meat-and-bone
meal (MBM) produced from cows imported from Britain, or imported from Italy
in the 1980s. It is also possible that Japan's 8th case of BSE stemmed from
feed mixed with MBM produced from cows imported from Italy.

[Additional data on the Italian and Japanese findings on the "atypical"
characteristics of the described cases will be useful.
The results of an official interim investigation into the possible source
of BSE introduction into Japan was included in posting 20021101.5677. One
of the findings was that up until 1 Jun 1998, the Italian factories making
MBM feed for export to Japan were not using the special thermal processing
method; therefore, it was highly possible that before this time the
pressure treatment standards for insuring that potential causes of diseases
are effectively kept inert (humidity of 136 degrees C for 30 minutes) were
not met.
Additional data on Japan's external BSE risk -- such as the imports of live
bovines and MBM -- might have been included in the dossier provided by
Japan to the EU for the analysis of Japan's geographical BSE risk (GBR).
However, this GBR document -- mentioned in EU's press release of 2 Apr 2001
as one of a series which were pending finalisation -- remains unpublished. -
