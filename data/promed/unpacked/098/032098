The plague is striking very close to the capital [Antananarivo]. In Ambohimiadana, Antsaharatsy, Ampanotokana commune, Ambohidratrimo district [Analamanga region], 3 people died on Tue 20 Dec 2022 after being sick. 3 other people had to be hospitalized, including a young man who was in a critical condition.

The week before, the mother of 1 of the 3 recent victims passed away, 2 days after the funeral of her husband who died in deplorable and worrying health circumstances. The mother of the family, despite suspicions of illness, was only buried 3 days after her death. The number of plague victims in this locality thus amounts to 5.

Reached by telephone, officials within the Ministry of Public Health said they had not been informed of the situation. The regional director of health in the region of Analamanga was removed from office in the Council of Ministers, thus regretting not being able to give the slightest information on this situation in Ampanotokana. Current ministry officials say they want to investigate this information.

The symptoms and the circumstances in which the victims found themselves suggest that they suffered from the plague. Local medical authorities are also not authorized to communicate related information to the media. Nevertheless, the heads of the schools located in this village have decided to temporarily close the schools as a precaution.

[Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017. The numbers in this cluster of cases have increased somewhat.

The following information is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al. Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm:

Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest control and good health management. However, since 1990, annually more than 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa.

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by the spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague," and also may spread to the lungs causing hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission. Not all initial cases of plague pneumonia occur with a preceding bubonic phase, and when the lung infection spreads from person to person, there is no bubonic stage.

Ampanotokana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampanotokana) is a town and commune in Madagascar. It belongs to the district of Ambohidratrimo, which is part of Analamanga Region. It lies 35 km (22 mi) north west of the capital, Antananarivo. - Mod.LL
