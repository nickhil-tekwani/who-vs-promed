Bornaviruses cause a lethal form of encephalitis, called Borna disease, among horses and sheep. To date [Wed 21 Jun 2017] there have been only a few reported cases in Austria. Recently, however, 4 horses were afflicted in the same area of Upper Austria within just 2 years. Tests conducted on local shrews, the only known reservoir host for the virus, confirmed the suspicion of a local viral reservoir. A large proportion of the small mammals investigated by the researchers from Vetmeduni Vienna tested positive for Bornaviruses, which were revealed to be genetically distinct from strains found in neighbouring regions such as Bavaria. The study, conducted in cooperation with the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) and local veterinarians, and published in the journal Emerging Microbes & Infections, documents this rare outbreak of Borna disease in a new endemic area in Austria.

Clinical signs of Borna disease among horses and sheep include behavioural disturbances and disorientation. The causative agent of Borna disease, the Bornavirus, is harmless for people but triggers a lethal infection of the brain and the spinal cord among affected animals. The virus is transmitted exclusively via a reservoir host, the protected bicoloured white-toothed shrew. Infected shrews are lifelong, yet asymptomatic, carriers of the Bornavirus.

Despite a declining number of cases, occasional sporadic outbreaks of the disease have been documented in Central Europe with the exception of Austria. Now researchers from Vetmeduni Vienna and the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) have confirmed for the 1st time an outbreak of Borna disease in a previously unaffected area. Within a period of just 2 years, 4 horses in Upper Austria contracted the disease in locations no more than 17 km [approx. 10 mi] apart. Local bicoloured white-toothed shrews, as well as one common shrew, tested positive for the virus. The Bornaviruses that were found, however, were genetically only distantly related with the viruses found in neighbouring regions like Bavaria.

The 1st indication of a possible outbreak of Borna disease came from 2 vigilant local veterinarians. They diagnosed a neurological condition among 4 horses in Upper Austria and suspected that Bornaviruses could be responsible. An examination of the afflicted horses confirmed the diagnosis and the suspicion. "At the same time, we also tested the possible local carrier, shrews, to help assign a local aspect to the multiple cases of disease," says Herbert Weissenböck of the Institute of Pathology and Forensic Veterinary Medicine. More than 50 percent of the trapped bicoloured white-toothed shrews were positively identified as carriers of the virus. But there also was the unexpected positive test for another species of shrew living in Upper Austria.

The shrews captured in the affected region also included common shrews. This species had so far not been considered a possible carrier of the Bornavirus. "For the 1st time, we have now identified an infected common shrew. Further studies are needed to show whether this species also serves as a reservoir host or if this is an isolated case," says Norbert Nowotny of the Institute of Virology.

The researchers also compared the Bornaviruses found in Upper Austria with the previously discovered Central European strains. "Unlike one would expect from their geographic proximity, the Upper Austrian Bornaviruses were not genetically related to those in Bavaria but to a viral strain from Rhineland-Palatinate. Since its description, this strain has been found in other areas in Germany and now also in Austria," explains Nowotny. "This shows that we are still lacking important information about how the various strains of Bornavirus spread. The identification of a previously unknown endemic area for Bornaviruses in Upper Austria was a surprise for us all."

An earlier study by the team had confirmed that the bicoloured white-toothed shrew represents a reservoir for Bornaviruses. The viruses are present in high amounts in all organs of the shrews while the animals themselves remain asymptomatic. "After an infection, the shrews remain lifelong hosts and even excrete the virus," says Nowotny. With protected animals, however, the question is how to best combat Bornavirus infections. The shrews must be kept out of the stables, for example through self-closing doors or barriers. Hygiene standards and regular controls also play an important role.

"This case has shown that many scientific studies begin with the watchful diagnosis by practicing veterinarians. This awareness must be further strengthened. The good cooperation with AGES has shown that we can make rapid progress when we work together. The proof that the Bornaviruses were present in both horses and shrews confirmed not only the veterinarians' diagnosis but will also help us to develop strategies for the future," says Weissenböck.

Abstract
--------
"Borna disease, a lethal infection with Borna disease virus-1 (BoDV-1), was diagnosed in 4 horses from Upper Austria in 2015 and 2016. All cases occurred in winter (2 cases in February 2015 and 2 cases in December 2016), and the maximal distance of the affected stables was 17 km [approx. 10 mi]. To demonstrate whether the causative agent was also harbored by its reservoir host, the bicolored white-toothed shrew (_Crocidura leucodon_), 28 shrews from this geographic area were collected in 2015 and investigated for the presence of BoDV-1. The shrew species were identified according to taxonomic clues and molecular barcodes. Affected horses and all shrews were investigated using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription PCR. The horses exhibited severe nonpurulent encephalitis. Large amounts of BoDV-1 antigen were identified in their CNS. Among the 28 shrews, 9 were identified as _C. leucodon_ and 13 as _Sorex araneus_ (Common shrew; Eurasian shrew). Six _C. leucodon_ (66.7 percent) and one _S. araneus_ (7.7 percent) had BoDV-1 infections. In accordance with previous findings, the IHC of _C. leucodon_ exhibited a high amount of viral antigen in many neural and extraneural tissues. By contrast, the single positive _S. araneus_ had an exclusively neural staining pattern. Of all positive samples, whole-genome BoDV-1 sequences were generated. The acquired sequences of the affected shrews were not identical to each other and clustered around the sequences of the diseased horses belonging, surprisingly, to the German 'strain V' cluster."

Borna disease, is described mainly in association with natural infections of horses and sheep, in which BoDV (Borna disease virus) has a main tropism for the CNS (central nervous system). Borna disease and, later, BDV were named after the town of Borna in Saxony, Germany, where an epidemic of infectious encephalitis caused a large number of equine deaths in 1885. Veterinary scientists spent many years carefully describing the natural history of BDV infection in animals in Central Europe, including infections of horses, sheep, rabbits, and birds. The infection is noncytolytic and persistent, and in the natural hosts, mood, sensorium, sensibility, motility, and the autonomous nervous system are simultaneously or successively affected, with a fatal outcome in up to 90 percent of infected animals. For epidemiological and zoonotic aspects of BoDV, see references 1- 3.

Reference 4 includes a 2016 review:

Abstract
--------
"The neurotropic virus, Borna disease virus (BDV), a member of a group of nonsegmented, negative strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (order Mononegavirales), infects warm-blooded animal species. Infection among mammals may be asymptomatic, produce neurobehavioral abnormalities, or result in fatal meningoencephalitis. It is unique among animal viruses in the order Mononegavirales in its nuclear localization of replication and transcription and distinctive in its capacity to establish persistent, non-cytolytic infection of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Natural infection, long described in horses and sheep, has more recently been recognized to extend to bird species in association with a related virus, avian bornavirus, as well as to divergent bornaviruses in reptiles, challenging established virus taxonomy. Nonhuman primates can be experimentally infected; however, natural infection of humans and nonhuman primates appears to be unusual. Decades-long controversy over a role for BDV infection in human neuropsychiatric illnesses has more recently waned. Nonetheless, the discovery that the genomes of humans as well as other vertebrate lineages contain remnants of BDV sequences has raised questions regarding potential evolutionary implications. Analysis of rodent models of infection has yielded insights into the mechanisms by which neurotropic agents and host immune and signaling pathway responses may impact upon developing or mature CNS circuitry to effect complex neurobehavioral disturbances."
