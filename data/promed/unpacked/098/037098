1st report of northern stem canker of soybean caused by _Diaporthe
phaseolorum var. caulivora_ in North Dakota
---------------------------------
CA Bradley, Department of Plant Pathology, North Dakota State University,
Fargo, 58105; S Li, Department of Crop Sciences, University of Illinois,
Urbana 61801. Plant Dis 2006; 90: 687, published online as DOI:
10.1094/PD-90-0687A. Accepted for publication 10 Feb 2006.
In early September 2003, patches of soybean (_Glycine max_) plants in a
field in Foster County, ND had dead branches with reddish brown cankers at
the nodes. Stem tissue with cankers from 2 plants were excised and immersed
in a 0.5 per cent NaOCl solution for one min, rinsed with sterilized
distilled water, and placed into Petri dishes containing potato dextrose
agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate (200 mg/liter). Four fungi
were hyphal tipped and grown on PDA, acidified PDA, or water agar (WA) with
soybean stem pieces incubated at 21 C with 24-h light and identified by
culture and spore morphology after 3 to 4 weeks. Cultures were identified
as _Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora_ that produced white colonies with
interspersed cottony tufts of mycelium on PDA (1). Stromata were small and
scattered irregularly on the plate. Perithecia of the _D. phaseolorum var.
caulivora_ isolates were black and globose with 8-spored asci formed on
soybean stem pieces on WA. To confirm pathogenicity of the _D. phaseolorum
var. caulivora_ isolates, soybean plants (cv. NuTech 0606) were grown in
the greenhouse and inoculated with recovered _D. phaseolorum var.
caulivora_ isolates. The stems of soybean plants at the V3 stage were
excised just below the 4th node. Mycelia plugs of the 4 different
one-week-old cultures of _D. phaseolorum var. caulivora_ were placed into
the large end of disposable micropipette tips (200 ul). The micropipette
tip containing a _D. phaseolorum var. caulivora_ culture was subsequently
placed over a cut soybean stem. The 4 _D. phaseolorum var. caulivora_
isolates were used to inoculate 10 stems apiece. To serve as controls, 10
cut soybean stems were inoculated with micropipette tips containing plugs
of noninfested PDA, and 10 cut stems were not inoculated. Ten days after
inoculation, micropipette tips were removed and lesions that had developed
on the stem were measured. The mean lesion lengths of the _D. phaseolorum
var. caulivora_ inoculated stems ranged from 48 to 82 mm and were
significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the lesion lengths of the noninfested
PDA (3 mm) and no PDA (one mm) controls. Northern stem canker was only
observed in the one field; however, surveys were not conducted to determine
the prevalence of the disease throughout the soybean-production area of
North Dakota. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of northern stem
canker on soybean in North Dakota.

[The crop plant soybean, _Glycine max_, develops symptoms of the disease
northern stem canker when infected by the fungus _Diaporthe phaseolorum
var. caulivora_.
Stem canker has been reported in Europe, South America, and in most soybean
regions of Canada and the United States. This is the 1st report in North
Dakota from samples collected in 2003, but it has been reported in South
Dakota since at least 2000. In the USA, the disease is divided into
northern stem canker and southern stem canker. Northern stem canker and
southern stem canker are caused by _Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora_
and _Diaporthe phaseolorum var. meridionalis_, respectively. Stem canker is
closely related to pod and stem blight, which is caused by the related
pathogen _Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae_.
Northern stem canker was 1st reported in the late 1940s in Iowa, and by the
1950s, the disease had spread into the upper Midwest and Canada. Southern
stem canker was reported in the south in 1973, and by 1984, had been
detected in all southern states. Northern stem canker caused severe losses
in the Midwestern and North Central Regions of the United States and
Ontario, Canada in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Yield losses have been
reported to be as high as 50 to 80 per cent in naturally infested fields.
It became less significant as a problem when extremely susceptible
varieties were removed from production. Southern stem canker arose as a
problem in the southern United States in the 1970s and continues to be
significant problem for southern soybean farmers. A resurgence of Northern
stem canker may be related to the deployment of susceptible varieties,
changes in agronomic practices, changes in the pathogen population, as well
as seed sources.
Both pathogens can overwinter in infested soybean residue and may be spread
with infested seed. Stem canker is effectively managed by the combination
of planting resistant cultivars and reducing infested crop residue on the
soil surface by deep plowing prior to planting a soybean crop. Delayed
planting may be helpful. Seeds that are to be used for planting should not
be harvested from fields with a history of stem canker. Fungicides applied
to the seed at planting can reduce the introduction of stem canker to a
field but will not control infections in the field. Foliar fungicides can
be effective when applied during vegetative stages; however, results are
inconsistent, and in most cases, foliar fungicides would not be an
economical management strategy.
