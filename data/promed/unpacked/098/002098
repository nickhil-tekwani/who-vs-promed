A Scott County chicken has tested positive for avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, according to the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission.

The commission received confirmation of the positive test Tuesday night [18 Jun 2013] and has quarantined all poultry within a 6.2-mile [10 km] radius of the chicken house facility where the infected bird was located, according to a statement from Governor Mike Beebe's office.

The positive test poses no public health threat, and bird flu (H7N7) cannot be transmitted to people "through the consumption of properly prepared poultry," according to the statement, although bird flu can be spread to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

The commission is coordinating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on response and additional testing, according to the governor's office.

This particular strain of the virus is regarded as low pathogenic. The commission is clearly acting to try and prevent any spread of the virus. However, the article does not mention any type of decontamination for personnel leaving the facility. It is important for workers not to pass the virus to back yard flocks. It is equally important to determine the source of the virus. Hopefully, as the commission conducts their investigation, they will not discover that the virus was tracked in from a back yard flock or from avian athletes.

Even low pathogenic strains of a virus can cause trade barriers to go into place from trading partners that are concerned.
