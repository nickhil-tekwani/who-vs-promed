Two heads of a hospital in Shangluo in northwest China's Shaanxi Province were dismissed after 26 patients contracted hepatitis C during dialysis treatment, said the local authorities on Fri 26 Feb 2016.

It is suspected that the patients contracted hepatitis C while undergoing hemodialysis sessions in the hospital, said an official at the medical center, He Youwen. "They are among about 40 kidney patients receiving treatment regularly 2-3 times a week," he added, noting that the virus, which is transmitted by blood, was detected in routine checks between 17 and 19 Feb 2016. As of last Wednesday [24 Feb 2016], they had confirmed 26 cases.

The hospital has undergone a sterilization process and received 7 new dialysis machines after the outbreak, according to the same source. The origin is probably inadequate sterilization, said a specialist of the First Associate Hospital of Jiaotong University of Xi'an and member of the investigation team led by the government, Jiang Hongli. "We need more research to fully determine how the problem occurred and who was responsible," Jiang said.

China recorded 200 000 cases of hepatitis C last year [2015], and 95 patients died, according to figures released by the National Commission of Health and Family Planning.

With 601 employees and 500 beds, Zhen'an Hospital is the largest and most active public hospital in the district, where there are 302 600 inhabitants.
