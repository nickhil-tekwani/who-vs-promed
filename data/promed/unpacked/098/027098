Avian influenza suspected in Belgium
------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 17 March 2003 from Dr Luc Lengele,
counsellor general, Animal Health and Animal Products Department, Federal
State Service for Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, Brussels:
During the night of 10 to 11 March 2003, a high mortality rate was observed
among 4 week old broilers (2000 dead birds out of 12 000 birds), in Poppel,
Ravels district, Antwerp province. Avian influenza cannot be ruled out from
the clinical features.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests gave negative results for fowl plague
(highly pathogenic avian influenza). A second test also gave negative
results. Results of virus isolation tests are awaited for 24 March.
Principal measures applied:
- Pre-emptive sanitation of the suspect farm and the 3 farms located within
a 1 km radius from the suspect farm.
- Cessation of the issuing of certificates for the exportation of live
poultry and hatching eggs.
- Setting up of a buffer zone that includes the whole district of Ravels as
well as the Dutch district of Baarle-Hertog.
Within the zone:
quarantine of poultry farms and hatcheries.
- Throughout the country: ban on the movements of poultry and eggs. As an
exception, transportation of poultry for immediate slaughter may be
authorised (out of the buffer zone), as well as transportation of one day
old chicks to a farm where there are not any other poultry.

[Although the spatial-temporal proximity to the current outbreak of avian
influenza in the Netherlands might lead us to assume this event in Belgium
is result of spread from a neighboring infected area, caution is always
warranted until we have good epidemiological and laboratory data. This
should be available sometime after March 24. It is worthwhile to remember
that unrelated epidemics may occur at the same time. - Mod PC]
