Human bocavirus, a new pathogen of childhood: Background
-----------------------------------------------
In 2001, Allander et al. described an innovative molecular method for
discovery of previously unknown viral agents in serum or plasma samples,
incorporating DNase treatment and its application to the identification of
2 novel virus species. The method is based on DNase treatment of serum
followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single
primer amplification of the fragments. Experimental validation of the
method confirmed that both DNA and RNA viruses could be reproducibly
identified at concentrations of approximately 10(6) genome equivalents per
ml in 50 micro liters of serum. In the initial application of the method, 2
previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in bovine sera used as
diluent. These 2 novel parvoviruses proved to be frequent contaminants of
bovine sera (see: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 25;98(20):11609-14.
Epub 2001 Sep 18).
Application of this methodology has now identified a novel human pathogen
of childhood. A preliminary description was reported by Reuters on 22 Aug
2005 (see ProMED-mail post: Human bocavirus, a new pathogen of childhood
20050823.2487), and a full description is now available in the 23 Aug 2005
Early Edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0504666102v1?etoc>.
The abstract of the paper by Tobias Allander et al., entitled "Cloning of a
human parvovirus by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples,"
states the following: "The identification of new virus species is a key
issue for the study of infectious disease but is technically very
difficult. We developed a system for large-scale molecular virus screening
of clinical samples based on host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification,
large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to
pooled human respiratory tract samples. The 1st experiments detected 7
human virus species without the use of any specific reagent. Among the
detected viruses were one coronavirus and one parvovirus, both of which
were at that time uncharacterized. The parvovirus, provisionally named
human bocavirus, was in a retrospective clinical study detected in 17
additional patients and associated with lower respiratory tract infections
in children. The molecular virus screening procedure provides a general
culture-independent solution to the problem of detecting unknown virus
species in single or pooled samples. We suggest that a systematic
exploration of the viruses that infect humans, 'the human virome,' can be
initiated."
Parvoviruses are among the smallest, simplest eukaryotic viruses. They are
widespread in nature. Essentially, they fall into 2 groups: defective
viruses, which are dependent on helper virus for replication, and
autonomous and replication-competent viruses. In all, more than 50
parvoviruses have been identified. The family is divided into 2
subfamilies: the subfamily _Parvovirinae_ comprises 5 genera of vertebrate
viruses (_Parvovirus_, _Erythrovirus_, _Dependovirus_ , _Amdovirus_ and
_Bocavirus_). The genus _Bocavirus_ comprises 3 species; the previously
recognized _Bovine parvovirus_ and _Canine minute virus_, and now the newly
discovered Human bocavirus. The genomes of these viruses are linear,
single-stranded monopartite DNA, about 5.5 kb long with hairpin loops at
both ends of the genome. The hairpin structures at both ends of the genome
are characteristic of the sub-family _Parvovirinae_. The virions are
isometric (icosahedral), not enveloped, 18-26 nm in diameter, with 60 units
of the capsid protein. The viruses classified in the 5 genera are
phylogenetically distinct.

Discovery of Unique Chest Infection Virus
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists have identified a unique virus linked to serious chest
infections in children and babies. All of the 17 children with what the
researchers are calling human bocavirus had distressed breathing and fever
and were hospitalized. In most cases, the virus causing the lower
respiratory tract infection is known; most commonly, it is respiratory
syncytial virus. But in around 1/3rd of cases, no obvious pathogen is
found. Dr. Tobias Allander and colleagues at the Karolinska University
Hospital in Stockholm tested 378 respiratory tract samples collected from
patients in the hospital who had chest infections for which no obvious
cause had been found.
Rather than looking for well known viruses, the team used technology
similar to that used to crack the code of human DNA in the Human Genome
Project to see what viruses were present. They detected 7 virus species in
the samples, one of which was a parvovirus that had never
been characterized before, which they called human bocavirus
(HBoV). All of these samples containing HBoV had come from children or infants.
The researchers then checked for the virus in 540 children with lower
respiratory tract infections being treated in the hospital. In the 17
children found to have HBoV, this virus was the only one present,
suggesting that it was indeed the cause of their illness. Although the
findings will not directly change the way childhood chest infections are
treated in the short-term, the researchers say their findings are important.
Dr. Allander said: "This is quite a prevalent virus, and it has remained
undetected until now. It tells us that there is a lot we do not know. Also,
maybe this virus, which is a parvovirus, can cause other conditions." He
said it was likely there were many more viruses yet to be discovered but
that are causing illness in humans. "Finding these might be important for
treating disease," he said. He urged scientists to search for more of these
unrecognized viruses.
Dr. Maria Zambon, a virologist at the Health Protection Agency, said the
detection was welcome. "The detection of human bocavirus is the latest in a
long line of recently discovered respiratory viruses." And she added: "The
sort of molecular detection methods used to uncover human bocavirus will
undoubtedly lead to the discovery of more viruses in the coming years." Dr.
Warren Lenney of the British Thoracic Society said: "We need to know more
about the cause of infections in the respiratory tract, and this research
helps us with this. One of the difficulties, however, is that even though
viruses are isolated from nasopharyngeal specimens, we cannot be sure that
they are responsible for problems that occur lower down in the lung.
