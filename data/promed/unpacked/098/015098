Five horses in Barn 29 at Saratoga Harness Track, in Saratoga Springs, New York, have shown signs of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), including fever, mild coughing, and mild nasal discharge. On 28 Jan 2020, New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM) and New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) officials received laboratory test results on one of the horses, which indicated an active EHV-1 infection. None of the horses are exhibiting neurologic clinical signs.

Officials quarantined Barn 29 on 29 Jan 2020 and will monitor for fever and other signs of illness for 21 days after the last signs of EHV-1 infection. Quarantined horses will not be allowed to leave the facility during that period. Exposed horses in Barn 29 that are well enough to train may do so when all other horses have left the track area at the end of each day.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM; the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

An 8-year-old Quarter Horse in Nebraska was confirmed to have equine herpesvirus on 6 Feb 2020.

According to the TheHorse.Com (https://thehorse.com/184847/nebraska-horse-confirmed-with-equine-herpesvirus-1/), the mare began showing signs of fever on 4 Feb 2020. She had been vaccinated and is recovering; however, a voluntary quarantine on 30 horses was put in place.

EHV-1 is highly contagious in horses, and many times signs can initially go undetected. Signs include cough, decreased appetite, depression and nasal discharge.

The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) received confirmation of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease linked to equine herpes virus (EHV-1), in a hunter jumper horse visiting Texas from Wyoming.

The EHM-positive horse traveled to Katy, Texas to participate in a hunter jumper event that began on 29 Jan 2020. The infected horse has not visited any other events in Texas.

The infected horse was immediately isolated and quickly relocated to a Brazos County veterinary hospital for care after showing signs of ataxia and other neurologic signs consistent with EHM.

Horses that were known to have come in direct contact with the infected horse were in an isolated area of the facility, and the directly exposed horses are now under quarantine and veterinary monitoring.

"TAHC veterinarians are in direct contact with event organizers to ensure participants are notified and enhanced biosecurity measures are being taken," said Dr. Susan Rollo, State Epidemiologist. "I believe the attentiveness and quick actions taken by the event veterinarian and staff will help contain the disease and mitigate the risk of spread."

Owners of horses that attended the event are encouraged to take precautions:
- Clean and disinfect tack, boots, equipment, and grooming supplies.
- When you return to your farm, isolate the horses that attended the event for at least 2 weeks.
- Have their temperatures monitored twice daily for at least 14 days after last known exposure. If a fever or other signs consistent with EHM develop, contact your veterinarian.
- When doing feeding and chores, work with the returning horses last, wear booths and coveralls, and remove them before working with your other horses.
- Don't forget to wash your hands.

Owners should work with their veterinary practitioners to establish appropriate monitoring and diagnostic plans for any potentially exposed horse(s). For more information on biosecurity measures you can take to keep your horses healthy, visit https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_BiosecurityEquine.pdf.

One of the most common clinical signs of EHV-1 is fever, which often precedes the development of other signs. Respiratory signs include coughing and nasal discharge. Neurologic signs associated with EHM are highly variable, but often the hindquarters are most severely affected.

Horses with EHM may appear weak and uncoordinated; urine dribbling and loss of tail tone may also be seen. Severely affected horses may become unable to rise. For more information on EHM, please visit https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_EquineHerpesMyeloencephalopathy.pdf.

It is important to remember these signs are not specific to EHM, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. Many horses exposed to EHV-1 never develop clinical signs. If you suspect your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your local veterinarian.

The equine industry is encouraged to obtain the latest information on this outbreak and other disease events across the country by visiting the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) website, http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks. Additional Texas EHM cases will be posted on the EDCC.

[Biosecurity is extremely important with this disease, as it is highly contagious and spreads easily. There is no vaccine against the neurological form of the disease. Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention. - Mod.TG
