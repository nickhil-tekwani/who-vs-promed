It's more important than ever to check for ticks this season. Lyme disease cases are on the rise in Central New York. According to the most recent data from New York State Department of Health [year 2011], every county in Central New York has seen more Lyme cases nearly every year since at least 2005 [http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/2011/cases/4.htm].

In 2011, Tompkins County had 145 cases, the most in the area, and Onondaga County had 86 that same year. Just 8 years ago, no county in Central New York had more than 10 reported cases in one year. The graph and table attached to this story show the rise in the prevalence of the disease over time. Local doctors expect this trend to continue.

"Lyme disease is real and it's out there," said Dr. Mitchell Brodey, the chief of internal medicine at Upstate University Hospital Community Campus. "We see a lot of it and we're probably going to see a lot more of it."

Ticks that can carry Lyme disease are tiny: adults only grow to be the size of a sesame seed. It can take 24-36 hours for a tick to transmit the disease, so it's important to check for them daily.

The Center for Disease Control recently released new Lyme disease resources to help people protect themselves from the disease. This comic strip for kids reminds them to do "tick checks" even when away from parents at camp [http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/toolkit/DontletTicksbitemeComicFS_508.pdf].

The CDC also released this new reference guide for health care providers on tick-borne diseases. Doctors say taking simple precautions can go a long way. "People should walk around if they can and use insect repellent that's going to help repel the ticks and just be aware. If you get a rash don't ignore it," said Dr. Brodey.

The Department of Health says New York State has the highest number of confirmed Lyme disease cases in the country [http://www.wadsworth.org/databank/borreli.htm]. For additional information, about Lyme disease, [see http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/].

[The latest data from the CDC, dated May 6, 2013 on the reported number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease by state and the District of Columbia for the years 2002 to 2011 and the incidence of confirmed cases per 100 000 population by state and the District of Columbia for the year 2011 can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html. In 2011, according to the CDC, 3 states with the highest number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease were Pennsylvania (4739), New Jersey (3378) and New York (3118). The respective incidence rates of confirmed cases per 100 000 population were 37.2, 38.5 and 16.0. The states with the highest incidence rates of confirmed cases in 2011 were Delaware (84.6), New Hampshire (67.3), Maine (60.3), and Connecticut (56.0). Thus, New York State had neither the highest number of confirmed cases, nor the highest incidence rate in the USA in 2011.

Figure 3 in an online publication (1) most helpfully illustrates the rate of change in incidence of Lyme disease by state for the years 1993 to 2007 in the United States (http://www.cmajopen.ca/content/1/1/E43/F3.expansion.html). The Northeast, Midatlantic, and Upper Midwestern states experienced a significant increase in incidence from 1993 to 2007.

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_, and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. In areas of the northeastern, mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, the white-footed mouse is the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_ and _I. scapularis_ is the tick vector. The western black-legged tick (_I. pacificus_) is the main vector on the west coast, where only 2-4 percent of _I. pacificus_ are reported to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_, whereas over 50 percent of _I. scapularis_ are infected in hyper-endemic areas in the northeastern states (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/).
