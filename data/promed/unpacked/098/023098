[1] Brain damage
Date: Mon 19 Apr 2021

Researchers at Columbia University say that they found no signs of virus inside the patients' brain cells but saw many brain abnormalities that could explain the confusion and delirium seen in some patients with severe coronavirus and the lingering "brain fog" in those with mild disease.

The study, which the authors called the largest COVID-19 brain autopsy report thus far, involved analysis of samples from autopsies conducted from March-June 2020 and was published late last week in the journal Brain. The findings, they said, suggest that the inflammation triggered by the coronavirus in other parts of the body or in the brain's blood vessels may have caused the neurologic abnormalities seen in the autopsies.

The brain damage consisted of areas starved of oxygen, many of them hemorrhagic, which the researchers said were likely caused by blood clots that temporarily blocked the flow of oxygen. Many activated microglia, or immune cells in the brain that can be activated by pathogens, were also identified.

"We found clusters of microglia attacking neurons, a process called 'neuronophagia,'" co-senior author Peter Canoll, MD, PhD, said in a Columbia University press release [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/cuim-cdn041521.php].

Because no virus was observed in the brain, he said that the microglia may have been activated by inflammatory cytokines, which are tied to coronavirus infection. "At the same time, hypoxia [reduced oxygen from COVID-19] can induce the expression of 'eat me' signals on the surface of neurons, making hypoxic neurons more vulnerable to activated microglia."

Most activated microglia were found in the lower brain stem, which is responsible for heart and breathing rhythms and levels of consciousness, and in the hippocampus, which is involved in mood and memory.

"We know the microglia activity will lead to loss of neurons, and that loss is permanent," co-senior author James Goldman, MD, PhD, said in the release. "Is there enough loss of neurons in the hippocampus to cause memory problems? Or in other parts of the brain that help direct our attention? It's possible, but we really don't know at this point."


Of the 41 patients, 59% required intensive care, and about half required intubation. Hospital-related complications were common, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (20%), acute kidney injury necessitating dialysis (17%), and bacteremia (24%). About 20% of patients died within 24 hours of hospitalization, while 27% died 4 or more weeks after admission.

All of the patients, who were 74 years on average, had signs of virus-related lung damage. 66 percent of the patients were men, and 83% were Hispanic/Latino.

The authors said that future studies should aim to determine whether some COVID-19 survivors have any of these neurologic abnormalities and whether they lead to chronic neurological deficits.

"In light of the brainstem and hippocampal distribution of microglial activation, the latter of which has been linked to virus-induced cognitive deficits, it is notable that some COVID-19 survivors develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, including memory disturbances, somnolence, fatigue, and insomnia, and that similar symptoms are reported in both the acute and recovery phases," they wrote.

"This study included only patients who were severely ill and died. These changes may not be seen in patients with mild illness."

The investigators concluded that "These [autopsy] findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules, and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather are likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems." - Mod.LK]

[2] India: cases soaring
Date: Mon 19 Apr 2021

https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-health-india-coronavirus-pandemic-new-delhi-194b8356811dadf41c552beedff839a9


New Delhi imposed a weeklong lockdown on Mon 19 Apr 2021 night to prevent the collapse of the Indian capital's health system, which authorities said had been pushed to its limit amid an explosive surge in coronavirus cases.

In scenes familiar from surges elsewhere, ambulances catapulted from one hospital to another, trying to find an empty bed over the weekend, while patients lined up outside of medical facilities waiting to be let in. Ambulances also idled outside of crematoriums, carrying half a dozen dead bodies each.

"People keep arriving in an almost collapsing situation," said Dr. Suresh Kumar, who heads Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, one of New Delhi's largest hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients.

Most desperately need oxygen, Kumar said. But the city is facing shortages of oxygen and some medicine, according to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who told reporters that the new stringent measures being imposed were required to "prevent a collapse of the health system," which had "reached its limit."

Just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic, the virus is now spreading at a rate faster than at any other time, said Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking infections in India.

The surge is devastating for India and has weighed heavily on the global efforts to end the pandemic since the country is a major vaccine producer but has been forced to delay exports of shots abroad, hampering campaigns in developing countries in particular.

The rise in cases comes as the global death toll from the coronavirus passed a staggering 3 million people on Sat 17 Apr 2021 amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places beyond India as well, such as Brazil and France.

India reported over 270 000 infections on Mon 19 Apr 2021, its highest daily rise since the pandemic started. It has now recorded more than 15 million infections and more than 178 000 deaths. Experts agree that even these figures are likely undercounts. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off a trip to New Delhi amid the rise in cases.

New Delhi, a city of 29 million people, has fewer than 100 beds with ventilators, and fewer than 150 beds available for patients needing critical care. Similar scenes played out in other parts of the vast country. In the Himalayan Jammu state in India's north, the weekly average of COVID-19 cases has increased 14-fold in the past month.

In response, officials have begun to impose stringent measures again. The Indian capital was shut down over the weekend, but now authorities are extending that for a week: All shops and factories will close, except for those that provide essential services, like grocery stories. People are not supposed to leave their homes, except for a handful of reasons, like seeking medical care. They will also be allowed to travel to airports or train stations.

They were the strictest measures imposed since India's harsh lockdown last year [2020], which lasted months and left deep scars. Politicians have since been reticent to even mention the word. When similar measures were imposed in Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, in recent days, officials refused to call it a lockdown. Those restrictions are to last 15 days.

Kejriwal urged calm, especially among migrant workers who particularly suffered during the previous shutdown, saying this one would be a "small lockdown."

But many feared it would spell economic ruin. Amrit Tripathi, a laborer in New Delhi, was among the thousands who walked home for miles after India had abruptly announced a harsh and nationwide lockdown in 2020. "We will starve," he said, if the current lockdown is extended.

Doctors and officials say the measures are necessary to ease pressure on the fragile health system, which has been underfunded for decades. A failure to prepare for the current surge has left hospitals in New Delhi and other large cities crumbling under the pressure of mounting infections.

[The increase in cases in India is the greatest daily rise since the start of the pandemic.

"There are now more than 15 million infections reported, a total 2nd only to the United States. The Health Ministry also reported 1619 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 178 769. India has the 4th-highest number of deaths after the U.S., Brazil, and Mexico, though with nearly 1.4 billion people, it has a much larger population than any of those countries..." (excerpted from https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-india-coronavirus-pandemic-london-boris-johnson-01deb45893948bfae000f2e0cfc60ab3).

The pandemic situation in India is going from bad to worse and appears to be raging out of control like a wildfire. This 2nd wave that started in mid-February 2021 is now undoing the impressive progress made against the outbreak earlier.

The country has continued to report record numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths, with 2 73 810 new infections and 1619 deaths. This was the 10th record daily increase in Covid-19 cases in 11 days (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Covid-19-cases). The numbers of active cases have soared to 19 29 329. The country's deaths from Covid-19 rose by a record 1619 to reach a total of 178 769, according to health ministry data. The daily coronavirus positivity rate in India in the last 12 days has doubled to 16.69 per cent, while the weekly positivity rate has increased to 13.54 per cent in the past one month, the health ministry said on Sun 18 Apr 2021. In Delhi, the positivity rate soared to over 30%, which means that every one in 3 people getting tested for the infection was found to be positive.

On Sun 18 Apr 2021, 13 56 133 samples were tested, taking the total number to 26 78 94 549 (excerpted from https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-reports-record-273810-covid-19-cases-and-1619-deaths/articleshow/82138665.cms).

Currently, one in 5 infections in the world are in India, possibly in part related to its large population. - Mod.LK]

A survey by Wakayama Prefecture revealed that the rate of pneumonia among people in their 20s and 40s who were infected with a mutant strain in Wakayama Prefecture due to a new type of coronavirus infection has doubled compared to conventional strains. Severe cases of the same age have also appeared in mutant strains, and Takako Nojiri, director of the Prefectural Health and Welfare Department, said: "It shows a high risk of aggravation of mutant strains. Young people also need to be careful."

Of those infected during the month from 14 Mar 2021, which the prefecture designated as the "4th wave" of infection, 363 were screened for mutant strain infections, of which 205 (56.5). %) were confirmed. We compared and analyzed the symptoms of 207 people, including these 205 people, the remaining 158 people infected with the conventional strain, and 49 related positives, estimated to be the conventional strain.

The proportion of people with pneumonia was 41.5% (86 people) for the conventional strain and 40.5% (83 people) for the mutant strain, which was not much different overall. However, when compared between the age groups in their 20s and 40s, the conventional strain was 22.6% (14 out of 62 people), while the mutant strain was 43.3% (42 out of 97 people), which was about 20 points higher. Looking at the number of people by age group, the number of conventional strains was 30 for people in their 70s, while the number of mutant strains was 19 in people in their 40s, followed by 15 in people in their 20s and 50s, and many in the young and middle age group.

Furthermore, there were 10 people in their 20s and 40s who needed oxygen administration, which the prefecture considers to be a seriously ill person. The severity rate in 40-year-olds was 18.4%, and that in 30-year-olds was 13.3%, which was higher than for those in their 60s (11.1%). There are no seriously ill people in their 20s and 40s with conventional strains, and the prefecture said: "We will continue to accumulate data and analyze it.

[The variant strain is not defined but thought to be N501Y (KI).

The report is translated as "people in their 20s and 40s," which I must assume should read 20s-40s.

This is an important finding to disseminate to emphasize the vulnerability of young people, and not only old people, to severe disease, particularly from the more transmissible variants. - Mod.LK]
