South Korea: suspected case of mad cow disease
----------------------------------------------
The authorities are conducting an epidemic inspection on a suspected victim
of mad cow disease (BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy). A patient who
was hospitalized due to dementia symptoms at Soon Chun Hyang University
Hospital in Seoul on Fri [5 Jan 2006] showed symptoms consistent with those
of a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD in ProMED-mail], according to the hospital, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare on Monday
[16 Jan 2007].
An official of the hospital said the patient, a man in his 70s whose
identity was not disclosed, was confirmed to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) symptoms and has been hospitalized. "But the final checkup result
about whether he was infected with vCJD has not yet come out," the official
said. The hospital reported the case to the authorities, and the
authorities dispatched related experts to inspect the patient, as the
hospital did not have people and equipment needed for close examination of
vCJD.
People infected with vCJD have similar symptoms to that of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), so-called mad cow disease. With that
disease, brains develop holes like sponges. Those in their 20s or 30s
usually fall victim to the disease, and the patients have symptoms such as
madness, loss of eyesight and paralysis. They develop dementia and die
within one year. Currently, there is no cure.
People can get vCJD through eating beef infected with BSE. According to the
Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 75 people in
Korea from 2001 through last September [2006] who were suspected of having
the disease. Korea has had cases of CJD, which occurs from gene mutation,
but not a case of vCJD yet.

[No cases of vCJD have been reported from South Korea previously, and the
risk of exposure to BSE in East Asia is negligible unless the patient had
spent some time in the UK or France. The age of the patient is not typical
of vCJD, and without laboratory examination, the patient's illness could be
confused with sporadic CJD, familial CJD, iatrogenic CJD, or
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. Further information from
South Korea is awaited. - Mod.CP]
