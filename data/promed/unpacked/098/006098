Last week, 2 pigs died in a private holding in the village Boyarsk, 30 km from Smorgon. The owner immediately called the veterinarian. Pig carcasses were burned and buried. Currently, quarantine measures are being applied in the village, including prohibition of exported meat.

According to the deputy director of the District Veterinary Office, Elena Yakovleva, the cause of the pig deaths has not yet been established, but precautionary measures to prevent the potential spread of African swine fever [ASF] are being applied. This is also justified in view of earlier ASF cases in the Grodno [Hrodna] region of Belarus.

[Confirmation or otherwise of the reported ASF suspicions are requested. Russia has recently published a decision to lift, as of 9 Jan 2014, its temporary restrictions upon imports of pigs and porcine products from pig farms and meat-processing plants in Belarus' Brest Oblast (see at http://fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/8583.html?_language=en). - Mod.AS
