The new type of mosquito found in Merced County likes to live around people in urban residential areas and can carry four different types of diseases, including Zika, according to Merced County Mosquito Abatement District officials.

The mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, also known as the "yellow-fever mosquito," can transmit Zika, yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya [viruses]. As of [Tue 26 Sep 2017], there have not been any cases of Zika, dengue or yellow fever in Merced County, said Rhiannon Jones, general manager for the Merced County Mosquito Abatement.

As of [Fri 22 Sep 2017] there have been 593 cases of Zika throughout the state, according to Jones. Although there haven't been any local cases of these diseases transmitted by the mosquito - Jones said -; if someone in Merced County travels outside of the country and contracts one of these diseases the mosquito can get the disease and pass it to others. "That's why we're very concerned," she said. "The mosquito is the prime factor that spreads these diseases."

Dengue causes fever and, in the most severe cases, can be fatal. Chikungunya can cause fever and joint pain.

The mosquitoes are black and white, about a fourth of an inch [approx. 6 mm] long and prefer to feed on humans, Jones said. They also bite during the day, she said, and like to live around humans and their homes.

The yellow fever mosquitoes lay their eggs just above standing water, like pet bowls, plant saucers and bird baths, Jones said, and they advice people to drain any standing water around their homes.

The mosquito abatement also advices people to cover their skin as much as possible and use mosquito repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus.

If bitten, Jones said, watch the area for an allergic reaction and wash it with warm soapy water. People can also seek medical help is they find it necessary.

[_Aedes aegypti_ has been found in yet another county, Merced, in California. Although this is the 1st report of _Aedes aegypti_ in Merced County, its discovery there is not surprising. This mosquito has been popping up in various localities, mainly in southern California. As noted in previous posts, it was 1st discovered in the state in the counties of Madera, Fresno, and San Mateo in 2013, before turning up later in Tulare, Kern, Los Angeles, San Diego, Imperial, Orange, and Alameda counties. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1 to 4 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus transmission.

Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.

The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5344699,204. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/california-county-map.gif. - Mod.TY]
