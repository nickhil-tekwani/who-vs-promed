Russia: Increased Number of HFRS Cases Expected in Udmurtia
---------------------------------------------------
In 2003 there were 299 cases of HFRS [in Udmurtia], while this year [2004],
400 HFRS cases have already been registered.
According to preliminary assessments, the number of rodents has increased
significantly in comparison with 2003; the total rodent population is 3-fold
greater in 2004. Field voles, the carriers of HFRS, are particularly abundant.
Relatively warm winter weather and a good harvest have created the
best conditions for the early reproduction of rodents. According to
[epidemiologists], peaks in HFRS activity are observed every 3-4
years. The past 2 years have been relatively quiet, and the
expectation is that the incidence of HFRS will increase in 2004.
Most of the cases are in rural areas where many people are
agricultural workers and sanitary conditions are poor. Urban
residents can also become infected, especially if they have gardens
located near forested areas. The most active foci of HFRS infection
are forests, especially in lime tree forests, since lime tree seeds
[are attractive food for rodents]. 36% percent of all cases of HFRS
were recorded in the city of Izevsk.
