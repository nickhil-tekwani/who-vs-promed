Found this summary of Malaysian Newspaper Highlights from The Asia Pulse.
Will killing of all the pigs in the affected area stop the transmission of
both JEV and the Hendra-like virus? What about other intermediary hosts
and the population of infected Culex (JEV). The use of CO instead of more
blood-splattering techniques should theoretically reduce the potential
contact of humans with bodily fluids (Hendra-like virus), but are the pigs
the primary hosts?
A buffer zone to contain the spread of Japanese encephalitis virus will be
drawn up around the areas affected by the outbreak in Negri Sembilan. All
pigs within the zone will be destroyed using carbon monoxide.

[Through the kindness of many of our subscribers, ProMED-mail has received
numerous newspaper, BBC, and NY Times "reports". Because they are so
inaccurate and add nothing to the dialogue, I cannot in good conscience
post them. A report from the Philippines compares Japanese encephalitis
(JE) with foot and mouth disease, other reports call the Hendra-like virus
a "strain" of JE virus, and so on. With such irresponsible and ignorant
reporting it is no wonder these stories and the attendant panic are
self-propagating. See following message. - Mod.CHC

Malaysian authorities are expected to expand a pig culling campaign to
another state as fears grow over the spread of deadly Japanese encephalitis
and a second virus linked to pigs. Health officials said another person
has died of suspected encephalitis in the worst-hit central state of Negeri
Sembilan, bringing the total number of deaths blamed on the disease to 63.
The national Bernama news agency reported some 500 soldiers will begin
killing more than 10,000 pigs in Perak state where the outbreak of
encephalitis, carried by mosquitoes from pigs to humans, began in October.
The soldiers will join a 2,000-strong pig culling team that has been
shooting thousands of pigs in Negeri Sembilan daily since last week.
Veterinary department officials, with the help of foreign experts, examined
dozens of dead pigs in a pig-breeding region in central Selangor state,
several miles away from the country's new international Kuala Lumpur
airport. Petrified residents have been fleeing the pig-rearing village in
Sepang near the airport, fearing that an outbreak of encephalitis and a
second mysterious virus may be creeping near the capital. Troops in
protective gear and masks killed about 25,000 pigs in Negeri Sembilan on
Friday, bringing to 95,124 pigs the total killed so far. It was not clear
whether a plan to gas pigs en masse to speed up the planned culling of some
350,000 pigs had materialized on Friday. Officials were not immediately
available for comment. Health officials said 11 other people were admitted
into hospitals for treatment of suspected encephalitis, bringing the total
cases of infections to 182.
Deaths in pig-farming regions had long been linked to encephalitis. But
health director-general Abu Bakar Suleiman said on Friday that only 18
people were confirmed to have died from encephalitis, and the rest could
have been infected by a second virus that authorities know almost nothing
about.
Health experts from the United States, Australia and Taiwan have arrived in
Malaysia to help study the second virus, believed to be related to the
Hendra virus carried by fruit bats. It killed two people and 15 horses in
Australia during outbreaks in 1994 and 1995.

[The following advice was given by the Malaysian Director-General of Health
on what to look for in pigs infected by the Hendra-like virus. This is the
first official description of the clinical signs of infected pigs. See
earlier posting on unofficial descriptions
Pig farmers and pig-farm workers have been advised to watch out for unusual
disease signs in pigs like sows with heavy breathing or loud coughing in
great distress which can be heard far away, followed by death.
