The Whatcom County Health Department (WCHD) in Bellingham, Washington [state], investigated an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infections. The Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] assisted with the investigation.

Environmental contamination with _E. coli_ O157:H7 of the Dairy Barn at the Northwest Washington Fairgrounds was the likely source of this outbreak. All of the ill people either attended the Milk Makers Fest between 21 and 23 Apr 2015 at the Northwest Fairgrounds; helped with the event between 20 and 24 Apr 2015 or were close contacts of people associated with the event. Most of the ill people were children, including older children who helped with the event. More than 1000 children from primary schools in Whatcom County attended the event on these days.

The investigation team greatly appreciates the time and support of many community stakeholders who made this work possible, including Whatcom County schools, teachers, parents, students, Whatcom County Dairy Women, Northwest Washington Fair, and clinical and lab providers.

Final case counts
-----------------
Disease investigators calculated case counts based only on lab-confirmed infection with _E. coli_ O157:H7 or physician-diagnosed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure:
- 25 people were confirmed cases;
- 9 of these cases were considered secondary cases (the ill person didn't attend the event but had close contact with someone who did attend);
- no one died;
- 10 people were hospitalized;
- 6 people developed HUS.

Final environmental sampling results
------------------------------------
Multiple samples from the environment where the event was held were collected on 2 different days (30 Apr 2015 and 13 May 2015) and submitted for laboratory testing. The samples indicated that several areas of the north end of the Dairy Barn at the Northwest Washington Fairgrounds were contaminated with the same strain of _E. coli_ that made people ill. Negative results do not rule out contamination in other parts of the barn.

The outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 was identified in the following areas of the Dairy Barn:
- manure bunker;
- hay maze area;
- bleachers [open-air seating. - Mod.SH] by east wall;
- bleachers by west wall.

Contamination of the environment most likely occurred before the Milk Makers Fest. Any environment where animals have been kept, such as barns, should be considered contaminated. _E. coli_ O157 can survive in the environment up to 42 weeks (Varma, 2003 JAMA).

Epidemiologic investigation findings
------------------------------------
As part of the investigation, officials interviewed many of the confirmed cases to find out what they did during the event before they got ill. Officials also interviewed "controls", meaning people who attended the Milk Makers Fest but did not get ill to find out what they might have done differently.

The results of analyzing the data collected during the interviews are not final, but a few preliminary findings stand out:
- event attendees who reported washing or sanitizing their hands before eating lunch were less likely to become ill;
- children who reported always biting their nails were more likely to become ill;
- leaving animal areas without washing hands might have contributed to an increased risk of transmission;
- eating in animal areas might have contributed to an increased risk of transmission.

Recommendations for event organizers
------------------------------------
- evaluate and update plans for cleaning and disinfection before, during, and after events, particularly surfaces with high levels of hand contact (such as seats, door or fence handles, and hand railings);
- evaluate and update measures to restrict access to areas more likely to be contaminated with animal manure. This is especially important for people at higher risk for severe illness. These people include young children, pregnant women, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems;
- ensure access to handwashing facilities with soap, running water, and disposable towels;
- display signs and use other reminders to attendees to wash hands when leaving animal areas;
- store, prepare, or serve food and beverages only in non-animal areas.

Recommendations for the public
------------------------------
- consider any environment where animals have been kept, such as barns, to be contaminated with bacteria or viruses that can make people ill;
- hands should always be washed immediately when exiting animal areas, after removing dirty clothing or shoes, and before eating or drinking. Handwashing with soap, running water, and disposable towels is the most effective method. Adults should always supervise young children while they wash their hands;
- food and beverages should be consumed in non-animal areas and only after washing hands first;
- be aware that objects such as clothing, shoes, and stroller wheels can become soiled and serve as a source of germs after leaving an animal area.

9 secondary cases were reported during this outbreak. It's important for people infected with _E. coli_ or those with a family member infected with _E. coli_ to follow these precautions to prevent secondary infection:
- wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after using the restroom or changing a child's diaper;
- wash your hands before and after preparing food for yourself and others;
- stay home from school or work while diarrhea persists; most people can return to work or school when they no longer have diarrhea. Special precautions are needed for food handlers, health care workers, and child care providers and attendees. Check with your employer before returning to work, and check with your child's child care center before resuming child care.

[This outbreak was notable for the higher percentage of cases associated with HUS, usually 10 per cent or less, and for a substantial number of secondary cases.

It remains unclear if the environment was contaminated before the event setup began, as one of the 1st cases occurred in a teenager who helped with the hay maze before the event began. The bleachers could have been contaminated secondarily during the event. No information was given if the animals from the petting zoo were culture positive for the pathogen, so they were likely not. The risk factors identified parallel those warned against in the recommendations below.

CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised."
