We would like to respond to the posting below from Merritt Clifton published on ProMED on 22 Oct 2015 (PRO/AH> Rabies - Indonesia (09): (BA) canine, comment, Archive Number: 20151022.3735706).

Our response is this: "On the subject of numbers of human rabies deaths in India, we would refer the interested reader to peer-reviewed publications rather than their interpretation and misrepresentation as presented in this thread.

Table 1 from the 2003 WHO-sponsored National Multicentric Rabies Survey (Sudarshan et al., 2007) reported between 300 and 400 human rabies deaths per year (from 1992-2002) from the records of 22 infectious disease hospitals, and between 700-900 probable cases based on clinical criteria from these same hospitals. Over half of the patients classified as probable cases left these hospitals against medical advice so were not recorded as deaths.

In contrast to the reporting in this thread, the 235 deaths in this study were the rabies deaths identified by follow up community-based surveys, calculated to cover a population of 10.8 million. Of these, the majority (79.1 percent) did not receive any post-exposure vaccine and, therefore, did not access health services.

The aim of the multicentric study was to estimate the incidence of human rabies in India based on the most reliable data from these community surveys (to reduce the effect of recall bias). The study abstract reports: "The annual incidence of human rabies was estimated to be 17 137 (95 percent CI 14 109 to 20 165). Based on expert group advice, an additional 20 percent was added to this to include paralytic/atypical forms of rabies, providing an estimate of 20 565 or about 2 per 100 000 population."

A more recent independent study based on verbal autopsy suggested that in 2005, there were 12 700 (99 percent CI 10 000 to 15 500) symptomatically identifiable furious rabies deaths in India (Suraweera et al., 2012).

These are estimates extrapolated from extensive investigations but nonetheless representing only a sample of India's overall population. The findings of more recent global modelling studies are also based on extrapolations from limited data (GBD Mortality Causes of Death Collaborators, 2014; Hampson et al., 2015). As expected, given their different methods and underlying data sources, the point estimates of human rabies deaths in these studies differ. Nonetheless, all estimate that tens of thousands of human rabies deaths occur in India each year.

Rabies is a fatal disease. People who arrive at a hospital leave when there is no treatment that can be offered. Moreover, the 22 hospitals in this study were accessible to only a small fraction of rabies victims throughout India. Active surveillance has identified considerable underreporting of rabies (as evidenced by the Sudarshan and other studies around the world). Until official surveillance data are reliable enough for accurate recording of human rabies cases in canine rabies-endemic countries, estimates are, sadly, the best information that we have. Relying on recorded data known to be inadequate and not using all available information severely under-represents the scale of the rabies problem and does a disservice to the victims of rabies globally.

Misrepresenting evidence is misleading, and repeating the same assertions does not make them true. Rather, it risks the reputation of the ProMED forum as a source of reliable information to the global health community.

First of all, we have already been around almost exactly this same mulberry bush several times before, most recently on 18-23 Apr 2015; see 20150420.3309817.

My focal point then was that where 17 000 or 20 000 or 21 000 bodies were claimed to exist, fewer than 250 could be found. The burden of proof is on the persons making the claim to find them. Exercises in math based on presumptive projection are no substitute for forensic evidence in bringing a murder charge, and should not be substituted for forensic evidence in allocating resources in disease control either.

The only noteworthy addition to Louise Taylor's argument is that she has shifted from relying on GARC's own publications, which are based on presumptive projection, to relying on Suraweera W, Morris SK, Kumar R, et al, in "Deaths from Symptomatically Identifiable Furious Rabies in India: A Nationally Representative Mortality Survey. 2012: PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6 (10); e1847. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001847," which is also based on presumptive projection.

Suraweera et al used a survey method called "verbal autopsy," which in law would be called relying on hearsay, and in reputable journalism would be called relying on 2nd-hand sources.

The "verbal autopsy" method consisted basically of asking people: "Did anyone in your family die within the past couple of years, and if so, from what?"

Unlike an actual autopsy, no body was present. No one with actual diagnostic or forensic expertise confirmed the symptoms with any sort of testing of physical evidence. Deaths were simply presumed to be more-or-less from whatever the respondents said they were from.

What happens when one interviews anyone after the fact about anything? First of all, there is a high margin of error, no matter what is being described, because memories are inexact. The more complex the subject, the higher the margin of error becomes. The margin of error is multiplied further when the interviewees are poorly educated, perhaps even illiterate, and not familiar with the range of plausible explanations for the observed phenomena.

Under that circumstance, the interviewees typically reach for the explanation familiar to them (history of dog bite within several months, high fever, followed by death = rabies, well-known and widely publicized in India for more than 150 years) instead of the explanation less familiar to them (history of mosquito bites, which everyone gets often and tends to not remember, high fever, followed by death = Japanese encephalitis, probably occurring in India for decades but only relatively recently medically recognized and still practically unknown to most of the public.)

Given the reality that mosquito bites outnumber dog bites in India by many millions to one, a statement like this from Taylor means nothing at all: "In contrast to the reporting in this thread, the 235 deaths in this study were the rabies deaths identified by follow up community-based surveys, calculated to cover a population of 10.8 million. Of these, the majority (79.1 percent) did not receive any post-exposure vaccine and, therefore, did not access health services."

If the cause of death was something transmitted by mosquitoes, such as Japanese encephalitis, or by any other insect or tick vector for febrile disease (to name just a couple of possibilities), whether the victims received post-exposure vaccination for rabies would be completely irrelevant.

Again, I want to see a "writ of rabies corpus:" show us the bodies.

[Patently, we have a definition difference for a case of human rabies in a situation where public health records are not as rigorous as one might hope for, though the pathology is sound. But I think we can agree that if canine rabies were properly controlled in India, as it has been in many counties, it would cease to be a public health problem or even a veterinary problem. This is long, long overdue.

I must reluctantly cut this thread at this point and leave it to my academic colleagues to continue it in their graduate classrooms, because their students will face the realities in their future professional lives. - Mod.MHJ]

[I would add that while completely accurate counts of human rabies cases are unlikely to be found in the developing world where most cases occur, the overwhelmingly prevalent view of global health authorities in both the human and animal sectors favors the higher estimates put forth by the Global Alliance for Rabies Control in the correspondence from Louise Taylor and Katie Hampson. Peer reviewed literature also appears to support these alarmingly high estimates.

Until further evidence develops, we will cut this thread. - Mod.LM
