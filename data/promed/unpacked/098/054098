Guinea Bissau has been hit by the highly contagious infection measles disease as 12 out of 29 suspected cases appeared positive after a test, the Minister of the Public Health Service (Valentina Mendes) confirmed [Thu 19 Mar 2015]. Appealing for general mobilization, the health official has urged the general populations to abide by the instructions of the health professionals and asked parents to take their children who show signs of the disease to the closest health facilities in a bid to ensure early diagnosis and adequate treatment.

The suspected cases whose blood showed measles symptoms come from Bafata eastern region (7 cases), Tombali in the South (2 cases), Cacheu up North (1 case), and Bissau, the capital (2 cases).

Large outbreaks of measles and other preventable infectious diseases could occur in West Africa due to the collapse of health systems in Ebola-ravaged countries, according to a recent report. With the region's medical systems in shambles, deaths from other infectious diseases could equal or surpass those caused by Ebola, says Justin Lessler, coauthor of the paper and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore, the US.

Lessler and his colleagues base their predictions on mathematical models, said report published [Thu 12 Mar 2015]. While West Africa has recently made progress against Ebola, the battle against the virus has drained resources from other parts of the health system.

Childhood immunizations programs have ground to a standstill in some places, Lessler says. Although the health system has rebounded slightly as the number of Ebola cases has ebbed, Lessler and his colleagues estimate that vaccination programs have reached at least 25 percent fewer children than usual. For every month that immunization programs are disrupted, thousands of children are left vulnerable to measles, one of the most contagious of all viruses, according to Lessler. Measles outbreaks often follow natural and humanitarian disasters, he observes.

Measles is already circulating in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the 3 countries hardest hit by Ebola. Liberia alone has had at least 180 cases of measles, says Mit Philips, health policy analyst at Doctors Without Borders, who recently visited the country. A regional measles outbreak could affect 20 000 more people today than before the Ebola outbreak, which began in December 2013, simply because there are so many more unvaccinated children. Up to 4000 additional lives could be lost, Lessler says.

Measles, which spreads through the air, is far more contagious than Ebola, which spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids.

Worldwide, measles killed 82 100 people in 2013.

The health systems of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were weak even before the Ebola outbreak. Liberia had only 51 physicians for a population of 4.3 million, according to a report, while in 2013 Sierra Leone had the highest infant mortality rate in the world, with more than 1 of every 100 babies dying at birth, the World Bank said.

UNICEF has started a campaign to vaccinate children against measles in the Ebola-stricken countries.

As of 15 Mar 2015, about 18 00 suspected measles cases, including 803 confirmed fatal cases have been recorded in 12 Sudanese states. According to the Federal Ministry of Health, the majority of deaths were reported in North, West, and East Darfur.

The Ministry, in cooperation with the Sudanese Association of Paediatricians, has finalised measles case management guidelines that will be distributed to medical staff in health facilities throughout the country, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reported in its latest weekly bulletin.

The WHO and UNICEF are supporting the Health Ministry in the "implementation of the initial response and containment measures in West and North Darfur, including case management, investigations, surveillance, and community health awareness." A request for funding will soon be submitted to the Central Emergency Response Fund to support the response.

Kyrgyzstan initiates mass vaccination campaign as measles cases continue to soar
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to a large-scale measles outbreak, Kyrgyzstan will initiate a mass measles vaccination campaign on 16 Mar 2015, targeting over 2 million people aged 1-20 years in the country. The outbreak, which began in early 2014, has caused over 11 300 suspected cases to date and continues to increase by 120-250 suspected cases every day.

The 1st phase of the campaign focuses on 7 to 20-year-olds in the capital city of Bishkek and in Chui Oblast, which are the age group and areas most affected. The 2nd phase, planned for April-May 2015, will target children under 7 years of age in these areas and children and adolescents under 20 years of age in the rest of Kyrgyzstan.

Support from WHO and UNICEF
---------------------------
After a dramatic increase in daily reported cases in November 2014, the Measles and Rubella Initiative Outbreak Response Fund provided USD 500 000 for the outbreak response and other emergency needs in Kyrgyzstan. The funds were provided through WHO/Europe to cover the operational costs of the supplementary immunization activities. Another USD 1.9 million were provided for the bundled vaccine for measles and rubella and USD 250 000 for communication and social mobilization activities for the outbreak response through the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

WHO and UNICEF have been providing communication and logistics support to the Government in preparation for the campaign. National spokespersons have been trained by WHO to communicate effectively with the media and health-care workers have received training on how to vaccinate correctly and safely.

Call to action
--------------
The outbreak in Kyrgyzstan is one of several ongoing outbreaks in the WHO European Region. The country's decision to initiate the mass immunization campaign comes in the wake of a call on 25 Feb 2015 by WHO Regional Director for Europe Zsuzsanna Jakab for policy-makers, health-care workers and parents to immediately step up vaccination against measles across age groups at risk to stop the outbreaks.

Serious threat to Region-wide elimination
-----------------------------------------
Measles is one of the most readily transmitted communicable diseases and among the most deadly of all childhood rash/fever illnesses. However, it can be prevented with safe, effective and inexpensive vaccines.

All 53 Member Countries of the WHO European Region include the measles vaccine in their routine immunization schedules. In 2010, they unanimously committed to eliminating measles and rubella by the end of 2015. The current resurgence in cases points to persistent gaps in immunization coverage at the subnational level that must be addressed in order for the Region to achieve this target.

A pre-school in Sumner, Christchurch has reported a case of measles. A 2-year-old girl enrolled at Pebbles Montessori and Pebbles Preschool had contracted the highly infectious disease (measles), centre director Belinda Slade said. The case was confirmed at 5 pm on [Wed 18 Mar 2015].

About 80 children were enrolled across both preschools. On the preschool's Facebook page parents were advised to keep children who had not been immunised away until 1 Apr 2015. Slade said the affected girl had received her 1st measles vaccine.

The Sumner case comes just 10 days after the Canterbury District Health Board confirmed a Christchurch child had been diagnosed with measles. That case was believed to be the 1st case of measles in the region since 2011.

Measles starts with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat. It is followed by a rash that spreads over the body. Measles virus is highly contagious and spreads through the air through coughing and sneezing.

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Daniel Williams urged parents to ensure children were immunised. "We need to keep lifting our rates of immunisation across the board if we are to be successful in eradicating measles."
