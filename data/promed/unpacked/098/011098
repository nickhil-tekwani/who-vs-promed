New outbreaks (41)
Outbreak 1: Ixtlan del Rio, Nayarit

Outbreak status: resolved 23 Mar 2019
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 63 / 21 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: 14 farms: 13 with working animals and one with 2 sporting animals. Only one animal showed clinical signs (ataxia and incoordination), and 21 were positive through RT-PCR.

Outbreak 3: Jala, Nayarit
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Mar 2019
Outbreak status: resolved 25 Mar 2019
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: A farm with a pet animal positive through RT-PCR but without clinical signs.

Outbreak cluster 4: Ixtlan del Rio, Nayarit (25 outbreaks)
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Mar 2019
Outbreak status: resolved 22 Mar 2019
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 101 / 25 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: 25 farms: 21 with working animals, 2 with sporting animals, 2 with show animals and one with breeding animals. Only 2 animals showed clinical signs (ataxia and incoordination), and one died.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 41
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 195 / 53 / 7 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 27.18 / 3.59 / 13.21 / 3.59
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors, contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: Following the index outbreak, a 10-km [6.2 mi] zone around the outbreak was established; 47 positive animals have so far been identified through RT-PCR. RT-PCR was immediately carried out in the nearest official laboratory, located in El Salto, Jalisco. Virus isolation has not been achieved. Wild birds, domestic birds and mosquitoes are being monitored, without conclusive results. Mosquitoes from the genus _Culex tarsalis_, the main vector of the disease, were identified. The health sector has been informed and maintains surveillance in humans without having detected any cases so far. Epidemiological surveillance has been strengthened at national level.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; vector surveillance; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: SENASICA Biosafety Laboratory Level 3 (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Equidae / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 6 Mar 2019 / positive
Equidae / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 25 Mar 2019 / positive
Equidae / virus isolation / 11 Mar 2019 / positive
Equidae / virus isolation / 27 Mar 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) viruses are members of the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family Togaviridae. The natural ecology for virus maintenance occurs via alternate infection of birds and ornithophilic mosquitoes. EEE virus has also been isolated from snakes, and these may have a role as reservoir hosts. Clinical disease may be observed in humans and horses, both of which are dead-end hosts for these agents.

EEE has been diagnosed in Quebec and Ontario in Canada, central and eastern regions of the United States of America (USA), the Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and Central and South America. Disease caused by the WEE virus has been reported in the western USA and Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America.

Even though the mortality is lower for WEE, the clinical signs of EEE and WEE can be identical. The disease caused by either virus is also known as sleeping sickness. Following an incubation period of 5-14 days, clinical signs include fever, anorexia, and depression. A presumptive diagnosis of EEE or WEE virus infection in unvaccinated horses can be made if the characteristic somnolence is observed during the summer in temperate climates or the wet season in tropical and subtropical climates, when the mosquito vector is plentiful. However, a number of other diseases, such as West Nile virus and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, produce similar clinical signs and the diagnosis must be confirmed by the described diagnostic test methods.

WEE virus infection in horses is often observed over a wide geographical area, e.g. sporadic cases over 1000 square miles [259 000 hectares]. EEE virus infections are usually observed in limited geographical areas. Isolated events of high mortality in captive-raised game birds, primarily pheasants, chukars, aquarium penguins, and quail have been traced to WEE, EEE, or Highlands J virus infection. Most encephalomyelitis infections in domestic fowl are caused by EEE virus and occur on the east coast states of the USA. The virus is introduced by mosquitoes, but transmission within the flocks is primarily by feather picking and cannibalism. Both EEE and WEE viruses have caused a fatal disease in ratites. Haemorrhagic enteritis has been observed in emus infected with EEE and WEE viruses, and morbidity and mortality rates may be greater than 85 percent.

EEE virus causes severe disease in humans with a mortality rate of 30-70 percent and a high frequency of permanent sequelae in patients who survive. WEE is usually mild in adult humans, but can be a severe disease in children. The fatality rate is between 3 and 14 percent. Severe infection and death caused by EEE and WEE viruses have been reported in laboratory workers. Laboratory manipulations should be carried out at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis. It is recommended that personnel be immunised against EEE and WEE viruses. Precautions should also be taken to prevent human infection when performing post-mortem examinations on horses suspected of being infected with the equine encephalomyelitis viruses."
