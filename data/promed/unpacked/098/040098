The discovery of African swine fever (ASF) in wild boar has created a large intricate loophole in China's prevention program of the epizootic. The 1st case was discovered in Jilin province in a dead wild boar. Experts say that if a large-scale killing of infected wild boar is applied, it will lead to wild boars fleeing to neighboring regions, causing ASF to spread to North Korea, which borders Jilin. The wild boar death occurred at the junction of Changbai Mountain and North Korea [see map at https://tinyurl.com/yaytbh8f].

Since the start of ASF in China, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has issued a warning that the outbreaks in mainland China will almost inevitably spread to other Asian countries. FAO chief veterinary officer Lubroth said: "Unfortunately, what we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg."

At present, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan have detected the ASF virus in pork products brought from mainland China. Countries that border mainland China are strictly preventing and controlling the invasion of the epidemic.

ASF has spread to 18 provinces and autonomous regions in China, covering more than half of the country. Some breeders have revealed that because of the high cost, current pork production does not accurately monitor each pig. This poses a risk of infected pork entering the market. It is understood that many people in mainland China have now reduced their consumption of pork and pork products.

Recently, mainland epidemic prevention and control personnel responsible for preventing and controlling ASF revealed to the outside world that the epidemic is much more serious than imagined. Such information leakage is considered an offense in China.

If the information on the site where the dead, ASF-infected wild boar was found ("at the junction of Changbai Mountain and North Korea") is correct, this may mean that the virus is likely to be already circulating among wild boar within North Korea, or will be soon. A map showing the location of the Changbai Mountain is available at https://tinyurl.com/yaytbh8f.

Earlier, 3 outbreaks of ASF have been reported from Jilin to the OIE, affecting domestic pigs in the following 3 locations (in parentheses, the start date of the respective outbreak):
1. Daxing Village, Nanweizi Township, Gongzhuling, Jilin (17 Sep 2018)
2. Liangwo Village, Liushui Township, Changling, Songyuan, Jilin (25 Sep 2018)
3. Dama Village, Laotougou Township, Longjing City, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin (2 Nov 2018).

The 3rd recent outbreak is of particular interest, located close to the North Korean border. For the locations of all 3 outbreaks, see OIE's global, interactive ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/yctt3gux (click on North Korea/Jilin, zoom in).The Dama village (outbreak 3 above) is the most eastern of the 3 Jilin outbreaks.
