Summary of the presentation given to the "International Symposium on Preventing the Dissemination of Infectious Animal Diseases on Climate Change" Salekhard, Yamal 9-11 2016 by Bob Gainer, DVM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
My expertise is as an experienced practitioner with 40 years of involvement in anthrax outbreaks and a MSc on the population effects of the disease on wildebeest in Africa. In Africa I visited several well known anthrax areas and when I moved back to Canada I became involved in the anthrax at Wood Buffalo National Park. As a practitioner I noticed gruesome environmental conditions, especially insect, associated with these outbreaks and knew it would have reduced the host population's resistance. Anthrax became a fascination or hobby that I would read every article I could on. When I retired, I traveled to Yamal [Yamal-Nenets Autonomous district in northwest Siberia] in January 2016, hired a guide in Salekhard, toured abattoirs, talked to several veterinary technicians and a practitioner. Based on that trip I wrote a note on Yamal and anthrax in the Canadian Vet J. [references below. - Mod.MHJ]

What I learned about Yamal was that it had the most spectacular anthrax outbreaks of them all. Reports said it would sometimes kill 1/3 of the reindeer in the area, or that it ruined the reindeer meat industry; and there were many hundreds of thousands of reindeer in the area. An enormous number of animals died. In Russia, a country with plenty of anthrax, it was famous and became known as Yamal disease. About 1925 the government started mass vaccination of farm animals and reindeer [with a Pasteur-type vaccine], and disposal of carcasses in permafrost pits. 15 years later, 1941, a very cold year, was the last year the disease was reported. The mass vaccinations were stopped and for 75 years the disease did not return, until the extremely hot summer of 2016. This is by far the most successful anthrax control program I know of.

The origin of the note I wrote on Yamal and anthrax was 2 articles written by GV Kolonin in a Russian Journal in 1969 and 1971 based on the geographic distribution of the disease in Russia. He said that the soil was unsuitable for the maintenance of the spore in the north and that mass vaccination eliminated the host's maintenance and source of infection for outbreaks. That meant insects were both transmitters of the disease and reducers of the populations' resistance creating the necessary conditions for outbreaks of the peracute form. The success in Yamal was because the vaccination eliminated the host as the maintainer and source of the infection, and the type of soil was such that it eliminated itself as the source and maintainer of the spore. This may be circumstantial evidence but it fit.

It is obvious that the Russian knowledge of how to deal with the disease in Yamal is extremely effective. If an organization is needed to deal with this problem they would be the 1st choice. A suggestion I might make is to use the modern abattoir system to monitor the presence of the [silent] disease by collecting blood samples for antibody testing from approximately 10 percent of otherwise healthy animals and culturing retropharyngeal lymph nodes from approximately 1 percent.

On a personal note, after the Symposium was over, I thought I detected a concern from the Russian and Yamal authorities with the natives living on the land amidst their reindeer herds with anthrax, and their health risk. It is not the bogeyman, hysterical disease that media sometimes portray it as, with animals or with people. With myself and 5 staff in Africa, we all got the cutaneous form of the disease and it responded overnight to one injection of "long acting" veterinary benzathine/procaine penicillin (because of isolation it was our only resort). Other non staff in the surrounding area would have also contracted the disease from handling or eating the carcasses and most would have recovered without any antibiotics. Medical staff in the Yamal native communities, I am sure, would be able to deal with 95 percent of the cutaneous and much of the intestinal anthrax with amoxicillin or other basic, inexpensive antibiotics.

[The rapid efficiency of the 1925-1941 campaign when, according to Bob's CVJ [Canadian Vet J.] article, at best only 20 percent of the reindeer were vaccinated annually, would add strength to Kolonin's hypothesis that the continued outbreaks depended on latent infections in the reindeer. Raised summer temperatures would reduce the innate resistance in the latent-infected reindeer which would be unable to withstand the spore germinations. Added to which they were severely stressed by the hoards of insects, which would also transfer the infections to other reindeer.

Animals with silent/subclinical exposures will have antibody titres way higher than one expects to see in animals that have been merely vaccinated. Anthrax antibodies are temporary but any previously vaccinated animal naturally exposed will demonstrate an anamnestic response. And the present Russian Sterne-type vaccine is far better and safer than the old Pasteur vaccines.

If you want to read Bob's CVJ article it is presently unavailable on the CVJ website. They insist on a 6-month delay. But many vet school libraries have the journal in hard copy. And thanks to Bob for sharing his Russian experiences in Ob and at the Salekhard workshop. - Mod.MHJ
