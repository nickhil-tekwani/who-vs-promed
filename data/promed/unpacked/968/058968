An equine neurological disease caused by a virus has been confirmed in a horse from Northern Virginia. State Veterinarian Dr. Richard Wilkes says the horse was euthanized on Fri 11 Apr 2014.

The horse lived on a farm in The Plains in Fauquier County. Wilkes says an investigation by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't find any other horses displaying signs of the disease, equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, or fevers. But horses on the farm will remain under quarantine for 21 to 28 days from the last exposure to the virus.

Horse owners are advised to continue practicing strict biosecurity measures. The disease is often fatal. It is caused by equine herpesvirus-1. Signs may include a fever, nasal discharge, wobbly gait, hind-end weakness, and dribbling of urine.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
