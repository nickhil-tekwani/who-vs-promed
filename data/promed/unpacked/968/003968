Influenza Update N 203
--------------------

Summary
--------
- In North America, influenza activity remained high in recent weeks with A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant.

- In Europe, a slight increase in influenza activity has been observed, which may indicate the start of the influenza season.

- In China, influenza activity continued to increase with influenza (H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B co-circulating.

- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low.

- In countries of tropical areas, variable influenza activity was reported.

Based on FluNet reporting (as of 23 Jan 2014, 13:25 UTC), during weeks 1 to 2 (29 Dec 2013 to 11 Jan 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 72 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 81 261 specimens. 24 494 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 22 425 (91.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 2069 (8.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 11 033 (80.5 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2669 (19.5 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 220 (84 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 42 (16 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-------------------------------------
North America
In North America, influenza activity remained high with A(H1N1)pdm09 the predominant virus detected. This differs from the 2012-2013 season when A(H3N2) was predominant.

Canada continued to experience increased influenza activity. Canadian surveillance data from laboratory detections, hospitalizations, and antiviral prescriptions show a larger proportion of cases among 20-64 year olds compared to those over 65, which is a change from the 2012-2013 season. Over 90 percent of laboratory detections this season have been A(H1N1)pdm09, compared to 10 percent in 2012-13.

In the United States of America (USA), influenza activity remained high. In the 2nd week of January 2014, the proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 3.6 percent, which is above the national baseline of 2.0 percent. Most regions reported widespread geographic spread of influenza, and ILI activity was high in several southern and southwestern states. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was above the epidemic threshold, and 10 pediatric deaths were attributed to influenza. The proportion of ICU admissions for influenza was 19.4 percent of those hospitalized compared to 15.7 percent, 16.6 percent and 18 percent in previous seasons. Of the tested specimens in the USA, influenza A was the predominant virus, and A(H1N1)pdm09 was the subtype detected most frequently.

Europe
In the European region, influenza activity increased in the beginning of January 2014 compared to recent weeks, which may indicate the beginning of the influenza season. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses circulated throughout the region with variability in predominance among different countries. Consultation rates for ILI and acute respiratory infection (ARI) remained at low levels in most countries. Increasing numbers of hospitalised laboratory-confirmed and fatal influenza cases have been reported in the last few weeks in western European countries.

Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal and Spain reported medium intensity of influenza, and Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom reported geographically widespread activity. Of the specimens reported to WHO EURO, influenza A viruses remained predominant, accounting for 95 percent of tested samples. Of the subtyped A influenza viruses, 45 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 55 percent A(H3N2).

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
In Central and Western Asia, increased influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey in beginning of January 2014. Egypt experienced an increase in A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, and Turkey experienced increases of A(H3N2) activity. Influenza activity remained low in the remainder of the region.

Eastern Asia
In the Asian region in the beginning of January 2014, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the predominant subtype detected with increased influenza activity reported in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. In China, the influenza activity in both the south and north remained at high levels and was still increasing. The dominant subtypes of influenza viruses detected were A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 in south China, and A(H1N1)pdm09 in north China. In the Republic of Korea, the proportion of patients who visited sentinel physicians for ILI remained at 27.3 percent, which is above the national baseline of 12.1 percent.

Countries in the tropical zone
---------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and tropical areas of South America was at low levels.

Central African tropical region
In the African tropical region, influenza activity was reported from the central and western regions with detections of all 3 subtypes. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was detected in Madagascar.

Tropical Asia
Influenza activity in southern Asia was generally low with a decreasing trend. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran reported increasing influenza detections since mid-November 2014.

Influenza activity in Southeast Asia varied among countries but overall was rather low. Influenza detections increased in Singapore, while the rate of acute respiratory infections was below the national threshold.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
-----------------------------
In the southern hemisphere the season is over, and all indicators are at interseasonal level.

There is now a marked difference between the situation in North America, where the Northern hemisphere winter seasonal outbreak is in full swing, and elsewhere. In the North American outbreak, the H1N1(pdm09) virus predominates, whereas elsewhere, H3N2 virus, or rarely B type virus, may predominate. No novel antigenically distinctive virus types have appeared, and the current Northern hemisphere vaccine is appropriate for infection control. There is some evidence of increased severity, however, locally in some US states. - Mod.CP
