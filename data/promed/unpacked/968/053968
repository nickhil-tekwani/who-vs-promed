MAF Investigating "Balclutha Horse Syndrome"
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has isolated two
neighbouring properties near Balclutha, while it investigates an unexplained
ailment among horses there. The ailment has been dubbed "Balclutha Horse
Syndrome" in the interim.
Of the 29 horses on one property, 15 have small shallow ulcers on their
tongues and gums, and two have small, coldsore-like blisters, on their gums.
Three horses on the adjacent property all have lesions in their mouths. The
horses in question are otherwise healthy and blood tests from them have been
normal.
Restricted place notices has been served on the properties, which means no
movements in or out are permitted while the cause of the problem is
investigated. The Ministry stressed that this was a routine investigation
which is carried out in New Zealand whenever animals suffer unexplained
illness or ailments.
An equine specialist from Massey University, Dr Harry Pearce, who has been
brought in by MAF to examine the horses, does not believe the lesions and
blisters are cause for concern. Dr Pearce said mouth ulcers and small
blisters are common in New Zealand and those found in Balclutha are within
the normal range. He said the cause could be equine herpes, which is endemic
(i.e. well-established and widespread) in this country and around the world.
Dr Pearce said horses at the properties had been brought together from
around the country and the resulting stress could have triggered the herpes.
Preliminary results from samples sent to MAF's central animal health
laboratory at Wallaceville have found no evidence of exotic virus. However,
further tests are being carried out in both New Zealand and the United
Kingdom to confirm these results.
Results of the tests to confirm herpes and to check for other viruses are
not expected until late next week at the earliest
Meanwhile, other possible causes of the ailment are being investigated,
including a reaction to a natural plant toxin or a contaminant in the feed.
Tests are being carried out on water and feed samples, and a plant
toxicologist is investigating possible toxic plants at the properties.
Results from these tests expected before the end of the week.
In the meantime, quarantine on the properties will be maintained. Horses
recently moved from the properties in question, and other horses which may
have had recent contact with horses from the properties, have been traced,
checked and cleared.
