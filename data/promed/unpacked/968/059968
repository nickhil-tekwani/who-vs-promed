Mystery fish disease causing concern
------------------------------------
Ulcerated fish have been caught in and around Tea Gardens adding to concerns about the health of the Myall River. Myall River Action group spokesman Gordon Grainger said those in the area thought the illness may have been red spot which appeared in the lower lakes system 3 years ago [2009] due to low salinity levels.

Myall Coast Nota contacted fisheries for further comment about the possible cause and frequency of the ulcerated fish but had not received a reply by the time of print. But it was reported that New South Wales (NSW) Fisheries had ruled out red spot and said the cause was an "unidentified disease." Mr Webb, who sells fishing supplies said he had about 5 separate customers come back to see him, questioning the red sores on the fish they had caught.

"I have lived and fished here all of my life, which is over 40 years, and I have never seen anything to this extent," he said. "It's a bit concerning when it could cause a downturn in tourism."

Caretaker at the Myall River Camp Graham Winn said a number of campers were also catching fish with ulcers. "If people can't eat the fish then there is no point in fishing," he said.

Anyone who catches an ulcerated fish should contact NSW fisheries.

[Skin lesions in fish can be caused by a variety of infectious and noninfectious insults. Lesions commonly are caused by opportunistic pathogens, which infect weakened or stressed hosts. These pathogens, which include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites, may gain entry because of impaired immune or disease resistance factors, or because the natural defense mechanisms of the skin are impaired or breached.

The lesion seen in a photograph posted by the Myall Coast Nota http://static.lifeislocal.com.au/multimedia/images/full/1642236.jpg resembles lesions observed on fish in other estuarine environments where cutaneous ulcerative syndromes are associated with an invasive fungus called _Aphanomyces invadansthose_. In Australia, this fungal disease, known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome or red spot disease, is more common in the Northern Territory, but it also occurs in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. There is no mention on how they ruled out a fungal etiology.
