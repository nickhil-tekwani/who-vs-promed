- 7 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Beni, 3 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo.
- 2 new confirmed deaths, including 1 in Butembo and 1 in Katwa.
- 1 new recovery in Beni.

News of the response
Press point in Beni
-------------------
- On Mon 19 Nov 2018, the Coordinator of the response, Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, held a press briefing in Beni to present the evolution of the epidemic and reassure the population of the ongoing commitment of the Ministry of Health and international partners to end the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province. Despite the evacuation of 20 WHO staff over the weekend, the human resources deployed in Beni remain very important. The Ministry of Health has more than 900 experts in Beni, of which almost 85 percent are locals who have been trained to participate effectively in all pillars of the response. WHO has 191 national and international consultants who continue to work in Beni. Added to this are the hundreds of other people employed by the other organizations involved in the response. In addition, he recalled that according to the new community-based monitoring approach, it is the local actors who lead more field activities with the technical support of national and international experts.

- Dr. Bathe also discussed the epidemiological situation in the health zone of Kalunguta, which is a red zone. The spread of the epidemic in the village of Kanihunga was caused by the arrival of a confirmed case from Beni who fled several weeks ago to escape the monitoring teams. The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, instructed the coordination of the response to provide substantial technical and medical support to all health centers in this area so that they can provide quality care to the population. Thanks to the goodwill of the village leaders who granted access to the response teams, 895 people were vaccinated in the village.

- In order to contain the epidemic in and around Butembo Health Zone, the coordination decided to send additional intervention teams to the Katwa, Kalunguta, and Lubero areas to support local health care providers.

News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
- Resumption of vaccination in Beni since Sun 18 Nov 2018. Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 32 108 people have been vaccinated, including 15 962 in Beni.

"Thanks to Helen Branswell for tweeting about the latest Weekly Bulletin from WHO AFRO. Here's an excerpt from the Bulletin...then a comment:

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored. Since our last report on 9 Nov 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 45), 37 new confirmed EVD cases have been reported, and 9 new deaths have occurred.

As of 17 Nov 2018, there have been a total of 366 EVD cases, including 319 confirmed and 47 probable cases. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 14 health zones: Beni (163), Mabalako (67), Kalunguta (25), Katwa (20), Butembo (10), Masereka (6), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Oicha (2), Vuhovi (2), and Mutwanga (1) in North Kivu Province; and Mandima (16), Tchomia (2) and Komanda (1) in Ituri Province. A total of 214 deaths were recorded, including 167 among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio among confirmed cases of 52% (167/319). A total of 39 health workers have been infected to date, including 11 deaths.

On 17 Nov 2018, 49 new suspected patients were hospitalized, bringing the total number of patients admitted to 124, including 35 confirmed cases. As of 17 Nov 2018, the number of patients cured and discharged back into the community is 107. Bed occupancy in Beni Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) is 100 percent.

Beni, Kalunguta and Katwa remain the principal hotspots of the outbreak with, respectively, 46 percent (n equal to 45), 31 percent (n equal to 30) and 11 percent (n equal to 11) of the 97 confirmed and probable cases reported in the past 21 days (from 28 Oct-17 Nov 2018).

Contact tracing is still of concern due to insecurity and persistent community resistance. Of the 4430 contacts listed for follow up, 4182 (94 percent) were seen on 17 Nov 2018. The proportion of contacts seen in the previous 24 hours varies from 80 percent to 100 percent.

Branswell points out that the HCW cases last week numbered 30, with just 3 fatalities; she suspects the new cases are traditional healers, who are often the 1st consulted." - Rapp.MJM

[The World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office today [20 Nov 2018], in its weekly outbreak and health emergencies update, said that over the past 21 days, Beni, Kalunguta, and Katwa have been the main hotspots. It added that against a backdrop of escalating insecurity, the outbreak remains dangerous and unpredictable.

The agency said there's a critical need to strengthen infection prevention and control in Beni and other areas and to continue collaborating with Mai Mai rebel groups regarding security in the Kalunguta red zone to help with death investigations, follow-up, and vaccination.

The report notes that bed occupancy in Beni's Ebola treatment center is at full capacity. It said 39 healthcare workers have been sickened in the outbreak, 11 of them fatally, signifying an increase of 9 cases and 8 deaths. [Note this figure differs from that quoted in Helen Branswell's tweet above. - Mod.LK]

-19 Nov 2018. DRC reports 21 more cases of Ebola amid more violence in Beni
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/drc-reports-21-more-cases-ebola-amid-more-violence-beni
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Outbreak grows in Kalunguta: Bathe addressed the recent cases in Kalunguta, a health district in one of the DRC's security red zones. He explained that Ebola was spread to the area by a confirmed case-patient from Beni who escaped surveillance in that city. Bathe said the community has been accommodating to health workers, and more than 800 people have been vaccinated.

At least 2 of the 21 new cases recorded this weekend were in Kalunguta.

In updates over the weekend, the DRC's health ministry efforts to clean up the Ebola case database were continuing.

[3] Response
- Mon 19 Nov 2018. WFP's Response to the Ebola Outbreak in DRC
[Relief web; World Food Programme, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/wfp-s-response-ebola-outbreak-drc-19-november-2018

WFP continues to respond to the worst Ebola outbreak in DRC's history, providing food assistance to prevent a further spread of the virus, and serving the wider humanitarian community with critical logistical support.

The Ebola response is led by the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO). WFP supports the medical response with food assistance to affected people, logistical support to WHO and the provision of common services to the response community. Coordination mechanisms consist of numerous technical commissions led by the Ministry of Health, including ones dedicated to tracing and monitoring, vaccination, psychosocial support, prevention and patient care. The commissions meet daily to share information and make the required adjustments to response planning and execution.

WFP coordinates with all relevant commissions, including those responsible for surveillance, psychosocial support, vaccination and logistics. The surveillance commission is WFP's main source of information, facilitating prompt reaction to the latest contact tracing information.

WFP leverages 2 key comparative advantages in its response to Ebola. 1st, the capacity to quickly deliver food in remote and insecure locations. 2nd, its agility and speed in logistics, construction, infrastructure repair and supply chain management. 32 WFP staff have been deployed to Beni. Since August 2018, WFP and cooperating partner Caritas have delivered food and nutrition assistance to about 60 000 Ebola-affected people. Distributions are intended to:

Care: WFP provides food to confirmed/suspected cases receiving medical care in health facilities, to sustain their nutritional status.

Contain: WFP provides food to registered contacts. This helps mitigate the risk of Ebola spreading by limiting population movements. Food distribution also encourages Ebola contacts to present themselves for registration. Family food rations are provided weekly door-to-door for 4 weeks, thereby ensuring coverage of the 21-day observation period. Rations are also provided to health workers and other front-line personnel.

Protect: This targets discharged suspect cases and Ebola survivors and their families, supporting their reintegration to communities of origin. Survivors also receive special nutritious products to support recovery.

Drawing on its expertise and experience from responding to Ebola in West Africa, WFP plays an enabling role for the medical response. This includes engineering works, response hubs and accommodation for responders, movements and warehousing of medical supplies, as well as constructing safe rooms to accommodate response teams. WFP has put in place daily special UNHAS flights to Beni, the epicentre of the outbreak, and stationed a helicopter there.

WFP plans to provide food to some 20 000 people a month, and a range of common logistical services to the response community. Given that the response is highly dynamic and requires considerable agility, WFP will augment its deep field presence and deploy Rapid Response Teams (RRTs). It will also ramp up its logistical support to the medical response.

The risk of Ebola spreading geographically remains very high. WFP is preparing to react promptly to new outbreaks in other parts of DRC, especially in urban areas.

The crisis is occurring in a context of chronically poor health and nutrition indicators, and a large IDP population. It is likely to impact the food security of affected communities in the medium-term, and food assistance will have to evolve accordingly. WFP is working closely with Ebola Treatment Centres and the government response team to have a complete contact list of all Ebola survivors to which food and nutrition assistance can be provided for 12 months.

- Tue 20 Nov 2018. Real-time IOM Crisis Communications System Deployed to Help Save Lives During Ebola Response in DR Congo [Relief Web, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/real-time-iom-crisis-communications-system-deployed-help-save-lives

The World Health Organization is now using IOM's innovative Security Communications and Analysis Network (SCAAN) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to support the security of its staff fighting the Ebola epidemic. The effectiveness of this innovative crisis communications system was demonstrated almost immediately.

IOM developed SCAAN, a security mobile app and digital platform to enhance the safety of its own and other UN staff who so often are exposed to danger during their work, in collaboration with CENTRIC, a research and innovation centre at Sheffield Hallam University. Over the past year, IOM has field-tested the security communications system that includes a dashboard for security professionals to monitor global risks to staff and a mobile app to enable staff to send alerts and receive push notifications on developing threats to ensure a rapid and well-directed response for those in danger.

On their mobile devices, staff are equipped with:
- Easily installed app to provide emergency alerts, receive warning information, and crowd-source reports about incidents in their vicinity.
- One-touch contact with security professionals to get help and respond to requests for accountability and status.
- Geo-location which can provide critical information in case of hostage taking or security incident.
- Live interface with the UN TRIP system so that travel notifications can be input and received on the go.

On the live dashboard, security professionals are equipped with:
- A map-based security dashboard for monitoring the status, safety and location of all enrolled staff.
- Graphical visualization of the number of staff members on the system, current location, and any indicating a "NOT OK" status.
- Ability to push warnings of specific or general nature to all staff or targeted groups based on location.
- Interactive analysis of security trends and threats by region, type and risk level.
