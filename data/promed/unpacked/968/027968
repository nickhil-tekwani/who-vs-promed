Wet winter and dry summer create a plague, as mice come out of the woods
-----------------------------------------------
Just about this time, 2 summers ago, a plague of mice swept across the
drier parts of Maui and Molokai. The mice are back.
Joey Macadangdang is among the 1st farmers to suffer the consequences of
winter rains, and a vegetation bloom, that have contributed to a mouse
population explosion.
On another, dryer, part of the island, corn farmer Jerry Simpson, on Naalae
Road, said last week [3rd week July 2004], "we have a few of them but not
bad yet." Simpson and his neighbors were hit hard in 2002, although,
perhaps not as badly as in some sections of Molokai, where desperate mice
invaded homes, burrowed into upholstered furniture, and wiped out crops.
Still, Simpson lost a whole corn crop in 2002. He's setting out traps and
catching a mouse, or 2, per day. 2 years ago, at the peak, he got nearly 2
dozen mice overnight with one trap.
Macadangdang is getting more mice than Simpson, and has been for several
weeks. As the only active farm in the immediate area, his farm is also the
only place where a troop of hungry mice can get food.
The mouse population explodes every few years, and a wet winter, such as
the one just past, is part of the reason. The mice thrive and breed for
several generations, when wet weather promotes growth of grasses and plants
producing lots of seeds. The growth means lots of food for mice. But, when
the dry weather comes, they soon consume all of the available food. There
was little doubt that 2004 would be a big mouse year, with the only
uncertainty being the timing of their move. Scattered reports of high mouse
activity are beginning to come in from the usual places, such as Kihei. "In
Kula, some of the farmers are saying the mice are beginning to eat through
the drip tubing," he said. "Another month of this dry weather, and they'll
be coming."

[Wild mice coming into houses in search of food is the classic situation
for the spread of rodent-borne diseases. Physicians and diagnostic
laboratories there should be on the lookout for fevers compatible with
murine typhus, leptospirosis and other rodent-borne diseases. - Mods.JW/MPP]
