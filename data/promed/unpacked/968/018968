[The geographic distribution of 'Sheep & goat pox' (S&GP), an OIE-notifiable epizootic, includes central and north Africa, central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the Indian subcontinent. Its causative agents are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the family _Poxviridae_. Most isolates cause disease mainly in sheep or mainly in goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both species. Notably, the previous outbreak of S&GP in Mongolia started -- according to the official report to the OIE -- in October 2008, affecting 2 flocks of goats. Clinically affected goats were culled; mass vaccination of goats was applied. The epizootic was declared as resolved in Oct 2009. An earlier outbreak (Jan 2007) affected, reportedly, only sheep. The causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other with current techniques. Only one serotype exists.

Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species. Infections have not been seen in wild ungulates. The disease does not affect humans.

According to Mongolia's annual report for 2011 and the semi annual (Jan-Jun) report for 2012, S&GP was present; no further information on recorded outbreak was included. Vaccination was reportedly applied in both species. Quantitative vaccination data was available for 2011: the number of vaccinated animals was rather insignificant, namely 1267 goats and 5497 sheep. According to 2011 data, the goat population is 15 934 600 and the sheep population is 15 668 500. - Mod.AS
