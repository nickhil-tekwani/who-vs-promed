New hepatitis strain reported in Bundibugyo
-------------------------------------------
A new strain of hepatitis has been reported in the Bundibugyo District and
it has already claimed a life. According to the district health officer, Dr
William Sikyewunda, the disease had killed a resident of Bundikeki village
in Bubukwanga Sub-county about 2 weeks ago. He told the Daily Monitor that
2 other people infected by the disease were admitted to Bundibugyo Hospital
and placed in an isolation ward.

Dr Sikyewunda said blood samples have been taken to the Uganda Virus
Research Institute in Entebbe for examination. He said the patients develop
high blood pressure, yellow eyes, and headache. Already, there was panic in
Bundibugyo town when reports of the death were made public. Many people
feared that the deadly Ebola virus that struck the district in August
[2008] killing 22 people was back. But Dr Sikyewunda insists the disease is
not Ebola [haemorrrhagic fever] and has appealed for calm. Residents are
shunning the hospital where the 2 patients have been kept, for fear that
they may contract the disease.

Hepatitis returns; are we ready?
--------------------------------
The Daily Monitor this week reported that a yet to be identified strain of
hepatitis had struck Bundibugyo District, claiming a life and leaving 2
other people isolated at the town's main hospital. According to district
health officer, Dr William Sikyewunda, blood samples have been sent to the
Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe for examination. But as the
public waits for results, reports of this new attack bring into question
safety and measures instituted to prevent another possible epidemic,
considering that since hepatitis E was first reported in Kitgum District in
October last year [2007], it has claimed 150 lives and affected 9000 people.

The major focus in checking the spread of hepatitis, which according to the
Ministry of Health originated from South Sudan and found its way to
northern Uganda through the cross-border movements of the residents, lies
in hygiene. The Ministry says hepatitis E was able to hibernate and develop
because of the despicable sanitary conditions in most displaced people's
and satellite camps in the north. Disposal of human waste in the open,
characteristic of camps is the perfect breeding ground for this disease,
noting that it places water and food at great risk of contamination.

With high death figures in the past and new cases being reported, one would
suppose that all measures are being taken to avoid an escalation of the
problem in the north and now the west. But if the word of Dr Dawson
Mbulamberi, the assistant commissioner at the Ministry of Health is
anything to go by, gloom awaits. He says improving sanitation in camps is a
tough call, though he quips that the ministry is doing its best to better
conditions.

The same view is supported by the Pader [district] deputy RDC [resident
district commissioner], Mr Charles Kurua, who observes that since residents
continue to live in unhealthy conditions, they continue to be vulnerable to
diseases like hepatitis E and cholera. Dr Charles Oyoo, the officer in
charge of the Padibe health centre in Kitgum District, says travellers must
be checked if the disease is to be contained.

However, when hepatitis E was reported in October last year [2007], it did
not spread beyond 5 districts in northern Uganda. Dr Oyoo says the
situation in Gulu has improved due to the sensitisation of the people.
"Almost every member of the population has received adequate information
about hepatitis E but then the behavioural component is what is very
difficult to control. There is continued communal hand washing,[and]
sharing food remains our biggest challenge," he said.

Inertia or fear to change, Dr Oyoo notes, may jeopardise the quest to check
spread of hepatitis E, which destroys the liver. "There are still
re-infections. This means whichever information they got, they have not put
it in practice and yet these are adults. Isolation cannot work because by
the time the person develops the symptoms, she/he may have interacted many
people." He adds, "The sanitation standards are still poor. As people
return home, we've emphasised that the 1st thing they should construct are
latrines. But that has not been adequately addressed."

The private sector and NGOs have also jumped into the fray to help combat
the spread of the disease. According to the outgoing Oxfam public health
manager, Ms Julie Cailet, the agency has chlorinated more than 200
boreholes, distributed up to 50 000 jerrycans, and constructed more than
700 latrines in the north. Oxfam has also gone to 45 schools to preach on
behaviour change.

To ensure that the north is free of this latest hepatitis outbreak, Dr Oyoo
says authorities have discouraged storage of drinking water in pots,
encouraged children to wash their hands after using the latrine, eating hot
food, digging soil and covering human waste. Just in case the disease
returns, health staffing may be a major undoing. Padibe health centre, for
example, which receives about 200 patients daily, has only 14 staff.

Activists may also have to deal with the question of cultural practices.
People have resorted to traditional healers and in some families; they
prefer to hide patients for fear of stigmatisation. Bundibugyo can learn a
lesson from northern Uganda, but even then, if the disease spreads,
questions still linger whether an epidemic can be contained.

[These press reports suggest that the hepatitis E outbreak in the displaced
people's camps in the north of Uganda has spread to the Bundibugyo District
further south and west. Furthermore the outbreak (3 cases so far) is
attributed to a novel strain of hepatitis E virus. The justification for
this identification is unclear, other than that reappearance of the novel
strain of Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus prevalent in the Bundibugyo
District in the early months of 2008 has been excluded. Further information
concerning the identification of the agent responsible for this out break
of hepatitis is awaited.
