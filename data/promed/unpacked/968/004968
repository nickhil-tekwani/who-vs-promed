Zika virus outbreak hits Yap
----------------------------
A mosquitoborne virus, which was 1st isolated in Africa and is similar to
dengue, has found its way to Micronesia.
"An outbreak of illness on the island of Yap in the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM) caused by the Zika virus has been confirmed," according to
a World Health Organization statement made on behalf of Dr Marcus Samo of
the FSM national government and Dr Martin Bel of Yap State.
There have been no cases reported on Guam, said Dr Robert Haddock, the
territorial epidemiologist with the Guam Department of Public Health and
Social Services. But public health officials are urging Guam residents to
take necessary steps to avoid mosquito bites.
Symptoms of Zika fever include a skin rash that starts on the face and then
spreads throughout the body, conjuctivitis, more commonly known as pink
eye; and pain in the smaller joints of the hands and feet, according to WHO
officials.
As of Friday [22 Jun 2007], 73 patients who were processed by the
outpatient department at Yap's public hospital exhibited at least 2 of the
3 symptoms of Zika fever.
Control measures similar to those for dengue are already being taken in
Yap. Officials said quarantine measures are not necessary since this is a
[relatively] milder form of dengue [-like disease. - Mod.TY].
Zika, named after the forest in Uganda where the virus was 1st isolated, is
a flavivirus similar to the dengue virus. Zika causes similar but milder
symptoms, according to WHO's Office for the South Pacific. While commonly
found in Africa, the Zika virus has also been found in Malaysia.
The outbreak in Yap reportedly started in April [2007] and peaked in late
May. Zika fever symptoms are mild, according to WHO, and generally last for
2 to 4 days. "Some (Yap) patients also have low grade fever," according to
the WHO statement. "No patients had to be admitted to the hospital and
there have been no deaths. Because the disease is mild, many more
infections are thought to have occurred in the community that did not seek
medical attention. An initial assessment in the community indicates that a
significant proportion of the population has been affected. Geographically,
cases have occurred all over the island."
Public health officials said a joint investigation is being carried out by
the public health authorities of Yap State and the FSM national government,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and WHO.
"The investigation is continuing to better characterize the clinical
presentation of the illness, the magnitude of the outbreak and the mode of
transmission in order to determine the best control measures," the WHO
statement said. "We continue to see new cases, and the neighboring islands
are under active surveillance."
On Guam, Haddock said while there have been no cases of dengue or Zika
fever on island, "it would be prudent for Guam residents to avoid mosquito
bites as much as possible._Aedes_ mosquitoes, the mosquito group likely to
spread viral diseases in our region, are usually most active in the early
morning and late afternoon hours but they may be encountered any time
during the day in shady areas or if they can gain access to homes," he said.
Guam public health officials advise residents to use mosquito netting over
beds. "Use mosquito repellents and wear appropriate clothing such as
long-sleeved shirts and long pants that reduce exposure to mosquito bites
when venturing outdoors, especially during the late afternoon or early
morning hours," they said.
Mosquitoes breed in containers -- such as discarded tin cans, coconut
half-shells and old tires -- so residents should keep their homes free from
such litter. "Saucers under potted plants are another area where these
mosquitoes may breed so water should not be allowed to accumulate there for
more than a few days," Guam health officials said.

[Zika virus has been isolated from humans, non-human primates in Africa,
and mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_, and _Ae. africanus_). Epidemics in Africa
have been documented in Uganda and Nigeria and in South East Asia in
Malaysia and Indonesia. There is some serological evidence of Zika virus
infections in humans and in nonhuman primates in other countries, but
results from flavivirus serological tests need to be interpreted with some
caution due to cross-reactions among this virus family. It would be of
interest to know which _Aedes_ spp vectors are involved in Zika virus
transmission in Yap, and what the results of the clinical studies are when
they become available.
