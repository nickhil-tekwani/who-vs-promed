The government on Wednesday [28 Apr 2010] confirmed the nation's 9th
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease this month at a pig farm west of
Seoul. The animals at the farm on Ganghwa Island, 60 km from the
capital city, started showing symptoms late Tuesday [27 Apr 2010],
prompting on-site quarantine officials to order the culling and
burying of all pigs raised there as a preventative step, the Ministry
for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.

The ministry, which effectively raised the country's disease alert
status to its highest level last week, is discouraging the movement
of people, vehicles and animals near the site of the latest outbreak,
hoping to help contain the disease. The farm, which raises 1000 pigs,
is located 3.1 km from where the 1st outbreak was reported on 8 Apr 2010.

Farmers there recently noticed foot-and-mouth symptoms -- blisters on
the nose, mouth, teats and legs -- on some of the animals. "Exactly
how the animals became infected has not been determined, but a person
responsible for artificial insemination, who visited a farm that
reported an outbreak earlier in the month, may have spread the
disease," an official said. While the normal incubation period for
the animal virus is about 2 weeks, it can develop inside an animal
for up to 3 weeks before symptoms start to show in rare cases, he added.

The farm is located in a relatively isolated part of the island with
no livestock within a 500 meter radius, so no additional animals have
to be culled, the ministry said. It, however, said an area up to 10
km from the farm will be designated a special monitoring region so
quarantine officials can check animals and take immediate action if a
suspected case is found.

The outbreak is the 1st to be confirmed in the country since the 2
cases of the animal disease reported Thursday at another part of
Ganghwa and in Chungju, located in the central part of the country.
The government has ordered the culling of more than 42 000 head of
livestock on Ganghwa and in nearby Gimpo so far, with the total for
the entire year [2010] exceeding 49 000 animals counting the latest
outbreak. As of last week, compensation paid by the government to
farmers reached 64.0 billion won (USD 57.1 million).

The ministry said that, in the future, quarantine officials will be
given the authority to order the culling of animals that may have
been infected or order close observation regardless of distance from
an outbreak site.

Foot-and-mouth disease affects all cloven-hoofed animals such as
cattle, pigs, deer, goats and buffalo and is classified as a "List A"
disease by the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health.
Countries that report the disease are barred from exporting meat from
cloven hoofed animals.

The country reported 6 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the
Pocheon and Yeoncheon regions north of Seoul in January 2010.

In the 2 previous outbreaks that hit the country in 2000 and 2002,
the government ordered the culling of 2216 and 5956 animals at a cost
of 300.6 billion won and 143.4 billion won [USD 269.6-128.6 million],
respectively. The higher compensation was due to a nationwide
vaccination carried out to control the 2000 outbreak.

The ministry, meanwhile, said the latest outbreaks must be viewed
separately from the outbreaks in January 2010, noting the wide time
gap and the fact that the latest cases involve a different strain of
the virus. All outbreaks confirmed in the 1st month of the year
[2010] were of the A-Type strain, while those reported this month
[April 2010] are O-Type, which spreads more quickly through swine.

[As pigs excrete 4 logs more FMDv than other livestock, and FMDv O is
known to be airborne, this infection's rapid spread in this part of
South Korea, where the air will be humid, is not unexpected. What is
especially worrying is the appearance of this O type FMD virus in 2
widely separated parts of South Korea and in southern Japan,
essentially simultaneously. Logically, there is a common explanation,
and I think we can rule out a source to the east of both countries.
One must point out that FMDv O is made up of a number of substrains,
and, before indulging in conspiracy theories, we should await a more
careful analysis. The origin of the 2000 series of outbreaks in South
Korea was not firmly determined.
