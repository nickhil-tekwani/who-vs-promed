[According to the report, this 2nd outbreak was detected through the active surveillance program implemented as part of the original investigation. All birds on the 1st infected property were destroyed.

The N type has not yet been identified in this 2nd outbreak. The source of the infection is not yet known; an epidemiological investigation is under way.

According to the media, initial suspicions of the source of the current infection are directed to free-living waterfowl. Free-range poultry are far more susceptible to infection than confined flocks, especially if farms are located on flyways or near bodies of water which attract migratory anseriformes (http://egg-cite.com/rss/single.aspx?contentID=2493).

The Australian Department of Agriculture authorities expect the disease to be eradicated, as it was during the previous outbreaks in 2012 (http://www.daff.gov.au/about/media-centre/communiques/high-pathogenic-avian-influenza-a-young-nsw). - Mod.CRD
