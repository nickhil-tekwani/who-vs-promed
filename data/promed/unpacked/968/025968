At least 14 people have died in Madagascar from poisoned fish. Around
120 other people are seriously ill, with some in hospitals, after
ingesting the toxic sardines which had been caught in the
south-western town of Toliara.

Samples of the fish have been sent for analysis.

In previous food poisoning incidents the contaminated sardines had
eaten poisonous seaweed, which now proliferates on local reefs.

Officials have blamed global warming and changed sea conditions for
the incident.

At least 14 people have died in Madagascar after eating toxic
sardines. Officials say more than 120 people remain seriously ill
after the incident in the south-western town of Toliara.

The government sent its condolences to the victims' families,
promising to foot the medical bills of those being treated in
hospital.

Samples of the sardines have been sent for analysis. In previous
incidents, researchers said the contaminated sardines had eaten
poisonous seaweed. They say seaweed has proliferated among
Madagascar's coral reefs as global warming changes the sea
conditions.

[The toxin in the seaweed that the sardines may have eaten is not
known at the time of this writing.

Seaweed species such as _Porphyra_ and _Chondrus_ may be used as food
in many countries. Other uses may be as fertilizers and other
industrial uses.

Seaweed can be affected by viruses, bacteria, parasitic algae, and
fungal infections (for example _Pythium_, _Petersenia_, and
_Phycomelaina_ species). However, little is known about disease of
these plants.

As such, we do not know if the seaweed was affected by a disease that
then affected the sardines, or if the sardines have a disease of their
own.

We look forward to results of the sardine testing.
