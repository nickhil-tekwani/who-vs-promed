----------------------------------------------------
The human serosurvey will be of great help in evaluating our control
measures. However, "control measures" for humans also included education
and personal protection. None of our year 2000 horse cases were in
adulticided areas, while we have dozens of horses residing in the areas
where we had West Nile virus and adulticiding. We responded to last year's
cluster of horse cases in eastern Suffolk by stepping up water management
there last winter [1999-2000 and increasing larval control in the area
this past season. Much of that control was directed toward _Aedes_ spp.
mosquitoes, but I have believed from the beginning that _Culex_ spp. are
not the only players in this game, especially when it comes to humans and
other mammals. I cannot prove that's why there were no human or equine
cases in the area this year, but I don't regret doing it. I decided that I
would not wait for proof that _Aedes_ spp. were important before taking
steps to control them, since if I had waited for that, my only option would
have been adulticiding.
