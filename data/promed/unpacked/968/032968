800 birds culled near Attock
-----------------------------
A team of experts has culled 800 birds at a poultry farm at village
Sarwala near Attock where avian flu virus was found.
Director General, Poultry Research, Lahore, Dr Zafar Gill confirming
the report on Friday [28 Apr 2006] said samples collected from the
farm had shown low pathogenic avian influenza H5.
Some samples had been sent to National Veterinary Laboratory (NVL)
Islamabad, which would be sent to the World Reference Laboratory in
the UK for further confirmation, he said.
He said, earlier, after detecting moderate mortality rates in a
poultry farm in past few days the experts sent the samples from the
poultry farm to the Poultry Research Institute (PRI), Rawalpindi,
which tested positive the bird flu virus.
A special team, dispatched to the area, had sealed the farm after
culling about 800 birds. But no other farm of the district was found
affected so far, he said.
The teams have collected samples from all commercial poultry farms,
situated within 3-km radius of infected area, [which] are being sent
to research laboratories for tests.
The team had been asked to assess the situation in the area, give
advice and train local health workers to help contain any outbreak of
the bird flu, he said.
Meanwhile, an emergency meeting was held at a local livestock office
here under the EDO Agriculture Attock, to share information, review
the preparedness and discuss plans to cope with the situation. All
veterinary doctors and livestock officials attended the meeting.
The bird flu fear has once again gripped Attock district after
reporting the virus at a local poultry farm as poultry prices have
also plummeted in [the] last 24 hours by about 30 to 35 per cent in the market.
A local poultry wholesaler said that poultry industry had come under
unprecedented pressure for the 2nd time during the last 4 months.
He said the chicken price had come down by 40 per cent so far, and it
might go down further, as last time, when the poultry industry was
hit by the flu scare, chicken price was Rs25 [USD 0.417] per kg.

[The data from Bavaria, 24 Apr 2006, correspond with the Bavarian
data included in posting 20060429.1242, with one difference: the case
from Lindau, attributed in the above table to a "duck", was reported
as a "crested Grebe" in the Bavarian table, which might be the
accurate species. For a picture of a Crested Grebe, see

[3] UK (England, Norfolk), poultry, H7N3, 2 additional farms

Test results positive for avian influenza in 2 more poultry farms in Norfolk
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests have provided positive results for avian influenza in chickens
on 2 further poultry farms near Dereham, Norfolk today [29 Apr 2006].
The preliminary results indicate H7N3, but further tests are being
carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.
The 2 free range flocks will be slaughtered on suspicion of an avian
notifiable disease. A restricted zone has been put in place extending
1km from each of the infected premises. The State Veterinary Service
is tracing movements and contacts. The necessary surveillance and all
appropriate worker protection measures have been put in place.
H7 does not transmit easily from human to human. In almost all cases
of human H7 infection to date, the virus, in both low and high
pathogenic forms, has only caused a mild disease. Therefore at this
stage this is a virus which only has extremely limited implications
for human health.
