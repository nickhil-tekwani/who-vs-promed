Dengue virus arrives in Nepal. Districts bordering India are on high alert.
-----------------------------------------------
Six patients from villages near Nepalgunj, Banke district were found to be
exhibiting symptoms of dengue fever. Nepalgunj is near Nepal's southern
border with India, recently the scene of an outbreak of dengue fever. The
Nepalgunj Medical College revealed the finding on Tuesday [10 Oct 2006].
Reacting to the news, the Ministry of Health is starting various programs
to check dengue. The ministry has also issued notices to all health
officials to take necessary precautions. The chief of disease control at
the Department of Health Services, G D Thakur, has urged that measures be
taken at Nepal's airport, since around a half dozen flights operate between
Kathmandu, the capital, and various Indian cities on a daily basis.
A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) said India is at
high risk from dengue [India is experiencing dengue outbreaks at this time.
See the posting below. - Mod.TY]. According to reports, the disease has
killed 150 people across India. More than 3000 cases have been detected.
Since the districts bordering India are believed to be in high peril of
spreading the disease, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division
started a surveillance system in the districts of Morang, Parsa, Chitwan,
and Nepalgunj. The surveillance teams, which include trained physicians to
treat patients, will control the border and identify affected areas. The
office is in the final stage of dispatching those teams. Some districts,
including Biratnagar and Chitwan, are now on high alert. The mosquitoborne
disease is common during summer and rainy seasons in the Terai region of Nepal.
There were recent rumors that dengue fever could not be diagnosed in Nepal.
The National Reference Laboratory, however, has said that it is well
equipped to diagnose the dengue virus within 20 hours at its facility in
Kathmandu.

Karachi under dengue grip, 17 die of deadly disease
---------------------------------------------------
After India and Nepal, dengue has now spread its tentacles in Pakistan,
with its port city Karachi reporting 17 deaths due to the vectorborne disease.
Apart from the 17 dead, hospitals here have admitted around 700 suspected
dengue patients, prompting authorities to order emergency measures at all
government and private hospitals. "After proper tests, we had some 230 of
these patients testing positive for the virus. Most of them have been
treated successfully, but 17 have died due to complications in different
hospitals," health secretary Naushad Sheikh said today [14 Oct 2006].
Though he ruled out a red alert situation in this industrial hub of
Pakistan, he said the spread of the virus was being closely monitored so
that it did not turn into an epidemic.
Since the monsoon rains, hospitals have reported around 700 suspected cases
of the virus, which is spread by the _Aedes_ mosquito, which breeds in
clean water containers and buckets and bites during the daytime, health
officials said.
Doctors at a local hospital said that the government had taken steps to set
up isolation wards for virus patients and were maintaining extra blood
supply to meet all requirements. "The patient infected with the virus
suffers from blood deficiency, and his platelet cells' count also goes
down. A lot of blood is required to treat patients, which is why we need
more blood supply," Dr Shaukat Rajput of Liaquat National Hospital said.

The Cuban government recognized last month, August 2006, that dengue
hemorrhagic fever [DHF] existed [in the country] in a letter to the
Panamerican Health Organization [PAHO], although on the island, [the
populace] has not been publicly informed of the presence of the disease.
For some time, the authorities have developed a massive campaign throughout
the country to eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the vector of the
disease. The population has been informed frequently about the measures
that the citizens must adopt through the communication media.
Regular fumigation has been done in the cities, and thousands of people
have been mobilized on the island to eliminate possible vector breeding
sites, always within the framework of the official "battle against the
mosquito."
"In August [2006] we received a note from the Minister of Health (Jose
Ramon Balaguer) in which he indicated that there were cases of dengue in
Cuba, including cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (which can be fatal),"
said the PAHO representative in Cuba, Lea Guido. The Minister's note
indicated that the disease was in 4 provinces in which "at this time there
have been no deaths," and informed us that "there have been no children
affected with dengue hemorrhagic fever."
Guido stated that PAHO could not give any estimation of the magnitude of
the problem from any database nor give a number of affected [individuals]
"based on a speculation," which referred to the existence of "outbreaks" of
the disease. "The organization [PAHO] does not have its own information
system, but for obvious reasons, we base [our information] on official
government data," he said. The representative of the affiliate of the World
Health Organization (WHO) indicated that "vector control is a high priority
of the country and is being managed at a high political level of the
state." He added that the authorities were treating this theme [vector
control] "as being characteristically intersectorial, which goes beyond the
Ministry of Health," and that communication with the public exists.
"For the organization, this strategy of vector control is satisfactory, and
I think is very important," he affirmed and underscored that "at this time,
the focus must be on strengthening the strategy to eliminate the vector."
He indicated that access to health services and the eradication of mosquito
breeding sites are important elements to attack the [dengue] problem. He
emphasized that "there has been a very important count of every person who
has fever ... house-to-house."
Guido indicated that although he could not evaluate the impact of the
disease, he did indicate that, in his opinion, the situation is not like
that of 1981, when the greatest epidemic of the disease in the country
occurred.

[This report of what appears to be a significant dengue/DHF epidemic is the
1st from official Cuban government sources, through PAHO. It does not
provide information about the numbers of dengue fever or DHF cases, but
does indicate that cases are occurring in 4 provinces. ProMED-mail requests
additional information about the numbers of dengue/DHF cases, the dengue
virus serotypes involved, and the progress of the _Aedes_ reduction campaign.
WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults, but seldom causes death. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management
