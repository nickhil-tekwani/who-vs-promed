No Evidence of a Recurrence of Nipah Virus Infection in Malaysian Livestock
-----------------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: Industry sources told Reuters on Wed 7 Mar 2001 that fears of
a fresh outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus have receded following reports
that recent tests on cattle in the country's former hog center were
negative. The number of pig farms in the southern state of Negeri Sembilan
had been around 800 prior to the [Nipah virus outbreak, which killed 105
people in 1999. [Only a single pig farm remains.
Last week, Chinese newspapers reported some goats and cows had died at one
farm in the state because of [Nipah virus infection. [These newspapers
also reported that 2 farmers, believed to be have been infected by the
virus when it re-emerged in 2000, had also died. However, Negeri Sembilan
Chief Minister Mohamed Isa Abdul Samad said the results of 8 blood samples
taken recently from cattle farms in the state were negative. "The tests
showed none of the farm animals in the Bukit Pelandok area is infected with
either Japanese encephalitis virus or Nipah virus," Isa was quoted by the
national Bernama news agency as saying on Tue 6 Mar 2001. [Nevertheless
Isa said another 30 blood samples had been sent to the laboratory for
further tests.
Most pig farms in the state had been turned into goat and cow farms because
of the [Nipah virus outbreak, which inflicted heavy losses on pig farmers.
More than one million pigs were culled in 1999 because of the outbreak,
which nearly destroyed Malaysia's hog industry. Pork is a popular meat for
Malaysia's Chinese community, which comprises 35 percent of the country's
22 million people. Malays, [who are predominantly Moslems and make up the
majority, shun pork.
An official at the Department of Veterinary Services in Kuala Lumpur
confirmed that one worker at a cattle farm in Negeri Sembilan had died, but
said that was not caused by [recent exposure to Nipah virus. [He stated
that it was probably a consequence of past infection "He could have been
infected when he used to work at a pig farm," said the official.

[Nipah virus can affect pigs, horses, and dogs, but there was no evidence
yet that the viral disease can infect goats or cows.
Industry sources indicate that the number of pig farms in Malaysia as a
whole was stagnant at 824 this year compared with 1770 in 1998. The
government has refused to issue new licences to pig farms in Negeri
Sembilan because of fear of a re-emergence of Nipah virus.
Apparently it was accepted that the pig farm workers died of the deferred
consequences of previous Nipah virus infection. However, there has been no
positive diagnosis. At the moment there is no evidence of a recurrence of
Nipah virus infection of humans or animals in mainland Malaysia; therefore
this thread is cut. - Mod.CP
