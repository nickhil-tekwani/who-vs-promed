Cases of African swine fever (ASF) have been reported at the Government Pig Breeding Farm located at Hiyanglam Makha Leikai under Kakching district.

Subsequently, district authorities have immediately banned sale of pig, pork feed, and related items in and from Hiyanglam area.

The Department of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry had been keeping a variety of pigs imported from UK for breeding purposes at the campus of Pig Breeding Farm of Veterinary Dispensary, Hiyanglam Makha Leikai. In the last few days, some of the pigs kept at the farm had been dying one after another due to an unknown disease, after which their samples were sent for examination and found positive for African swine fever (ASF) disease.

On confirmation of the disease, district magistrate of Kakching Somorjit Salam issued an order on Friday [24 Jun 2022] declaring control areas for ASF at the pig breeding farm, with immediate effect to prevent spread of the disease in the area.

The order also notified that there will be complete ban on sale of pig, feed, and other related items in the area along with declared the area falling within 1 km [0.62 mi] from the epicentre of the disease as infected zone and areas falling within 9 km [5.6 mi] radius as surveillance zone for taking up control and containment procedures.

Meanwhile, Pig Breeding Farm Hiyanglam piggery specialist Dr RK Harshyam has revealed that the pigs kept at the farm are of the variety that was imported from the UK by the government in October 2021 for breeding purposes. As soon as the pigs started dying, the farm was sanitised as a precautionary measure.

As the test results have confirmed ASF [on 23 Jun 2022], the areas that have been declared as infected zone will be deeply sanitised again from Sunday [26 Jun 2022] morning onward, while surveillance will be taken up in areas under surveillance zone, he added.
