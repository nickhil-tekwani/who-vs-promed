Endangered Amur tiger populations are at "significant risk" from a viral disease most commonly found in dogs.

Reporting in the open-access journal mBio, a team of Russian and US researchers contend that canine distemper virus has killed at least one percent of the Siberian (Amur) tiger population since 2009. While the figure may seem low, the researchers note that with an endangered animal like the Amur tiger, every instance of species loss is significant.

"Losing one percent of an endangered population is pretty significant," said corresponding author Denise McAloose, Head Pathologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in The Bronx, New York. "And these losses represent only the deaths we know about. I imagine that there were others that we just never saw," she said.

Once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean Peninsula, the Amur tiger was driven to the brink of extinction by the 1940s due to excessive hunting, when only an estimated 40 were left in existence, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Populations have since rebounded thanks to conservation efforts, and the WWF reports there are now about 450 Amur tigers in the wild.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a contagious, largely incurable and frequently fatal disease that attacks an animal's body on multiple fronts. CDV targets the respiratory and digestive systems of animals, but the deadliest aspect of the disease targets the central nervous system, causing the animals to become disoriented and to not exhibit fear in situations in which they normally would.

Since 2001, researchers have been noting incidents of the normally reclusive Amur tigers behaving strangely, including wandering out into busy Russian highways, which they would usually be afraid of. Most of these tigers died or had to be euthanized after their condition worsened. CDV was suspected to have sickened the tigers, but this latest research provides more evidence that CDV is indeed to blame.

McAloose and her colleagues used tissue samples of 5 Amur tigers that were either dead or destroyed due to neurological disease in 2001, 2004 and 2010. Under a microscope, the brain tissues of the tigers were riddled with lesions, which indicated they suffered from viral encephalitis consistent with their clumsy, abnormal behavior. Further testing revealed the presence of specific genes and proteins found in CDV.

McAloose said the problem was not isolated to one location, noting that the CDV-positive tigers were distributed across the Russian Far East. "That tells us this is a disease that is distributed all across the Amur tiger range," McAloose said. "And it also appears to be a relatively new threat to tigers, since blood samples from wild tigers prior to 2000 tested negative for antibodies to the virus."

It's inconclusive how the tigers contracted CDV. Dogs, of course, are a suspect as tigers are known to kill and eat them. McAloose and her colleagues are working to identify the exact source of CDV transmission to Amur tigers in the hopes that future infections can be stopped. She said the "situation is quite serious," and that if unchecked, CDV could possibly spell the demise of the Amur tiger.

"It's the 1st infectious disease that we know is a significant risk to Amur tiger survival," McAloose said.

[The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs and cats are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world. Molecular studies comparing the degree of identity of the virus found in the dead tigers with that of those circulating in local dogs might shed light on the origin of the disease.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic carnivores can transmit to tigers, and thus conservation efforts should take into account all infectious agents that are potentially flowing at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface in the region.

Amur tigers are classified as endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/15956/0.
