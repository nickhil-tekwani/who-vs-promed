Regarding the comment about paralysis and monkeypox: two ideas come to
mind. First, if monkeypox is still in the same region as the previously
reported outbreak, that area has a very low immunization rate and is near a
region that has had epidemic polio outbreaks. Second, tropical spastic
paresis or "konzo" has been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo
when persons eat improperly prepared cassava ("fufu") such that cyanacide
poisoning results. If local people are associating one epidemic with
another problem it may [be that persons are leaving one region due to the
epidemic and are exposing themselves to polio or having to rely on the more
drought tolerant, high cyanide (thiocyanide) content of plants in another
region. Past reported cases of monkeypox have not included symptoms of
paralysis.

[Good thoughts. Does anyone know whether, at this time, polioviruses are
circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo or in nearby countries? -
