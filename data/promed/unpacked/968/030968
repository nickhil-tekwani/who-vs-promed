From: Larry Glickman <ltg@vet.purdue.edu>

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a national epidemic response resource
for
animal diseases, similar to the Epidemic Intelligence Service in the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reacts to human
outbreaks
when help is requested by state authorities.
The concern expressed that the cluster of 15 cases of neuromuscular
disease in horses in Arizona might have zoonotic potential, blurs the
distinction between epidemics in animals and humans. Why not have a team
within the CDC comprised primarily of
veterinary epidemiologists that can respond to such situations? I am
not aware that such capability currently exists within the USDA or other
federal agencies. It seems that reacting to an oubreak of a zoonotic
disease in humans is like closing the barn door after the horse is out.
We should practice preventive epidemiology by reacting to potential
zoonotic diseases in animals rather than waiting for animal to human
transmission to occur.
Does anyone know of other countries that practice this approach?

[Yes, wouldn't it be nice! An idea for those concerned to do something
about before something like the Australian horse disease, which killed
humans, shows up in the USA -- see: Equine morbillivirus - Australia:
