The larger than usual increase in hantavirus infections in France, Belgium
and Germany in 2005 that was recently reported (1) is also being observed
in Luxembourg, which is surrounded by these 3 countries.
Since March 2005, 14 cases of _Puumala virus_ infection have been
laboratory-confirmed in Luxembourg, compared with 2 cases in 2003 and no
cases in 2004. 2 of these patients lived in towns on the borders with
Belgium and France. The other 12 patients living in Luxembourg are
clustered in the rural region of Mullerthal and surrounding areas in the
east of the country, which suggests that the outbreak in Luxembourg is
quite localised. The Mullerthal is an area characterised by beech forests
and sandstone formations. The mean age of patients is 41 years (range 21 to
70), similar to that observed in the neighbouring countries (1). The
male-to-female ratio is 1.9. Most cases so far confirmed occurred in June
and it is not clear whether the incidence has already peaked.
Hantaviruses are carried by bank voles and their population size is known
to vary according to the availability of food. 2004 was a 'mast year'' [the
fruit of beech and similar broad-leaved trees is known as 'mast'] in
Luxembourg for beech trees, a common broadleaf tree species. This means
that there were unusually large seed crops, and is the most likely reason
for an increase of the bank vole population this year. In the past, the
peak of human hantavirus cases in the Ardennes region (which encompasses
parts of northeastern France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany) have tended
to occur in spring and summer, unlike the cases in northern Europe which
tended to peak in autumn and early winter (2). Given the direct
epidemiological link between bank voles and hantavirus, it is quite likely
that a higher incidence of human hantavirus infections is to be expected in
other areas belonging to the western European broadleaf forests, where
beech mast years may also have occurred in 2004. Western European broadleaf
forests are found in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Luxembourg and Switzerland (3).
In July 2005, all physicians and the general public in Luxembourg were
informed by the Health Directorate's Health Inspection about the increased
risks of hantavirus infections, and recommendations for avoiding infection
were published (4, 5 6).
