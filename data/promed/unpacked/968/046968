China's Health Ministry issued an alert on Tuesday for dengue fever, a
potentially fatal, mosquito-borne disease, as the peak season
continues in south China. "Health departments at all levels must
closely monitor the dengue fever outbreaks and strengthen detection to
make sure that all prevention measures are properly carried out," Mao
Qun'an, the ministry's spokesman, said at a press conference. He
warned that south China is still at the peak season for dengue fever
outbreaks as the average temperature of 28 degrees is prime mosquito
breeding weather. Mao called for great public effort to eradicate
mosquitoes by cleaning up the environment.
China reported 502 dengue cases in September [2006] but no one has
died from the disease. Most of the cases occurred in south China's
Guangdong Province, where 492 cases have been reported. Sporadic cases
occurred in other provinces but they were mainly brought by people
traveling from south China.
A larger outbreak sickened more than 1000 people in Guangzhou in 2002
but caused no fatalities.

Mosquito-born dengue fever has killed 8 more people in Pakistan's
southern city of Karachi, raising the death toll to 20 over the past 4
months, officials said on Thursday.
Around 180 people are still being treated for the disease in hospitals
across Pakistan's largest city.
"We have had 8 deaths since the beginning of October [2006]. People
are worried
with this outbreak but we are keeping things under control," Abdul
Majid, a senior official in the health ministry of the southern
province of Sindh, told Reuters.
Karachi, with a population of 14 million, is the provincial capital.
Neighbouring India has reported nearly 5000 dengue cases, including 94
deaths, since August [2006].
Majid said there had been around 1000 suspected cases in Karachi and
some 290 of them tested positive for dengue fever.
He said special emergency units had been set up in the hospitals to
deal with the disease.

[ProMED mail requests information about the measures being taken to
"keep things under control," as Dr. Majid was quoted as saying.
Keeping dengue epidemics under control is a daunting task, and sharing
both successful as well as less successful efforts with the broader
biomedical community would provide valuable "lessons learned." ProMED
thanks Dr. Carlota Medus for providing the same Reuters report.ï¿½
WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults, but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of shock
and die within 12-24 hours, or quickly recover following appropriate
volume replacement therapy. There is no specific treatment for dengue
fever. However, careful clinical management by!
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may
be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating
fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
