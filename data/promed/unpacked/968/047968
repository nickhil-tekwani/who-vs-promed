[1] United Kingdom: school study
Date: Wed 11 Aug 2021

Round 6 of the Schools Infection Survey (SIS) -- a study jointly led by Public Health England (PHE), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) -- was carried out in June 2021 across 141 primary and secondary schools within selected local authority areas in England. The study looked at prevalence of COVID-19 infection among pupils and staff sampled in schools. The results from testing showed lower levels of current infection in pupils and secondary school staff than in the autumn term 2020.

The percentage of primary school pupils in school on the day of testing that tested positive was 0.27%, showing very little change from Round 5 (May 2021). In secondary schools, 0.42% of students tested positive, representing an increase from Round 5 but a significantly lower level than the autumn term 2020 (Rounds 1 and 2).

In secondary schools, 0.27% of staff tested positive for COVID-19 -- infection was similar level to Round 4 (March 2021) and significantly lower than the autumn term 2020. For Round 6, the number of positive test results from primary school staff was too small to present due to statistical disclosure criteria.

SIS is not intended to be generalisable to England as a whole but does have good representation in the North West. Data for schools in the North West were compared to the wider community prevalence among children of comparable age taken from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS). This analysis showed that the prevalence of infection among pupils in schools was consistently lower at all time periods of the study.

The study also found that antibody seroconversion rates (the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results changing from negative to positive following natural infection) among primary and secondary school staff were at the lowest level recorded by the study for the academic year. Between Rounds 5 and 6, seroconversion rates for primary school staff were 0.8 per 1000 person-weeks and for secondary school staff 1.9 per 1000 person-weeks.

Dr Shamez Ladhani, consultant paediatrician at PHE and study lead, said: "Through this study we've closely monitored the risks of COVID-19 in schools. Latest results show that infection and antibody positivity rates of children in school did not exceed those of the community. This is reassuring and confirms that schools are not hubs of infection. Keeping community infection rates low remains critical for keeping children safe and schools open safely. Thanks to all staff and pupils up and down the country for playing their part in keeping transmission of the virus in schools low."

Dr Patrick Nguipdop-Djomo, assistant professor of epidemiology at LSHTM, and co-investigator of the study, said: "It is encouraging to see that the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in schools has remained lower than in the autumn term 2020, and the high vaccine uptake in school staff taking part in the study. This is a testament to the huge amount of work done in schools to prevent and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Although the study is not designed to be representative of all schools in the country, SIS has also shown that infections in schools mostly reflect the patterns of infection observed in the local community, thus measures to reduce community transmission remain important. The whole team working on SIS are grateful to the pupils, staff and parents taking part in this landmark study. With their collaboration and time, we are able to better understand how best to respond to COVID-19 and protect the children and school staff."

Fiona Dawe, deputy director, Wider Surveillance Studies at the ONS, said: "It's really encouraging that our results today show infection rates in the summer term 2021 were lower than in the autumn term 2020. As we have now completed the final round of testing, I would like to say thank you to all our incredible participants for taking part in the study throughout the school year, especially during such uncertain times. This study wouldn't have been possible without them."

Round 6 also recorded COVID-19 vaccination uptake of staff at participating schools in the 14 local authorities. The study found that 92.93% of staff had received at least one vaccine dose by the end of June 2021, an increase from 86.60% at the end of May 2021, and from 62.94% at the end of March 2021. Of staff, 70.47% had received both doses, an increase from 43.13% at the end of May 2021, and up from 1.01% at the end of March 2021.

In a separate data release from Round 4 (March 2021) of antibodies in primary and secondary school pupils, antibody levels following natural infection were found to be lower in schools located in local authorities where community infection rates have been relatively low throughout the pandemic than areas where infection rates have been higher. These findings support the suggestion that infection rates in school reflect those of the community.

Overall, the data suggest that adult vaccination (including in staff), and other "school-gate" measures such as the rapid asymptomatic testing programme, excluding bubbles and measures to limit the likelihood of transmission within the school site (for example, social distancing), have contributed to reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in schools.

Parental opinion on child vaccination recorded in Round 6 found there had been no significant change since Round 5 (May 2021); 40% of primary school parents and 54% of secondary school parents said "Yes, definitely" they would want their child to have a COVID-19 vaccine; 3% of primary school parents and 6% of secondary school parents said they would "Definitely not" want their child to have a vaccine.

Round 4 also measured conversion rates among pupils (the incidence of an oral fluid antibody test result changing from negative to positive). For all pupils combined, conversion rates were lower between Rounds 2 (Dec 2020) to 4 (Mar 2021) than between Round 1 (Nov 2020) to 2 (Dec 2020) at 5.7 per 1000 person-weeks and 12.0 per 1000 person-weeks, respectively.

The closure of schools during the national lockdown from 5 Jan 2021 meant that the 3rd round of the COVID-19 Schools Infection Survey was cancelled.

[The Schools Infection Survey (SIS) is jointly led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics. Their finding that infection rates in the schools reflect community infection rates should be reassuring to parents and teachers who are concerned the schools will be the source of virus spread in the greater community. - Mod.LK]

[2] Cognitive deficits
Date: Thu 12 Aug 2021
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-08-problems-attention-linked-covid-infection.amp


Evidence of cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19 has been discovered in a new study of over 80 000 individuals. The research found that those with more severe COVID-19 symptoms scored lower on an online series of tests, with performance on reasoning and problem-solving tasks being most affected. Further analysis of the data indicated that those who received mechanical ventilation to help them breathe while in the hospital had the greatest impairment on cognitive tasks.

Published in the journal EClinicalMedicine, the research was a collaboration between King's College London, Imperial College London and Cambridge University. It was part-funded by the UK Dementia Research Institute Care Research & Technology Centre and the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.

A series of online tests, developed by the first author on the study and reader in restorative neuroscience at Imperial College London, Dr Adam Hampshire, had been opened up to the general public just before the pandemic for the BBC2 Horizon's Great British Intelligence test. In early 2020, the study team extended the questionnaires to gather information on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the symptoms experienced and the need for hospitalization.

Out of the 81 337 who provided complete data, 12 689 people suspected they had COVID-19. Participants reported a range of severity of illness, with many experiencing respiratory symptoms whilst still being able to stay at home (3559 participants). Nearly 200 were hospitalized (192 participants) and about a quarter of these (44 participants) required mechanical ventilation. The time since illness onset was around 1-6 months, meaning the study could not draw any definitive conclusions about whether these effects on cognition were long-lasting.

The study found a relationship between deficits in overall cognitive performance and severity of respiratory symptoms experienced. The research also found that not all areas of thinking ability correlated in the same way with COVID-19 illness and that some abilities were spared, which included emotional discrimination (recognition of faces that were expressing the same emotion) and working memory (remembering where a sequence of squares appears on the screen). In comparison, "executive" tasks that required skills in reasoning (such as deciding if relationships between words were similar) and problem solving (working out how many moves it would take to go from one arrangement to another) seemed to show the greatest deficit.

To understand the size of the deficits, the authors compared the pattern of scores on the tests to cognitive changes that occur for other reasons. The effects in those hospitalized with mechanical ventilation were similar to the average cognitive decline seen over a period of 10 years of aging and equivalent to a 7-point difference in IQ.

The researchers carried out a series of checks to ensure these cognitive deficits were associated with COVID-19 and not explicable by other variables. These included separating out those who had a confirmed positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrating that the cognitive deficits were indeed greater in those with positive tests. Further checks suggested the results were not due to a minority with pre-existing conditions or ongoing symptoms of COVID-19. Analysis also indicated that it was unlikely that the results could be explained by the fact that those who contracted more severe COVID-19 disease were less cognitively able before they were ill.

Dr Hampshire said, "Our study adds to an increasing body of research that is looking at different aspects of how COVID-19 might be impacting the brain and brain function. This research is all converging to indicate that there are some important effects of COVID-19 on the brain that need further investigation. Going forward, it would be valuable to bring together brain imaging and cognitive tests with other information on mental health and everyday function, ideally in studies that track people's trajectories for months or even years. To really know what the long-term effects are for people will require people to be followed up over time."

New studies, such as COVID-19 Clinical Neuroscience Study (COVID-CNS), led by King's College London and University of Liverpool and the REACT Long COVID study, led by Imperial College London, are now applying these cognitive tools to study the long-term impacts of COVID-19.

"A critical question remains as to why some cognitive functions are more affected than others," said Mitul Mehta, professor of neuroimaging from King's College London and senior author on the study. "It is already known that hypoxia and mechanical ventilation are associated with cognitive deficits similar to those observed in this study, and there is now evidence of neurological complications in some patients, as well as psychiatric consequences. As we are coming through the 3rd wave of the pandemic, there are more available options that can reduce the severity of COVID-19 such as vaccination and effective treatments whilst in hospital. The findings from this study suggest that by reducing the severity of illness through these different approaches we may also be able to reduce the severity of cognitive difficulties people may experience."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors concluded that cognitive defects were not correlated with age of patient but rather severity of disease symptoms. Since severity correlates with age, it is a little surprising. The study included a broad demographic (mean age 46.75 years, 15.73 SD). It is stated in the paper that "Our analyses provide converging evidence to support the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection is associated with cognitive deficits that persist into the recovery phase. The observed deficits varied in scale with respiratory symptom severity, related to positive biological verification of having had the virus even amongst milder cases, could not be explained by differences in age, education or other demographic and socioeconomic variables, remained in those who had no other residual symptoms and was of greater scale than common pre-existing conditions that are associated with virus susceptibility and cognitive problems." - Mod.LK]
