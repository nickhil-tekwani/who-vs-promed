WHO update number 127
---------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity is increasing on the European continent,
particularly in the central, south and eastern part.

In the tropics, several countries of southern Asia have seen a recent
increase in influenza virus transmission mainly due to influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 virus. Other tropical areas of the world and the
temperate countries of the southern hemisphere are currently reporting
very little influenza circulation.

Influenza transmission in North America, notably in the United States
of America (USA) has increased this week with a slight increase of
(H1N1) 2009 compared to earlier weeks.

Transmission in most of northern Africa and the Middle East has
peaked recently and is declining. Some countries in northern Asia are
seeing an increase in (H1N1) 2009 transmissions and some are seeing an
increase in influenza-like illness (ILI) activity.

The majority of the viruses characterized from North America and
Europe are closely related to the vaccine viruses for the current
seasonal vaccines.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Europe
------
Overall, influenza transmission continues to be high and is
increasing in Europe while the countries in the north are starting to
show decreasing trends. Of the samples tested from sentinel sites
across Europe 46 per cent were positive for influenza virus (43-44 per
cent in the previous weeks). The dominant influenza virus in Europe is
still (H1N1) 2009. Of influenza viruses detected, 65 per cent were
type A and 35 per cent type B (72 per cent A and 28 per cent B in the
last update). Of the type A viruses subtyped, 94 per cent were (H1N1)
2009 and 6 per cent influenza A(H3N2). In the western European
countries, hospital admissions due to influenza are declining while
the eastern countries report an increase. From the western countries,
severe cases are in 15 to 64 year old age range, a substantial
proportion (43 per cent) are not in the known higher risk groups and
most are due to (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. For example, in France,
of the cases admitted to intensive care units and for which subtype
data are available, 90 per cent were found to have (H1N1) 2009 virus
or unsubtyped influenza A, 8 per cent influenza type B and only 1 per
cent influenza A(H3N2), while in the community 43 per cent of the
detected viruses are influenza type B and 7 per cent A(H3N2). A
similar disparity between mild and severe cases was earlier noted in
the United Kingdom.

Characterized viruses in Europe were nearly all antigenically closely
related to the current seasonal influenza vaccine viruses, with only a
small number of influenza B viruses of the Yamagata lineages
detected.

North America
-------------
Influenza transmission continued this week across North America, with
increasing trends in the USA but declining in Canada. In Canada
influenza virus detections in most parts of the country have declined,
except in the Atlantic provinces. Other influenza activity indicators
are either decreasing or stable compared to earlier weeks. About 18
per cent of specimens tested in Canada are now positive for influenza;
influenza type A accounts for 95 per cent, a decrease from previous
weeks related to a slight increase of influenza type B detections. Of
the influenza type A viruses characterized, 87 per cent are A(H3N2)
and 13 per cent are (H1N1) 2009.

In the USA, influenza activity increased. The proportion of
outpatient visits for influenza-like illness increased to 4.0 per cent
from 2.9 per cent in 2 weeks, which is above the national baseline of
2.5 per cent. Pneumonia and influenza deaths from 122 cities across
the country are currently at 8.5 per cent of total mortality, slightly
above the epidemic threshold and increased from 2 weeks ago (7.5 per
cent). About 33 per cent of clinical specimens tested are positive for
influenza, an increase from the 26 per cent reported previously.
Influenza type B accounted for 18 per cent of detections. Of the
influenza type A viruses, 63 per cent are influenza A(H3N2) and 37 per
cent are (H1N1) 2009. This represents a further increase in the
proportion of (H1N1) 2009 in comparison to earlier weeks.

In Mexico the percentage of samples positive for influenza was 18 per
cent, about half influenza type B and half influenza A(H3N2). Based on
the proportion of samples tested positive, influenza activity in
Mexico appears to be declining.

All of the influenza A viruses from Canada and the USA, and more than
90 per cent of the influenza type B viruses that have been
antigenically characterized are closely related to the current
seasonal influenza vaccine viruses.

North Africa and the Middle East
--------------------------------
Influenza transmission in North Africa and the Middle East appears to
have peaked overall, though Algeria is showing an increase. In
Pakistan, Iran, and Oman the percentage of samples tested positive for
influenza was still rather high (range 28 per cent to 70 per cent).
(H1N1) 2009 and type B viruses are co-circulating in nearly equal
distribution.

Northern Asia
-------------
The influenza-like illness activity has been variable in the
different countries in northern Asia. A number of countries already
went through a peak of influenza activity, and most of these were
predominated by A(H3N2), notably northern China and Mongolia, while
the Republic of Korea has had a (H1N1) 2009 season which peaked around
week 52 of 2010. In recent weeks, however, Mongolia and northern China
are reporting an increase in (H1N1) 2009 detections, although without
a significant increase in the ILI indicator. Japan is reporting a
sharp increase of ILI activity, but does not report as many positive
detections of influenza viruses as in previous weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
The most active area of transmission in tropical regions of the world
continues to be in Asia. In tropical areas of the Americas, reports
continue to indicate very little transmission of influenza viruses. In
sub-Saharan Africa, available data indicate little activity in most
countries. Madagascar, however, shows an increase in influenza
activity with a mixture of influenza B and A(H3N2) circulating. In
tropical Asia, Singapore and China, Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region report respiratory disease activity above their epidemic
thresholds with (H1N1) 2009 virus accounting for about 90 percent of
the samples tested. An increase in (H1N1) 2009 positive samples is
also reported from southern China. Data from South East Asia indicate
only small numbers of influenza virus detections and no increases in
respiratory disease activity.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries in the southern temperate regions of the world continue
to have very little influenza transmission since the end of their
winter season. Australia, however, continues to report out-of-season
transmission of influenza A(H3N2) at low level.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 3 to 4, widespread outbreaks of laboratory confirmed
influenza A(H1N1) 2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to be reported
in many parts of the northern hemisphere. In general (H1N1) 2009 and B
viruses predominated in Asia and Europe. In the North Americas A(H3N2)
activity remained high but A(H1N1)2009 activity increased.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 3 to 4 (16 Jan 2011 to 29 Jan 2011), National Influenza
Centres (NICs) from 78 countries, areas or territories reported data
to FluNet. A total of 24 543 specimens were reported as positive for
influenza viruses, 19 078 (77.7 per cent) were typed as influenza A
and 5464 (22.3 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A
viruses reported, 77.6 per cent were (H1N1) 2009 and 22.4 per cent
were (H3N2).
