There were suspicions a few years ago that some banana plantations in Jordan were infected with Panama disease. The Jordanian Ministry of Agriculture later sent samples of the fungus to Professor Randy Ploetz of the University of Florida, who forwarded them to Wageningen UR (University and Research centre).

Subsequent DNA tests showed that the Jordan strains were identical to TR4 [Tropical Race 4]. The scientists have thereby established that TR4 has now spread beyond Southeast Asia.

Relatively few bananas are grown in Jordan, but 80 percent of the plantations are now infected. It is unclear how Panama disease spread from Southeast Asia. It [is argued that] it is only a question of time before TR4 reaches Africa [where it] would threaten the food security of millions. A concerted international approach is now needed to prevent the spread of Panama disease and, in the worst-case scenario, contain it, [the scientists] state.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below), which include most of the commercial eating bananas, are attacked by temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510).

Previously, Cavendish-affecting strains appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania, but they are of great concern worldwide. TR4 is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia. For example, every Cavendish plantation in Malaysia was wiped out within 4 years of the detection of TR4 in the country.
