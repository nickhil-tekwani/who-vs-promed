1997 - An outbreak of salmonellosis in Maryland involving 702 cases
(2 fatal) was ascribed to stuffed ham.
1998 - Contamination of cooked beef patties at a Georgia plant
resulted in recall of 2 million pounds of meat.

Louisiana was ascribed to a meat-based rice dressing.
2002 - An outbreak of multiresistant _Salmonella newport_ infection
