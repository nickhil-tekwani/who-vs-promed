An insect-borne disease is killing white-tailed deer in South Jersey, with more reported cases in western Salem County than any other part of the state, wildlife officials said.

Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease is not a public health issue, according to the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife. Infected deer cannot transmit the disease to people, other deer or any other animals, and humans are not at risk by handling infected deer.

However, state officials caution against eating meat of sickened deer because it may contain secondary infections that could be harmful to humans.

Exact numbers weren't available, but Bill Stansley, research scientist with the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, said there have been dozens of possible cases in Gloucester, Camden and Cape May counties, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the western part of Salem County.

"So far it seems to be confined to the southern part of the state, and in some areas it's pretty intense," Stansley said on Tuesday [3 Sep 2012].

"Western Salem County is the worst area in the state, but statewide the intensity is not what we've seen in previous years."

In 2011, there were no reported cases of EHD in Salem County, but the number of cases elsewhere throughout New Jersey were higher by this time last year [2011], Stansley said.

EHD is a common viral disease in deer that is contracted from a species of small biting flies called midges. Outbreaks generally begin in August and end with the 1st frost, which kills the midges.

While EHD is closely related to Bluetongue virus and cross-reacts with it on many blood tests although they are different diseases, officials said.

Death happens swiftly for the deer after symptoms appear, which may include lethargy, disorientation and difficulty breathing. They suffer high fevers, and are commonly found near bodies of water in an attempt to cool off. They stop eating and drinking and may have bloody discharge coming from the nose or mouth. They also may lose their fear of people.

There is no vaccine or treatment.

EHD outbreaks have occurred in various parts of New Jersey since 1955, Stansley said.

Outbreaks in 1955, 1975 and 1999 were caused by the EHD serotype 1 virus, while outbreaks in 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012 were caused by the EHD serotype 2 virus. The serotype 2 virus occurs every year in parts of the southern U.S.

It's not clear why outbreaks are more significant during some years than others.

"There is a lot that is still not known about this disease," Stansley said.

[A woman], who lives on a 6 and a half acre tract in Pilesgrove Township that includes part of Oldmans Creek, has noticed several deer on her property who appear to be infected.

"One deer was circling and acting like it was in distress, kicking up dirt, then it keeled over and died, [she said, she] has lived at the same home in Pilesgrove for 30 years and never seen a suspected case of EHD before.

"What's really sad is my husband took the body away, and the baby deer kept coming back to that spot looking for it. We've noticed several baby deer running around without their moms."

Those who find dead deer are asked to call the Division of Fish and Wildlife at 908-236-2118 so officials can take tissue samples.

The state doesn't handle the disposal of carcasses - since the disease isn't a threat to people or other animals, property owners can "let nature take its course" and leave infected deer carcasses on their property, Stansley said.

Whitetail deer are being found dead across South Dakota, and officials believe a virus is to blame.

"We are getting reports of dead deer almost daily from across the state," said Andy Lindbloom, senior big game biologist for the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks.

In Hutchinson County, the area with the worst of the problem in the eastern half of the state, about 50 dead deer have been found. It's believed the deer succumbed to Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease, or EHD, though only one instance of the disease has been confirmed. The test for EHD needs to be administered within 24 hours of the death of the animal.

"It's possible that some of those 50 died of other causes as well, but it looks like EHD. We just won't know for sure," said Ron Schauer, GF&P regional wildlife specialist.

EHD is a non-contagious, insect-borne viral disease that cannot be spread to humans.

The virus is transmitted by midges such as flies or gnats and primarily infects sheep but can also infect goats, cattle, antelope and whitetail deer. It is more severe during times of hot temperatures and drought

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR) says drought is fueling an outbreak of a fatal deer disease in southern and central Illinois and surrounding states.

The DNR said Thursday [6 Sep 2012] that it knows of more than 700 deer killed by Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease, or EHD. The viral disease is spread by biting gnats and leads to internal bleeding. It doesn't affect people and domestic animals rarely develop serious illnesses when infected.

The disease has also been reported in drought-affected areas of Indiana, Kentucky, Iowa and Missouri.

DNR deer project manager Tom Micetich says EHD becomes more common in drought years when deer concentrate around limited water sources. Exposed mud flats are also ideal for large hatches of gnats.

He says EHD outbreaks typically end with the 1st serious frost.

According to an Aug. 28 [2012] report from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, 1762 total white-tailed deer have been infected by EHD. Most of the cases are confined to Michigan's southern counties.

The Ionia County deer population has been hit particularly hard by the virus, with over 1100 confirmed deaths from EHD. More than 200 deer have been reported dead from the disease inside Ionia County lines for each of the past 4 weeks. Branch County has seen the 2nd biggest EHD outbreak, with 225 confirmed infections from EHD. Clinton County has confirmed 153 cases of EHD, though 97 cases were observed in the DNR's latest report alone. Calhoun, Gratiot, Barry, Allegan and Cass counties have all confirmed double-digit deer deaths from EHD infections, and several other counties have seen a small number of infected deer.

According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, there is no known treatment for the disease, though there is no evidence that would suggest humans can be infected. The disease is transmitted by insects carrying the virus. No other source of transmission is known except for a bite from a biological vector. The most common vector, the insect _Culicoides variipennis_, dies off come late autumn.

The DNR expects the disease to die abruptly after the swarming insects fail to outlast the frost. An estimated 2150 deaths in the Michigan white-tailed deer population have been observed since 1955. This year's outbreak has already accounted for more than 80 percent of that number. The DNR stated that EHD can have a significant effect on a local deer population, though statewide decreases of population have never been observed. Other symptoms infected deer exhibit include loss of appetite, weakness, salivation and unconsciousness. Those killed by the virus are often found by bodies of water to soothe themselves from fever.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the southeast USA. According to the 4th report, deaths in Michigan are at higher levels than usual, which may be cause for concern.
