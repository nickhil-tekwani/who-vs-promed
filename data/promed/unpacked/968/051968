Virus plays havoc with papayas in UP
------------------------------------
Viral diseases and difficulty in differentiating male and female
plants have ruined the 'desi papaya' (_Carica papaya_) crop in the
state. As the result, farmers have had to incur revenue loss. Now
scientists here have pulled up their sleeves. Tissue culture
technology will enable farmers to revive this sweet fruit in the state.

The age-old 'desi papaya' has been badly damaged by a virus and the
common disease which has been discovered that has damaged the papaya
crop badly is mosaic [but see comment below]. "The virus enters the
papaya plants at the nursery stage, therefore nothing much remains in
the hands of farmers," said scientists of Chandra Shekhar Azad (CSA)
University. "We are suggesting farmers set up a tissue culture lab
jointly for 3 or 4 villages," said Subhash Chandra, CSA.

In the entire state the total area where 'desi papaya' was grown has
been reduced to half due to these 2 reasons. "Now we are convincing
farmers that if setting up of small tissue culture labs at village
level is not possible, to collect seeds [rather: seedlings or
transplants - Mod.DHA] from state tissue culture labs or from CSA or
another agriculture university," said Dr Chandra.

[Although the disease above is referred to as "mosaic", _Papaya mosaic
virus_ (PapMV; genus _Potexvirus_) has only been reported from the
Americas. However, _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV; genus _Potyvirus_)
is present in many parts of Asia, and it is more likely that this is
the virus causing the problem. PRSV occurs in most countries where the
crop is grown and is the major limiting factor to production in many
of these countries.

PRSV symptoms on papaya leaves include yellowing, vein-clearing,
mottling (which may be considered a "mosaic"-like pattern), and
sometimes severe blistering and leaf distortion. Fruit symptoms are
striking and consist of dark concentric rings and spots or C-shaped
markings. Vigour of trees, life span, and fruit set are usually
reduced depending on the age of the plant when infected. Fruit
quality, particularly flavour, is also adversely affected. The virus
is spread by many species of aphids and with infected plants or
seedlings but is not usually seed transmitted.

PapMV causes similar leaf symptoms, but fruit symptoms are less
obvious. The virus is spread by mechanical means and infected plants,
but has no specific insect vectors and is not transmitted by seed.

Disease management for both viruses includes quarantine measures,
phytosanitation to limit sources of inoculum, and for PRSV vector
control. Some resistant or tolerant cultivars are available. Most
important is use of clean planting material, and tissue culture
facilities are suggested to be set up to supply this. However,
depending on the virus and the method used, only a percentage of
resulting lines can be expected to be clean of the pathogen.
Therefore, for the proposed scheme to be successful, it would be vital
to verify the virus-free status of the plantlets before release to the
farmers. This is usually done via certification by a well-equipped and
experienced laboratory using molecular diagnostic procedures.
