Two outbreaks of bird flu in Afghanistan were caused by the highly
pathogenic form of the H5N1 avian virus, the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) said on Friday [23 Feb 2007].
The outbreaks occurred among 202 birds in [the provinces of]
Nangarhar and Kunar, 73 of which died, according to an outbreak
report that the OIE received from the Afghan ministry of agriculture.
The highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 has been confirmed by tests in
an advanced laboratory, the outbreak report said.
On Wednesday [21 Feb 2007], the United Nation's Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said the infected birds were turkeys and that the
H5 virus was the suspected culprit.
The Afghan authorities have carried out screening and culling in
their response to the outbreaks, the report issued by the Paris-based OIE said.
[According to officials in Kabul,] Afghanistan has also banned
poultry imports from Pakistan because of its outbreaks of H5N1.
There were confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in birds in Afghanistan
last year [2006], but not in humans.
The H5N1 strain of avian flu has killed 167 people worldwide since it
re-emerged in 2003, most of them in Asia, according to the latest
World Health Organisation (WHO) toll.
