I don't dispute Mod.MHJ's suggestion that anthrax spores do not survive well
in acid soils, but I would point out that spores in the acid peat soil (mean
pH less than than 4.5) on Gruinard Island [the site of field trials of
anthrax weapons in the UK during World War II] survived in many thousands per
gram until the island was decontaminated in 1986. Admittedly this was from
the huge initial inoculum produced by the exploding munitions in 1942 and
1943.

[I cannot argue with Richard's point about Gruinard; but as he stated, that
island started with truly astronomical numbers of spores in that very peaty
soil. There had been multiple trials in the same restricted area with
explosive devices, which by their nature are inefficient producers of
aerosols, essentially dumping more than 98 percent of the surviving contents
of all the small bombs and mortars around the point of explosion. Even if
only a fraction of a percent survived, survive they did.
One of the conundrums of this organism is that the disease consistently
does not persist in regions with acid soils. This is true whether we look
at North America, where it was very common pre-1955 east of the
Mississippi, with significant industrial contamination in New England, and
now is totally absent, to acid soil areas in India, etc. And in the UK,
where we had 400-600 cases per year for decades thanks to contaminated
livestock feeds, once proper controls were instituted, it soon disappeared
from all but a very few areas, and there has not been a livestock case
since 1997. There were only some 100 cases since 1980. Peter Durr and I are
working on this to see why it hung on in those last few places. At this
time it seems that industrial contamination in relation to tanneries and
wool mills has been involved, and like other dormant areas, e.g., south of
Reno, Nevada, cases follow soil disturbance.
But it is odd. _B. anthracis_ spores seem to perform like other bacterial
spores, in that they have a negative surface charge and thus adhere to
organic matter in soil. This will normally prevent their dispersal. I
suspect that the exosporium is a key player in this adhesion. Any suggestions
are welcome. - Mod.MHJ]
