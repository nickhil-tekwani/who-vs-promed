We have investigated 12 samples (7 clinical cases and 5 contacts) from Guinea for suspected viral hemorrhagic fever. We have detected Ebola virus among 6 samples (from clinical cases) using RT-PCR assays and viral isolation is in progress. We are currently analyzing the sequences of different amplified viral fragments to further characterize the strain involved. Sequencing of a part of the L gene has already showed strong homology to Zaire Ebolavirus, suggesting that this species is responsible for the outbreak. This is consistent with the dramatic mortality observed.

[ProMED is grateful to Drs. Baize and Pannetier for this prompt firsthand report of the detection of Ebola virus from Guinea in 6 of 7 clinical cases (and apparently in none of 5 contacts) from the Guinea hemorrhagic fever outbreak that began in early February 2014. Preliminary sequencing of a portion of the virus is compatible with the Zaire species. This is presumably the same species causing disease in neighboring Sierra Leone. Further results including virus isolation and confirmatory sequencing are eagerly awaited.

As noted above, Zaire Ebolavirus is highly lethal with case fatality rates of up to 90% and is considered the most lethal species of Ebolavirus. It has been responsible for large outbreaks in the past; the most recent of these was in DR Congo in 2008 with 32 cases and 14 deaths for a CFR of 44 per cent. Detection of Zaire ebolavirus raises the already high level of concern for this event.

From the WHO Ebola Fact Sheet:
http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/
"The Ebola virus is comprised of five distinct species: Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, Reston, Sudan and Zaire.

Bundibugyo, Sudan and Zaire species have been associated with large Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in Africa, while the Ivory Coast and Reston species have not. EHF [Ebola hemorrhagic fever] is a febrile haemorrhagic illness which causes death in 25-90% of all cases. The Ebola Reston species, found in the Philippines, can infect humans, but no illness or death in humans has been reported to date."
