The death of a captive gyrfalcon [in Columbia Falls, Flathead County, Montana] was caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza, the Montana Department of Livestock confirmed Tuesday [31 Mar 2015].

It's the 1st case, outside of hunter-harvested wildlife, reported in Montana in years.

The influenza can decimate commercial poultry stocks, killing up to 99 percent in an infected flock.

No mortalities in domestic poultry in the state due to avian influenza have been detected, and no human health issues have been reported for this particular strain, H5N2, to date.

Martin Zaluski, a veterinarian with the Department of Livestock, said the avian influenza is primarily found in wild waterfowl.

"However, the extent of avian influenza in the Continental flyways right now is unprecedented," Zaluski said, and infected domestic poultry has been found in several states in the past several weeks, including Idaho, Washington and Oregon.

In addition to wiping out flocks, the influenza can cause international trading partners to "erect barriers" in order to refuse poultry from specific areas, states or even entire countries, according to the veterinarian.

"We're in better shape than others, because the influenza was not found in poultry," Zaluski said.

The bird that died was owned by a falconer who has approximately 50 other captive birds. They will all be tested for avian influenza by the end of the week, if not sooner, Zaluski said.

The Department of Livestock is also identifying poultry producers in the same area so flocks can be monitored for signs of the virus.

The gyrfalcon died of unexplained causes and was sent to the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Lab in Bozeman. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the highly pathogenic influenza virus strain H5N2 in the bird.

The gyrfalcon is the largest of the falcon species. It weighs 2 to 3 pounds, and can be used as a captive bird for hunting and falconry.

Zaluski said it appears the bird that died was exposed to the disease through a wild harvested duck.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks recommends that falconers avoid hunting avian species, particularly waterfowl, during highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks.

The Department of Livestock, meantime, recommends that poultry producers practice good biosecurity, including limiting if not eliminating contact between domestic and wild birds, and limiting visitor access to domestic poultry.
