The Kedah Health Department confirmed that 2 cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) infection have been detected in the Kota Setar district, with both cases involving death.

State Health director Dr Othman Warijo said the 1st case was reported on 18 Nov [2021] followed by the 2nd case on Thursday (25 Nov [2021]), and the department declared an outbreak of JE in the district on Thursday [25 Nov 2021].

In this regard, he said the cumulative number of JE cases reported in the state as of Thursday [25 Nov 2021] was 10 cases compared to 8 cases in the same period last year [2020], an increase of 25% with 3 deaths out of the 10 cases.

"Outbreak control activities were implemented immediately," he said in a statement last night. "Among the control measures implemented by the Kota Setar District Health Office and the State Health Department are vector control through thermal space spraying and larvaciding in patients' residential localities as well as outbreak localities that are at risk.

"In addition, entomological studies by entomological science officers at outbreak localities and active case detection (ACD) were carried out around the affected areas."

Dr Othman said the community was advised to clean up the environment and seek and destroy mosquito breeding grounds in their homes and get immediate treatment at health clinics if they experienced symptoms such as fever, headache, and vomiting.

[The areas noted above in Kedah state are active sites of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This outbreak is not surprising, since JEV is endemic in peninsular Malaysia, including Kedah state, and cases occur sporadically at various localities in the country. Because sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occur in Kedah and the rest of Malaysia, vaccination is the best preventive measure. Vector control is difficult and likely to be of short duration. Elimination of breeding sites around buildings and avoidance of mosquito bites are prudent preventive measures.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY
