25 people have gotten meningitis during the last 9 months [of 2003] in
Mariy El. This is twice the number of cases for the [same period of 2002].
According to [the above-referenced website, cases of] meningitis mostly
involve children, and this time 21 children have gotten meningitis. There
were 3 lethal cases.
The most effective preventive measure against meningitis is vaccination.
However, according to the Mariy El Ministry of Public Health, no vaccine
against meningitis is available in Mariy El. In Russia, vaccine is produced
only against one type of meningitis, which is not appropriate in Mariy El.

[The Republic of Mariy El is located in the middle part of the Volga
Valley. It is part of the Russia's Volga-Vyatka Economic region. Mariy El
occupies a territory of 23 200 sq km, which is 0.13 percent of the total
area of the Russian Federation. It has a population of 766 200. The
administrative center is Ioshkar-Ola, whose population totals 280 000 and
is located approximately 400 miles southeast of Moscow.
Although the report uses the word 'virus', the presence of fatalities and
preventive vaccination strongly suggests that this is bacterial meningitis.
ProMED would like more information regarding the bacteriology of the cases.
The 3 major bacterial organisms involved in bacterial meningitis outside
the neonatal period are _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Neisseria
meningitidis_, (at least all the major capsular types except B) and
_Haemophilus influenzae_. Pediatric vaccines are available in the west for
all 3 with the pneumococcal and _H. influenzae_ products being conjugated
to proteins. Conjugating polysaccharide capsules to a protein backbone
improves the immune response by allowing the vaccine to have efficacy in
children less than 24 months old and, as a T-cell-dependent antigen,
produces immunologic memory. - Mod.LL]
