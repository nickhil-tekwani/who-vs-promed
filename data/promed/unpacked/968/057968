Syphilis is on the increase in Sweden, with the number of new cases more than tripling in some parts of the country.

Medical magazine Dagens Medicin says that the Västra Götaland region on Sweden's west coast is the area where the disease has spread the sharpest, with the number of cases increasing from only 10 in 2010, to 51 in 2015. One of the most affected groups is men who have sex with other men.

Syphilis, a bacterial infection, is recognizable in small, painless sores that typically appear on the genitals or the mouth. If left untreated it can lead to cardiovascular and nervous system issues. "It is treatable, but it can also be serious," Leif Dotevall, a deputy disease control physician in the Västra Götaland region told news agency TT. "It can lead to meningitis, other neurological problems and vessel damage," he warned.

Though the swell was less dramatic than in Västra Götaland, capital city Stockholm also saw an increase in infections, with 158 cases reported there last year [2015] compared with 89 half a decade ago. The total across Sweden grew from 199 infections in 2010, to 244 in 2014. No national data for 2015 were available.

Syphilis is not the only sexually transmitted disease that is on the up in the Nordic country. Cases of gonorrhoea more than doubled between 1995 and 2015, according to figures from the Swedish Public Health Agency. In December, doctors warned that a so-called 'super-gonorrhoea' strain that is untreatable by conventional antibiotics could be the cause of the rise.

The growth in syphilis cases coincides with a new report from the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education, which shows fewer Swedes are using condoms in 2016.

Västra Götaland County, with a population of about 1.6 million people, on the western coast of Sweden, is the 2nd largest (in terms of population) of Sweden's counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Västra_Götaland_County). Its formal capital and seat of the governor is Gothenburg (Göteborg).

ProMED-mail posted on the rising incidence of syphilis in Sweden in 2014. The following is extracted mostly from my moderator comments from that post.

The increased incidence of syphilis in Sweden is similar to the situation in the US and other countries (see prior ProMED-mail posts below), where the rising incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) associated with decreasing condom use. In many countries, the increased incidence of syphilis among MSM has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site.

Other factors that could promote unprotected sex among MSM include engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), and taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis. These factors would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), without necessarily resulting in an increase in HIV infections.

A Eurosurveillance article in 2008 reported that the spread of syphilis in Sweden among MSM, particularly in the big cities, has been a major contributor to an increase in cases in that country (Velicko I, Arneborn M, Blaxhult A. Syphilis epidemiology in Sweden: re-emergence since 2000 primarily due to spread among men who have sex with men. Euro Surveill. 2008; 13(50). pii: 19063; available online at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19063). Estimated syphilis incidence among Swedish MSM was up to 28 times higher than in the general Swedish male population. The most affected age group among males was 25-44 years of age. The majority of infections in men and women through heterosexual contacts were acquired abroad, whereas the majority of infections attributed to sex between men were acquired in Sweden. - Mod.ML]
