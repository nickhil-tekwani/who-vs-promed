Officials with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and Local Land Services have reported the 1st confirmed case of anthrax this year [2020]. The detection occurred in the Central Tablelands on a property with no previous record of anthrax. The affected animals were ewes that had not been vaccinated for anthrax.

This has prompted DPI to urge producers to vaccinate their livestock.

Biosecurity measures at the affected property, including stock movement restrictions and the vaccination of remaining livestock, were immediately imposed. DPI Senior Veterinary Officer Dr. Graham Bailey said while there are no general public health risks or trade implications from the detection, it served as a timely reminder.

"Drought conditions create a favourable environment for anthrax infections, so producers should consider vaccination to protect their livestock," Dr. Bailey said. "Ingestion of soil by sheep, cattle and other ruminants is one of the key risk factors for anthrax, which is why drought conditions increase the risk.

"Cases of anthrax in NSW tend to occur in an area which runs through the centre of the state, between Bourke and Moree in the north, to Albury and Deniliquin in the south. Anthrax can be prevented by annual vaccination of cattle and sheep. Producers in high-risk locations are encouraged to consider vaccination."

Other risk factors include a history of anthrax on the property, grazing stubble or very short pastures, low ground cover, deep cultivation or earthworks in paddocks, soil movement or exposure as a result of rain, contact with infected carcasses and alkaline soils, which favour spore survival.

[A key ProMED-mail post to read from 22 Jun 2016: Anthrax - Australia: niche modeling of historic distribution 20160622.4302780. To see the niche maps generated, go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27280981. There is a fair amount of prediction details in these maps. This later 30 Oct 2019 report (https://www.sheepcentral.com/new-nsw-anthrax-outbreak-prompts-second-vaccination-call/) has a map of Australia showing the various provinces and the historic anthrax belt that stretches from northwest Victoria through New South Wales to Queensland.

There is a wide band of high risk for anthrax spore survival, and disease, through New South Wales. If this farm has not reported livestock anthrax before, neighbouring farms will have. A problem with observing ovine anthrax is that random sporadic deaths can be ignored, and this is usually the case. Veterinary help is sought when the numbers reach somewhere between 18 and 24 animals, which is a bit late, and properly disposing of that number of carcasses can be a challenge. This flock will need to undertake annual anthrax vaccination for the next 5 years, at least. When your ranch or farm is in a recognised high-risk zone, it is inviting trouble to not be vaccinating your livestock. - Mod.MHJ
