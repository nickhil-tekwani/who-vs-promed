The Health Surveillance unit [VISA] in Campinas [in the state of Sao Paulo,
Brazil] issued a technical note to alert health professionals on the
occurrence of post-surgical cases of rapidly growing mycobacterium
infection in the municipality. According to data from the Center for Health
Surveillance [CVS], the total number of confirmed cases reported in the
city so far [as of 4 Dec 2008] to be infected with _Mycobacterium
fortuitum_ is 9 (plus one more case still under investigation), all of whom
had previously undergone cosmetic surgery involving breast implants.
Another 2 cases with similar characteristics have been confirmed in
Indaiatuba [also in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil]. The coordinator of
health services surveillance in Campinas, Marcia Beltramelli, reported that
the patients had surgery since July [2008]. However, the 1st report [of
this problem] to VISA was in the beginning of November [2008].

This is the 2nd time that Campinas has had an outbreak of mycobacterium
[infection] in women following surgery for silicone implants of the
breasts. The 1st outbreak occurred in 2004, when 14 women were infected.

Marcia [Beltramelli] explained that, following the 1st report, VISA, in
partnership with the CVS and the National Health Surveillance Agency
(ANVISA), initiated an investigation of cases. Brazil reported the 1st
cases of [?all rapidly growing mycobacterium or only _M. fortuitum_]
infection in [the state of] Para in 2001. Since then, the number of cases
has been increasing. During the period 2001 to November of this year
[2008], there were 2122 cases reported, of which 1937 were confirmed, with
about 80 per cent related to laparoscopic surgery.

In Campinas, teams from VISA inspected the institutions involved [those
with post-operative _M. fortuitum_ cases reported] and evaluated the
records of all patients undergoing surgery for breast implants in those
institutions. "The objective [of the investigation] is to obtain data on
confirmed cases and actively search for new cases [that might not have been
reported]," said Marcia [Beltramelli]. Patients and surgeons were contacted
and the cases were followed to verify the evolution [of the infection] and
thereby identify signs, symptoms, and possible common factors. The
investigation also includes an evaluation of the work procedures, cleansing
and sterilization of equipment and material and products used for the
procedures.

"Until now, we have not encountered evidence that points to which stage in
the procedure the contamination occurred," informed Marcia [Beltramelli],
adding that since the outbreak in 2004, VISA had intensified its activities
with the Committees for Hospital Infection Control (CCIHs) in the
municipality, and that in 2009, there will be a special focus on cosmetic
procedures. ANVISA also released a technical report on the outbreak and
established preventive measures. One [of the preventive measures] is a
reporting requirement.

A 27 year old factory worker who agreed to give an interview on condition
of anonymity is one of the victims in Campinas. Two months ago, she had
surgery for silicone breast implants and, afterwards she had the implants
removed, following signs of infection. "I had a lot of pain; the [surgical
site] was red with discharge. It was necessary to open [the surgical site]
and then remove the prostheses," she said. She is being followed by a
plastic surgeon in conjunction with an infectious disease specialist.

As of 8 Dec 2008, a total of 24 suspected cases of infection caused by
rapidly growing mycobacteria have been reported in Sao Paulo State, 13 of
which occurred after surgery for prosthetic breast implants, according to
the bulletin released by the State Department of Health before the new year.

The last bulletin of the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), from
November 2008, pointed out that of a total of 75 reported cases in Brazil,
17 cases were from [the state of] Espirito Santo and 13 [cases were from
the state of] Sao Paulo. The 24 cases [in 2008] exceed the 17 cases
reported in 2005, the last year in which there were reported cases of
[rapidly growing] mycobacterial infections, according the health
department. The report issued yesterday [5 Jan 2009] was in the form of a
bulletin.

Of the total infections reported in [the state of] Sao Paulo, 9 in
Campinas, 7 in Assis, 2 in Indaiatuba, and 1 in Santos have been laboratory
confirmed. In August 2008, the health department had issued an alert about
the disease and released a manual on its prevention. Information came from
the Jornal da Tarde.

Another case of infection with mycobacteria was recorded in Campinas [Sao
Paulo state] this week and 3 other suspected cases are being investigated.
In total, the city has had since March 2008, 11 confirmed cases of
infection in women. The outbreak of infections, which in the rest of the
country mainly affects patients undergoing surgery by laparoscopy, has led
the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to propose new measures
for cleaning and sterilization of equipment and materials used in surgery.

[_Mycobacterium fortuitum_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) (that
is, a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex). _Mycobacterium
fortuitum_ is one of the rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) that produces
mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. Non-pigmented RGM
are grouped within the _M. fortuitum_ complex and include _M. fortuitum_
and the _M. chelonae/abscessus_ group. The intermediately growing NTM
include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_, are pigmented, and require 7-10
days to produce mature growth on agar plates. Slowly growing NTM include
_M. kansasii_ and _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex and require more than 7
days to produce mature growth on agar plates.

_M. fortuitum_ causes community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection,
usually following trauma in previously healthy individuals and has followed
exposure to contaminated footbaths in nail salons (Sniezek PJ, et al. Arch
Dermatol 2003; 139: 629-34; available at
<http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/139/5/629>). _M. fortuitum_
is found in natural and processed water, as well as in sewage and dirt,
worldwide. Nosocomial outbreaks of infections due to non-pigmented RGM
species are generally related to use of contaminated water or fluid skin
markers in cosmetic plastic surgery (Safranek TJ, et al. _Mycobacterium
chelonae_ wound infections after plastic surgery employing contaminated
gentian violet skin-marking solution. N Engl J Med 1987; 317: 197-201;
abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/4/197>), and related to
implanted devices and injection sites.

A prior outbreak of RGM infections following breast implant surgery in
Campinas was reported in 2007 and involved 14 confirmed and 15 suspected
cases who had undergone surgery at 8 different hospitals (Padoveze MC,
Fortaleza CM, Freire MP, et al. Outbreak of surgical infection caused by
non-tuberculous mycobacteria in breast implants in Brazil. J Hosp Infect
2007; 67: 161-7; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881086?dopt=AbstractPlus>). The
isolates obtained from patients at each hospital showed different molecular
patterns, except for isolates from one hospital that repeatedly showed the
same genotype for about one year. No source was apparently identified at
the time.

The current outbreak of _M. fortuitum_ breast implant infections in Brazil
may not be apparently localized to the state of Sao Paulo, but the exact
number of infections due to _M. fortuitum_ versus other non-tuberculous
rapidly growing mycobacteria is unclear from the news releases above. The
results of the epidemiological investigation that should include speciation
and genotyping of the isolates for the current outbreak are eagerly awaited.
