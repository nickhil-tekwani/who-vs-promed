A total of 63 additional cases of salmonellosis have been identified in an ongoing, multistate outbreak linked to raw beef products, the CDC said on [Tue 23 Oct 2018]. This brings the total number of people who have fallen ill to 120 in 22 states since August 2018. Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington are the latest states to report illnesses as part of this outbreak. They join Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, which all previously reported cases. As many as 33 of the sick individuals in this outbreak have been hospitalized, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported.

Health officials previously linked the outbreak to raw ground beef products from JBS Tolleson Inc. On [4 Oct 2018], the Arizona-based meat producer recalled more than 6.5 million pounds of "various raw, non-intact beef products" because of potential _Salmonella_ contamination. The recalled products were packaged between [26 Jul 2018] and [7 Sep 2018] and were sold nationwide under brand names Walmart, Cedar River Farms Natural Beef, Showcase, Showcase/Walmart and JBS Generic. The USDA inspection mark on the packaging of the recalled products contains the establishment number "EST. 267."

"FSIS [Food Safety and Inspection Service] is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase," the agency said in announcing the recall.

The USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] also reminded consumers to cook all ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 deg. F [approx. 70 deg. C]. "The only way to confirm that ground beef or other cuts of beef are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature."

State and local health departments continue to ask ill people questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. A total of 66 (93%) of 71 people interviewed reported eating ground beef at home. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 40% of respondents reported eating any ground beef at home in the week before they were interviewed.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
