An outbreak of anthrax that claimed the lives of 13 drug addicts has
officially been declared over, but the contaminated heroin that
caused it could soon be back on the streets.

The 1st cases of anthrax poisoning were reported in December last
year [2009], and there were a total of 47 cases of anthrax poisoning
among heroin users over the next 7 months, including 5 in Fife and 6
in Tayside. There were a total of 13 deaths caused by the
contaminated drug, including 2 in Tayside and one in Fife. However,
no new cases of anthrax poisoning have been reported since July 2010,
and the national Outbreak Control Team (OCT) has now officially
declared the outbreak [sic, epidemic, it involved significant numbers
in 3 countries. - Mod.MHJ] over.

Yet consultant epidemiologist and chairman of the OCT Dr Colin Ramsay
said that although the outbreak has been declared over, there is
still a risk of users purchasing contaminated heroin. "Anthrax
infection must continue to be considered a risk when taking heroin,"
he said. "There is still no way to prepare or use heroin that will
remove this risk, so our advice must be to avoid heroin use. Anyone
who does continue to use heroin should seek urgent medical advice if
they develop redness and swelling at injection sites or other
symptoms of general illness such as fever, chills or a severe
headache, as early antibiotic treatment can be life-saving. Marked
swelling of a limb which has been used as an injection site is a
particularly important sign of possible anthrax infection."

But Gareth Balmer, project manager of drugs support agency Addaction,
warned that more of the contaminated heroin could still enter
circulation. He said dealers could have put the anthrax-infected
heroin into storage until the scare has passed. "It is really
difficult, because we never really discovered where this heroin came
from," he said on Thursday [23 Dec 2010]. "There have been a lot of
heroin supply problems recently because of a fungus affecting the
Afghan crop and a lot of big police seizures. The contaminated heroin
may have been stockpiled, and if there is a drought, it could be
sold. If people are desperate, they will use anything."

He added: "We will continue to advise people that there is a risk.
Anthrax will be another item on our list of the dangers of heroin."

[It is unfortunate that the OCT has yet to publish their official
report on these events. It would remove some uncertainties. Also, in
spite of many drug seizures, it has proven impossible to characterise
the nature of the contamination and thus get a better handle on how
and where it may have come about, which would of itself have
mobilised a better targeted prevention upstream outside the United
Kingdom. It is puzzling that it seems that it was a singular event
(until now, and ignoring the previous case in Oslo some years ago).
Significant amounts of heroin are exported from Afghanistan into
Russia but apparently without similar cases; ditto for shipments into
Western and Eastern Europe. Logic would propose that the
contamination was not a unique event. The absence of cases elsewhere
is telling, but of what? - Mod.MHJ]
