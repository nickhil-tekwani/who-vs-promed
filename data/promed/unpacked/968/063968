The Colombian National Institute of Health (INS) confirmed to the Department of Health of Huila, a case of death due to the rabies virus, which affected a young man who had been referred for hospital care from the municipality of La Argentina.

"We come from the previous year on Red Alert for the case of human rabies having occurred in the municipality of Neiva, a measure maintained when this new case is notified and the Departmental Council of Zoonosis has already convened to resume contingency strategies," announced the Secretary of Health of Huila, Cesar Alberto Polania Silva.

Once the INS issued the alert, the Government of Huila, through a circular sent to the 37 municipalities of the department, asked the territorial entities and the actors of the health system to take prevention, surveillance and notification of possible new cases of human rabies or reports of animal aggression which could mean transmission of the virus.

The Secretary of Health of Huila also announced in the areas near the municipalities of La Argentina, La Plata, Tarqui and Oporapa, the active search for cases of human rabies will begin, in order to determine "the foci and peripheries."

Therefore, as detailed by the health official, in these areas "rabies vaccination will be intensified in domestic animals, but also in people who are part of the epidemiological fence of the confirmed case."

This is the 2nd case of death from human rabies reported in the department of Huila. The 1st was registered in September 2020, when the Ministry of Health reported a 26-year-old woman had died in Neiva, after being bitten by her cat, which transmitted the virus to her.

The discovery of a rabid bat in Ingersoll has prompted Southwestern Public Health to issue a warning to all local residents.

In a statement on Friday [9 Jul 2021], Infectious Diseases Program Manager Elaine Reddick reported an incident the previous Saturday [3 Jul 2021], where an Ingersoll resident found what appeared to be an injured bat, and touched it in an attempt to remove it.

The bat subsequently tested positive for rabies on Wednesday [7 Jul 2021] and the Ingersoll resident was undergoing a series of preventative treatments for the disease.

"It is important for residents to always seek medical attention if they are bitten by a bat, or any animal, whether it is wild or not," she said. "This case should also be a reminder for residents to avoid contact with wildlife, always supervise pets outdoors, and vaccinate pets against rabies as advised by their veterinarian."

The Boyle County Health Department confirmed Wednesday 2 dogs have tested positive for rabies in surrounding counties.

According to Dr. Butch Schroyer with the Animal Care Clinic in Lexington, while the strain of rabies typically carried by dogs has almost been eradicated, pet owners still need to be cautious and mindful of other animals they come in contact with.

"Rabies becomes a problem because people aren't used to seeing it and so even if a case of rabies is around them they may not recognize that," Dr. Schroyer said.

Schroyer says the rabies virus is an encephalitis virus, which impacts the brain, causing behavioral changes in animals. He adds there are some more obvious physical changes you can spot as well.

"The encephalitis paralyzes some of the muscles aiding swallowing and since they can't swallow, we get saliva coming out of their mouth and you may get foaming going on," Dr. Schroyer said.

Even if you have an indoor pet which hardly goes outside or even stays inside, Dr. Schroyer says those pets should still get vaccinated for rabies to keep them safe.

"I've had 3 rabies positive bats be in a house with a pet and at those times those 3 pets got exposed during the instance had not been vaccinated, so they were on a 6-month quarantine," Dr. Schroyer said. [This kind of quarantine can be expensive and hard on both animal and owner. - Mod.TG]

Fortunately those animals survived, but many rabies cases are lethal, which is why Dr. Schroyer says it's so important to get your pets vaccinated.

"We would recommend you take a 3-year vaccine whenever possible, you got longer protection, a little bit more overlap, less chance of a failure on a vaccine," Dr. Schroyer said.

If your pet does get bitten by an animal you're unsure has rabies, Schroyer says it's always safest to take your pet to a veterinarian so they can check the status of your rabies vaccine or take appropriate measures if your pet isn't up to date with the shot.

https://www.theinteriorjournal.com/2021/07/08/rabies-confirmed-in-lincoln-county-dog/


The Lincoln County Health Department has confirmed rabies in a dog in Lincoln County. Exposure to rabies is defined as a bite, scratch, or contact of saliva from an infected animal with a mucous membrane, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth.

Health department personnel have contacted individuals associated with the rabid dog and want to advise residents of the situation and urge caution when dealing with skunks and other unknown animals. Please contact the health department if you have or know of anyone who might have had, any possible human or animal exposure to unknown or wild animals. It is very important that you approach stray animals with extreme care.

Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease that attacks the nervous system; it is predominantly seen in bats and skunks in Kentucky.

Domesticated animals and our pets, such as dogs and cats, can get rabies when they come in contact with wild animals. Keep your pets protected with up-to-date vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian.

Rabies can present with a variety of signs. Early signs can include lethargy and vomiting, progressing to weakness, seizures, aggressiveness, difficulty breathing or swallowing along with other symptoms. Some animals may appear depressed instead of aggressive.

Transmission occurs through direct contact with saliva or brain/nervous tissue with broken skin or mucus membranes and infects the central nervous system. Keeping pets vaccinated against rabies is a crucial step in rabies prevention.

You may contact the Lincoln County Health Department if you have any questions or concerns at 606-365-3106.

A Malden woman will go through a series of rabies vaccines after she was attacked by a rabid raccoon in her backyard.

Laurie Rose said she went outside to put her chicken in its pen on Saturday when she saw the raccoon. She said it charged at her and would not let go of her heel, WCVB reported.

Rose's husband, Brad Day, heard her yell and rushed outside to help. He said fending off the raccoon was challenging because he is blind, but it eventually let go of Rose's ankle after Day hit it with a pan several times, the news station reported.

Shortly after, the couple called the police.

Malden Police Officer Michael Polston said the raccoon was "nasty and determined." The officer said he shot the animal because it charged at him.

Rose wasn't seriously injured but since the raccoon tested positive for rabies, she is undergoing several rabies vaccines.

Malden Animal Control Officer Kevin Alkins warned that people should not approach wild animals and should vaccinate their pets, the news station reported.

Two people were attacked Wednesday [30 Jun 2021] in North Carolina after they approached a fox later testing positive for rabies, according to animal control and media reports.

Guilford County Animal Control said a man and a woman were bitten on the arms and legs around 6:30 p.m. in Greensboro, WFMY reported. Both were taken to the hospital and given rabies shots.

The fox was killed with a sledgehammer before officers arrived, according to the TV station, and Animal Control took it for testing. The results came back positive for rabies on Friday [2 Jul 2021].

WXII reported the incident happened in the 600 block of Coronado Drive, a largely residential area in west Greensboro.

The victims were outside when they "heard a fox whining near them," according to the TV station.

At least 4 people were walking on a foot path when they encountered the fox and began recording a video, WGHP reported. They told the TV station the fox was "acting sweet and in need of assistance."

That's when the fox attacked, according to WGHP.

In a 911 call obtained by media outlets, a person can be heard saying 2 people were bitten and 1 "has blood all over."

"I need you all to stay away from the fox," the dispatcher responded, according to WGHP.

The caller then said someone was trying to hold the fox down, the TV station reported.

"I need you to not hold the fox down. We don't want anyone else to get bit," the dispatcher said. "If there's a way to confine it and you can do it safely, but do not try to hold it down just because it's another bite risk."

According to WFMY, someone in the group then started hitting the fox with a sledgehammer.

"I know you said they were hitting the fox with the sledgehammer, but in order to test for rabies we do need to make sure the head of the fox was not severely damaged because that's how, they need to be able to access its mouth," the dispatcher said in response.

Animal control officers arrived shortly thereafter.

Raccoons, foxes, skunks and bats are the most common spreaders of rabies in the area, according to Guilford County Animal Control.

Anyone who is bitten or exposed to a rabid animal should wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately. Animal Control said the rabies vaccine is successful when started "soon after the bite or exposure." Rabies can, however, be fatal if left untreated.

Animal Control recommends people avoid "strange and sick animals" and not "approach or play with wild animals of any kind."

"Enjoy wildlife from a distance," the county agency said.

["Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals, most commonly transmitted by a rabid animal bite. The majority of reported cases occur in wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. The virus infects the central nervous system resulting in disease within the brain and then death.

"In people, the symptoms initially include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, the signs become more severe, including insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water. Typically, death occurs within days after the onset of these symptoms" (http://michigan.gov/emergingdiseases).

Rabies is a serious disease. Vaccinate your pets against this deadly disease. If your pet is without the vaccine and is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be euthanized. If you keep your pets up to date on the rabies vaccine, you can prevent the pet's death and perhaps save your own life or certainly save yourself the necessary shots of post exposure.

If you are bitten by an animal, wash the bite site with soap and plenty of water, and seek medical attention. You may require a series of vaccine shots called post exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

If your vaccinated pet is bitten, wash the wound and take your pet to the veterinarian. A booster rabies vaccine is usually required.

If your pet is not vaccinated but is bitten by a rabid animal, it will be humanely euthanized. There is no treatment for an animal which has not been vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG
