At least 14 people have died of cholera in northeastern Brazil in the past six months, the country's
worst outbreak of the disease since 1994, news reports said Wednesday. Since the start of [1999,
a total of 1455 people had been diagnosed with cholera, according to health authorities in
Pernambuco state.
During all of 1998 a total of 1161 people were infected with cholera in Pernambuco, while 625
people were infected in 1997. In 1994, cholera killed more than 80 people in Brazil. The current
cholera outbreak was exacerbated by a drought, which was forcing people to wash food with impure
water, health authorities said.

The health authorities of Honduras this Wednesday [2 June 1999 reported that the cases of
cholera increased from 13 to 25 since the beginning of 1999 in this Central American country,
where the disease was responsible for one death in the poor indigenous region of La Mosquitia
(east). The Vice Minister of Population Risks, Elliet Giron, said that there was confirmation that
11 persons were infected by the bacteria, but they are out of danger, having recovered
satisfactorily.
The official lamented that the zone of La Mosquitia continues to register cases of the disease in
the border zone with Nicaragua following the damage provoked by the hurricane Mitch last
October and November.
On 6 May 1999, the Honduran Health authorities declared a "national alert" against cholera as a
result of six cases of the disease that had been reported on that day, resulting in one death, in La
Mosquitia and in Santa Barbara, on the border with Guatemala. The alert consisted of reenforcing
all of the regional Health zones, hospitals as well as health centers, with supplies necessary to
attend the cases [of cholera that would present [to the health facilities and to [educate the
population in prevention with hygienic norms which should lead to reducing the risk of contracting
the disease.

The Honduran Public Health Ministry has declared a state of alert following a new outbreak of
cholera in regions bordering Nicaragua and Guatemala.
In Honduras, 32 cases of the disease have been recorded and it has already caused three deaths.
Elliethe Giron, vice minister of Public Health, said that she has already spoken with health officials
from neighboring countries to implement measures to curb the spread of the disease. Some 120
people have died in Guatemala and Nicaragua of cholera over the last few months.
Throughout Honduras, there have been 73 000 cases of diarrhea reported in children under five
years of age and some 11 520 cases reported in people older than 15. More than 6600 cases of
dysentery have been reported, Giron said.
The Public Health Ministries of all three countries have agreed to work together to control the
outbreak of cholera and other intestinal diseases, usually caused by drinking contaminated water.
Contamination levels in most Central American rivers have risen following the landfall of
Hurricane Mitch in October and November 1998.

In Kinshasa, 459 cases of cholera, including 50 deaths, have been reported since the beginning of
the year. However, the real death toll would be higher if cases reported outside the units which
offer treatment were also taken into consideration. According to the report drafted by the 23rd
session of epidemiological monitoring unit and submitted today at the meeting of the sub-
committee in charge of combating epidemics and disasters, the number of cases is increasing in
Kinshasa and in the provinces. There is in fact a serious threat and, if hygienic conditions are not
strictly observed, the epidemic, which is already spreading rapidly, will reach all 24 of the
Kinshasa districts and provinces.

Biu and Hawul and quoted deputy governor of the state Ali Abubakar Jatau as saying the government
had initiated moves to curb further spread of the disease.

At least 14 people have died and more than 100 have been hospitalized in the past two weeks after
an outbreak of cholera in refugee camps in western Uganda. State-owned and private media in
Uganda have reported 30 deaths in Bundibugyo, a mountainous region where 100 000 refugees
have fled in the past three years to escape attacks by rebels fighting to oust President Yoweri
Museveni. But health officials with the aid group Doctors Without Borders-France estimated that
14 people had died. Officials say the outbreak in Bundibugyo, 236 miles west of the capital of
Kampala, is due to overcrowding, lack of clean water and poor sanitation. Kampala's private Capital
Radio reported in April that 100 people were feared dead from cholera along Uganda's
southwestern border. Another outbreak in December left nearly 500 people dead nationwide.
