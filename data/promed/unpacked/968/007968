[Sam, an iconic koala that became famous as a result of a photograph
of her drinking from a firefighter's water bottle during the Victoria
bushfires

<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/sam-the-koala-dies/story-e6frf7jx-1225758651550>,
resulted in this article in the London Telegraph when she had to be
euthanised because of severe urogenital cystic lesions]:

Koalas live in the rolling hills and flat plains where eucalyptus
trees grow, because they need the leaves for both food and water. But
as people move in, koalas are finding themselves with fewer trees,
researchers have said. The stress is bringing out a latent disease
that infects 50 to 90 per cent of the animals. "Koalas are in
diabolical trouble," says researcher Frank Carrick, who heads the
Koala Study Program at the University of Queensland. "Numbers show
that even in their stronghold, koala numbers are declining alarmingly."

The problem came to national attention in August 2009, when the
well-known Sam the Koala died during surgery to treat the disease,
called chlamydia. Sam captured the world's attention during major
wildfires in February 2009, when she was photographed drinking from
the water bottle of a firefighter in a smouldering forest. Sam was in
such obvious pain from chlamydia that veterinarian John Butler
decided to operate. But her organs were too scarred to complete the
surgery, and Sam was euthanised.

Chlamydiosis is a [bacterial disease] that breaks out in koalas in
times of stress like cold sores in humans and leads to infections in
the eyes and urinary, reproductive and respiratory tracts. It can
cause blindness, infertility and death.

Deborah Tabart, chief executive of the Australian Koala Foundation,
urged the government to follow up on Sam's case by classifying koalas
as a threatened species and implementing policies to preserve their
habitat. Her organization named September "Save the Koala" month,
with the theme "No Tree, No Me." The United States already considers
the koala a threatened species. And the Australian Koala Foundation
estimates there are fewer than 100 000 koalas left in Australia, down
from the millions at the time European settlement started in the late 1700s.

Mr Carrick and other scientists think the numbers are slightly
higher, but in any case, regional counts by scientists and state
governments show a huge drop. There's clear evidence that some local
populations have gone extinct because of chlamydial disease, Carrick said.

The majority of koalas live on a stretch of eastern coastline in the
states of Queensland and New South Wales. They are most abundant on
the so-called Koala Coast, a 155 square-mile swath of semi-rural
coast in southeastern Queensland. A 2008 survey of the Koala Coast by
the Queensland government shows the population dropped 64 per cent,
from more than 6200 in 1999 to about 2800. While car accidents and
dog attacks killed many koalas, the report blamed about 60 per cent
of the deaths on disease.

[Ex Draft of National Koala Conservation & Management Strategy,
2009-2014, section 6.4, Disease "The most significant diseases in
wild koalas are associated with chlamydial infections. Many koalas
appear to carry _Chlamydia_ without showing clinical symptoms. Eye or
urinary tract infections due to _Chlamydia_ may become apparent as
overt diseases when an animal is subjected to additional stress such
as nutritional deficiency following habitat loss or loss of
territory. Infection of the reproductive tract by _Chlamydia_ may
lead to female infertility, which may reach sufficiently high levels
to cause a marked depression of the reproductive rate in the
population. This may be an issue of particular concern for small,
isolated populations. However, some populations with _Chlamydia_ also
reach over-abundant levels. For example, koala populations at
Raymoind Island, Snake Island and Mt. Eccles National Park are
_Chlamydia_ positive but have grown to such an extent that they have
out-stripped their food supplies.

The frequency of severe cases of disease in healthy koala populations
is usually low and thus does not normally threaten the survival of
koala populations. Vulnerability to disease may itself be an
indicator of problems such as nutritional or environmental stress.

The low genetic variation found in koalas in some locations may
exacerbate the risk of disease. If a new disease risk arises in such
populations, low genetic variation means that a high proportion of
individuals may be vulnerable to the disease."

Sam had had to be considered for surgery. His reply follows. - Mod.MHJ]

The most recent review of chalmydiosis in koalas is in a chapter
written by Wendy Blanshard and Kate Bodley in the 2008 textbook
Medicine of Australian Native Mammals - Blanshard, W. and K. Bodley
(2008) Koalas. In L. Vogelnest and R. Woods (eds) Medicine of
Australian Mammals, pp 226 - 327. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood,
Victoria, Australia: see <http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/21/pid/5742.htm>).

Rupert Woods (Australian Wildlife Health Network: see
<http://www.wildlifehealth.org.au/AWHN/home.aspx>) commented that in
this chapter, chlamydiosis in koalas is discussed on p. 285 under
10.11.12; urinary tract infection and disease on p. 289; and the
section on treatment starts on p. 294. There is no mention of
surgical treatment for the urinary/reproductive tract involvement.

Kate Bodley (Melbourne Zoo) commented that "I understand that surgery
was performed to explore/assess reproductive tract pathology.
Unfortunately, the laparotomy revealed severe disease affecting
reproductive tract, bladder and ureters. Details of similar surgical
approach (following diagnosis of reproductive tract cysts in a
captive koala in the US) can be found in: Mathews et al. (1995):
Ultrasonographic diagnosis and surgical treatment of cystic
reproductive disease in a female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine 26: 440-452."

Jon Hanger (Australia Zoo) noted that for the classical chlamydial
diseases: "Keratoconjunctivitis: surgery is not indicated and can
lead to serious complications if performed early in the treatment
period. It is best left until the proliferative/granulation tissue
has reduced to its greatest degree using topical steroids (such as
Maxidex, a topical dex[amethasone] preparation). If residual small
tags of tissue are still present in the conjunctiva, their surgical
removal may be warranted. Surgery is often unnecessary for treatment
of even severe proliferative keratoconjunctivitis, if appropriate
conservative therapy is used.

Urogenital tract infection: Ovariohysterectomy is warranted if there
are gross changes detectable in the reproductive tract (by
ultrasonography or palpation). Ovarian bursal cysts are the most
common gross manifestation of reproductive tract disease in females,
although cysts and abscesses may affect the uteri and oviducts.
Surgical treatment is recommended (by us) because elimination of
infection (using antibiotics) does not often stop progression of
pathologic changes and their sequelae. Cysts or abscesses may grow to
such an extent that they interfere with defaecation/urination, and
may rupture leading to localised or generalized peritonitis. Chronic
pain is difficult to detect in koalas, so I would prefer to remove
diseased tissue (i.e. reproductive tract) if the animal is to be kept
alive. Surgery is generally not indicated for chronic cystitis,
although large urinary casts of necrotic exudates/fibrin/blood may
cause urethral obstruction and other complications, for which
cystotomy may be indicated. Ureteral obstruction due to scarring in
the bladder wall may cause dilatation, and theoretically (never tried
it myself) surgical techniques may assist in resolving that."

Wendy Blanshard (Sea World Australia) commented that "the treatment
of ocular disease differs greatly at different institutions, so to be
inclusive, we documented [in the chapter on koalas in the 2008
textbook Medicine of Australian Mammals] the approach at 3 different
facilities. A summary of the Mathews et al. (1995) procedure to which
Kate alluded can be found in the surgery section at 14.4 reproductive tract."

With respect to Sam, Jon commented that "I imagine that the surgery
proposed for "Sam" was ovariohysterectomy due to reproductive tract
disease. This surgery can be difficult and dangerous, particularly
for the inexperienced. Complications due to adhesions and scarring
are common sequelae of chronic disease, and can cause significant
surgical challenges. The ureters course closely to the reproductive
tract and can be inadvertently damaged or ligated during
ovariohysterectomy. Having said that, we perform the operation
commonly and with good success (probably greater than 90 percent). We
generally only choose to operate on healthy, well nourished koalas
without any other concurrent disease or complications."

With respect to the number of koalas and trend in the population of
the species, Wendy Blanshard's and Kate Bodley's book chapter notes
that: "The koala is found in eastern Australian sclerophyll forests
and woodlands, and there are populations in Queensland, New South
Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and South Australia
(Melzer et al. 2000). It has a widespread distribution and is
abundant in many areas. The distribution, however, is largely
fragmented, with populations separated by unsuitable habitat or
cleared land (Martin & Handasyde 1999). Estimates of population size
are few and inconsistent. The conservation status varies throughout
its distribution, reflecting regional perceptions of current threats
to koalas and to their habitat (Melzer et al. 2000). Populations in
New South Wales and Queensland are subject to a number of key
threatening processes, including habitat loss through clearing of
native vegetation and urban development, and populations are
declining in those states. Increasing urban expansion also
contributes to mortality in local populations via increases in
road-associated deaths and exposure to attack by domestic dogs.

In contrast, unsustainably high population levels have developed in
six isolated patches across Victoria and on Kangaroo Island (SA)
(Menkhorst et al. 1998). Habitat destruction and hunting contributed
to a marked decline in populations in Victoria and South Australia
during the early 20th century. Koalas were reintroduced in some
mainland habitats in these states, via translocation from flourishing
populations that were established on off-shore islands during the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unsustainable densities in
isolated populations (including some of those established on these
islands, and several mainland populations living in remnant habitat)
have resulted in overbrowsing of forage trees, widespread tree death
and, in some cases, starvation of koalas (Martin 1985a). Koala
populations in South Australia have largely been re-established using
animals translocated from a single colony that flourished after being
introduced to French Island (Vic.), during the 1880!
s."

Australia's federal (national) and state/territory ministers for the
environment (working as the Natural Resource Management Ministerial
Council, NRMMC) have released a draft National Koala Conservation and
Management Strategy 2009-2014 (see:
<http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/publications/koala-strategy/pubs/draft-koala-strategy.pdf>).
This strategy was developed by the National Koala Conservation and
Management Strategy Steering Committee on behalf of NRMMC and was
circulated earlier this year (June 2009) for public comment. The
initial National Koala Conservation Strategy was released in 1998 and
aimed to conserve koalas by retaining viable populations in the wild
throughout their natural range. In 2006, the NRMMC agreed to review
the strategy, and that review is available online (see:
<http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/publications/koala-strategy/review.html>).

I hope these comments help to answer the questions that the recent
media reports raised.
