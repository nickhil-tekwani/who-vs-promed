Dengue/DHF in Vietnam: Update to Mid-August 2001
------------------------------------------------
The country is currently experiencing a significant increase in the
number of reported cases of the potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF), according to officials from the Ministry of Health. Dengue
fever has infected more than 18 700 people and claimed 44 lives across
the country in the period up to mid-August 2001. This is a 57%
increase on the same period last year, officials warned.
The last major epidemic in 1998 resulted in 234 920 cases and 380
deaths. A total of 100 deaths were recorded in 1999 and 2000.
The majority of the reported cases are from the southern part of the
country, with 14 450 cases and 42 fatalities. In An Giang province, 12
deaths were recorded out of 2300 reported cases. Binh Thuan and Phu
Yen provinces also experienced high infection rates with 2200 and
2170 cases, respectively.
The disease has been gradually spreading to the central and northern
provinces of Quang Binh and Nghe An. Health workers and experts
have been dispatched to the disease-prone areas to provide treatment
and raise awareness about prevention, officials emphasized. There is
no preventive vaccine or cure for dengue fever, and the high death toll
is attributed to the delay in seeking medical treatment.
The disease is reaching the peak of its 3-year cycle in Vietnam,
although the number of cases has increased considerably in the
southern part of the country. High humidity caused by a prolonged hot
spell in the central region and the seasonal rains in the south make for
ideal breeding conditions for dengue mosquitoes, Ministry officials
stated.
