We have had medical confirmation of the recent human case, a heroin addict,
in Oslo, Norway. The index case was seen in the emergency clinic on 4 Apr
2000 with an infected injection site. As he had not improved when seen
again on 6th April he was instructed to go to the local hospital where he
later died on 10 Apr having been found comatose at home on the 7th.
Organisms found in his CSF were confirmed as _B. anthracis_.
Local authorities are making the necessary inquiries.

[It should be noted that cutaneous anthrax can carry a significant risk of
death especially if treatment is refused. At the terminal systemic stage
organisms may be recovered from the CSF even if the initial clinical
diagnosis is cutaneous anthrax. MHJ
