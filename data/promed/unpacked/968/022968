An 8 year old pupil at Ende III Catholic Elementary School in Ende, East
Nusa Tenggara died on Tuesday [4 Nov 2008] after being bitten in September
[2008] by a suspected rabid dog. There have been 135 such fatalities in the
province over the past 10 years, with 3 this year [2008].

"The victim's family said [the boy was bitten] in September [2008]," said
Yosep Deo of the Ende Health Agency. "At the time, the victim did not
receive any treatments such as anti-rabies serum or vaccine at the local
Puskesmas (community health center) or hospital." Yosep said the boy later
received a vaccine, but by then, he was in a critical phase. "[He] had
entered the 4th stage when he was brought to the hospital. He was afraid of
water, wind, and light, just like other people infected by rabies," Yosep said.

He said some 50 000 out of 200 000 dogs in Flores (where Ende regency is
located) and Lembata islands had yet to be vaccinated.

Rabies is an acute viral disease that attacks the nervous system and is
usually transmitted through the bite of an infected animal. Other animals
that can transmit the virus include bats, cats, foxes, raccoons and skunks.

[The figure of 50 000 dogs vaccinated among a population of 200 000 remains
unchanged since the previous report from Flores in February of this year
2008, suggesting that the dog vaccination program has stalled. Travelers
should be aware of the continuing risk of exposure to rabies virus
infection by contact with domestic and feral dogs in this region.
