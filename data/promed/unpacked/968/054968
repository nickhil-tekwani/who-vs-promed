A useful alternative to protect travellers is the use of insect repellents.
DEET based products are highly effective against Aedes aegypti. Because
this species tends to bite close to the ground, it is particularly
convenient to use an aerosol on exposed skin of the legs and feet (if in
shorts/skirt and sandals) or on the lower part of the leg and socks (if in
more formal clothing). Although reapplication is likely to be necessary
every two to four hours with a 20% DEET aerosol, many tourists will not
find this too much of a problem because they are only exposed outside of
air-conditioned buildings during part of the day. Of course, there are many
other
formulations of repellents, some of which may be longer lasting but less
convenient to use.
I am not aware of a quantitative study showing that dengue transmission was
limited by the use of repellents, so the advice above is based on personal
experience during studies of repellents and living in Latin America and
Thailand.
