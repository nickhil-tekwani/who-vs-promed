EPIDEMIC ALERT - ALBANIA
************************
Date: Tue, 08 Jul 1997 18:45:49 -0400
From: "Robert A. LaBudde" <ral@lcfltd.com>

Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph)
July 8, 1997: Kristo Pano, head of the infectious diseases unit of Tirana's
University Hospital Center is quoted as saying, "We think that all the
conditions exist for the explosion of an epidemic. Poor water. Clouds of
flies. Bad personal hygiene. A low level of education."
Pano has denied reports that typhoid fever had broken out in the capital,
Tirana. There was, however, an outbreak in Elbasan, 20 miles SE of Tirana,
in April 1997, in which about 30 people fell ill. Polio broke out last summer.
UNICEF, anticipating an imminent health emergency, began broadcasting public
service announcements on Albanian TV three weeks ago because the conditions
for a cholera outbreak are present (there was one in 1994). The spots
instruct people to take basic precautions like boiling water and washing
their hands before eating. UNICEF is providing Albania with oral
rehydration salts to treat diarrheal disease and chlorine to purify water in
an attempt to control the spread of disease. However, until the water
distribution system is replaced the risk to public health will remain high.
The country has been suffering from chronic malnutrition, civil unrest and a
breakdown in the distribution of food and medicine in many parts of the country.
