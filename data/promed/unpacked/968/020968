United Party for National Development (UPND) Kasengo ward councillor in
Mazabuka has said corridor disease has nearly wiped out all herds of cattle
in 14 villages in the area. [Corridor disease, caused by the protozoan
parasite _Theileria parva lawrenceii_, infects cattle and African buffalo
(_Syncerus caffer_) and is carried by the brown ear tick (_Rhipicephalus
appendiculatus_) - Mod.TG
Mr. Jonathan Mufaya said cattle had been dying since the disease broke out 3
years ago. Mr. Mufaya said although President Chiluba released funds to
control the disease in Southern Province, farmers failed to acquire funds
because the conditions were too stiff and they could not afford it. He said
the farmers were required to pay 25 percent first instalment which was
supposed to be paid within 6 months. He said only the commercial farmers
could meet the conditions as peasant farmers lost all their animals.
He said farmers feared this farming season would be difficult without cattle
in cultivating their land since there were no cattle remaining. Mr. Mufaya
appealed to Government to establish a donkey system of farming because
donkeys were not prone to this disease.
