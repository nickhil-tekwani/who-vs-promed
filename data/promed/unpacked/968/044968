The number of dialysis centers around the country reporting problems with
the machines increased to 11 following a government alert that said
malfunctioning tubing could expose patients to each other's blood.
Some of the 11 centers and hospitals have alerted their patients to the
equipment problems, including blood leaks inside dialysis machines, and
said they'll conduct regular blood tests for exposure to hepatitis or HIV.
The Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide safety alert last week
to all dialysis centers because of the chance that malfunctioning equipment
potentially exposed patients to contaminated blood.
At the time, four centers had reported some problem with tubing used
extensively in the dialysis process.
Since the FDA's alert, another seven centers have notified the agency of
problems, and it is continuing to investigate to determine "the exact
nature of the problem and what is causing it," spokeswoman Sharon Snider
said Friday.
The machines are used to cleanse the blood of deadly toxins when the
kidneys fail. There is concern because traces of blood were found in tubing
inside the machines, Steven Niedelman, an enforcement director for the
FDA's Center for Medical Devices and Radiological Health in Rockville, Md.,
said last week. Filters are supposed to prevent that from happening.
He said the risk that patients were exposed to blood-borne diseases was
"extremely remote."
Nipro Medical Corp., which manufactures the tubing, has voluntarily
recalled 154,000 tubing sets.
St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson, one of the first centers identified, told
its 121 dialysis patients about potential problems. Officials also told
patients they would undergo blood tests for possible exposure to HIV,
hepatitis or other blood-borne infections.
At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Lee Regional Hospital in
Johnstown, Pa., spokeswoman Anne McGrath said no blood leaked within the
dialysis machines and none of 67 patients was exposed.
None of the other centers said anyone had been exposed to contaminated
blood. Several did not return calls seeking comment and some said blood
testing would be offered.
The other centers are Bayonne Hospital in Bayonne, N.J., Total Renal Care
in Miami Lakes, Fla., Dialysis Clinic of Oak Ridge, Tenn., Maine General
Medical Center in Waterville, Maine, Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Des
Moines, Iowa, Methodist Hospital in Houston, Cape County Regional Dialysis
Center in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Bay Health Medical Center in Dover, Del.,
and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

[It is small consolation to renal dialysis patients who may have been
exposed to HIV to know that they are being offered testing. This recall
should be a wake-up for all renal dialysis units worldwide to check their
filters for cleanliness. - Mod.JW
