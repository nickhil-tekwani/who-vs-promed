Bird flu in 2 Bengal districts
------------------------------
Bird flu has been detected afresh in West Bengal's Darjeeling and
Jalpaiguri districts and culling of 65 000 birds will begin tomorrow
[4 Jan 2008], official sources said today [3 Jan 2008].

The epicentres of the avian influenza in Darjeeling district were
Benoy Krishna Palli village under Matigara village of Siliguri
sub-division and Pubang village under Sadar sub-division in the
hills, district magistrate Surendra Gupta told a press conference [in
Siliguri].

Altogether 30 culling teams would start work in full swing from
tomorrow morning [4 Jan 2008], Gupta said. A control room headed by a
deputy director of Animal Husbandry has been opened at Pintal village
[in Siliguri] on the outskirts of the town, he said.

Gupta said there was no notification to stop sale and consumption of
birds and poultry products outside the 5 km (3 mi) radius of the 2
epicentres. [INR] 50 lakh [USD 104 000) has been allotted for culling
operations, which included 34 wards under Siliguri Municipal
Corporation.

Bird flu has also been confirmed in adjacent gram panchayats [local
government at village level] 1 and 2 in Fulbari in Jalpaiguri
district, its DM Bandana Yadav said. 10 culling teams had been formed
and 4000 birds would be culled from tomorrow [4 Jan 2008], she said.

Earlier, over 20 000 birds were culled in Malda in mid-December
[2008] after the H5N1 virus was confirmed in the north Bengal
district.
