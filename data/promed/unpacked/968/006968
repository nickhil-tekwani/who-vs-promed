A [Nagaland] State level workshop on 'Hepatitis B and C virus' (HBV and HCV) was conducted on [21 Sep 2016] at the conference Hall of the Directorate of Health and Family Welfare with the health officials of the Health Department, Government of Nagaland.

Maongwati Aier, IAS [Indian Administrative Service], Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, addressed the workshop as the guest of honor. Sharing concerns about the alarming rate of HCV infection recorded in some studies conducted in Nagaland, he mentioned that the rate was as high as 30 percent among injecting drug users. According to a press note, Regional Medical Research Centre of ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] located in Dibrugarh, National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, and Kripa Foundation were involved in this investigation carried out in 2005. Also sharing the Integrated Bio-Behavioral Assessment (IBBA) study among injecting drug users (IDUs) in 2006 and 2009 according to which the prevalence of HCV among IDUs in Phek stood at 5.4 percent (2006) to 8.7 percent (2009) and 16.7 percent (2006) to 20.8 percent (2006) in Wokha, respectively.

"All these data underlined an expanding HCV epidemic in the state of Nagaland," Aier said while lamenting about lack of awareness on the whole issue and suggested that the message has to reach the macro level and for which he urged the participants to become master trainers and conduct training of trainers (TOTs) to facilitate dissemination of information as widely as possible. On HBV vaccination, he mentioned that "it has to be made available at all Health settings and also to population groups who are most at risk."

The workshop was chaired by Principal Director, Dr L Watikala while Dr Samiran Panda, from NICED ([National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases], ICMR) and Dr Saubhik Ghosh from Calcutta Medical College spoke on the transmission, disease burden and clinical aspects of HBV and HCV. Dr Panda discussed in details about the transmission dynamics of both the viruses and highlighted that while HBV is a DNA virus, HCV has RNA at its core. He further drove the points home that while HBV vaccine is available, no such vaccine against HCV exist in the market.

[Most of the reporting regarding viral hepatitis on the Indian subcontinent relates to the waterborne types, A and E. Hepatitis C is not water or foodborne but rather transmits mostly through contaminated blood or blood products, from contaminated needles in the healthcare setting and in injection drug users. - Mod.LL
