The Ministry of Health in Mambwe district in Eastern Province have recorded an increase in cases of Chicken Pox [Varicella] from 80 -- 349 [cases] in the 3rd quarter.

Mambwe District Acting Public Health Officer Moses Sakala said the district has also recorded an increase in the number of diarrhea cases from 136 -- 219 in the same quarter.

Mr Sakala observed that the increase in the number of patients with chicken pox is attributed to the challenges being faced by the department to isolate patients from other members of the community.

He noted that many people do not pay particular attention to such cases such that even school going children who have the infection are allowed to attend class by the school administration as opposed to staying home.

And Mr Sakala has expressed sadness over the ignorance of some community members to come forward and receive the relevant vaccination against chicken pox, even after receiving the necessary sensitization.

Meanwhile, Mr Sakala disclosed that diarrhoea samples have since been sent to the laboratory in order to ascertain the cause of the sudden rise in diarrhoea cases in the district.

[Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human pathogenic alphaherpesvirus, and the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) during primary infection and zoster (shingles) during reactivation from latency in sensory ganglia. In rare cases, VZV primary infection or reactivation can cause more severe diseases, including pneumonitis and CNS disease, manifesting as cerebellitis, encephalitis, or stroke.

If anyone has information on the cause of the diarrhea, ProMED would appreciate hearing from them.

Sephu Primary School (PS) in Wangdue reported 8 cases of chicken pox among students yesterday [Mon 6 Nov 2017], taking the total number of infected to 26 since [Thu 2 Nov 2017].

The school health in-charge, Rinchen Om, said 5 students complained of the sickness on [Thu 2 Nov 2017].and were sent to Sephu basic health unit (BHU). It was later confirmed that the students were suffering from chicken pox.

Infected students were sent home on medication. The school again reported another 6 cases on [Fri 3 Nov 2017].

The school received another 4 girls and 4 boys suffering from chicken pox yesterday [Mon 06 Nov 2017]. Most of the students infected are below 14 years of age. The school has total of 112 students from pre-primary to class VI.

"This is the 1st time the school has seen outbreak of chicken pox," she said, adding that at least 2 cases keep coming [per] day. No students, however, have been admitted in the BHU.

Rinchen Om added the school sends students home when they are found to have contacted the disease to prevent from spreading. "The BHU health officials have already come and created awareness to students on the prevention of the disease. We call their parents and advise them to visit BHU, which is 4km [2.48 mi approx.] from the school."

Health assistant, Tashi Pelden, said that although it is not confirmed, the outbreak was likely spread from a student from Nobding Lower Secondary School who was in Sephu village after he was sent home for treatment.

"Looks like that the student had visited Sephu PS and that was how the disease was spread," she said. "Since some of the students recovered in a few days the outbreak is not so alarming."

[It is not clear whether these students had been vaccinated. According to CDC, 2 doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox. The 1st dose is recommended at age 12 through 15 months old and the 2nd at age 4 through 6 years. Some people who are vaccinated against chickenpox may still get the disease. However, it is usually milder with fewer blisters and little or no fever.
