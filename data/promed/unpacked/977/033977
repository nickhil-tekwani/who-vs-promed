y Leon in 1996.
- 513 cases were reported (368 of these 'probable', and 53
confirmed) in Castilla y Leon during January 1997 to March 1998 -
with 46 additional cases reported (13 confirmed) in Asturias,

Austria:
--------
25 of the 26 cases reported in 1994 were registered in
Niederostereich. 2.8% of ticks (_Dermacentor reticularis_) were
found to be infected along the Moravian border in 1996.
Czechoslovakia [former:
-------------------------
- Epidemics were recorded in Slovakia during the 1960's. Rates in
the area declined from 5.5/100 000 (1969) to 0.3/100 000 (1980 to
1994).
- Over 2500 cases were described in Southern Moravia during 1960
to 1993.
- 126 cases were reported in Slovakia during 1985 to 1996 - 96.8%
of these from the western region (50% from Nitra and Noveacute
Zamky), and most among high-risk groups during summer.
Lagomorphs accounted for 66% and ectoparasites for 20.5%.
- Tick-borne disease was first documented in Western Slovakia in
1985. The organism is present in wild ticks (_Dermacentor
reticulatus_ - rarely _Ixodes ricinus_, _I. trianguliceps_ and
_Haemaphysalis concinna_).
- _D. reticulatus_ is the principal vector in Southern Moravia
(2.2% of ticks infected in 1996).
Finland:
--------
- Highest rates are reported in Kymenlaakso and Pirkanmaa, and
during early autumn.
- Epidemics were recorded in 1983 (600 cases confirmed in the
Oulu area of northern Finland) and 1989.
- 467 isolates were registered in 1995 - 207 of these from
Keski-Suomi; 397 in 1996 (over 50% in women) - 72 from Hame and
58 from Keski-Suomi; 109 in 1997.
France:
--------
The highest incidence is registered in Alsace Lorraine,
Champagne, Franche-Comte, Indre-et-Loire, Indre, Vienne and
Dordogne.
Germany:
---------
Ten cases were reported during 1983 to 1990.
Italy:
-----
- The first case of human tularemia was reported in 1965. Human
disease was subsequently reported from Emilia-Romagna, Grosseto,
Lombardia, Tuscany and Umbria.
- The last cases were registered in 1982 (49 cases during a
water-borne outbreak in Arezzo).
- A locally-infected hare was reported in 1987. Two infected
hares were imported (from Romania and Hungary) in 1995; 3 (from
Hungary and Slovakia) in 1997.
Norway:
---------
- The disease is most common in the northern region.
- 54% of patients are in the age group 30 to 54, and most
infections are acquired by handling hares and other game.
- 105 cases were reported during 1975 to 1990 - 34% characterized
as oropharyngeal and 38% as ulceroglandular.
- As many as 4.7% of schoolchildren are seropositive.
Poland:
-------
- A single case was reported from Komzynskie in 1996.
- Antibody is present in 0.13% of forest workers in the
northeast.
Former USSR:
---------------
- Tularemia is reported from the Ukraine, with annual rates of
approximately 0.1/100 000. The major natural Crimean
focus is the Kerch Peninsula.
- Two cases were reported in Estonia in 1942; 8 in 1958; 1 in
1962; 0 during 1968 to 1995; 24 during August to September 1996 -
23 of these from Prangli Island.

- Over 2800 cases of pulmonary disease (most in farmers) were
reported during 1966 to 1967, and ascribed to the cleaning of
rodent-infested barns.
- More than 500 cases were associated with an outbreak in 1981.
183 cases were reported during 1984 to 1993
- The organism is present in 7.2% of wild hares. Acquisition from
mosquitoes (_Aedes cinereus_) has been documented.
