Although no details are given, a foodborne outbreak suspected caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis to be caused by chilled horse meat from Belgium which was also distributed to France. ProMED would like more information regarding the number of cases and their location.

[Although not an often thought of source of salmonellosis, equines can certainly be on the menu of zoonoses for this pathogen as shown by:

Jay-Russell MT, Madigan JE, Bengson Y, Madigan S, Hake AF, Foley JE, Byrne BA: _Salmonella_ Oranienburg isolated from horses, wild turkeys and an edible home garden fertilized with raw horse manure. Zoonoses Public Health. 2014;61: 64-71.

Abstract
--------
In July 2010, a horse from a rural farm (Farm A) in coastal Northern California was diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infection following referral to a veterinary hospital for colic surgery. Environmental sampling to identify potential sources and persistence of _Salmonella_ on the farm was conducted from August 2010 to March 2011. _Salmonella_ was cultured using standard enrichment and selective plating. Pure colonies were confirmed by biochemical analysis, serotyped and compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. A total of 204 clinical and environmental samples at Farm A were analyzed, and _Salmonella_ spp. was isolated from 6 of 8 (75 percent) horses, an asymptomatic pet dog, 2 of 7 (28.6 percent) water samples from horse troughs, 9 of 20 (45 percent) manure storage pile composites, 16 of 71 (22.5 percent) wild turkey feces and 4 of 39 (10.3 percent) soil samples from the family's edible home garden. Well water and garden vegetable samples and horse fecal samples from a neighboring ranch were negative. _S._ Oranienburg with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the horse clinical strain was found in all positive sample types on Farm A. The investigation illustrates the potential for widespread dissemination of _Salmonella_ in a farm environment following equine infections. We speculate that a recent surge in the wild turkey population on the property could have introduced _S._ Oranienburg into the herd, although we cannot rule out the possibility wild turkeys were exposed on the farm or to other potential sources of _Salmonella_. Findings from the investigation indicated that raw horse manure applied as fertilizer was the most likely source of garden soil contamination. Viable _S._ Oranienburg persisted in garden soil for an estimated 210 days, which exceeds the 120-day standard between application and harvest currently required by the National Organic Program. The study underscores the need to educate the public about potential food safety hazards associated with using raw animal manure to fertilize edible home gardens.
