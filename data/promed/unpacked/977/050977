Rabid bat bites woman
----------------------
A woman has been bitten by a bat which has tested positive for a strain of
rabies that can affect humans. The volunteer bat warden has been
vaccinated against the disease after she was bitten on the hand while
caring for the animal on 11 Sep 2002 in north Lancashire.
Initial tests on a Daubenton's bat have proved positive for a strain of
rabies not seen in Britain since 1996, the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (Defra) has confirmed. But experts are waiting for the
results of further tests. Five other people who came into contact with the
animal have also received medical treatment.
The strain of rabies, thought to be the most likely virus, is known as EBL
(European bat lyssavirus) [the various serotypes and biotypes of rabies
virus are species classified in the genus _Lyssavirus_; the name is derived
from the Greek "lyssa" meaning rage, fury, madness in dogs. - Mod.CP]. EBL
is a [virus] common in bats across northern Europe and has killed 3 people
in Europe since 1977.
"We have identified 5 other people who had any involvement in the handling
of the bat and are beginning post-exposure treatment. Probably this is over
the top." Dr Frank Atherton, director of public health in Morecambe Bay,
said: "There is no threat to the general public from what has happened in
north Lancashire."
Rare cases
Sick and dead bats, are being sent by conservationists to veterinary
authorities for analysis. It is hoped tests will confirm whether or not
any of the bats are carrying the rabies strain by early next week. Defra
said anyone who finds a sick or ailing bat should not approach or handle it
but should seek advice from a local bat conservation group.
If this case is confirmed it will be the second known case of this strain
of rabies being found in Britain. In June 1996 a pregnant woman and
another woman, were bitten on the hand by a bat carrying the strain.

Suspected case of bat rabies in Lancashire
------------------------------------------
Initial tests carried out on a Daubenton's bat submitted to the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey have shown positive results for a
strain of rabies. Confirmatory tests are in progress.
The bat was found at a premises in Lancashire. The bat had been looked
after by a bat conservationist who was bitten by the bat on 11 Sep 2002. As
a precaution the person has undergone post-exposure treatment for rabies.
Although the risks of pet animals in the house having had contact with the
bat are thought to be low, all pet animals in the house have been put into
isolation as a precaution.
Investigations are continuing at the premises where the bat was found and
at the premises where the bat was kept. These investigations are being
conducted jointly by Defra's State Veterinary Service and officials from
the Department of Health, and ministers are confident that the local teams
are handling the matter well.
Notes for editors
If the confirmatory tests being carried out on the bat prove positive, the
likely agent will be European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL), a strain of rabies
common in bats across Northern Europe. If virus is isolated it will be
genetically typed to establish its origin. EBL rabies will not affect the
UK's rabies-free status.
EBLs are closely related to classical rabies virus. They have been known to
infect not only the primary hosts (insectiverous bats) but on very rare
occasions other animal hosts and human beings. In Europe, between 1977 and
2000, a total of 630 EBL cases in bats have been confirmed, mainly in
Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. There has been a previous
bat-associated rabies case in the UK, when a Daubenton's bat (_Myotis
daubentonii_) was found in Newhaven, Sussex during 1996. The animal was
infected with EBL type virus. The virus had a genetic sequence which
matched EBL viruses from the Swiss-German border, suggesting that this bat
might have been a migrant bat.

European bats which arrive in the UK either as vagrants or as part of their
migratory behaviour may possibly carry EBL. The Veterinary Laboratories
Agency carries out passive surveillance on up to 200 bats each year for bat
rabies. All though it is too early to make judgements about the origin of
this case, over the past 15 years all surveillance cases (apart from the
one found in Newhaven) have returned negative results.
On rare occasions there has been transmission of EBLs to terrestrial
mammals. On two occasions sheep have been infected and in 2002 EBL was
detected in a stone martin in Germany. Since 1977 there have been three
human deaths in Europe attributed to EBL infections, all in cases where the
humans had been in close contact with bats. Although such human cases are
very rare, the risk posed to humans from an EBL infected bat still exists.
Bats are a protected species and must not be killed or their
roosts damaged. EBLs may only be transmitted by the bite of an infected
bat. There is therefore no risk to human beings if bats are not approached
or handled by them.
Precautionary measures
Persons who find a sick or ailing bat should not approach or handle the bat
but seek advice from a local bat conservation group.
Persons licensed to handle bats in Great Britain should ensure that they
have rabies vaccination and should always wear protective gloves when
handling bats. If any person is bitten by a bat, the wound should be
immediately thoroughly cleaned with soap and water. Additional cleansing of
the wound site with an alcohol base or other disinfectant is also
recommended and immediate medical advice must be sought.

[From the press release it appears that the post-exposure treatment of the
bitten person has taken place at least 2 weeks after the alleged incident;
hopefully, there had not been a previous exposure since, from the text, it
is not clear since when the bat had been "looked after". - Mod.AS]
[Rabies is enzootic in all regions of the world except Antartica. However,
several island countries, notably Great Britain, Ireland, Japan, New
Zealand, and Hawaiii, have remained rabies-free once infected animals were
eliminated and strict quarantine and importation regulations applied. Until
1996 Australia was considered rabies-free also, but a novel rabies virus
now designated Australian bat lyssavirus was discovered in Australian bats
and two fatal cases of human infection have been recorded.
The existence of bat rabies in the United Kingdom has been recognised since
1996 when rabies virus was isolated from a single bat among 1800 examined
virologically. The present case is the first indication that rabies virus
can present a risk to people handling bats in the UK. There have been more
than 500 cases of rabies in bats reported in Europe, mostly in Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands and Russia, and at least three human deaths during
the past two decades. In fact two distinct genotypes of European bat
lyssavirus are recognised. European bat lyssavirus 1 was the genotype
previously isolated in the UK; the genotype of the current isolate has not
been reported.
Genetic characterisation of rabies virus isolates supports the subdivision
of the genus _Lyssavirus_ into 7 distinct genotypes. In the United States
more than half the cases of human rabies investigated between 1976 and 1995
proved to be attributable to bat rabies viruses. The European bat
lyssaviruses belong to genotypes 5 an 6, whereas the North American bat
rabies viruses all belong to genotype 1. African bat lyssaviruses (Lagos
bat virus, Mokola virus and Duvenhage virus) comprise genotypes 2, 3 and 4
respectively, and the Australian bat lyssavirus belongs to genotype 7. It
is presumed that there is sufficient cross-reactivity between the North
American and European bat rabies viruses and the canine rabies virus, from
which the current vaccine is derived, to induce protective immunity. - Mod.CP]
