6 residents treated for rabies: 5 rabid bats found in Larimer County
--------------------------------------------------------------------
6 Larimer County, Colorado, residents are being treated for rabies,
and 5 bats in the county have been confirmed to have the disease,
according to the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment.
Those being vaccinated for possible exposure to rabies include Fort
Collins and Loveland residents. The rabid bats have been found in
both cities, as well as rural Larimer County. Also, 2 dogs and a cat
have been quarantined in Fort Collins after possible exposure to rabid bats.

Last year, 2 bats were confirmed to be rabid in Larimer County. No
other wildlife has been found with the disease in Larimer County for
years. However, rabies has been confirmed in 11 skunks this year on
the Eastern Plains, according to the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment.

Jane Viste, public information officer for the county health office,
said July into September is the peak rabies season because it
coincides with bat migration and people being outdoors. Studies in
Colorado have found about 15 percent of bats are carriers of the
disease, which is transmitted by saliva. "There is no huge alert,"
Viste said. "Rabies is endemic to the bat population, so we see
rabies every year. We might be seeing it now because it's hot and
people are leaving their doors and windows open, and people are
outside more. It's not that the bats are doing anything differently."

There has not been a human rabies fatality in Colorado since 1931.
Viste said the key to prevention is to make sure doors and windows
are closed in the house and all holes, as small as one-quarter inch,
sealed. She advised to never pick up or touch a bat. If you see what
appears to be a sick bat or have a bat in your home, you should call
Larimer Humane Society at 226-3647.

She said pet owners should make sure their pets' rabies vaccinations
are up to date. If a family member or pet has been bitten or
scratched by a wild animal, safely contain the wild animal, if
possible, in case rabies testing is needed. People with possible
rabies exposure should consult a doctor immediately.

If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, it
is recommended you contact your veterinarian.

[Rabies is almost always a fatal disease in humans and animals. But
it is very preventable in pets with a simple vaccine. It is generally
preventable in people, by exercising some caution around bats and
wild animals. - Mod.TG
