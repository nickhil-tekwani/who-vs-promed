Artificial hibernation
-------------------
It was with great interest that I read about Dr. Rodney Willoughby inducing
a coma to successfully treat a rabies patient who had not received serum or
vaccine following a bat bite. This procedure, called artificial
hibernation, was introduced in 1952 by a French Navy Surgeon, Henri
Laborit, who demonstrated, for the 1st time, the use of Chlorpromazine to
tranquilize patients without sedation. Subsequently, Laborit devoted
himself to research and became the leader in therapy of psychotropic
syndromes. He received the Albert Lasker prize in 1957. In 1958, Laborit
opened the Laboratory of Eutonologie, at the Boucicaut Hospital in Paris.
He directed this laboratory until his death in 1995.
As a 1st year medical student in 1956, working as a volunteer in a military
hospital in Viet Nam, I was soon introduced to the use of artificial
hibernation to treat patients recovering from surgery, or undergoing severe
post-traumatic shock, or suffering from massive septicemia. The usual lytic
cocktail consisted of a mixture of Largactil-Phenergan-Dolosal, and it was
believed that the induced hypothermia would depress the defense mechanisms
of the patient and inhibit, at least for a while, the active participation
of organs, thus minimizing large expenditures of energy.
Having lost a very close friend to rabies, who was not given the possible
benefit of artificial hibernation, I find it marvelous that the procedure
was resurrected successfully to treat this recent rabies patient, and Dr.
Willoughby should be praised for his courageous initiative.
Most of the literature on the subject is in French, but I just found an
article in: Eur Psychiatry 2002; 17:1-5 Emmanuel Stip. Happy birthday
neuroleptics! 50 years later: la folie du doute.

[Dr. Jozan's interesting recollections are a suitable point to interrupt
this thread until, in due course, more information becomes available on the
progress of Dr. Willoughby's patient. - Mod.CP]
