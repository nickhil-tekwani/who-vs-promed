I would like to know more about this case of yellow fever in the Caribbean
basin. The Dutch authorities state that serology was positive for yellow
fever IgG and IgM but not for dengue. This result surprises me because I
would have expected to see extensive cross reactivity between YF and dengue
in a routine ELISA format assay. What was the exact serological test
performed? A neutralization test may be more conclusive.

[We have requested further information from Dr. Herbert Schilthuis, the
person who sent this report from the Netherlands. When we receive a reply
we will post it. Meanwhile, it can be said with some confidence that
neither IgG nor IgM ELISA would show extensive cross-reactivity between
YFV and dengue viruses. Whereas all are flaviviruses, they are distantly
related ones. The IgM ELISA would be even more specific than the IgG ELISA
in this instance. - Mod.CHC
