Avian Cholera Confirmed on St. Lawrence Island
----------------------------------------------
An unusual number of sick and dead seabirds around St. Lawrence Island is caused by avian cholera, a bacterial infection relatively common in waterfowl other places, but previously undetected in Alaska.

The highly contagious bacterium, _Pasteurella multocida_, has caused many large die-offs of wild waterfowl worldwide and causes one of the most common diseases of domestic poultry. The closest avian cholera events to Alaska in the past decade [2003-2013] involved common eiders and snow geese in Nunavut and Northwest Territories, Canada. It is not related to the infection in people referred to as "cholera."

Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, Wildlife Veterinarian and Wildlife Disease Specialist, says that the speedy detection of the disease was a result of 2 factors. Citizens of Gambell and Savoonga quickly reported seeing sick and dead birds beginning 20 Nov 2013. The University of Alaska's Marine Advisory Program Biologist Gay Sheffield, who is stationed in Nome, received a dead thick-billed murre, a Northern fulmar and a crested auklet and sent them to the US Geological Service National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin. The diagnosis was made on 4 Dec 2013.

Dr. Beckmen said that before the diagnosis was confirmed, local residents had shared concerns about possible causes relating to the environment, and were worried that humans might be susceptible.

_Pasteurella multocida_ is commonly found among both domestic and wild birds but different strains or subtypes are found in other animals such as rodents. "Strains of the avian cholera bacteria are adapted to infect birds are not generally a high risk for infection for people," Dr. Beckmen said. "However, it is always advisable to cook meat thoroughly and never eat sick birds or animals that may have died from a disease. Anyone touching a sick animal should wear gloves and wash hands with soap and water after handling animals or butchering meat."

Dead birds in these outbreaks still contain high numbers of bacteria and can infect other birds. Outbreaks are usually handled by removing the carcasses as soon as possible, but options for disposal on St. Lawrence Island are limited. The Dept. of Environmental Conservation recommends putting carcasses in vented, empty fuel drums that prevent scavenger spread and allow the carcasses to decompose through next summer [2014].

Avian cholera outbreaks are typically localized events that end fairly quickly within a few weeks, and Beckmen noted that the number of sick and dead birds reported is decreasing.

People who wish to report sick or dead wildlife should send an email to <dfg.dwc.vet@alaska.gov> or phone the nearest Alaska Department of Fish and Game office.

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

Avian cholera outbreaks tend to occur every year in some wetlands. But it had never before been reported in Alaska. It would be important to direct research to unveil the underlying mechanisms that determined its occurrence there. The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitations. Others suggest that absence of rain leads to high concentration of waterfowl, leading to unusually high mortality. The influence of water shortage on these episodes should be investigated in detail.
