Bulgarian farmers rebel against FMD culling plans
-------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of farmers in the southeast of Bulgaria, an area close to
Turkey and recently ravaged by repeated outbreaks of foot and mouth
disease (FMD), have decided to defend their animals, saying they would
rather be killed 1st than have their animals destroyed.

Thousands of farm animals in the Strandzha region are earmarked for
destruction as a new outbreak of FMD in the region of Sredets was
confirmed, Bulgarian National Television (BNT) reported on 28 Mar
2011.

But the operation to cull the animals was being hampered by a protest
organised by stock-breeders who are complaining that the Government is
lying to them, depriving them of coherent information, and has failed
on its promises. They accuse the Government of too much talk, and
absolutely no substance behind it.

The stockbreeders have written a lengthy letter to Kristalina
Georgieva, European Commissioner for international co-operation,
humanitarian aid and crisis response, in which they demand that they
are provided with real assistance; furthermore, they demand to know
why the Government is hesitating and refusing to build a fence along
the Turkish border after the 1st FMD outbreak in January [2011].

FMD was found in 4 regions in Bulgaria near the Turkish border for
the 1st time in 12 years. Reportedly, after animals were slaughtered
in Kosti and other regions near Bourgas, Yambol and Haskovo, the
outbreak was successfully tackled, but then Interior Minister Tsvetan
Tsvetanov said that a wall along the border with Turkey would not be
built, because "it was not necessary for the Government to be spending
money on the project."

Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naidenov had said that "it would be
cheaper for us to build a fence and protect our farmers that way,
rather than having to pay them compensation for the animals."

But no fence is being built, and no other measures are being taken to
protect the stockbreeders, who now have vowed that they will not allow
the slaughter to continue. Still, some animals were put down, as the
veterinary teams managed to cull 206 cattle on 28 Mar 2011, but their
owners fear that they will not be compensated properly for them.

Almost the entire population of Momina Tsurkva, a village in the
Strandzha region will be affected if the animals are slaughtered Â­
from large farms which employ up to 30 individuals, to families who
own one or 2 cows on which they rely for milk and cheese, a bTV report
said.

"They are trying to destroy our living. This is a tragedy," farmers
in the village told a bTV news crew.

The previous day, stockbreeders blocked the road leading to Turkey,
threatening that they would not allow their animals to be destroyed
and that they would let them roam free instead.

About 300 farmers from the Strandzha villages of Fakiya, Dolno
Tabulkovo, Granichar and Momina Tsurkva have vowed that they are ready
to fight for their livestock and will not allow the nearly 7000
animals to be killed.

[All 9 outbreaks, recorded in Bulgaria's south since the start of
this epizootic -- reportedly on 4 Jan 2011 -- have occurred along the
Turkish border (see interactive map at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10138>).

Mar 2011, including maps and results of serological surveillance, at

An updated presentation will be posted when becoming available.

The review "FMD Situation in Bulgaria, 2010-2011" by Begona
Valdazo-Gonzalez, Nick J. Knowles, Jef Hammond and Donald King
includes the following (selected) statement:
"VP1 sequence analysis on samples received from the first case of FMD
in Bulgaria in a wild boar was carried out at the IAH and showed that
the virus belongs to the MIDDLE EAST-SOUTH ASIA (ME-SA) topotype
(PanAsia-2 lineage, ANT-10 sub-lineage) and is closely related to
viruses found in Turkey and Iran (sharing nucleotide identities of
greater than 99 percent;
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/euro/bul.htm>http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/euro/bul.htm>.
Our studies have shown that the ANT-10 sub-lineage of the PanAsia-2
lineage (which was derived from the earlier PanAsia lineage) has
recently become widespread in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey."

Turkish Thrace, bordering Bulgaria, obtained, in May 2010, OIE's
status of an FMD-free zone with vaccination. This was decided
following the submission, by Turkey's delegate, of documents addressed
to OIE's Director General in November 2009 and in March 2010.

The conditions for such recognition are described in Article 8.5.5.
("FMD free zone where vaccination is practised") of OIE's Terrestrial
Code, as follows:

"To qualify for inclusion in the list of FMD free zones where
vaccination is practised, a Member should:

1. have a record of regular and prompt animal disease reporting;

2. send a declaration to the OIE that within the proposed FMD free
zone:
a. there has been no outbreak of FMD for the past 2 years;
b. no evidence of FMDV circulation has been found during the past 12
months;

3. supply documented evidence that:
a. surveillance for FMD and FMDV infection in accordance with
Articles 8.5.42. to 8.5.48. is in operation (see at
<http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.5.htm#article_1.8.5.42>;
special attention to Article 8.5.43.2.b)
b. regulatory measures for the early detection, prevention and
control of FMD have been implemented;
c. routine vaccination is carried out for the purpose of the
prevention of FMD;
d. the vaccine used complies with the standards described in the
Terrestrial Manual and is appropriate for the strains of virus
currently circulating;

4. describe in detail and supply documented evidence that these are
properly implemented and supervised:
a. the boundaries of the proposed FMD free zone,
b. the boundaries and measures of a protection zone, if applicable,
c. the system for preventing the entry of the virus (including the
control of the movement of susceptible animals) into the proposed FMD
free zone (in particular if the procedure described in Article 8.5.10.
is implemented).

"The proposed free zone will be included in the list of FMD free
zones where vaccination is practised only after the submitted evidence
has been accepted by the OIE. The information required in points 2, 3
and 4 b)-c) above should be re-submitted annually and changes in the
epidemiological situation or other significant events including those
relevant to points 3 b) and 4 should be reported to the OIE according
to the requirements in Chapter 1.1."

Readers are reminded that the investigation in Bulgaria, which
previously was included in OIE's list of countries free of FMD without
vaccination, was initially prompted by the discovery of FMD lesions on
the feet of one wild boar, out of 3 shot during the normal hunting
season in an area located at around 2km from the Bulgarian border with
the Republic of Turkey. This underlines the importance of FMD
surveillance in wildlife. It will be interesting to note if such
surveillance has been/is being carried out in Turkish Thrace, and to
obtain its detailed results. It will be also be interesting to note
if/which steps has Turkey applied to protect its free zone in Thrace,
following the outbreak in Bulgaria. - Mod.AS]
