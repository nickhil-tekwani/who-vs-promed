The Ministry of Agriculture and Land (MPPAT, according to its Spanish
initials), through the Autonomous System for Agriculture Sanitation (SASA,
according to its Spanish initials), successfully closed the 1st vaccination
cycle against foot and mouth disease (FMD), rabies, and encephalitis for
2008. A total of 770 cattle producers benefited from this activity.

According to an official bulletin, MPPAT invested money in order to
purchase biologicals, as well as for hiring personnel, paying for their
transportation, and covering other logistics expenses. These actions led to
the successful completion of the 1st vaccination campaign, which lasted 3
months and was offered free of charge.

Animals will be immune against viruses and bacteria that may affect the
health of meat consumers.

Vaccination increased
---------------------
In addition, 24 744 cattle were vaccinated (11 per cent more than in 2007).
This time coverage reached 89 per cent.

SASA-Sucre, the only entity responsible for issuing the official document
for vaccination so that farmers may mobilize their products all over the
country, reached 86 per cent of all farms, 10 per cent more than last year
[2007].

The effect of vaccination [immunity] against FMD lasts for about 6 months,
while the effect in the case of encephalitis and rabies vaccines lasts for
one year.

MPPAT indicated that the municipalities with the highest numbers of animals
immunized were Ribero (6553), Marino (4954), and Valdez (3243).

In Sucre State, the Ministry had the support from its ascribed entities:
Farming and Fishing Development Fund (FONDAFA), Socialist Institute for
Fishing and Aquaculture (INSOPESCA), and the National Land Institute
(INTI). There was also support from the following entities: National
Institute for Rural Development (INDER), Foundation for Training &
Innovative Support for Agricultural Revolution (CIARA), and National
Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA). There was additional support
from: Bolivarian Avian Association, Farmers' Association, Integrative Farm
Health Councils (COSAI), Integral Agricultural Health Brigades (BRISAI),
personnel from SASA, veterinarians, technicians from SASA-Sucre, personnel
from the Cuba-Venezuela agreement, and Integral Health Brigades from the
Ezequiel Zamora National Peasant Front (Spanish initials for all these
institutions appear in parentheses).

Soon the MPPAT, through SASA Sucre, will initiate a campaign for gathering
all animals from a certain area, in order to hasten the vaccination
process. Consequently, this initiative may have a greater impact, by
covering animals from more farms.

[It is refreshing to see a vaccination campaign covering more than one disease.

Despite the apparent success of the vaccination campaign, Venezuela has
still not reported the FMD outbreak to the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE). Reporting may take pressure from their neighboring countries
as well as international pressure. - Mod.TG
