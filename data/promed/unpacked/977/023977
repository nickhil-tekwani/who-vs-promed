2 pupils of Karichuta Primary School in Kieni East sub county [Nyeri County] have been admitted after a disease outbreak in the school. The children, one aged 5 and the other aged 13, were admitted at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital on Tue 26 May 2014. 8 other pupils were treated and discharged. The symptoms of the disease are yellow eyes, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue and stomach ache.

More than 44 pupils have been affected. Some 34 pupils were discharged after screening. School headmaster Wanjohi Muriuki said the Ministry of Health has screened the pupils but did not say exactly which disease it is. He said children do not share food in school but carry their own.

Parents have urged the government to take immediate action. One parent, said his Standard 3 daughter had the symptoms last week. He said she is yet to recover despite visiting several hospitals. Another parent said her son in Standard 6 had similar symptoms last week but was treated and discharged from Nanyuki District Hospital. Area member of the county assembly Marete Ring'iru said the disease was brought by potato sellers from Rift Valley who visited the region recently.

"The government should close down the school so that the parents can take their children for treatment," he said. Ring'iru said the outbreak has spread to neighboring villages. He urged the government to take urgent measures to control the spread. Nyeri county acting health director Dr David Ndegwa said the cases were reported at Kiamuthaga Dispensary in Kieni. He said the cases were referred to Narumoro Health Centre. "The medics at Narumoro Health Centre referred them to Nyeri PGH. We sent an ambulance to evacuate the 8 kids," Ndegwa said. Health executive Dr Charles Githenji said the county government will educate the residents on public health.

[A cluster of icteric [jaundice] disease in a school-aged population suggests hepatitis A, a primarily waterborne viral disease. In a developing world environment, cases will occur primarily in children, as the seroprevalence of the infection is close to 100 percent by age 10. Hepatitis E is also primarily enterically transmitted but can cause outbreaks in adults as well, with very significant morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, particularly. - Mod.LL
