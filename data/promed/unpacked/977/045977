Ghana's mango sector is in dire straits. It is faced with bacterial black spot (BBS) in mango crops, a serious disease that has overwhelmed many farmers. The government is doing little and the future of the national mango industry is gloomy. BBS may result in a 50% to 80% reduction in fruit production and is causing a lot of frustration.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (Xc) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ (Xcm). It was first described from Africa but is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90 percent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging. Symptoms include small, irregular, or star shaped water-soaked lesions on fruit that soon become raised; they may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers which may crack lengthwise. Leaves show water soaked lesions that may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species). Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

The bacteria live as epiphytes but occur in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. They are essentially wound pathogens but can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. BBS can be prevalent in both low and high rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

The disease is spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.

In Ghana, although BBS has been a problem in mango crops for many years (e.g. ProMED post 20150819.3587676), disease management measures appear to be sorely lacking. The pathogen was also reported as the cause of black spot on cashew in Ghana's neighbour, Burkina Faso (ProMED post 20160601.4255664).

Other pathovars of Xc cause, for example, citrus canker; other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example, banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
