[According to the details given, the 'susceptible population' involved
one sick animal which was destroyed and subsequently tested positive
for ASF, initially in a regional laboratory, confirmed by the national
reference laboratory. Detecting a single case in an animal apparently
solitary on a backyard farm is a remarkable, commendable achievement
on the part of the veterinary authorities.

The outbreak above seems to be the 1st one recorded in the Kursk
(Kurskaya) oblast, bordering Ukraine on its north-eastern border.
Previous Russian ASF outbreaks on Ukraine's borders were recorded on
the eastern borders, namely in the Rostov (Rostovskaya) oblast; see
map of all 154 outbreaks in Russia since the start of the current
epizootic, in September 2009, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462.

Major concerns over the potential for ASF spread to Ukraine and other
countries in Europe have been raised during the recent World Pork
Conference by the head of the Russian Veterinary Service (see
ProMED-mail 20111023.3163).

The lack of ASF vaccine is a prominent concern to the pig industry
worldwide. ASF is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
