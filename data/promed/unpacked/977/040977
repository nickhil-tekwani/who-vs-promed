Warning issued on ciguatera fish poisoning.

The state Department of Health is issuing a warning to avoid eating a fish
found around all of the Hawaiian islands after fish poisoning afflicted 12
people.
The department reported yesterday that the 12 have become ill in the past
two weeks with ciguatera fish poisoning after eating surgeon fish, known in
Hawaii as _kole_. The inflicted individuals consumed contaminated fish
caught off the
north shore of Kauai between Anini and Hanalei.
State officials do not know when it will be safe to eat _kole_ again.
"I recommend never eating _kole_ on the north shore of the island," said
state Health Department epidemiologist Jo Manea. She believes there are
several unreported cases in addition to the 12 documented.
The ciguatera poison cannot be detected in the fish by sight, taste or
smell. Freezing, cooking or drying the fish does not eliminate the poison.
The first symptom, which normally starts in about three to four hours after
consumption, is diarrhea. That is frequently followed by aching muscles,
nausea, weakness, sweating and dizziness. Numbness and tingling around the
mouth, hands or feet may also follow.
Health officials advise people who have experienced poisoning to avoid
eating fish or shellfish for several weeks after the symptoms disappear.
Other fish that have been linked to ciguatera poisoning in recent years are
_paio_, _ulua_ and _roi_ (grouper).
Anyone who becomes ill with ciguatera or knows someone who is sick should
report it to the Health Department. Leftover fish that is believed to be
the cause of the poisoning should be frozen and submitted to the Health
Department for testing.
