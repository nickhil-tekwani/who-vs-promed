Yellow fever in Uganda
----------------------
On 23 Dec 2010, the Minister of Health in Uganda reported 3
laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever, detected through a
special investigation following an outbreak in the country in October
2010. The cases were reported in 3 districts of Abim, Agago, and
Kitgum near the border with South Sudan.

In total, 5 cases have been laboratory confirmed for yellow fever by
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (3 by RT-PCR, 1 by
ELISA method, and 1 by histopathology). A total of 226 cases
compatible with the clinical case definition including 53 deaths have
been reported by 12 districts in northern Uganda.

Following field investigations by the Ministry of Health with the
support of WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the US, and other
partners, a decision was made to conduct a reactive mass vaccination
campaign in 5 districts (Abim, Agago, Kitgum, Lamwo, and Pader). On
31 Dec 2010, WHO deployed 3 additional experts to support risk
assessment, and planning and implementation of control measures,
which include strengthening of the surveillance system and the
vaccination campaign.

A request for one million doses of vaccine was submitted to the
International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision
(YF-ICG) on 4 Jan 2011 and the vaccine from the GAVI [Global Alliance
for Vaccines and Immunisation] funded emergency stockpile was shipped
to the country on 11 Jan 2011. The vaccination campaign will start on
22 Jan 2011, targeting a population of over 905 000 people.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Interestingly, previous reports indicated deaths in 10 districts but
the report above indicates that there were fatalities in 12
districts. Apparently, only a small fraction of the cases are
laboratory confirmed. This is not surprising, given that these
districts are fairly remote with limited health care capability.
There is no indication in this or the most recent previous report
(see ProMED-mail 20110118.0214) of whether there is evidence of
ongoing yellow fever virus transmission.
