Nearly 400 cattle die of foot & mouth disease in Zanzibar so far in 2004
---------------------------------------------------
Over 388 out of 900 cattle that contracted foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) and anthrax have died so far in Zanzibar since the outbreak of
the diseases in January 2004, local newspaper Sunday News reported.
Director of Livestock Development in the Ministry of Agriculture
Kassim Gharib was quoted as saying on Saturday that all 3 regions in
Zanzibar were affected by the outbreak of these diseases.
Gharib said that local government has issued a quarantine to forbid
transfer of livestock in Zanzibar to discourage further spread of the
killer diseases. He also said that the numbers of cases decreased
after major treatment campaigns and imposition of quarantine.
Zanzibar, an Indian Ocean archipelago, joined Tanganyika in April
1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania.

[Zanzibar is an archipelago made up of Zanzibar and Pemba Islands and
several islets. Zanzibar (known locally as Unguja) is an island state
within the United Republic of Tanzania. It is located in the Indian
Ocean, about 25 miles from the Tanzanian coast.
The news item relates to 2 distinct diseases, anthrax and FMD, both
regarded as endemic in Tanzania. The unusually high (45 percent)
mortality rates attributed in the title of the article to FMD might
reflect the reported involvement of anthrax.
Tanzania reported to the OIE 49 FMD outbreaks during 2003, caused by
3 FMDV serotypes -- O, SAT1 & SAT2. None of them was reported from
Zanzibar. For monthly data, figures and locations see
