CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE, INCREASED VIRULENCE - AUSTRALIA: (NEW SOUTH WALES)

New testing has found the 1st New South Wales cases of a super bug
that has killed thousands of patients in European and North American hospitals.

New South Wales Health says 21 patients tested positive to a virulent
strain of _Clostridium difficile_, not detected in Australia until
earlier this year [2010] in Melbourne.

Some of the symptoms include mild to severe diarrhoea, fever, and
stomach pains.

Professor Lyn Gilbert, chair of the New South Wales expert advisory
group on health care associated infections, says New South Wales
Health are now testing regularly for the bug.

"Some cases have been identified almost by chance in northern Sydney
that have occurred over the last couple of years in several different
hospitals in northern Sydney," she said. "None of them as far as we
can tell have particularly severe disease, contrary to what happened
in the northern hemisphere where it often was more severe than usual."

[_Clostridium difficile_ -associated disease (CDAD) is a spectrum of
potentially fatal illnesses that includes diarrhea, pseudomembranous
colitis, and toxic megacolon. Although most CDAD is acquired by
exposure to the organism within a health care facility,
community-acquired CDAD is well recognized
(<http://www.njmonline.nl/njm/getpdf.php?t=a&id=10000317>).
Predispositions reported for community-acquired CDAD include
antibiotic usage and use of medication that suppresses gastric acid
production (Dial S, et al: Use of gastric acid-suppressive agents and
the risk of community-acquired _Clostridium difficile_-associated
disease. JAMA 2005; 294(23): 2989-95; available at
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/23/2989.long>).
The news release above is presumably referring to the hypervirulent
strain of _Clostridium difficile_ called North American pulsed-field
gel type 1 (NAP1) or polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027,
which has caused outbreaks of colitis with increased severity, high
relapse rate, and significant mortality in North America, Japan, and
Europe (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266326/>
and
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=714>),
although some studies have found no evidence of increased clinical
severity attributable to ribotype 027 (see
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0001812>).

This strain, also referred to as the "Quebec strain" (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/infDis/Cdiff_ICHE08_05.pdf>), was
said to be the pathogen in reports of Australian cases in Perth and
Melbourne posted by ProMED-mail last year (Clostridium difficile,
increased virulence - Australia (02): (WA) 20100529.1790 and
Clostridium difficile, increased virulence - Australia: (VI)
20100526.1752). For a detailed discussion of _C. difficile_
infection, please see a prior ProMED-mail post Clostridium difficile,
ribotype 027 - UK: (N. Ireland) 20080207.0498.

Sydney is the largest and most populous city in Australia, with an
approximate population of 4.5 million in the Sydney metropolitan area
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney>). It is the state capital of
New South Wales.
