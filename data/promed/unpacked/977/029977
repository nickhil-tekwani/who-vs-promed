The number of victims in a recent tri-state cluster of _E. coli_ illnesses
has risen to 29, the Ohio Department of Health reported Thursday. Since the
cluster was revealed last week, the number of cases has steadily climbed
from 20 to 22 on Friday to 27 on Wednesday and now to 29. The two newest
cases involved Hamilton County residents. The most recent one was diagnosed
August 7, one day after the previous most recent case.
DNA analyses from 20 of the cases have found that 11 involve bacteria with
the same DNA pattern, a finding that implies but does not necessarily prove
that the illnesses were triggered by a single common source. For the past
several days, a team from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has been investigating the local cluster. The CDC group might
release more information today about the most likely causes of the illness,
said Clermont County Health Commissioner Janet Rickabaugh.
