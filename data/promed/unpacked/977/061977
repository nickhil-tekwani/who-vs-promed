A case of African swine fever has been detected in a wild boar in Italy, news agency ANSA said on [Fri 7 Jan 2022], raising fears of a blow to the country's meat industry.

Highly transmissible and fatal for pig populations, African swine fever (ASF) does not present a risk for human health, but risks serious repercussions for pork producers.

Italy, with about 8.9 million pigs, is the 7th biggest pork producer in the European Union, representing an 8 billion euro ($9.1 billion) industry, according to the agricultural association Confagricoltura.

ANSA said the case of the viral disease was detected after tests on the carcass of a wild boar in Ovada in the northern Piedmont region.

African swine fever has existed in Africa for decades. In Italy, it has been endemic on the island of Sardinia since 1st appearing in 1978.

The disease spread to China -- the world's largest pork producer -- in 2018, causing millions of pigs to be slaughtered to prevent an epidemic.

In western Europe, the virus was reported in Belgium in 2018, prompting China to ban all imports of Belgian pork.

After Germany confirmed its 1st case in a dead wild boar in 2020, China, Japan and South Korea, alongside Brazil and Argentina, also suspended German pork imports.

ANSA said the case in Italy had been referred to Italy's health ministry, which in turn would notify the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) and the European Commission.

In a [3 Dec 2021] situation report on the virus, the OIE said African swine fever has been reported in 32 countries in 5 different world regions since January 2020. It has affected more than 1 million pigs and more than 28 000 wild boar around the world.

"The events observed in the last 6 months confirm the global threat of ASF, which continues to spread with serious impacts on pig production systems, animal health and welfare, as well as the socio-economic impacts on livelihoods, national food security and international trade," the report said.

After Germany's first case, Confagricoltura said Italy had activated a plan of surveillance and prevention approved by the European Commission since the beginning of 2020.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodoros_. ASF is believed to have evolved in asylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
