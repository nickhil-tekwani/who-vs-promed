_E. coli_ sickens 4,000 in Illinois
A form of the _E. coli_ bacterium lurking in a popular caterer's potato
salad caused more than 4,000 people to fall ill, health officials said. The
Illinois case was the largest documented outbreak in the United States of
the strain called enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_, or ETEC, Cook County
Health Department officials said Monday. The bacterium was identified in
stool samples from three victims of the illness known as "traveler's
diarrhea," said Stephanie Smith, the department's director of communicable
disease.
More than 4,000 people became ill after eating potato salad prepared by
Iwan's Deli and Catering for several hundred parties in the Chicago area
over the weekend of June 6. Officials from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention were conducting tests to isolate the bacteria in the
food or water at the catering company in suburban Orland Park. Although
ETEC is common in developing countries, the CDC in Atlanta has tracked just
14 ETEC outbreaks in the U.S. in the last 23 years, Smith said.

[ETEC can be distinguished from the EHEC (hemorrhagic) strain isolated from
the Georgia water park outbreak (see ProMED-mail posting cited above)
insofar as the latter carries a plasmid coding for additional virulence
factor(s) that render the organism more likely to cause serious
complications and death. - Mod.ES
