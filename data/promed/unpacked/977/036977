Despite precautionary and surveillance measures by the Department of Health and Family Welfare in the district [Shivamogga] against Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, there is no sign of the outbreak subsiding in Malnad [Malenadu] region and it is extending its reach to new areas here.

Chandraraju KS, a member of the Aralagodu Gram Panchayat [village council], epicentre of this season's outbreak, told The Hindu that, on an average, 4 new positive cases are reported at the primary health centre in his village every week.

What is of particular concern is that some who have received the primary and the booster doses of the vaccine have also succumbed to the disease.

According to the schedule by the department, administering the 3rd dose in affected areas is likely to commence from August [2019].

Since December 2018, 15 persons have lost their lives owing to KFD in the district and out of that 9 deaths were reported since [1 Mar 2019]. A total number of 306 persons have been tested positive for KFD in the district this season of which 11 persons are still being treated at private hospitals in Udupi district as in-patients.

The department has vaccinated 1.4 lakh [140 000] persons in the district against the disease this season so far. In Aralagodu [2 persons]] (who had died due to KFD in March 2019) and [another] (who passed away on 1 May 2019) were administered primary as well as booster doses of the vaccine.

Kiran SK, Deputy Director of Viral Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), an important arm of the department in tackling KFD, told The Hindu that the primary dose of the vaccine will offer 35 per cent immunity against the disease and the booster dose 65 per cent.

The immunity level in a vaccinated person would be enhanced to 87 percent after the third dose.

The chances of getting infected with KFD virus will be less after the 3rd dose, he said.

The infection has continued to extend its reach. In April [2019], positive cases have been reported from Shettyhalli village, 8 kilometres [5 mi] from Shivamogga city, and from Kargal town in Sagar taluk.

The infection has been reported from the 1st time in Shettyhalli and Kargal. Mr Kiran said that the pace at which the disease is spreading this season can be attributed to the high density of ticks in the forest and the high viral load in the ticks.

"Earlier, we used to collect 8 to 10 ticks by conducting flagging operation at the spot where a monkey had died due to KFD. This year [2019], we are collecting 100 to 120 ticks through flagging. It is apparent that the number of ticks in the forest that causes KFD have increased," he said.

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told The Hindu that with the commencement of summer, vigilance has been stepped up in the affected areas as the ticks will be active during this period. During summer, people in Malnad enter the forest to collect minor forest produce and dry leaves.

They have now been directed to avoid entering the forest. Residents of the affected areas have been directed to apply dimethyl phthalate (DMP), a tick repellent, on their body before venturing to their agricultural land on the forest fringe.

[According to the report above, 306 KFD positive cases have been reported this year (2019) in Karnataka state, with 15 deaths (CFR: 4.9 percent).

The strategy for administration of a 3rd booster dose of KFD vaccine in the susceptible population is important to check disease transmission and reduce the associated morbidity/mortality. - Mod.UBA
