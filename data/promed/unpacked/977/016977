A year after its 1st outbreak [ProMED-mail post 20160411.4150953], wheat blast has reemerged [in Meherpur district, Khulna Division]. This time quite early in the season, causing fears of production loss of the country's 2nd most important cereal. Agricultural University (BSMRAU), applying a molecular diagnostic tool, have confirmed that blast resurfaced.

Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) said blast attacked in mid-February last year [2016] but this season, "we're getting symptoms as early as mid-January [2017]." Farmers have been advised to burn affected [crops] and spray fungicide for the protection of unaffected wheat. The authorities have already ordered burning of grain at flowering stage in 5 hectares of wheat fields.

CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre] fears that, "A wider outbreak in South Asia could be devastating to [the] region."

[Both wheat and rice blast are caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice. Over 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related fungal strains, each of which generally appear to affect only a limited number of host species. Further work is needed regarding genotypic differentiation related to host range, including differences between the wheat and rice pathovars. Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. Wheat blast is now considered an emerging disease and a threat to global food security.

Blast symptoms on wheat (and barley) may be confused with fusarium head blight (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and link below) and include bleaching of ears, shriveled kernels and no seed production at all for severe infections. Yield losses seem to average 40 to 50 per cent, but cases of 100 per cent losses have also been reported, and wheat production in some affected areas has ceased.

Humid and warm conditions favour disease development, but the life cycle of the fungus is still unknown. Spread of the rice pathogen occurs with infected plant material (including seed), mechanical means (including human and insect activity), water and wind. It is likely that the wheat pathogen is spread in similar ways. Disease management of rice blast may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Available wheat cultivars lack resistance to wheat blast, and only limited tolerance can be found. Resistance breeding is difficult because the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Initially, wheat blast was thought to be caused by a fungal strain which crossed from rice to wheat, but it has now been shown to likely originate from local wild grasses. Furthermore, wheat blast strains in Bangladesh were found to be highly similar to strains from Brazil (ProMED-mail post 20160502.4196134 and see link below), which suggests an introduction of the fungus to Bangladesh with grain from that region. Consequently, other countries which have imported Brazilian wheat must be considered to be equally at risk of an incursion.
