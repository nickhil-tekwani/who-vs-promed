A deadly plague is thought to have wiped out hundreds of crayfish in
a river system.

All the creatures killed so far have been from an invasive species --
the Turkish crayfish [_Astacus leptodactylus_; see picture at
<http://forum.garten-pur.de/attachments/10050009_eAstacus_leptodactylus.JPG>]
-- but there are fears the disease could spread to the native
white-clawed crayfish [_Austropotamobius pallipes_,
<http://ecoevol.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/gif/App-2.gif>].

The dead crayfish were found by a ranger in the lower River Colne in
Colchester, Essex and samples have now been sent for analysis to the
Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) in Weymouth.

The crustaceans are thought to have been killed by the
highly-virulent fungal disease _Aphanomyces astaci_, commonly known
as crayfish plague. A similar outbreak on the River Waveney in nearby
Suffolk last October [2007] killed thousands of crayfish.

The risk of the disease spreading piles further pressure on the
native crayfish which has already been driven to local extinction on
many of the waterways in southern England by the relentless advance
of another invasive species, the American signal crayfish
[_Pacifastacus leniusculus_,
<http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/fish/246986/342184/1205879/?lang=_e>].

Larger than the native crayfish, [the American signal crayfish] was
introduced to be farmed for the restaurant trade but many escaped and
quickly became established in rivers and lakes. The voracious signal
eats almost anything in its path including plants, snails, and fish
and has quickly displaced the native crayfish. It also carries a
variation of the plague which is harmless to it, but which is fatal
to its English cousin.

The Turkish crayfish was also brought into the UK as a food source
but has not spread as quickly as the signal.

The population in the Colchester area has not been big enough to
cause problems and the loss of significant numbers to the plague may
even help native river wildlife.

"It is usually found at the bottom of the river and tends only to
appear when other species of crayfish have moved on," said
Environment Agency Fisheries, Recreation and Biodiversity officer
Julia Stansfield.

"Although only Turkish crayfish have been affected so far we think it
will be only a matter of time before it spreads to the native species
and that would be a disaster. There are no native crayfish left in
the Colne but there are still some remnants in the River Stour and
the River Chelmer."

The Environment Agency is asking anglers and other river users to be
aware of the dangers of spreading the disease and is urging them to
clean and disinfect equipment such as keep-nets.

Ironically it may be people who are trapping bigger invasive crayfish
for food -- at the same time helping cut numbers in the river -- who
are spreading the disease.

Julia Stansfield explained: "One possible route for the spread of
this disease is use of unlicenced crayfish traps. The idea of this
'wild food' is much in vogue.

"While this is safe to do in parts of the country where native
crayfish have already been wiped out, in the east of England we are
trying to protect one of the last strongholds.

'If members of the public notice dead crayfish in any other rivers,
please let the Environment Agency know as soon as possible.'

[Crayfish plague is considered to be infection of crayfish with
_Aphanomyces astaci_, which is a member of a group of organisms
commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded to be
fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are not members of the Eumycota
and are now classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called
the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

There is evidence that established older _A. astaci_ strains that
have been present in Europe for many years are less aggressive than
are newer strains introduced with crayfish imports from North America
since the 1960s. Some isolates from warmer waters in Spain have
temperature/growth curves with higher optimum temperatures compared
with those from northern Europe.

_A. astaci_, both in culture and in infected crayfish, is killed by a
short exposure to temperatures of 60 deg C (140 deg F) or to
temperatures of -20 deg C (-4 deg F) or less for 48 hours or more.
Sodium hypochlorite and iodophores are effective for disinfection of
contaminated equipment. Thorough drying of equipment (more than 24
hours) is also effective as _Aphanomyces_ is not resistant to desiccation.

The life cycle is simple with vegetative hyphae invading and
ramifying through host tissues, eventually producing extramatrical
sporangia that release amoeboid primary spores, each of which then
germinates as a biflagellate zoospore. Biflagellate zoospores swim in
the water column and, on encountering a susceptible host, attach and
germinate to produce invasive vegetative hyphae. Zoospores are
capable of repeated encystment and re-emergence, extending the period
of their infective viability.

There is good field and experimental evidence that movements of fish
from areas in which crayfish plague is active can transmit infection
from one watershed to another . _A. astaci_ can also be spread by
contaminated equipment (nets, boots, clothing, etc).

The information above is derived from chapter 2.3.7. "Crayfish Plague
(_Aphanomyces astaci_)" in OIE's (World Organisation for Animal
Health) Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic animals. The chapter
includes additional comprehensive information on the agent factors,
host factors, disease pattern, diagnosis, control and prevention,
