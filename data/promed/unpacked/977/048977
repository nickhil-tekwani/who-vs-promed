[Although the report below provides no new information beyond that reported by the ProMED-mail post of 12 Dec 2013 (archive no. 20131211.2110302), it does provide a broader context for the occurrence and spread of chikungunya virus outbreaks around the world and underscores the risk of this virus becoming established and spreading in the Americas in those areas where dengue viruses are endemic. - Mod.TY]

Today's [12 Dec 2013] map comes via the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shows where the mosquitoborne [virus] illness chikungunya is located in the world [see the URL above for the map].

As of this week, however, this map is out of date. For the 1st time in recorded history, there have been locally transmitted cases of chikungunya [virus infections] in the Americas. On Monday [9 Dec 2013], the World Health Organization issued an alert that there are 2 confirmed, 4 probable, and 20 suspected cases of chikungunya [virus infections] on the Caribbean island of St Martin. This is a 1st. And it means that chikungunya could become the next West Nile virus or dengue fever [viruses] to sweep across the region. [The potential geographic distribution of chikungunya virus vectors is more restricted in North America than that of the vectors of West Nile virus. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya [virus infection] is rarely fatal. Like dengue and West Nile [viruses], it is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes [but the mosquitoes that transmit dengue and West Nile viruses are different. - Mod.TY] and very easily so. People suffering from the disease develop a fever, headache, and have intense pain in their joints, which can last many weeks. The name, chikungunya, is from the Makonde language roughly meaning "that which bends up", reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease, says WHO. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease.

There have been sporadic outbreaks since the disease was identified, but the pace and scope of these outbreaks have increased in recent years. In 2004, an outbreak in coastal Kenya spread quickly to Comoros, La Reunion, and throughout islands in the Indian Ocean, sickening 500 000. By 2006, it hit India, where 1.7 million more people were infected through 2010.

The Pan American Health Organization (a division of WHO) and the [USA] CDC have been warning that conditions are ripe for a chikungunya virus outbreak in the Americas. The same mosquitoes that carry the virus are present throughout the Americas, stretching from Argentina to upstate New York. (And that geographic imprint will expand as temperatures increase due to climate change). It was only a matter of time until the disease made its way to this side of the world. The big task now for WHO, CDC, and PAHO is to track and isolate the virus.

A 2011 report from PAHO and CDC offered recommendations and guidelines for the epidemiological surveillance of chikungunya [virus], making the case that tools currently used to track and mitigate dengue fever should be harnessed to include chikungunya surveillance. The same mosquitoes can carry both viruses. This comparison should shock national health authorities into action. Latin America is in the midst of an unprecedented dengue epidemic, which is hitting urban areas particularly hard.

This is year zero of chikungunya [virus transmission] in the Americas. The extent to which this virus can be contained depends on the capacity of national health authorities to meet this threat head on. Unless these warnings are heeded, chikungunya [cases] could be as common as dengue [virus infections].

[Although the tone of the above report is somewhat alarmist, the concern about the consequences of introduction of chikungunya virus into the Americas, where dengue virus transmission is endemic, is real. A PAHO/WHO summary report of 9 Dec 2013 (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=23806+&Itemid=999999&lang=en) mentions that in the Americas where dengue virus is transmitted, imported cases have previously been registered in Brazil, French Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and the USA. Clearly, the virus has been arriving in the Americas with some frequency, but the outbreak in St Martin is the 1st recognized instance of ongoing transmission of this virus.

One hopes that the proactive steps for surveillance and vector control on St Martin, along with health authorities on the Dutch side of the island (St Maarten) will prevent further transmission of the virus and reduce the risk of its spread to other localities in the Americas. ProMED-mail thanks Roland Hubner for sending in this report.
