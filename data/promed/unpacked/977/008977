BSE: Spain, first cases in Andalucia (edited)
--------------------------------------------
The Laboratory of Animal Health in Cordoba detected the first 2 cases of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Andalucia, southern Spain. The
animals, aged 5 and 11 years, were from 2 different farms. They were
slaughtered because they tested positive for tuberculosis; no clinical
signs of BSE were detected. [All movement of their herds, a total of 305
animals, has been restricted. So far 5788 animals have been tested under
the regional surveillance programme and 11.407 tonnes of concentrates of
animal origin have been given to the authorities by the food industry.
A total of 45 cases of BSE have been reported throughout Spain since
November 2000; 34 of them in the north west of the country. Galicia, with
common borders and a long tradition of commerce with Portugal (country that
shares with Ireland the second highest national case tally), registers 21
cases. The neighboring regions Castilla-Leon and Asturias follow with 9 and
4 cases [respectively. The disease has also been detected in Navarra (5),
Pais Vasco (1), Catalunya (2), Baleares (2), and Castilla-La Mancha (1).
The breeds affected are varied: Holstein-Fresian (26), mixed (12) Parda
Alpina (2), Pirenaica (2), Rubia Gallega (1), Limousine (1), and Fleckvich (1).

Danish authorities should have investigated possible BSE cases in 1995 - claim
--------------------------------------------------
The Danish authorities have been criticised for doing nothing to protect
the public despite the fact that BSE was probably in Denmark in 1995. Irish
authorities found a Danish-born cow with BSE in 1995, according to
Politiken, a Danish newspaper.
As the cow had only been in Ireland for 26 weeks, it appears likely that it
was infected in Denmark, experts say. According to the newspaper, the
Danish authorities did not investigate where the farm the cow originated
from got the fodder and if there were any more infected animals in the
country. Proof of the existence of BSE in Denmark would have been likely to
have had a great impact on the export of Danish beef.

Slaughter method raises BSE fear
--------------------------------
The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency is investigating the way
millions of cattle and sheep are slaughtered, amid suspicions that it
affects the risk of humans catching BSE. The agency has commissioned
research into the possible danger that infective parts of the brain and
central nervous system are dispersed via the bloodstream into tissues used
in food. This may take 3 years. Studies by vets at Bristol University and
elsewhere have shown that conventional methods of killing, using bolts
fired into the skulls of animals, scatter nervous tissue into the blood. In
cattle, these have been found in lungs, and in sheep in jugular veins.
The next stage of research will help tell whether existing controls on
removing potentially infective brain and offal from cattle go far enough.
Sheep have been infected experimentally in laboratories, and it appears
that the disease is able to affect far more organs and tissues than in
cattle. This is forcing the government to draw up contingency plans,
including mass culls, in case BSE is found in flocks. Separate research by
the government's veterinary agency has also suggested that sheep spleens
can show signs of BSE infectivity in animals 10 months old, well before
clinical signs are evident. In addition, the disease under the microscope
looks indistinguishable from scrapie, a condition that seems to have no
health impact for humans. Most cattle are killed by bolts, but there are
other options. Although most sheep are slaughtered after being stunned
electrically, as many as one in 6 still may be killed by bolts.
Dr Haluk Anil, from Bristol, said: "The work does not go far enough. We
need to see whether this material might end up in the edible parts". His
team's latest work on sheep suggests that infected material could pass
through the lungs and heart into the vessels that supply blood to the
edible parts of carcasses. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said
the research would take 2 to 3 years to complete. The practice of pithing -
thrusting a rod through the hole in the cattle's skull made by the stunning
bolt - has already been banned by the EC because of fears it might help
spread contaminated material. It was widely used in the UK to stop animals
kicking out and endangering abattoir workers.

[The original work was done in 1996 and published in the 14 Sep 1996 issue
of the Lancet as a letter, complete with color photos. The researchers were
from Texas A&M University, with Tam Garland as senior author. Data from
Texas A&M has found as much as 14.5 CM of neurological tissue in the lungs
and their unpublished data has found 16.7 CM in the liver. Haluk is right
when he says it does not go far enough, because if we can find chunks this
big, what is happening to the microscopic pieces. If workers at College
Station and Bristol are correct -- and there is no reason to doubt them --
the past UK exposure to BSE prion contamination is likely to have been
extensive. - Mod.MHJ
