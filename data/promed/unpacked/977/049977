On 22 Apr 2000 the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan
announced the control measures of (Foot and Mouth Disease) FMD have been
changed. The serological survey has been conducted in movement control area
and surveillance area (a radius of 20 km and 20-50km from the first
outbreak, respectively.).
The sera have been collected from epidemiologically related farms
nationwide. The collected sera are 43 628 and have been screened, 33 240 of
the sera by ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) until 20 Apr 2000.
The Government concluded there is no evidence of airborne infection of the
prevailed FMD virus and declared both the 20km movement control and 20-50km
surveillance area has been lifted and the new movement control area has
been established in a radius of 10km where a confirmed and a suspected
outbreak occurred on 3 April and 9 April, respectively. The radius of 10km
is harmonized with standards of the control measures of the Office
International des Epizooties(OIE).
As results of serological survey there are 25 farms in which the decision
of the existence of the antibody to FMD virus was difficult. I do not know
the location of the farms. These farms are being controlled under
Prefectural Veterinary Inspectors according to the Paragraph 3, Article 14
of the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Laws. In the farms, the
premises are disinfected, the animals are isolated, the sera are
recollected for the confirmation of the antibody to FMD virus, and the
probang samples are also collected for virus isolation.

The representatives of the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science
including Professors Kunio Doi, Eiji Takahashi, Yasuhiro Yoshikawa (the
University of Tokyo), Professors Ikuo Takashima, Misao Onuma (Hokkaido
University), and Professor Katsuya Hirai (Gifu University) authorize these
inspection programs.
