Measles outbreak in the Ukraine 2005-2006: request for information and
specimens
---------------------------------------------------
The WHO European Regional Office in Copenhagen has received reports of over
19 000 cases of measles being associated with the current outbreak, which
began in 2005. Over 17 000 of these cases have been reported during the
first 2 months of 2006. While 38 per cent of the cases have been reported
from Kiev City and Kiev Oblast, all administrative areas of the country are
reporting cases. Based on limited information, 84 per cent of the cases are
in persons 15 years of age and older, 16 per cent are persons 30 years of
age and over; 7 per cent are less than 5 years old.
We are aware of cases having been imported into Belarus, the Russian
Federation, and the United States of America. A measles virus of D6
genotype has been identified both from cases in the Ukraine and from the
cases imported into the previously mentioned countries.
The WHO European Regional Office is interested in being notified of other
cases in other countries that may be linked to this outbreak. The European
Region's Measles/Rubella Laboratory Network would also like to receive
specimens for virus detection/isolation or viral genetic sequence data on
cases linked to this outbreak. This information can be communicated to Dr.
Mick Mulders at <mmu@euro.who.int>.
