[1] Laurel wilt, avocado - Florida

New disease may cost Florida's avocado industry millions
--------------------------------------------------------
Florida's avocado industry could lose millions of dollars if a new
disease reaches the state's southern tip, according to University of
Florida [UF] experts. Laurel wilt disease [LW], caused by a fungus
transmitted by the invasive redbay ambrosia beetle [RAB], kills
avocado and several native trees including redbay, said Jonathan Crane, UF.

UF researchers are scrambling to develop damage estimates and
management strategies. They have evaluated about 30 percent of the 28
avocado varieties grown in Florida; all have been susceptible to the
disease, though not all have died, said Jorge Pena, an entomologist
at UF. For controlling the fungus or the beetle, researchers are
testing pesticides and repellents, Pena said.

Some redbay trees may be resistant to the disease, said UF forest
pathologist Jason Smith. Researchers will investigate factors
associated with resistance, in the hope that tolerant varieties can
be identified.

The disease was unknown until 2004. The beetle, first found in the US
in 2002, is native to Asia and may have arrived in wood products.
Laurel wilt is in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. "The disease
is moving fairly rapidly, so it will arrive in Miami sooner or
later," said Randy Ploetz, a UF plant pathologist.

LW apparently spreads at least 2 ways, Crane said. One is via the
beetle, which expands its range 20 or 30 miles [32-48 km] per year.
Also, because the disease has leapfrogged around the state,
researchers believe beetle-infested firewood has been sold, he said.

LW symptoms include wilted stems and leaves, black streaking in the
wood, and strings of compacted sawdust protruding from tree trunks.
Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services [DOACS] are monitoring
several counties for RAB, said DPI [DOACS Division of Plant Industry].

There's more at stake than the avocado industry. LW has killed 99
percent of infected redbay trees in many areas, said Smith. Other
species are also at risk. Smith developed a test that identifies
diseased trees in less than an hour, even if the fungus is present in
small amounts. The test will be available to diagnostic labs.

[2] Thousand cankers disease, walnut - Idaho

Deadly walnut disease hits Treasure Valley
------------------------------------------
A disease called "thousand cankers" has been detected in walnut trees
in Boise, according to Debbie Cook, community forestry arborist.

The disease is a circulation-blocking fungus spread by walnut twig
beetles native to the American Southwest. No effective cure has been
found. This disease can kill a mature tree in a year or less. It has
wiped out walnut trees on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.
It mainly affects black walnut trees, but English walnut trees also
are vulnerable.

Symptoms of the disease are yellowing, wilting, and browning of
foliage, as if the tree were drought-stressed. These symptoms usually
show up first at the top of the tree and progress downward rapidly.
Leaves that turn brown often remain attached to the twig or branch
after it dies. Trees that showed symptoms in fall may leaf out in
spring, then quickly exhibit symptoms of the fungus infection and
die, or they may not leaf out at all.

The beetles could have spread northward naturally, or they may have
been transported in firewood. Avoiding damaging the bark will help
maintain tree health. Some experts say pesticides applied
systemically can help by killing the beetles, but it must be applied
before the tree is infected.

[3] Septoria leaf spot, pistachio - New Mexico

NMSU finds first-ever leaf spot in New Mexico pistachios
--------------------------------------------------------
Scientists at New Mexico State University [NMSU] have identified
septoria leaf spot, a fungal disease, in Otero, Hidalgo, Luna, and
Dona Ana counties' pistachio trees. The disease is common in other
states where pistachios are grown but has never before been
documented in New Mexico. NMSU will hold a workshop about minimizing
its effects.

The septoria fungus creates small, brown lesions on the leaves. If
enough lesions are present, the tree will have difficulty
photosynthesizing. The fungus does not directly affect the fruit, but
can have a negative effect on yield. Each of the 20 southern New
Mexico pistachio orchards tested by NMSU has been positive for
septoria. Natalie Goldberg, NMSU plant pathologist, believes the
fungus has been present in the state for years.

"It's of concern," said Richard Heerema, an NMSU extension
specialist. "The fungal disease is very much weather driven. With our
dry climate we typically don't see these sorts of things." He said
the fungus thrives in wet weather. He believes a string of wet
summers have increased its severity in the region, perhaps explaining
why it had gone undetected.

"Because of the level of infection, we need to pay attention to it,"
Goldberg said. "There are some low-risk fungicides available, but
that's an added input for growers." She said a relatively dry growing
season could significantly reduce the amount of septoria.

"One of the most important aspects is good sanitation, such as raking
and destroying fallen leaves," said Elizabeth Gordon, Otero County
extension agent. "Those leaves contain the fungus and will produce
spores that will re-infect the new leaves." She said many growers
incorporate old leaves into the soil, which ordinarily is a good
practice but not with septoria present.

If [infected] trees are left untreated, they become weakened and more
susceptible to other diseases and could eventually die. This strain
of septoria is pistachio-specific and will not affect other types of
trees. Previously, septoria has been found in Texas and Arizona.

[Laurel wilt (LW) is a vascular disease affecting species in the
family _Lauraceae_. It is caused by a new fungus, _Raffaelea
lauricola_, described in 2008. LW is spread by the redbay ambrosia
beetle (_Xyleborus glabratus_), which is native to India, Japan,
Myanmar, and Taiwan. Since 2003, LW has caused widespread mortality
of redbay (_Persea borbonia_) in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida
and has recently also been found on avocado (_Persea americana_).

Thousand cankers is considered a disease complex involving fungal
species of genus _Geosmithia_ and possibly also _Fusarium_. It is
spread by the walnut twig beetle (_Pityophthorus juglandis_) with
subsequent canker development around beetle galleries. This beetle is
native to North America and belongs to the same family
(_Curculionidae_, snout and bark beetles) as the LW vector. This
insect-fungus association is considered to represent a new and
significant threat to walnut species (genus _Juglans_).

Septoria leaf spot on pistachio can be caused by _Mycosphaerella_
(synonym _Septoria_) _pistacina_, _Mycosphaerella_ (synonym
_Septoria_) _pistaciarum_, or _Septoria pistaciae_. These fungi
affect only species in the genus _Pistacia_. _S. pistaciae_ has been
reported to be associated with leaf spot in California, and _M.
pistaciarum_ in Arizona, but item 3 above does not state which
species has been found in New Mexico.
