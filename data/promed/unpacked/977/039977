Definition of an epidemic
-------------------------
Stedman's (medical dictionary) defines an epidemic as (1) "Disease attacking
many people in a community simultaneously; distinguished from endemic since
the disease is not continuously present but has been introduced from
outside". Or (2) "The extensive prevalence of a disease brought from
without, or a temporary increase in number of cases of an endemic disease".
As I recall from basic epidemiology, we were taught it was an "unusual
cluster" of cases - fitting either "brought from without" or "increase in
number of cases of an endemic disease". Both the 1999 New York and the
current Israeli situations fit these definitions. As usual, release of
information to the public is more often geared toward concerns of reducing
panic than any correct usage of medical terminology.

["Much of the terminology used in epidemiology has a temporal component.
The terms 'epidemic', 'endemic' and 'sporadic' do not have any statistical
definitions but simply mean, respectively, occurrence of an infection at
higher than expected frequency, at the expected frequency, or only rarely and
in seemingly unconnected fashion" (A.S. Monto, in Topley and Wilson, 9th
edition, vol.1, p. 239). - Mod.CP
