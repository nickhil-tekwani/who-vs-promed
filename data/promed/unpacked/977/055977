The director of the Morropon-Chulucanas Health Network, Anibal Calle Chumacero, said that the 1st 18 cases of anthrax (or carbuncle) have been reported in the area of La Encantada, in the Piura province of Morropon.

The victims acquired the illness by consuming or working with infected beef. Some patients have been admitted to the hospital at Chulucanas, while others are being treated locally. "We have intervened in the optimum manner to control this illness. The majority of patients have already been discharged, and 3 are hospitalized and receiving treatment," according to Dr. Anibal Calle. The doctor urged other institutions such as the National Service of Agrarian Health and the Provincial Municipality Morropon Chulucanas to join this work.

The departments of Epidemiology and Public Health of the Health Network perform daily searches for more cases. "There have been 3 cows slaughtered, and their meat was spread in various areas of the metropolitan area. The number of patients is going to increase," explained the epidemiologist Iasbel Sandoval Ordinola.

She recommended that local ranch owners not slaughter their animals right away without an evaluation from the National Service of Agrarian Health.

The symptoms of this illness are difficulty breathing, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the bacteria are contracted through an open wound, they produce a hardening of the area, then a blister appears, which transforms into withered, sunken skin.

Peruvian health authorities have confirmed 32 human anthrax cases in the northwestern city of Piura, the region's health director said on Monday [21 Sep 2015].

Jesus Juarez said 49 human cases of anthrax have been reported in the city, 972 km north of the capital Lima. The verified ones [the 32 presumably] have shown typical symptoms of anthrax.

The authorities also confirmed that 90 percent of the anthrax cases had physical contract with infected livestock.

Local health workers have been sent to identify potential cases among residents. They were taking tests on the samples from suspected ones.

The Piura region has also seen the deaths of 6 animals from anthrax over the past month, which alarmed local residents. The Peruvian government has been monitoring all cases to take preventive measures to stop the spread of anthrax.

Anthrax has made periodic appearances in the state of Piura. The regional health authorities issued an epidemic alert in 2008.

[The last anthrax outbreaks in Piura were in 2004, 2005, and 2008. Interestingly the 2008 outbreak in cattle was identified as a result of human cases, and the actual number of cattle affected was obscure.

In this instance, there is an initial report of 3 cows slaughtered, which would give a cow-to-human case ratio of 1:10 -- not unexpected-- and an indication that the human cases were primarily cutaneous. The 2nd report has a total of 6 animals affected in the past month. I think we can expect that the retroactive case search by the local public health service may well identify more cases, although they may be healed. On the other hand, if we presume the 2 reports are accurate -- a presumption -- there are 18 cases in Morropon and 32 cases in Piura city, or 50 cases in total. The distance of Morropon from Piura and its rural nature makes one suspect that there are just, at this moment, 32 verified human cases in Morropon.

The State of Piura is on the northern border with Ecuador; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/peru_admin_06.jpg; and for Morropon, see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Morropon.html, which is 74 km to the east of Piura city. - Mod.MHJ
