Anbar provincial council member Naeem Abdul Mohsin al-Ka'oud, on [Sat 6 Jan 2018] called on the authorities to prevent the entry of imported chickens into the province, due to the risk of introducing bird flu.

Al-Ka'oud said in an interview with Alsumaria News that "there are fears of the spread of avian influenza in Anbar province, especially since some authorities began to divert the consignments of infected poultry to the province, after preventing their introduction into Baghdad and Diyala." Al-Ka'oud called on the regulatory authorities to "prevent the entry of imported chickens to Anbar because the province is rich in poultry farms with susceptible animals which may lead to the virus spreading throughout the province".

A local source revealed on 1 Jan 2018, that more than 25 000 chickens were culled in Newdah al-Shat, Diyala province, due to the suspicion of avian flu [see item 2].

A joint committee in the province of Diyala stated the burial of 4 poultry flocks in the area of Jadedat Al Shat.

"A joint committee of the agriculture, veterinary, municipal, environmental and health departments carried out a campaign to bury more than 20 000 poultry, distributed among 4 flocks in the area of Jadedat Al Shat (30 km) [about 18.64 mi] west of the city of Baquba on suspicion of avian influenza infection , a source in the Diyala agriculture stated.

The source added that "this campaign is the 2nd in this area, preceded by a campaign a few days ago, during which 7800 birds were also buried in the same area, after the emergence of symptoms of infection disease in the fields of the region." Noting that these measures are preventive to prevent the spread of the disease to other areas in the province.

The warning on possible introduction of AI into Iraq (item [1] above) is likely to refer to the HPAI H5N8 virus strain. This virus is currently known to be circulating in at least 2 of Iraq's neighbours, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Confirmation of the reported outbreak in the Diyala governorate and, if confirmed, of the virus strain involved, is requested.

In the meantime, HPAI H5N8 continues its spread elsewhere in Eurasia. South Korea submitted its 7th follow-up report on Fri 5 Jan 2018, notifying 2 new outbreaks close to its northern border (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=25595). - Mod.AS
