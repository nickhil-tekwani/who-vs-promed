The presence of the longhorned tick, a non-native species dangerous to livestock, pets and humans, has been confirmed locally in Putnam and Lincoln counties, according to the West Virginia Department of Agriculture. The tick has also been found in Tyler, Taylor, Ritchie and Hardy counties.

The ticks were discovered on pet dogs in Putnam and Lincoln counties in June [2018].

The longhorned tick is considered a serious threat to livestock, particularly cattle, and is known to carry several diseases prone to animals and humans. Heavy infestation in animals can cause stunted growth, decreased production and death. In humans, the tick may harbor diseases like severe fever with thrombocytopenia, which can have a 30 percent fatality rate, and possibly Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a bacterial disease that can be deadly if not treated early with the right antibiotic.

Native to East Asia and the Pacific region, the tick is a well-known problem to cattle farmers in New Zealand.

"This tick has been associated with bacterial and viral tickborne disease in other parts of the world," said Miguella Mark-Carew, director of epidemiology and prevention services for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, Bureau for Public Health, in a release. "Like [blacklegged] ticks that transmit Lyme disease, longhorned ticks are very small and can be difficult to find on people and animals. It is important to conduct full-body tick checks when returning from time outdoors in wooded areas."

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection Services 1st identified the longhorned tick in the United States in New Jersey in November 2017. The tick's presence was then confirmed in Albemarle County, Virginia, in May [2018] before being discovered on farms in Hardy County.

There currently is no known link between the West Virginia, Virginia or New Jersey cases, and the tick has also been confirmed in Benton County, Arkansas.

Female longhorned ticks can reproduce without males, meaning one tick can breed a massive population. The first 3 confirmed cases appear to have all been the offspring of an original female progenitor.

"Livestock producers, animal owners and veterinarians should notify the State Veterinarian's Office if they notice any unusual ticks or ticks that occur in large numbers on an individual animal," said state veterinarian Dr. James Maxwell in a news release. "Livestock producers can work with their veterinarians to develop a tick prevention and control program."

Tick submissions are encouraged through the Veterinary Tick Submission Project, a voluntary tick surveillance program that tests ticks for disease pathogens.

[Finding these longhorn or bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) now in 6 counties in West Virginia as well as instances of occurrence of the in the eastern USA, makes one wonder whether this tick has become established in this region. Either the tick is spreading rapidly or surveillance has been intensified, or both. The report above does not mention if the dogs from which the tick was recovered had a travel history outside of the county and state. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 7 months, one wonders if it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
