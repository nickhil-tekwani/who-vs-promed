The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice recently for Viet Nam due to a diphtheria outbreak.

National health authorities have reported 198 diphtheria cases since the beginning of this year [2020]. Of the 198 cases, 172 cases have been reported in the Central Highland region, 22 cases in central provinces, and 4 cases in southern provinces.

In response to the outbreak, the Viet Nam Ministry of Health has launched a vaccination campaign for affected provinces and implemented several measures to help prevent and control the spread of the disease.

CDC says travelers to Viet Nam should make sure they are up to date with diphtheria vaccination.

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that causes respiratory tract and skin infections. It can spread from person to person by coughing and sneezing and through contact with infected skin sores. Diphtheria bacteria make a toxin (poison) that kills healthy tissues in the respiratory system. Within 2-3 days, the dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. If the toxin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause heart, nerve, and kidney damage.

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable infection caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm).

The DTP3 (the 1st 3 doses) coverage in Viet Nam is estimated to be 75% in 2018, having fallen from above an estimated 90% coverage in each of the preceding 4 years (https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/vnm.pdf).

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotic. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis.

Viet Nam is divided into 58 provinces and 5 municipalities, and the various provinces/municipalities into 8 regions, which are often grouped into 3 macro-regions: Northern, Central, and Southern. The Central macro-region includes the North Central, South Central, and Central Highlands regions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam#Regions). A map showing the Central Highlands region and Viet Nam's provinces in the various regions can be found at http://ontheworldmap.com/vietnam/vietnam-province-map.jpg. - Mod.ML
