Parents are being warned by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to keep children under the age of 10 away from a West Midlands park associated with a string of _E. coli_ cases. 8 people have been infected with _E. coli_ O157 in Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield since July 2012, a spokesman said. The 6 children and 2 adults have all made a full recovery.

The HPA said _E. coli_ O157 was often associated with contact with animals or contact with animal feces. Dr Roger Gajraj, from the Health Protection Unit in Birmingham, said: "We cannot ban children from the park but for the time being, to minimize the risk of infection, we are asking parents to take them to other parks in the local area." He said _E. coli_ O157 could be "very serious" in younger children and could cause kidney failure and be fatal in the most serious cases.

Posters issued by Birmingham City Council in Sutton Park recommend keeping children and pets away from grazing animals and washing hands, particularly before eating or drinking. They also advise washing shoes and bicycle and pushchair wheels after visiting the park. Extra hand-washing facilities have been set up in the park.

Birmingham City Council's head of parks, Darren Share, said: "We are working closely with the HPA to control this outbreak. As the infection can be particularly serious for young children we must reinforce our messages on the potential risks."

A series of races due to be staged through the park at the weekend [22-23 Sep 2012] by the Midland Counties Athletic Association have been called off on the advice of the council.

[Sutton Park, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, England (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Park), is one of the largest urban parks in Europe. The park covers 2400 acres [971 ha] with a mix of heathland, wetlands, and marshes, 7 lakes, extensive ancient woodlands (covering approximately a quarter of the park), several restaurants, a private 18-hole golf course on its western edge, and a municipal golf course to the south, a donkey sanctuary, children's playgrounds, and a visitors' center.

The surroundings in this large park in the West Midlands area of England offers ample areas where an individual might be exposed to animal feces including a water exposure and donkey sanctuary. With the size of the area, assessing where in Sutton Park the cases were and what activities they participated in could assist in identifying the reservoir. - Mod.LL
