Coconut Lethal Yellowing [LY] disease was detected in Inhambane
province, in the district of Vilankulo. So far, 6 coconut palms have
been identified and destroyed, [and] survey work to identify possible
additional outbreaks is underway.

According to a correspondent, this is the 1st official report of LY
to the south of the Zambezi river, some 400 km from the previously
nearest known source of the disease. Reliable observations suggest it
may have been there for at least a year and has affected rather more
than the 6 palms referred to here. This extension to the distribution
[range] of LY must be considered a serious threat to the large area
of coconut plantings in southern Mozambique.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the
palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains
have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and
southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the
respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm
species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of
inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm, usually
within 4 to 6 months.

The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the
Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY
strains elsewhere (for example, Mozambique). Seed transmission of the
pathogens cannot be excluded, and some weed species may serve as
reservoir hosts.

Commercial control of LY relies on replanting with resistant
varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely
used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons for the
breakdown are still uncertain.

In Mozambique, LY has been spreading in the coastal coconut belt to
the north and south of Quelimane in Zambezia province. Quarantine
restrictions are in place for the movement of coconut materials to
protect areas still free from LY, and some success with replanting
certain coconut varieties in LY affected areas has been reported
(ProMED-mail post 20100910.3262). Jumps of LY across apparently
unaffected coconut populations, like the situation reported above,
have been observed before in other regions. Possible reasons may
include aerial spread of infectious vector insects and, of course,
human activities.
