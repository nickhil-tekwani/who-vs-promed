A patient, who was admitted to Siaya District Hospital with symptoms similar to those of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever], has tested negative. Nursing Officer Sylvester Ng'anda said the patient, who was treated for thrombocytopaenia -- a condition that leads to lack of plasma in blood vessels and results in bleeding -- was discharged on Monday morning [6 Aug 2012]. "That is the reason why the patient was bleeding from the gums and other openings. We have confirmed he is free from Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] and there should be no panic," he said. He denied claims that the patient was treated for venom [exposure] after he was suspected to have eaten meat from a goat that had been bitten by a snake.

Meanwhile, Tanzania is on high alert as the government investigates 2 suspected cases of the viral disease in the North Western region, near the border with Uganda. Deputy Minister for Health Seif Suleiman Rashid on Monday [6 Aug 2012] told the Xinhua Agency that a team of doctors had been sent to the region to investigate the 2 cases. The 2 patients were admitted to Nyakahanga Hospital in Karagwe District [Kagera Region], after they exhibited symptoms of the haemorrhagic fever. Dr Andrew Charles, who is charge of the hospital, told Xinhua on the phone that blood samples of one of the patients, a 6-year-old boy, had been sent to Dar es Salaam for tests. [_Ebolavirus_] is spread only through contact with infected body fluids. The disease has killed 16 people in Uganda.

A Tanzanian mother and son who suffered Ebola-like symptoms after returning from a trip to Uganda are isolated in a local hospital on Monday [6 Aug 2012] as doctors await the result of their blood tests to know if they have the deadly disease. The patients were suspected of contracting Ebola [haemorrhagic fever] as they came from the neighboring Uganda, where an [ebolavirus] outbreak has killed 16 people and infected 53 others in Kibaale. They are confined in the Nyakahanga Hospital in Karagwe District, Kagera region in western Tanzania while samples of their blood are tested in Dar es Salaam.

The boy, 6, was admitted to the hospital after showing symptoms of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever], according to Dr Andrew Charles, who is in charge at the Nyakahanga Hospital. The child was placed in an intensive care unit and separated from other patients. His condition was improving as of Sunday [5 Aug 2012], the doctor said.

Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] symptoms include fever, body aches, rash, abdominal pain, and severe bleeding from body openings. It is spread through contact of body fluids from an infected person. The chances of dying from [ebolavirus infection] are 50 to 90 percent based on fatalities from previous outbreaks as there is no cure or treatment for the viral disease.

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has dismissed as unfounded reports that [an ebolavirus outbreak] has crossed to Karagwe District, Kagera Region from Uganda where over 40 cases have been reported. A statement released in Dar es Salaam, however, admitted that there was a patient reported in the district with symptoms relating to those of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever], but medical examinations have ruled out the connection.

"A 6-year-old boy was on Friday [3 Aug 2012], taken to Nyakahanga Hospital in Karagwe with symptoms feared to be that of [ebolavirus infection], but preliminary tests found out that he was suffering from urinary track infection (UTI) that caused him to urinate blood," reads the statement. It noted further that other checkups for malaria, hepatitis, and typhoid conducted to the same patient tested negative and that the hospital continues to treat the patient who is admitted in isolation room together with his mother, as experts continue with investigation on their health.

It noted further that a team of experts was dispatched to Kagera Region over the weekend [4-5 Aug 2012] which has also carried medical examination on the patient and sent blood samples to the national and international laboratories for further checkups. 'The team has reported that the patient's health is improving significantly and that all the bad signs such as fever, vomiting, and urinating blood have all stopped and there are no [ebolavirus infection] symptoms found so far," reads another part.

The statement reiterated that the ministry has positioned itself very well in defending its people over the disease in case it breaks in Tanzania. The ministry has dispatched teams of experts to various regions including Mara, Mwanza, Kagera, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, and Arusha.

In another development, the Kagera Acting Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Mr Herman Kabirigi, said the rumours were unfounded and aimed to create unnecessary tension among the people. He said that a team of experts had been dispatched to all entry points to monitor movements, adding that a 24-hour surveillance was being conducted at all entry points. The entry points include Rusumo and Kabanga in Ngara district, Kaisho and Murongo in Karagwe District, Kyaka and Mutukula in Misenyi District. Mr Kabirigi urged residents in the region to take precautions by boiling drinking water and using toilets.

Kagera Region is on high [ebolavirus] alert following reports that neighbouring Uganda risked a major resurgence of the disease after 43 cases were discovered recently. The warning came after Uganda said an epidemic had killed 18 people this month [August 2012], including 4 clinical officers who were attending sick patients.
