Bulgarian authorities reported Thursday [20 Jul 2006] the 1st case of
bird flu in domestic fowl on the territory of the country -- in the
village of Slanchogled (sunflower), near Kurdzhali. [About 70 km
north of the Greek border; Lat: 41:38:33N , Lon: 25:22:48E. Map at

Veterinarians have undertaken checks of local fowl after birds were
found to die in bulk.
Initial tests have detected avian flu virus, the Agriculture Ministry
announced at a special press conference. It has not yet been
confirmed whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present.
All fowl and turkeys from 3 farms were killed, massive disinfection
is under way, and stricter control on passing trucks and vehicles is
in place, the officials said; 2 people who were in contact with the
infected birds are under constant medical surveillance, Agriculture
Minister Nihat Kabil said. He added that all farmers whose fowl were
culled will be compensated.
The information on the bird flu situation was given to Prime Minister
Sergey Stanishev, President Georgi Parvanov, Disasters Management
Minister Emel Etem, and Health Minister Radoslav Gaydarski, their
agriculture colleague said.

[Bulgaria notified the OIE of its 1st H5N1 case on 12 Feb 2006; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_31.HTM#Sec8>.
The infected bird was a mute swan (_Cygnus olor_), found dead on 3
Feb 2006 in Vidin (Lat: 43:59:49N; Lon: 22:52:57E). Subsequently,
dead wild birds, collected in 4 locations -- the dams of Tsonevo and
Durankulak, the Black Sea town of Burgas, and near the river Danube
-- tested positive for H5. (see 20060213.0478, 20060212.0466).
The authorities have taken measures to prevent the introduction of
the virus from infected fauna into domestic fowl; unfortunately, and
rather inevitably, the first outbreak of the disease seems to have
occurred. Confirmation from a reference laboratory and details of the
virus are anticipated.
Thus far, Bulgaria has been one of the 14 European countries where
HPAI was detected only in wild birds. The other such countries are:
Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Austria, Bosnia &
Herzegovina, Slovakia, Switzerland, Poland, Georgia, Czech Republic,
Great Britain and Spain. If confirmed, Bulgaria will join the 12
European countries where domestic fowl have already been found infected.

[Subsequent reports have played down the likelihood that this is HPAI
H5N1. - Mod.JW.]
