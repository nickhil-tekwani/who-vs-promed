Slightly more up-to-date that the other stories, this in today's (Saturday
18 July) Electronic Telegraph, by Dr Roger Highfield, a scientist as well
as journalist, with a good background in BSE/CJD -- perhaps therefore less
garbled than the other/earlier press stories.

BPS 70m plan to screen blood for CJD
DONATED blood is to be treated to lessen the risk of transfusion patients
being infected with the human form of mad cow disease, it was announced
yesterday.
In future, supplies will go through a process of leucodepletion - the
removal of white blood cells which could harbour the infective agent - even
though Government advisers admit it is possible that the measure may be
ineffective.
The scheme, which will cost BPS 70 million a year, offers other health
benefits. It follows advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, SEAC, which helps to shape Government policy on BSE and its
human equivalent, new variant CJD. Importing blood for transfusion was out
of the question, given the enormous impact on the national blood supply.
Prof. Sir John Pattison, chairman of SEAC, said that it would be a
"catastrophe - we could not maintain the stocks and the risks would far
outweigh those we are trying to prevent".
Including the move to use imported plasma, introduced in February, the
Government will now spend BPS 100 million annually safeguarding the
nation's blood supply from CJD. There have been 27 confirmed cases of the
disease and although leucodepletion is not 100 per cent effective, the risk
is serious enough to warrant action, said Prof. Jeffrey Almond of Reading
University, a SEAC member. There is no good evidence that the old form of
CJD can be transmitted by blood but "there is a reason to be a little more
concerned about new variant CJD", said Prof. Almond. "The disease process
seems to be different."
The human BSE disease process involves the tonsils, spleen and lymph node.
"These tissues are packed full of white blood cell types," said Prof.
Almond. "You can't see any in the old-style CJD." White cells in mice can
transmit disease, as can lymph node, spleen and tonsils of sheep. This led
SEAC to suspect that white blood cells may carry the disease in patients.
The risk to the blood supply depends on how long an individual has been
infected and how much infectivity resides in blood, for instance is a
single drop or two pints enough to transfer the disease? "We don't know the
answer to that," said Prof. Almond.
The second risk factor depends on another unknown, that of receiving a unit
of blood donated by an infected person. A rough calculation suggests that
one in 125 transfusion patients could be at risk from blood contaminated
with human BSE. In reality, despite a risk assessment launched last
November, "we don't know", said Sir John. "We don't have enough information
to give a useful quantitative risk assessment."
Leucodepletion, which is carried out in four other European countries,
removes up to 95 per cent of white blood cells and would therefore reduce
risk so long as the white cells are not highly infectious. The move would
offer other potential health benefits: white cells transmit other
infections, are a cause of fevers in patients who receive transfusions, and
are linked to rejection in bone marrow transplants.
Frank Dobson, the Health Secretary, said yesterday: "Although the risks are
still theoretical, it is better to be safe than sorry."

Blood supplies to be treated for CJD
All supplies will now be treated to remove white cells
Twenty-seven people are known to have died from nv-CJD. Three of them were
blood donors. There is no screening procedure for the disease. Britain's
blood stocks are to be treated to reduce the risks of transmission of
new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD).
Ministers made the announcement after a recommendation from SEAC - the body
of experts who advise the government on BSE and its human equivalent,
nvCJD. The SEAC committee believe there is a 'theoretical risk', that the
agent which causes nvCJD could be passed through blood products. Their
report, to be published officially in the next few weeks, calls for the
introduction of leucodepletion - a process that removes white blood cells
from donated blood.
Professor John Pattison, the chairman of SEAC said: "It is possible that
there are a significant number of people who are incubating new-variant CDJ
who will be blood donors, and if that is the case it seems prudent to take
precautions to try to minimise the risk."
Government acknowledges danger
Frank Dobson, Secretary of State for Health, said: "We will do whatever we
are advised to reduce the theoretical risk to the blood supply of the
transmission of nvCJD. The National Blood Service has at my request been
planning since November for the introduction of leucodepletion. They will
now implement these plans. Although the risks are still theoretical, it is
better to be safe than sorry."
The government has been keen to stress that there are no risks associated
with donation of blood and has appealed to the public to continue making
donations. "If there is a risk from receiving blood transfusions it is a
minute one, and people who need blood would be in infinitely greater danger
of dying without a transfusion than from catching CJD," a health department
spokesman said.
Foreign supplies
Another course of action that has been considered is a total ban on blood
transfusions from donors in the UK. But that would mean Britons would have
to accept transfusions of foreign blood, which could have higher risks of
other infections. It would also give the National Health Service (NHS) a
massive bill as its British donations are free.
Claire Rayner, chair of the Patients' Association, called for greater use
of autologous blood transfusions in which a patient donates blood before an
operation and receives it back during surgery. She said the practice was
already used in the private sector but was not readily available in the
NHS. She said it would help reduce some of the paranoia that seems to
surround blood.
