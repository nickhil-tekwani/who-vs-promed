Outbreak of Contagious Poultry Disease
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the highly contagious Newcastle disease (ND) has been found
in turkeys at a poultry farm in Luvia (please see footnote) on the west
coast. All of the farm's turkeys have been destroyed.
A 10-km quarantine zone has been set up around the farm, in which all
transportation of poultry is restricted, says the Ministry of Agriculture.
The source of the outbreak at the farm, just 10-km south of Pori, is not
yet clear.
After cattle slaughtering and production facilities at the farm have been
disinfected, an inspection to determine whether the disease has been
eradicated will be made in 3 weeks time. Government compensation will be
given to the farm.
Newcastle disease was discovered in turkeys after blood tests carried out
during routine health checks. The birds did not have the respiratory,
digestive or nervous symptoms usually associated with the disease. Humans
or other mammals are not affected, but it can kill almost all young birds.
ND is a devastating disease to the poultry industry.
Affecting poultry, aviary and wild birds, ND last appeared in Finland in
1996 in the University of Oulu aviary. The most recent case of ND at a
Finnish poultry farm dates from 1971. The virus is preserved well in the
environment and spreads from one farm to another through birds, feed and
people.
In Europe, the last serious ND epidemic occurred in 2002 spreading as far
north as Denmark. All EU nations except for Finland, Sweden and Denmark
vaccinate poultry against the disease.
footnote:
Luvia is located 220 km (140 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
It faces the Gulf of Bothnia.
