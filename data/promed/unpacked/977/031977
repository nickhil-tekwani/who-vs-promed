Abstract
--------
Human cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were first detected in Spain in 2016. National human and animal health authorities organized a large, multidisciplinary study focusing on ticks as sentinels to determine the nationwide distribution of ticks with CCHF virus. Ticks were collected from animals and vegetation, samples pooled (12 584 ticks; 4556 pools), and molecular methods used to look for the virus. We detected the virus in 135 pools from most of the regions studied, indicating that it is widespread in Spain. We found sequences of CCHF virus genotypes I, III, and IV in the tick species collected, most commonly in _Hyalomma lusitanicum_, suggesting this tick has a prominent role in the virus's natural cycle. The red deer (_Cervus elaphus_) was the host that most frequently yielded positive ticks. Our study highlights the need for larger studies in Spain to ascertain the complete risk to public health.

Introduction
------------
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tickborne zoonotic disease causing severe illness, considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the 7 highest-priority epidemic-prone diseases. CCHF is considered the most widespread tickborne viral hemorrhagic disease in the world and poses a great public health risk because of its epidemic potential, high case-fatality rates in humans, and a lack of effective mitigation measures, creating an urgent need for accelerated research (1 [see source URL for complete references and figures]). CCHF is caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV; family _Nairoviridae_, genus _Orthonairovirus_), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is a spherical virion 80-120 nm diameter and has a lipid envelope. Its genome is divided into 3 segments; the small (S) segment encodes the viral nucleocapsid, the medium (M) segment the membrane glycoprotein precursor, and the large (L) segment the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein (2). The S segment has been widely used in phylogenetic studies, which have defined 6 of 7 CCHFV lineages, each with a different geographic range (3,4).

The virus is transmitted to humans mainly by the bite of infected _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, which act as reservoirs and vectors; sexual, transovarial, and transstadial transmissions have been demonstrated in the ticks (5). Immature ticks commonly feed on medium-sized mammals and on birds, but adults prefer domestic and wild ungulates, which do not develop clinical signs; reports of the tick on other vertebrates are anecdotal (6,7). The virus can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected fluids of animals and humans. Groups at risk include farmers and their families, slaughterhouse and healthcare workers, veterinarians, and persons who are otherwise prone to being bitten by ticks (8).

CCHFV has been widely reported across the whole of Africa, except for the Sahara Desert, and in Asia and Europe (9,10), where its range overlaps with that of its main tick vectors. Human CCHF cases in Europe had usually been reported in countries of the former Soviet Union and some Balkan countries before 2 human clinical cases were detected in Spain in 2016 (11), raising awareness of the virus's circulation in western Europe. The index case-patient was bitten by a tick while walking in a field in Ávila province, belonging to the Castile and León (CyL) region (autonomous community) (Figure 1). The 2nd case was a nosocomial infection in a healthcare worker. Since then, 8 additional cases have been described in Spain: 1 in 2013 (documented recently in a retrospective study), 2 in 2018 (1 found retrospectively), 3 in 2020, and 2 in 2021 (12-16). Epidemiologic tracking of these human cases revealed a wider distribution of the virus than initially expected. The patient in one of the 2018 cases was infected in Badajoz province in the Extremadura (EXT) region; all other patients were infected in CyL: 2 in Avila, 1 in León, and 5 in Salamanca provinces (Figure 1). Strikingly, the viral genotypes detected in human cases were highly variable. Genotype III (Africa 3 clade) was found in cases from 2016 and 2020 (11,17; A. Negredo, pers. comm.). Cases detected in 2018 consisted of CCHFV genotype V (Europe 1 clade) (14), a reassortment of genotype IV (Africa 4 clade) in the S segment, and genotype III (Africa 3 clade) in the M and L segments (13).

In Spain, the virus was first detected in 2010 in _H. lusitanicum_ ticks collected while they were feeding on red deer (_Cervus elaphus_) in Cáceres province, EXT region (18). Additional surveys detected the virus in the same area over several years, and sequencing revealed that several variants of genotype III (Africa 3 clade) were circulating there (19,20). Recently, RNA of genotypes IV (Africa 4 clade) and V (Europe 1 clade) have also been detected in ticks collected from red deer and wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) in several regions of south western Spain (21).

Our study reports the results of an extensive CCHFV surveillance study in Spain, involving more than 12 000 ticks collected while they were questing or feeding. The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the current distribution and genetic variability of the CCHFV strains found so far in Spain, with a special focus on future risk assessment.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this contribution on CCHF in ticks in Spain.

During 2011-2015, Negredo et al conducted a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) survey in captured ticks that were feeding mainly on wild and domestic ungulates in Spain and detected CCHFV RNA in _Hyalomma lusitanicum_ and _H. marginatum_ ticks for 3 of the 5 years. The rate of infected ticks was 2.78% (44/1579), which was similar to those for other countries in Europe with endemic foci for CCHFV (Kosovo, Bulgaria, and Albania; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6537724/).

Arteaga and colleagues reported new circulation of European genotype V CCHF Virus in Spain in February 2021 and suggested that CCHFV is an identifiable cause of febrile illness of unknown origin in Spain (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0009197).

CCHFV has been considered to be one of the 7 high priority emergent pathogens for the last 3 years by WHO, requiring urgent attention in research, development and innovation (R&D&I) because of its epidemic potential in the near future. CCHFV is considered an emerging or even a probable re-emerging pathogen in southern Europe. Presence of this virus had been reported previously in various regions of Spain with a case report in June 2020 (see https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/publications/hps-weekly-report/volume-54/issue-25/cchf-in-salamanca-spain/) and July 2021 in north west Spain.

Transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among healthcare providers in areas with potential circulation of CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should be conducted only under appropriate biological containment conditions. - Mod.UBA
