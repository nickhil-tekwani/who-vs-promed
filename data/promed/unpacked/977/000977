There is no sign San Diego County's hepatitis A outbreak is slowing down anytime soon. According to a new report by the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, there are now 196 confirmed cases of the viral disease, 142 hospitalizations and 4 deaths, making this the largest hepatitis A outbreak in California in more than 2 decades and the 3rd largest in the nation since the hepatitis A vaccine was introduced in the late 1990s. The overwhelming majority of the people affected are either homeless, drug users, or both.

The outbreak has forced health officials to resort to unconventional methods. They include sending out teams of nurses with backpacks and coolers to encampments, where they offer vaccinations. The county is also planning to install hand-washing stations in downtown San Diego and elsewhere to try to help prevent the spread of the disease.

Hepatitis A is spread through close contact and fecal contamination, and it leads to symptoms like nausea and jaundice.

County health officials expect the number of cases to continue to climb as dozens of suspected cases could soon be confirmed. There has been no confirmed source of the outbreak.

[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase, now over an almost 7 month period.

Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)
--------------------------------------------------------------
5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)
4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)
31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)
12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)
27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)

There have been 63 more cases over about 4 weeks and 116 more cases over about 8 weeks. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear if the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard.

Thus, it remains unclear if the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear if the fatalities occurred in those individuals.

Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors while homosexual practices is not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL
