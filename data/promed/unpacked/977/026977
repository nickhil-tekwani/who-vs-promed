Canadian Food Inspection Agency says suspected case of mad cow detected
----------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says it has detected what may be
another case of mad cow disease, a potentially devastating hit to an
already struggling Canadian beef industry.
The disclosure of the suspect case early Thursday came just hours
after the United States announced sweeping plans for the reopening
its border in March to nearly all Canadian exports of beef and live
cattle. The border was closed 19 months ago when a cow in northern
Alberta tested positive for mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
The CFIA released few details on the new suspect case, except to
identify it as a 10-year-old dairy cow. [Which may mean it was born
before the feed ban was put into place.- Mod.TG]
The preliminary testing results were completed on Wednesday, said the
agency, adding that the testing was conducted after the cow was
identified as a "downer" - unable to walk.
The finding is not definitive, but the CFIA says multiple screening
tests have yielded positive results. No part of the animal entered
the human food or animal feed systems, said the agency.
Samples are currently being analyzed at the Canadian Science Centre
for Human and Animal Health in Winnipeg and confirmatory results are
expected in 3 to 5 days.
Since confirming BSE in Canada in 2003, CFIA officials have stated
that finding more cases in North America was possible.
The agency said U.S. authorities have been notified and added that it
is the government's normal policy to report only confirmed results.
"However, given the unique situation created by the United States'
border announcement . . . it was decided that the most prudent action
would be to publicly announce the available information and provide
stakeholders with a full understanding of the current situation,"
said the CFIA.
BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy)is a chronic, degenerative
disorder affecting the central nervous system of cattle. Since it was
first diagnosed in Great Britain in 1986, there have been more than
180,000 cases.
If confirmed, the case could be a devastating blow to an already
struggling beef industry that celebrated the U.S. announcement on
Wednesday that it was finally reopening its border to most Canadian
beef exports.
"Isn't that wonderful," whooped Mac McLean, owner of two feedlots
near Lethbridge, Alta. "That's a big, big step. That's wonderful that
they're going to do that."
If the U.S. decision stands, it would mean that about 95 per cent of
the trade in beef and cattle could resume in the new year.
The beef industry has been struggling since May 20, 2003, when it was
announced a single breeder cow in northern Alberta tested positive
for BSE.
Before the trade ban, animals regularly crossed the border and Canada
sold more than 70 per cent of its live cattle to the U.S. That market
was worth $1.8 billion in 2002.
The second largest customer, Mexico, came in at $200 million and
Japan imported $81 million worth.
More than 4,200 jobs related to the beef industry have been lost, say
federal statistics, most in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. The border
closure also included ruminants such as deer, elk, sheep, goats,
caribou and bison.
It's estimated the closure has cost the Canadian industry and rural
communities about $5 billion. Federal and provincial governments have
spent a total of $1.6 billion on aid for producers.
While the U.S. opened its border to boneless beef from cattle less
than 30 months old last September, plans to expand the opening were
curtailed when a second BSE (mad cow) case emerged in a Canadian-born
cow in Washington state.
The United States consequently lost its major beef trading partners.

[It is a blow to Canada to have a suspect case. However, if this
proves to be a 10-year-old animal born before the feed ban, then
logically there should be little effect on the less than 30-month-old
animals coming in.
Also, it is only a suspect case and the confirmatory test are not
completed. It will be interesting to know if the CFIA does
immunohistochemistry (IHC) or Western Blot analysis and how the US
views the results of the confirmatory test. - Mod.TG]
