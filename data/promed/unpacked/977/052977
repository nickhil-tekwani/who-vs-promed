Hello Steve and Candance,
Here is some further information on the case of the Leonard Franklin,
the abattoir worker thought to have CJD. On Dec. 23, there was a
posting of a 36-line story about Mr. Franklin by Brian Unwin for the
PA News, on Compuserve. I assume that the PA News service must be a
major news service in the U.K. because the other news service listed
are of the likes of AP, Reuters, etc. This story is different from
the one Steve Sullivan posted. Since the story is headed by "Copyright
1995 PA News. Copying, storing, redistribution, retransmission,
publication, transfer or commerical exploitation of this information is
expressly forbidden," I won't send the story but simply summarize it.
Mr. Franklin worked in an abattoir for 2 years, until 1991, so his family
thinks his symptoms, which appear to have been originally diagnosed as
Alzheimer's Disease, may be due to CJD. His ex-wife Olga talks of her
husband's exposure to blood and brains and working with cuts on his hands
and then is quoted about his deteriorating health. A spokesman for the
York District Hospital confirmed that Mr. Franklin had symptoms of CJD.
The CJD surveillence unit is studying the case. Dr. Narang is then
quoted as having offered to test Mr. Franklin for CJD with his urine test.
The article ends with Dr. Narang's suggestion that, since Mr. Franklin was
initially misdiagnosed as having Alzheimer's Disease, perhaps Alzheimer's
patients should be tested to see if some of them may be misdiagnosed
cases of CJD.
It seems to me that Dr. Narang's suggestion has a lot of merit.
Alzheimer's disease is far more prevalent than CJD, yet both basically
are degenerative brain diseases that have remarkably similar outward
symptoms. Thus, it's easy to see how a doctor could confuse the latter
with the former. If a simple test does exist/is developed, perhaps such
a survey of select Alzheimer's patients should be done. Has the Department
of Health's CJD surveillence unit considered the possibility that CJD
could be easily misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease?
Regards,
Michael Hansen
