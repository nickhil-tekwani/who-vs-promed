Confirmed cases of a deadly pig virus spreading across the US Hog Belt jumped by 215, its highest weekly increase since it was discovered in the United States in April 2013, according to the USDA's National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN).

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv), which causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration, is transmitted orally and through pig feces. While older pigs have a chance of survival, the virus kills 80 to 100 percent of piglets that contract it.

The total number of confirmed cases has increased to 2692 in 23 states as of the week that ended [25 Jan 2014]. Nearly 40 percent of the cases, 1006, were confirmed in Iowa, the top US pork producing state.

As defined by the USDA, each diagnostic case could represent multiple animals at either a single farm site or several locations. The USDA's NAHLN released its latest PEDv data on Wednesday [29 Jan 2014].

There are no official figures for pigs lost to the PEDv -- which does not affect humans -- but up to 4 million pigs may have died from the virus, according to industry analyst estimates. Additionally, the virus was confirmed in Canada last week [week ending 25 Jan 2014].

PEDv has spread to a 4th farm in the Canadian province of Ontario, the provincial government said on Wednesday [29 Jan 2014], despite the hog industry's efforts to stop it by disinfecting delivery trucks and clothing used on farms.

PEDv has forced the US hog industry to increase its biosecurity measures and has fueled concerns hog supplies will slump in the spring and summer.

[This is one of those devastating, fast moving diseases that we wish we had an instant cure for. Unfortunately real science does not live up to the movie solutions of quick cures. It appears that vigilance and prevention, perhaps a case of paranoia, are needed to protect swine operations from this disease, and even those may not be tools that are good enough. - Mod.TG
