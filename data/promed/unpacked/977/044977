In the past 24 hours, 2 children from Bansihari have died of viral
encephalitis, and at least 10 others have developed symptoms of the
killer disease. Chief medical officer of health of South Dinajpur Asit
Kumar Mondal said a 9 year old and 10 year old who had been admitted
to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri with
viral encephalitis yesterday afternoon [8 Aug 2011] died this morning
[9 Aug 2011].

"The NBMCH authorities have confirmed that they died because of viral
encephalitis. Of the 10 children who have been down with fever, 2 have
been admitted to the district hospital in Balurghat," the CMOH said.

For the past one week, several children had been complaining of high
fever, severe headache, nausea and delirium at Shantipur village in
Bansihari, the CMOH said. Most of the children had been admitted to
Rashipur health centre and Gangarampur subdivisional hospital. But
their condition deteriorated, and the 2 deceased children were shifted
to the NBMCH.

The CMOH said an 8-member medical team headed by deputy CMOH Gourav
Roy had been sent to Shantipur and adjoining Biswanathpur, 70 km [44
miles] from Balurghat. According to Mondal, blood samples have been
collected. A medical camp has also been opened in the area under block
medical officer Tapas Saha. Block medical officer Saha said:
"Encephalitis usually spreads through pigs. But no one is known to
rear pigs in the locality. We suspect that someone might have been
infected with the disease [virus] from outside, and it had then spread
through mosquito bites."

[Encephalitis cases, with fatalities, continue to occur in north
eastern India. The above report implicates pigs and mosquitoes,
suggesting that the medical authorities believe that the etiological
agent involved in these cases is Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus,
which is likely to be correct. Laboratory confirmation is needed to
confirm the diagnosis. Pigs are amplifying hosts of JE virus. Wild
birds are the reservoir hosts and alone can serve as sources of
infectious blood meals for transmission to humans. The suggestion that
an infected human introduced the virus is incorrect for JE virus.
Human viremias are not of sufficient magnitude and duration to infect
vector mosquitoes. Thus, humans are dead end hosts. The proportion of
individuals in this area who are immunized against JE virus is not
stated in this report.
