According to [Gennady] Onischenko, the [First Deputy Minister of
Public Health], a serious epidemiological situation caused by a high
level of morbidity from various infectious diseases -- including that
caused by _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ -- has developed in Russia
due to rodent vectors.
Rodent numbers have considerably increased above normal. In Saint
Petersburg, it is estimated that there are 1.7 rodents/1000 sq.
meter, in seaports of the Krasnodar region - 7.5 rodents/1000 sq.
meter, in cities of the Jewish Autonomous Region (Birobidzhan) - 16
rodents/1000 sq. meter, and in Novosibirsk - 0.7 rodents/1000 sq.
meter (the standard rate - 0.5).
Even though the rodent numbers are lower for Novosibirsk than for the
other regions mentioned, 590 cases of pseudotuberculosis have already
been registered there in 2006 (versus 610 cases in all of 2005).

[Rodents are a main source of contamination, both in produce
storehouses and in the home. Sanitary epidemiological services should
pay steadfast attention to conditions and duration of storage of
vegetables in both commercial and home areas.
The Novosibirsk region is located in the southeastern part of the
west Siberian plain:

[The manifestations of illness in these cases are not stated.
Infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with reservoirs
in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and various birds.
Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The most
common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,
with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be
confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also
occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late
complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.
Cutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned
erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can
be found with a variety of infectious stimuli. Erythema nodosum
presents as painful, indurated erythematous circular lesions, usually
on the shins.
Erythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form
lesions including classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes
erythema multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into
plaques with a vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be
associated with conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes with
erythroderma and subsequent desquamation can also occur. This
manifestation can also resemble Kawasaki syndrome (2).
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the
strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and
food was published in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary
(4) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of
infections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection
with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from
lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but
cross-reactions are found between Yersiniae and other enteric
organisms, including some salmonellae.
