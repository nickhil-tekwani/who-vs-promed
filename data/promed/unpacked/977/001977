There were 395 rotavirus infection cases registered in Komi republic
in 2010, which is 52 percent more compared with the same period of
2009. More than 80 percent of cases were children mainly from
childcare and preschool institutions. Higher age groups experienced
rotavirus infection less frequently, [probably] referring to their
symptoms as functional dyspepsia.

The incidence of all cause enteric infections in 2010 (1530 cases)
exceeded the 2009 indicator by 35.4 percent. The cases of [bacterial]
dysentery were few and stayed at the same level as in 2009.
Meanwhile, viral diarrhea and unknown cause diarrheas increased. The
sanitary doctors advise [the public] to follow common hygiene rules
during this seasonal of raised rotavirus infection rates.
