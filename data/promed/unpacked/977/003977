An increase in the incidence of enterovirus infection (EVI) is noted in the Republic of Tatarstan. This was announced on 16 Sep 2022 by the regional department of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare].

For 8 months of 2022, 204 cases of the disease were registered in the republic, which is 22.9% more than last year [2021].

Most often, enteroviruses affect children. This year [2022], in the structure of EVI cases in the republic, the child population (under 17 years old) accounts for 92.6%, of which 84% are children under the age of 6 years.

The source of infection is a person (sick or healthy virus carrier). The disease manifests itself within 10 days from the moment of infection.

As REGNUM reported, in August 2022, the work of the Vostok children's health camp in the Semenovsky district of the Nizhny Novgorod region was suspended. About 30 emergency notifications were received from the camp with suspected enterovirus infection. According to the ICR [Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation] for the Nizhny Novgorod region, about 20 children were injured.

Background [abridged]
Many diseases can be not only treated but also prevented if preventive measures are not neglected. Today, the complex of prevention includes both medical and non-medical measures. Their common task is to minimize the risk of diseases, and in case of illness, the risk of complications.

Prevention measures include not only vaccination but also hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, as well as the proper organization of the workplace, proper nutrition, and much more.

[The Republic of Tatarstan is a republic of Russia located in Eastern Europe. It is a part of the Volga Federal District and its capital and largest city is Kazan, an important cultural centre in Russia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan)

"_Enterovirus_, a genus within the family Picornaviridae, comprises enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses, rhinoviruses, polioviruses, and echoviruses. These are causative agents for a wide variety of illnesses ranging from the common cold to poliomyelitis and aseptic meningitis. In humans, they are among the most common infectious agents worldwide.

"The genus is further divided into 12 species, enteroviruses (EV) A-J (which include the coxsackievirus (CV), poliovirus (PV), and echovirus subspecies), and rhinoviruses (RV) A-C. Within these, over 200 distinct serotypes have been identified.

"These viruses were classified, and the genus named thus due to their tropism involving the human alimentary tract. However, their pathology is varied, and in some instances, poorly understood."
(Sinclair W, Omar M. Enterovirus. 2021. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2022. PMID: 32966001; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32966001/).

This report does not state which enterovirus is suspected. A study conducted in Russia, published in 2021 states, "The identified strains of enteroviruses of 47 types, which circulated in Russia in 2018-2019, belonged to different species: _Enterovirus_ species A (CV-A2, CV-A4, CV-A6, CV-A8, CV-A10, CV-A16, EV-A71), as well as _Enterovirus_ species B and _Enterovirus_ species C."

"The incidence of enterovirus infection is influenced by geographic, climatic, economic and demographic factors... In the majority of territories of Russia, the climate is temperate or cold, and seasonal rises in the incidence rates of enterovirus infection usually occur in the summer, when people go on vacation, spend a lot of time outdoors, and swim in open reservoirs."
