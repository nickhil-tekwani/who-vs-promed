The death toll of a cholera outbreak in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has risen to 38 so far this year [2022], the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) said on Tuesday [10 May 2022]. The country has recorded a total of 1569 confirmed cholera cases since the onset in January [2022], Jessica Akinrogbe, NCDC's senior emergency response officer, said at a water sanitation meeting in Abuja, Nigeria's capital. In mid-April [2022], the NCDC reported 31 deaths from 1359 confirmed cases.

Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration.

Akinrogbe said a total of 15 states have been affected by the outbreak, noting some states have failed to report cholera issues in their localities. She said the NCDC had already deployed rapid response teams to the states to curtail the spread. With the approaching rainy season in the country, more efforts must be geared toward preventing recurrence, the public health official said.

The health agency has been supporting states to ensure a coordinated, rapid, and effective response to the current outbreak, including the deployment of rapid response teams to support the response at the state level, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, and scale-up of risk communications among other activities.

Part of the measures so far taken by the government includes the distribution of cholera kits to hotspot local government areas, while 5813 households received water treatment chemicals, she said, adding a total of 107 persons were trained on hygiene and sanitation promotion, water quality monitoring, water schemes operation, and maintenance, while 40 water points were chlorinated.

The cholera outbreak is frequently reported in Nigeria due to the lack of potable water supply, especially in densely populated areas.

Today, Monday [9 May 2022], a source revealed that 200 medical staff were summoned to Al-Kifl prison after the spread of cholera.

"This measure came after confirming the spread of cholera among the prisoners who are now lying in the Imam Al-Sadiq hospital in Babylon," the source added, and indicated that "the number of people who died of cholera has risen to 2 prisoners from Al-Kifl prison."

[3] Cholera: Pakistan (Balochistan)

The cholera disease outbreak in the Dera Bugti district of Balochistan on Monday [9 May 2022] claimed 2 lives, while 979 others were badly affected by the widely spread infectious disease, according to the health officer. Talking to the media, District Health Officer of Dera Bugti, Dr Azam Bugti, said that the 1st case of cholera epidemic was reported on 17 Apr [2022] from Pirkoh, 25 km [15.5 mi] from the district headquarters, Dera Bugti, and one person reportedly died of the disease on that same day. After the incident, the number of samples sent to National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad were reported as 'positive.'

DHO Dera Bugti further said humans and livestock of Pirkoh consumed water from a pond, which was filled with rainwater, and due to aridity for a prolonged time, the water of the said pond had become poisonous and contaminated.

"Deputy Commissioner Dera Bugti has provided 4 water bores for the supply of drinking water to the people of the affected area, but this is not a permanent solution to the problem," the DHO maintained. He also apprised that there were 2 government primary health centers in the affected area of Pirkoh, and all the resources available in them were being utilized. Moreover, since 17 Apr [2022] until now, these 2 centers were providing uninterrupted services round the clock, the DHO added.

A 16-year-old boy and a 66-year-old woman were the fatal victims of cholera so far, while 979 cases had been reported so far, including 103 new cases emerged on 8 May 2022, said the DHO.

Highlighting the preventive measures, DHO said that through social mobilization, the public was being sensitized about cholera's seriousness. "People are requested to boil the water before they drink it and follow the principles of hygiene and cleanliness," DHO urged.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
