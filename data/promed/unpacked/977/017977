The discovery of a suspected case of huanglongbing [HLB] in southern Portugal has put Spain's citrus industry in a state of high alert.

Last week's outbreak -- which has yet to be officially confirmed -- prompted Portugal's agriculture ministry to order the immediate uprooting of the affected 1.5 ha farm in the Algarve, in accordance with the emergency protocols established to deal with the disease.

Producers in Spain have asked the authorities to tighten controls, increase inspections, and be extra vigilant for the African citrus psyllid, which transmits the disease.

They are calling for a phytosanitary cordon to be established around any area in which the pest is found, as was the case in Galicia and in northern Portugal some months ago [see ProMED-mail post 20150213.3163555], and for EU controls to be tightened to prevent consignments affected by the disease from being imported into Europe.

A committee of experts is to come up with a suggested response to the latest threat ahead of a national meeting.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, africanus (including a subsp. capensis) or americanus. The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. While symptom development for _Ca._ L. asiaticus is favoured by warm temperatures and for _Ca._ L. africanus by cooler conditions, mixed infections of the 2 pathogens have been reported.

HLB is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_, but _D. citri_ has also been reported to be able to transmit africanus. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting of guava, is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018). In areas where an HLB pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of HLB outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Until recently, neither HLB nor either of the psyllid vectors had been detected in mainland Europe or Australia but were of great quarantine concern in those regions. However, the African psyllid _T. erytreae_ was reported for the 1st time from mainland Europe in Spain earlier in 2015 (ProMED-mail post 20150213.3163555). It appears from the report above that at the same time, it was also detected in Portugal. With a vector present in the region, an outbreak of the disease was, unfortunately, to be expected sooner or later. If this detection can be confirmed, HLB will pose a considerable threat to Mediterranean citrus production.
