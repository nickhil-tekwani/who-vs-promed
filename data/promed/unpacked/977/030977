A 28-year-old tribal woman from the Changalamoola tribal hamlet at Neykuppa in Poothadi grama panchayat died of scrub typhus, transmitted by infected ticks, on Wednesday [1 May 2019].

A woman from Maveli Nagar at Cheeral in the district died of the disease 3 months ago. "[The current patient] had been admitted to the District Hospital at Mananthavady 4 days ago with symptoms of scrub typhus, and later she was referred to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode," R. Renuka, District Medical Officer, told The Hindu. Her condition worsened on Tuesday night and she died on Wednesday [1 May 2019], Dr. Renuka said.

The samples collected from the patient were sent to the Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), and the tests confirmed it as a case of scrub typhus, Dr. Renuka added. A few days ago, 24 fever cases were reported in the tribal hamlet, and the ailing were admitted to the Family Health Centre at Poothadi. Ten among them showed symptoms of scrub typhus, and the disease was confirmed in 6 persons, K.M. Noona Marja, District Surveillance Officer, said. There was no need for panic as all steps had been taken to tackle the outbreak of the disease in the district, Dr. Marja said.

_Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a tick-borne bacterium belonging to the family Rickettsiaceae, is responsible for scrub typhus in humans. Chigger mites (larval mites) on rodents such as rats and squirrels transmit the disease to humans, Dr. Marja said. Surveillance had been stepped up in forest areas of the hamlet, she added.

According to data available with the district Health Department, 51 scrub typhus cases have been reported from the district so far this year [2019], with 2 deaths as against 43 cases and one death during the corresponding period last year [2018].

[Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Rodents (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated in the news report above. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely not available in endemic regions.

Wayanad is a district in northeast Kerala state, located on the Western Ghats at an elevation of 700 to 2100 meters (about 0.4 to 1.3 miles) above sea level, with 3 towns, Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery and many indigenous tribes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district).
