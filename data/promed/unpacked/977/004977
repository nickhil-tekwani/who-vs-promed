National medical chief officer Ferenc Falus has launched an inquiry after
15 people were hospitalized after eating food provided by a buffet at the
Hungaroring race track during yesterday's Formula One race.
A total of 14 adults and a child were rushed to hospital, but none was in a
serious condition and most were foreigners. The foreigners were taken to
Szent Laszlo Hospital from Budapest hotels, not straight from the race
track. The sale of food by those suspected of disseminating the epidemic
was subsequently suspended.

[The etiology of this foodborne outbreak is not clear and more information
is needed. Knowing the incubation period from eating to illness, if fever
is present and what specific gastrointestinal symptoms occurred would be
helpful.
The Hungaroring is a Formula 1 racing circuit located 19 km (11.8 miles)
from the center of Budapest, alongside the M3 motorway at the border of the
village Mogyorod near Budapest, Hungary, where the Hungarian Grand Prix is
held. In 1986, it became the location of the first Formula 1 Grand Prix
behind the Iron Curtain.

Danube River can be found at:
