A Minnesotan is among the 4 cases of a rare tropical disease, typically found in South Asia, that was linked to an imported aromatherapy spray product sold at Walmart stores. The Minnesota patient survived, but the same disease recently killed a 5-year-old boy in Georgia and a 53-year-old woman in Kansas.

That's according to new details published Thursday [3 Mar 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine, which outlined 4 cases of melioidosis in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and Texas that were linked to bottles of room sprays from Better Homes and Gardens. The bottles were labeled as a "highly fragranced essential oil and semi-precious stone infused room spray" with a "lavender and chamomile" scent. And now, the authors say healthcare professionals should more closely consider melioidosis in patients showing similar symptoms, even if they haven't traveled to places where the disease is endemic.

As Patch previously reported, Walmart recalled about 3900 bottles of "Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones." The aromatherapy room spray was sold at 55 Walmart stores and online from February 2021 through October 2021 for about USD 4. One bottle of the essential oil sprays was found to contain _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, a dangerous bacterium that lives in soil and water and causes the melioidosis infection when ingested, breathed or absorbed through the skin. The infection, also called Whitmore's disease, can lead to skin abscesses in the absence of fever, pneumonia, sepsis, organ abscesses, genital infection, and inflamed brain or spinal cord.

Most melioidosis cases are reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Northern Australia, as well as several other South Asia countries, though there have been cases reported in Puerto Rico, the British and US Virgin Islands, Central and South America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, according to the CDC. But in America, cases are exceedingly rare. About a dozen are reported to the CDC each year, and the vast majority are linked to travel to areas where melioidosis is endemic. So experts were puzzled when 2 people in America died from the bacterium, and none of the 4 in the cluster of cases, which occurred over a period of just a few months, had traveled internationally.

After testing numerous items the 4 patients were exposed to, researchers connected the strain of bacterium to an aromatherapy spray bottle that was imported from India.

Minnesota case: In late May 2021, a 53-year-old man was rushed to a Minnesota emergency room after family members found him weak and in an altered mental state. The man had a history of medical issues, including a dependence on alcohol and tobacco. He, too, had not traveled internationally. An MRI of his brain showed his condition was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. The neurological disease is often characterized by confusion, an inability to coordinate voluntary movement and eye abnormalities. He was admitted to a hospital for treatment of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The man experienced hip pain while in the hospital, and additional MRI images showed some degeneration changes.

After 6 days in the hospital, he was discharged to a transitional care facility. But on 6 Jun 2021, just 8 days after his initial emergency room visit, the man was moved back to the ER with a 104 deg F fever and deteriorating mental state. His oxygen saturation had fallen to 90%. He was given medication after chest scans showed evidence of pneumonia. Those meds were later switched to meropenem after he developed a new rash. The man's fever waned, and he was weaned off oxygen. The fever returned and the pain in his right hip worsened. An MRI showed acute inflammation, including myositis -- a rare disease characterized by inflamed muscles that can cause muscle fatigue and weakness -- a possibly septic hip and inflammation in his right pelvic bone.

As in other cases, he had positive blood cultures initially misidentified. The _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ was later identified on blood cultures and from a sample of his right hip joint. The patient was discharged to a transitional care facility on 23 Jun 2021. He completed 8 weeks of intravenous drugs and was given a schedule for eradication therapy. But even after discharge, he remained confused, researchers said, and showed evidence of osteonecrosis of the infected hip joint.

Melioidosis was detected in all 4 patients, who each fell severely ill and who hadn't traveled to places where melioidosis was endemic. However, melioidosis might not have been initially considered because the 4 had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. Additionally, initial tests didn't uncover a _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection. Furthermore, the patients in Kansas, Texas and Georgia all received glucocorticoid therapy prior to being diagnosed with melioidosis, which could have contributed to the severity of disease, researchers said.

The Georgia boy's coronavirus infection also likely contributed to the severity of his illness. In a previous case, the CDC found that the coronavirus may have reactivated a previous fatal coinfection of COVID-19 and melioidosis in which the SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have reactivated a latent _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection.

In discussing the 4 cases, the researchers highlighted the risks associated with exposure to imported products from areas where the bacterium is endemic. "Healthcare providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas," the study said. "In addition, patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis."

In 2020, ProMED posted on a report of what was likely locally acquired melioidosis in Texas from 2018 (Cossaboom CM, Marinova-Petkova A, Strysko J, et al. Melioidosis in a resident of Texas with no recent travel history, United States. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(6): 1295-9; https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2606.190975). It is not clear where in Texas this more recent case was thought to be acquired.

Although a classical infection in eastern Asia and northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, the Caribbean basin, Central America, and South America, particularly Brazil and North America. This 2016 article (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al. Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016; 1: 15008; http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158.pdf) for 2015 estimates the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:

Area / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands
South Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42
East Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31
Sub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15
Latin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1
Middle East and North Africa / 49 / <1 / <1

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%. A small percentage of cases can occur as reactivations, even decades later, sometimes called the "Vietnamese time bomb."

Along with a case acquired in the USA from tropical fish imported from South Asia (Melioidosis - USA (03): (MD) non-travel, 2019, freshwater aquarium source 20211001.8698818), 2021 was a surprising year for this disease in the USA. It is not clear what the mechanism of contamination of this product was and where along the manufacturing chain it occurred. Like with other uncommon infections, identification can be more difficult. - Mod.LL
