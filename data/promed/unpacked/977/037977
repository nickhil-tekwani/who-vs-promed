Shrimp farmers in coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta are suffering
unprecedented losses due to a disease that has infected tiger shrimp
in 40 000 hectares of farm area. Pham Hoang Giang, head of the Bac
Lieu Aquaculture Department, said microsporidiosis was the main cause
of the losses.

Right now there is no specific remedy for the disease and farmers can
only prevent it by testing the breeding shrimp to make sure they are
disease-free before raising them, he said.

More than 11 000 hectares of shrimp farms in Bac Lieu have been
destroyed, Luong Ngoc Lan, head of the provincial Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development, said.

In Tra Vinh, about 330 million shrimp in 6200 hectares of farm area
all over the province have died, causing a loss of over VND12 billion
(USD 600 000).

In Soc Trang, 20 000 out of 25 000 hectares of shrimp farms have been
destroyed, causing VND1.5 trillion (USD 75 million) in losses.

One farmer, residing in Lieu Tu Commune, Tran De District of Soc
Trang, said he had invested VND50 million (USD 2500) in 3 hectares of
farming area for tiger shrimp, only to have all his shrimp die after 2
weeks.

Another farmer, from My Xuyen District, said his shrimp have died
under strange circumstances. "The shrimp all killed themselves by
crashing into the pond bank," he said.

Most of the shrimp have died at the age of 20 to 30 days, causing
great financial stress to farmers who invested in the improvement of
ponds, shrimp breeding and food.

An experienced shrimp farmer in Bac Lieu said each hectare of dead
shrimp would cause a loss of VND40 million (USD 2000).

The Soc Trang People's Committee is expected to set aside VND20
billion (USD 1 million) to help the farmers continue their farming.

The provincial committee has also asked the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development for more support for shrimp farmers.

[Microsporidiosis is a parasitic disease also known as cotton shrimp
disease. It most often tends to affect 40-50 day old shrimp. The
shrimp tend to take on a white or cottony type of appearance due to
the parasite. The parasite generally affects the striated muscles
causing them to become opague, hence the white color, as the parasite
grows in clumpy patches.

While this disease does not affect the human consumer it does seem to
impart a negative flavor. Shrimp affected with it are generally deemed
as unsalable because of the bad flavor. - Mod.TG]
