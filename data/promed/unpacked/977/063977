Viet Nam: 14th avian influenza outbreak death; 2 new suspected cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese sources state that a 27 year old man has died from avian
influenza, bringing to 19 the number of deaths from the illness sweeping
Asian poultry. The man is the 14th fatality in Viet Nam, and is believed to
have caught the disease at his family's chicken farm. The latest man to die
from the illness came from Vietnam's southern Binh Phuoc province. All
confirmed human infections and deaths from the H5N1 bird flu have been
registered in Viet Nam and Thailand. [Combining these figures with those in
the WHO update below, in total there have been 23 confirmed cases in
Thailand and Viet Nam, 19 of whom have died. - Mod.CP]
The virus has so far only jumped from poultry to humans, and one possible
case of human-to-human transmission has now been proved a false alarm [This
statement is premature in view of the correction posted in the WHO update
below. - Mod.CP]. Health experts are worried that if the virus mixes with a
regular human influenza strain, it might create a mutant form that was able
to pass between humans, triggering a human flu pandemic.
Health officials have also reported a new [suspected] infection in Viet Nam
-- a 23 year old man from central Lam Dong province is in hospital in Ho
Chi Minh City in a stable condition.
In other developments:
Experts are waiting for test results from a Cambodian woman who died in a
Vietnamese hospital -- if she is confirmed to have had the disease, she
would be the first victim from Cambodia.
Malaysia is still free of bird flu after a suspected case in a bird shop
owner in Kelantan state near the Thai border proved to be a false alarm.
Tens of millions of chickens and ducks have already been slaughtered across
South East Asia as the outbreak also hit Viet Nam, China, South Korea,
Cambodia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Laos, and Japan.

Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus - WHO update 20
----------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Viet Nam
-----------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed an additional 3 cases of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection in Viet Nam. All 3 cases were admitted to hospital
in Ho Chi Minh City. The newly confirmed cases are a 6 year old child, who
died on 3 Feb 2004, a 24 year old man, who also died on 3 Feb, and a 23
year old man who remains in hospital. Altogether, Viet Nam has reported 18
laboratory-confirmed cases, 13 of which were fatal.
Overview of the global situation: public health concerns
--------------------------------------------------------
The outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in poultry,
currently reported in 8 Asian countries, are historically unprecedented in
their scale, geographical spread, and economic consequences for the
agricultural sector. The risk is great that the H5N1 strain has become
endemic in poultry populations of this geographical area. Infection in
birds could spread to distant regions. To date, human cases have been
reported in only 2 countries, Viet Nam and Thailand, with very widespread
outbreaks in poultry. It can be anticipated that human cases will also be
detected in other countries where outbreaks in poultry are spreading.
Evidence to date suggests that the H5N1 strain is not easily transmitted
from poultry to humans. Influenza viruses are genetically unstable and
their behaviour cannot be predicted. The present situation could change
very quickly.
When a disease which affects an economically important sector of
agriculture also poses a risk to human health, the risk to humans ­-
however unpredictable -­ must not be minimized in the interest of
maintaining consumer confidence. Measures aimed at eliminating the disease
in poultry also reduce opportunities for human exposures and infections.
These measures must be carried out urgently, giving highest priority to the
protection of human health.
Correction
----------
On Fri 6 Feb 2004 [see Avian influenza, human - East Asia (17)
20040208.0449], WHO reported the results from genetic sequencing of H5N1
viruses taken from 2 sisters in a family cluster in Viet Nam. The
sequencing announced on Friday by WHO showed that the 2 viruses were both
entirely of avian origin with no human genes, indicating the viruses had
not become adapted to be easily transmitted from one human to another.
Today, WHO has learned that the virus from only one sister has been
sequenced, not both sisters. The 2nd virus sequenced and reported was from
another case in Viet Nam.
The virus from the second sister is being sequenced this week.

[Taking these two reports together the revised data as of 9 Feb 2004 for
confirmed human cases and fatalities in Thailand and Viet Nam is the following:
Country / confirmed cases / deaths
Thailand / 5 / 5
Viet Nam / 18 / 14
Total / 23 / 19
Several newswire reports dated 9 Feb 2004 are still stating erroneously
that viruses from both sisters in the family cluster of fatal cases in Viet
Nam have been sequenced. The conclusion that there is no evidence of
human-to-human transmission cannot be sustained on the basis of sequence
data until the result from the second sister becomes available. - Mod.CP]
