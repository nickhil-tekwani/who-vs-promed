[1] Cholera, earthquake affected area - Pakistan (Kashmir)
Date: Wed, 9 Nov 2005
From: Alfonso Rodriguez <ajrm_msds@yahoo.es>

Hundreds of earthquake victims in Pakistani Kashmir have acute
diarrhea, and doctors are investigating whether they are cases of
cholera, the WHO and the UN warned.
Aid workers are urgently trying to improve water supplies and
sanitation at the cramped refugee camps where the survivors fell sick
in the devastated regional capital Muzaffarabad, WHO technical
officer Rachel Lavy told AFP.
"In one camp we visited yesterday, 8 Nov 2005, there were 55 cases of
diarrhea and there are so many spontaneous camps that we believe
there are hundreds of others," Lavy said as she headed to one of the
camps.
"Acute watery diarrhea fits very closely with the definition of
cholera. That is one of the things it can be," Lavy said, adding
however that there were other waterborne diseases that could cause
similar types of diarrhea. "We are treating it as suspicious but we
don't have laboratory guidance at this stage," she said Wed, 9 Nov
2005.
The UN has repeatedly warned it is racing against time and a shortage
of international aid cash to prevent a possible second wave of deaths
from disease, cold, and hunger after the 8 Oct 2005 disaster.
"The WHO is saying that even if the laboratory diagnosis is not
confirmed, these cases should be taken as seriously as if they were
cholera," said UN spokeswoman Amanda Pitt.
She said a small number of acute diarrhea patients had been reported
from other towns in the quake zone in recent weeks and that outbreaks
of disease were "not unexpected."
More than 7000 cases of diarrhea -- not all of them acute -- and 8000
cases of respiratory disease had been reported in the quake zone, top
Pakistani health ministry official Anwar Mahmood told AFP.
Lavy said that curbing the spread of illness was especially difficult
in the densely populated tent camps that have sprung up in
Muzaffarabad.
"The spontaneous camps are not set up by the government and are not
organized, so inevitably water and sanitation are not good," she
said. "Now we are going to visit as many of the camps as we can."

[2] Cholera - India (Tamil Nadu)
Date: Mon, 7 Nov 2005
From: T Jacob John <vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>

India's southeastern coastal city of Chennai received heavy rains in
the last week of Oct 2005 and the first days of Nov 2005 from the
North East Monsoon. Several low-lying areas, especially in the
northern part of the city, are flooded, and relief and medical help
operations are under full swing. According to newspaper report
(Malayala Manorama, Chennai edition, 6 Nov 2005), the city
corporation has confirmed cholera in 11 of the nearly 200 persons
hospitalized with diarrhea in the main city hospital for infectious
diseases at Thondiarpet.
In India, the term cholera is applied only after microbiological
confirmation. Otherwise clinical cholera-like disease is called
gastroenteritis. _Vibrio cholerae_ is an aquatic microbe, usually
resident in plankton. In human intestines it replicates prolifically
and is discharged via feces. Floodwaters distribute it widely. The
risk of cholera is well recognized in flooded areas, but the
pre-requisite is the local environmental or endemic presence of the
microbe. This condition occurs in many parts of India and elsewhere.
In spite of floods that lasted weeks after Cyclone Katrina, there was
no cholera in the New Orleans area because of the absence of the
microbe in that location.

The month-old cholera epidemic in Sao Tome has claimed 9 lives and
struck nearly 300 people, a health official from the West African
archipelago said Tue, 8 Nov 2005.
According to reports, coordinator of the epidemic's emergency team
Manuel Carvalho said 126 new cholera cases and 5 deaths from the
disease had been registered during the past 8 days, raising totals to
292 cases and 9 fatalities.
Carvalho said all districts of Sao Tome Island are affected, but the
outlying island of Principe remains untouched. Authorities have urged
the islanders to avoid using untreated water and uncooked foods and
to destroy garbage and trash.
An earlier epidemic in April affected about 200 people and took 3
lives in the country.

Mozambique's cholera epidemic has claimed 4 more lives recently in
the central province of Sofala, and has spread to the locality of
Mbongola in the district of Buzi, where 2 new cases were diagnosed in
the last few days, the daily Noticias newspaper reported Wed, 9 Nov
2005.
A report presented on Tue, 8 Nov 2005, during the opening of a
Consultative Council of the Health Ministry in the city of Beira,
said that 4 more people died, bringing to 15 the number of deaths,
out of 820 cases notified in the province since the outbreak of the
disease in January 2005.
Beira alone has reported 150 cholera cases, but no deaths. Here, the
Nova-Praia suburb is the most affected due to poor sanitation
conditions, with very few of the 500 resident families having
latrines. Beira and Buzi are the only 2 regions still reporting
cholera cases, and Sofala provincial Health director Alberto Baptista
urged the participants to the meeting to redouble their efforts to
make sure that the disease is contained.
The health authorities, particularly worried because of the poor
sanitation conditions in most places where cholera cases were
reported, are renewing calls for preventive measures, with particular
attention to the consumption of fruits such as mangoes, which should
always be washed before they are eaten.

The region's Medical Officer of Health, Jonathan Jarman, says 25
people suffering cramps and diarrhea have been diagnosed with
shigellosis. He says there were would normally only be 2 or 3 cases a
year. Dr Jarman says it seems the bacteria came from shellfish that
was harvested from beds contaminated with human waste.
He says all of the people they have spoken to ate raw oysters from
the Opua marina in the Bay of Islands.

[7] Cholera - Guam

Public Health officials announced the confirmation of cholera, a
disease contracted by drinking water containing fecal matter or
eating contaminated food, on Guam. While one case has been confirmed,
healthcare experts have launched an investigation but believe an
outbreak isn't likely.
Test results from diagnostic laboratory services in Hawaii confirm
Guam has a single case at this time. Public Health epidemiologist Dr.
Robert Haddock says a male adult patient treated for diarrhea at the
Guam Memorial Hospital earlier this week was confirmed to have the
disease. Tests were also conducted on 2 other patients with suspected
cholera. "They live in the same general area; they are not related,
but we're looking into the possibility that they may have had some
social contact between the different households," affirmed Haddock.
The patient with the disease lives with relatives who recently
returned from Chuuk. Dr. Haddock says the confirmation has prompted
officials to conduct an investigation with the Guam Environmental
Protection Agency, and Public Health's Environmental Health Division
and nurses. The focus will be to look into the problem and determine
how the cases spread. Continued Haddock, "We believe the present
problem is due to specific sanitation problems in one general area;
we don't believe there's much likelihood it will spread outside of
that area."
The Public Health epidemiologist says because Guam has an adequate
water supply, it's not likely that the island's water system would be
the source of any contamination. For now, he warns residents to take
precaution. "We would caution people as usual to avoid eating
uncooked or raw seafood, particularly if it's caught in the
near-shore areas; that's been a problem in the past," said the
physician.
According to Public Health's Office of Epidemiology and Research
[regarding] the disease outbreaks on the island, the last time there
was a confirmed case of cholera was 5 years ago. Back in 2000, Guam
had one confirmed case from Pohnpei, and 3 additional cases were
contracted on island in association with individuals who ate fish
imported from Pohnpei. Dr. Haddock confirms there have also been more
reported cases of parasitic worms that are contracted [in the same
way as] cholera. "Some of the doctors believe that we've had more
cases this year than previously," he told KUAM News.
While officials await the test results of the suspected cases, which
are expected sometime next week, Dr. Haddock says local physicians
have been advised to stay alert. "We've alerted the physicians to be
on the lookout for possible other cases. We don't expect there to be
any cases at the community at large, but we want them to be alert to
that possibility. At this time we don't believe that it's a threat to
the community at large, it's just a localized problem."
