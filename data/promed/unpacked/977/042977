France on Friday reported its fifth case of mad cow disease (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) this year amid concerns its cattle may
still be at risk of acquiring the deadly brain-wasting disorder. The Farm
Ministry said in a statement the new case involved a dairy cow born in 1994
in the Loire region of central France. It and the 41 other cows in the herd
were destroyed.
France has reported at least 82 cases of BSE since health authorities began
tracking it. Last year, the country reported 31 cases. The ministry said
the diseased animal was most likely infected by consuming feed not intended
for cattle.
France plans to set up a screening program soon to check cattle ready for
slaughter are not infected with BSE. French officials were on the defensive
earlier this week after the EU Commission said a veterinary mission in June
1999 found traces of meat and bone meal in cattle feed in France despite a
ban on such use of animal proteins to prevent the transmission of BSE.
French Farm Minister Jean Glavany blamed the report's findings on cheating
in the farm industry, and said he could not fully exclude the possibility
French cattle were still eating feed made with banned substances. The EU
report was published a month after the European Commission took France to
court over its refusal to lift a ban on British beef amid fears it may
still pose a risk to humans from mad cow disease. BSE has been linked to a
form of the human Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease that has so far killed at least
48 people.
