Number of cases of botulism in Kyrgyzstan from canned food
-----------------------------------------------
On 15 Dec 2005, 5 people were affected by botulism in the Japalak village
of Osh city. Among them there were 3 children who were seriously affected,
aged 10, 11 and 12 years old. The cause of infection was contaminated food
products: home made canned salads.
On 3 Dec 2005 in the Karasuy district, Osh region, one man was identified
with botulism. The cause of the intoxication is still not identified;
hypothetically, it could be canned food. 11 contact people were
investigated. 2 more cases of botulism were identified in the district on 2
Dec 2005. One of them died, a 2-year-old child. The cause was vegetable
salad that was domestically canned.
For the last 11 months of 2005, there were 21 cases of botulism in
Kyrgyzstan. Most of the cases, 9 out of the 21, happened in Bishkek, one of
them with a lethal outcome. In the Chuysk region, there were 8 cases with
one fatality. All cases were associated with domestically prepared food:
canned vegetables.
