Following the new ASF outbreaks in Sichuan (China's leading pig producer) and Shanghai, and the further spread of the disease in several previously infected provinces the summarised situation of reported outbreak, as of 21 Nov 2018, is the following:
ASF was detected in a total of 77 villages/sites in 19 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities out of China's total of 34:
Liaoning (n=25), Anhui (n=9), Hunan (n=6), Inner Mongolia (n=4), Jilin (n=4, of which one in a wild boar), Shanxi (n=3), Yunnan (n=4), Jiangsu (n=2), Guizhou (n=2), Heilongjiang (n=3), Hubei (n=3), Henan (n=2), Jiangxi (n=2), Sichuan (n=2), Zhejiang (n=2), Chongqing (n=1), Fujian (n=1), Shanghai (n=1), and Tianjin (n=1). OIE's updated interactive map showing all outbreaks in domestic pigs is available at https://tinyurl.com/yctt3gux (the ASF case in a wild boar in Jilin is expected to be included in the map when officially reported to the OIE).

China's government has, reportedly, issued new rules to tighten notification of cases of ASF, including incentives for whistleblowers, amid concerns that outbreaks of the disease are being under reported; see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever/china-cracks-down-on-african-swine-fever-reporting-idUSKCN1NQ09P. (Thanks to ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall for this source).

FAO issued a warning on the risk of ASF spread from China to other Asian countries, and urged, earlier in 2018, before the 1st reported case in China, regional collaboration including stronger monitoring and preparedness measures; see http://www.fao.org/3/i8805en/I8805EN.pdf.

The recent finding of ASF in a wild boar in Jilin, on North Korea's border, is very worrisome; the spread of the virus may be accelerated within and beyond China, due the uncontrolled movement of these animals.

Recently, results of the genotyping of the Chinese ASF virus strain have been published (ref 1). The analysis showed that the causative strain belonged to the p72 genotype II and CD2v serogroup 8. The strain had 100 percent p72 sequence identity with several strains from eastern Europe and Africa, such as Bel13/Grodno, Voronezh 2016, Mal 2011/01, and ZIM/2015/01.

In view of the recent developments, particularly in China and in Europe, the FAO is working to the coordination of an ASF Global Action Planning.
