Autochthonous _Plasmodium vivax_ reported from Spain
----------------------------------------------------
It is the 1st autochthonous [indigenous case] of malaria that has
occurred in Spain since 1961 and poses no risk to the public. The
patient, diagnosed in September [2010] in the province of Huesca,
contracted the disease by the bite of a mosquito _Anopheles
atroparvus_ which carried the parasite. Health authorities stressed
that it is an "epidemiological curiosity."

The case was detected in late September in a patient who had a fever
and discomfort but did not respond to the usual treatments. The
samples were sent to the Madrid Institute of Health, Carlos III, who
confirmed the diagnosis of malaria on 1 Oct 2010. The patient
received therapy and recovered without any problems.

Although the infection was in Spain, since the patient had not
travelled abroad, we are treating it "as an isolated case and also
low-risk" said from the Ministry of Health in Aragon. "It's an
epidemiological curiosity that does not pose a risk to the
population. "An anecdote rather than a threat," explained Francisco
Javier Falo, director of Public Health in Aragon, to El Mundo.

The results indicated that the parasite responsible for infection was
_Plasmodium vivax_, which produces a mild form of the disease. The
transmitter, officials said, would be the mosquito _Anopheles
Atroparvus_, one of the most important species in Mediterranean countries.

Malaria is not a rare disease in our country and each year there are
about 500 cases. All of which were people who have contracted the
infection while traveling abroad and have 'imported' it. The
infections produced by a native mosquito have not been recorded since
1961 and was malaria officially declared eradicated in 1964. "The
vector [_A. atroparvus_] is present generally all over Spain," said
Francisco Javier Phallus.

A few months ago, a report of the European project EDEN (Emerging
Diseases in a changing European Environment) confirmed the high
presence of the vector in the Ebro delta area but stated that the
risk of recurrence of malaria in Spain is very low, given the
effectiveness of the health system.

[Isolated cases of autochthonous malaria have been reported from
Greece, France (Corsica), Italy, Russia (Moscow), Virginia, New York
and Florida (US) (see below). These cases probably reflect local
transmission from asymptomatic gametocyte carriers infected in a
_P.vivax_ endemic area and -- as stated in the posting above -- does
not mean that malaria transmissions from a local reservoir exist. - Mod.EP]
