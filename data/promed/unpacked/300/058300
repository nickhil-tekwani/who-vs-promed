Avian influenza - situation in Asia: altered role of domestic ducks
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Countries experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry need to be aware
that domestic ducks may have acquired an important role in the
transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 to other poultry and,
possibly, to humans as well.
A new laboratory study [see commentary] of domestic ducks infected
with several 2004 H5N1 viruses shows that, when compared with
infections caused by viruses from 2003, domestic ducks are shedding
more virus for longer periods. The majority are doing so without
showing symptoms of illness.
Findings from this study also show that, compared to highly
pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] viruses from previous outbreaks, the
recent H5N1 viruses survive several days longer in the environment.
The study found that the quantities of virus excreted by
healthy-looking ducks approach those excreted by diseased -- and
visibly very ill -- chickens. This suggests that domestic ducks might
now be acting as a "silent" reservoir for the H5N1 virus, which is
highly pathogenic for chickens.
To date, no evidence has linked human H5N1 cases to exposure to
asymptomatic domestic ducks. However, the laboratory findings come at
a time when some human cases could not be traced to contact with
diseased or dead poultry.
In terms of preventing further human cases, it is of public health
concern that ducks may be infected and shed virus for long periods,
yet issue no "warning signal" in the form of visible signs and
symptoms that alert people to take precautions. The concern is
greatest in rural areas of affected countries, where free-ranging
ducks and chickens often mingle, frequently sharing the same water
supplies.
The new findings expand on recent evidence, based on characterization
of H5N1 viruses from southern China, that domestic ducks have played
a central role in generating and maintaining H5N1, in its highly
pathogenic form, in parts of Asia. [Li KS, Wang J, Smith GJD et al.
Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1
influenza virus in eastern Asia. Nature; 430 (8 July 2004): 209-13].
Findings pointing to an altered role for domestic ducks join other
recent evidence that the H5N1 virus circulating in parts of Asia has
increased its pathogenicity in chickens and mice (a laboratory model
for mammals), and has expanded its host range to include mammals,
such as felines, not previously considered susceptible to infection.
[In view of the said findings, the following] public health
recommendations for affected countries [should be applied]:
- Investigation of human cases should now include possible exposure
to apparently healthy domestic ducks, as well as to diseased or dead
poultry, as a risk factor for infection.
- Advice for people living in an affected area should be revised to
include precautions for apparently healthy ducks similar to those for
visibly ill poultry.
- Ducks should not be kept as pets or allowed to enter households.
- Water supplies for human use should not be drawn from open ponds
used by domestic ducks and should be stored in ways that prevent
contact with ducks.
- Once prepared and properly cooked, duck meat and eggs do not pose a
risk to human health.
- Significant exposure can occur during home slaughtering and
preparation prior to cooking, and these risks need to be addressed.

WHO, FAO, and OIE recognize that the altered role of domestic ducks
in the transmission cycle of H5N1 should be addressed, as it may
complicate efforts to control the disease in poultry and to prevent
further human cases.
Research on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in ducks in Asia
is urgently needed. Such information will allow a focused approach to
the prevention of human cases arising from exposure to apparently
healthy domestic ducks.
The wider implications of the role played by domestic ducks are being
jointly considered by FAO and OIE in formulating a long-term strategy
for bringing the current outbreaks in poultry under control. With the
H5N1 virus now endemic in parts of Asia, significant changes in
farming practices may be needed to control the disease, especially in
rural areas, and thus reduce opportunities for community-wide
exposure.
In animals, surveillance remains the key to prevention and control,
and this activity needs to be adequately supported.
FAO and OIE have recently issued comprehensive guidelines for
responding to the outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia.
[See 20040927.2672 and
<http://www.oie.int/eng/AVIAN_INFLUENZA/FAO%20recommendations%20on%20HPAI.pdf>].
The 2 agencies are conducting research on the epidemiology of H5N1
infection in ducks and on the use of vaccination to control infection.

[According to the CSR notification, the laboratory studies mentioned
were completed last week [3rd week of October 2004] by researchers at
the WHO collaborating center for animal influenza viruses at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The main
findings are being made public by the WHO, in advance of publication,
because of their significance for human health.
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/labstudy_2004_10_29/en/>
The findings, and the subsequent WHO recommendations, might have
impact upon the internationally prescribed measures to control HPAI.
If (apparently) "healthy" ducks are present in the vicinity of
affected poultry farms, the stamping out of the latter might not be
sufficient to eradicate the outbreak. This new situation might
prescribe a need to reassess existing provisions, as laid out in
chapter 2.7.12 of OIE's terrestrial animal health code
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.7.12.htm>
It might also explain the recurrence of the disease in countries like
Thailand, where stamping-out policy without vaccination has been
applied. - Mod.AS]
