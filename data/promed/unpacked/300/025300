One of the concerns we have here during the Christmas holiday season is the
number of live animal Christmas manger scenes created by various groups.
These are usually unlicensed and often allow direct interaction between the
families/children and the animals. Does anyone ask about this type
of potential exposure when investigating cases at this time of year?
