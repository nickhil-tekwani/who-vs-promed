China: 14th bird flu fatality confirmed
-------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry has confirmed China's 14th human fatality from
bird flu; a 62-year-old man who died last month [July 2006]. The
patient, a farmer, was from Jimsar county in the northwest region of
Xinjiang, the Ministry said in a statement on its website on Monday
[14 Aug 2006]. It said the man fell ill on 19 Jun 2006 and died on 12
Jul 2006 and that initial laboratory tests aimed at checking whether
he had succumbed to the H5N1 avian flu virus had been inconclusive.
For one month before falling ill, the man did not have close contact
with any human cases of bird flu, and there was no evidence he had
been near sick or dead poultry, the Ministry said. "There was no
confirmed link to poultry, but that doesn't mean there wasn't any
contact," said Roy Wadia, a Beijing-based spokesman for the World
Health Organization. "Most of the cases on the Chinese mainland have
not had any confirmed link to poultry," he said.
The county the patient was from is 150 km (94 miles) east of the
Xinjiang capital Urumqi. "There have been outbreaks in Xinjiang close
to Urumqi in the last couple of years, so the area is not new to
poultry outbreaks," said Wadia. He declined to speculate on whether
the patient was more likely to have caught the virus from
domesticated poultry or migratory birds. "Migratory birds fly across
of much of China, including Xinjiang," he said. "Everything is possible."
People who had been in contact with the deceased patient have been
placed under observation, the Ministry said. He is the 21st human
patient to be confirmed by China's health authorities. The
announcement came shortly after China said its 1st human bird flu
victim was in late 2003, 2 years earlier than previously reported.
While Beijing denied any cover-up, the confirmation of the 2003 case
was believed likely to change the time frame for the current outbreak
of the disease regionally. Up till then, the 1st reported signs in
Asia of the H5N1 virus were poultry deaths in South Korea in late 2003.

China: 21st human case of avian influenza confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health on Monday [14 Aug 2006] confirmed a
man had died from the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. The victim, a 62-year-old farmer, became ill on 19
Jun 2006 and died on 12 Jul 2006. Epidemiological research showed the
man did not have close contact with any human cases of bird flu and
sick or dead poultry in the last month of his life.
The Regional Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention tested
his samples and got negative results 14 days after he fell ill, but
the re-test by the national CDC on 16 Jul 2006 indicated he was
H5N1-positive. On 2 Aug 2006, the national CDC tested the rest of his
samples left from previous tests and again got positive results, said
the Ministry. The Ministry confirmed it as a human case of bird flu
by both Chinese and WHO standards and reported the new case to the
World Health Organization. Local health authorities have tightened
prevention and control measures and have found no abnormal symptoms
of the people who had close contact with the farmer. This case brings
China's total human cases of bird flu to 21 and the death toll from
the disease to 14.
An outbreak of bird flu in poultry in Xinjiang's Aksu City was
confirmed on 14 Jul 2006. A total of 3045 chickens were killed by the
disease and another 356 976 were culled when the outbreak was
confirmed, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. It announced on
10 Aug 2006 that the outbreak had been brought under control.
The information office of the Ministry of Health said they could not
link the new human case with outbreaks among poultry in the region.
The source of infection for the new case is still unclear, spokesman
of the Ministry of Health Mao Qun'an told Xinhua.

China: Avian influenza Situation - WHO update 14
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 14 Aug 2006, the Ministry of Health in China has confirmed
the country's 21st case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 62-year-old male farmer from the northwestern
province of Xinjiang. He developed symptoms on 19 Jun and died on 12
Jul 2006. Initial tests on patient specimens produced negative
results. As a precautionary measure, tests were repeated during July
and August 2006 and eventually produced positive results, which were
confirmed today [14 Aug 2006] by the Ministry of Health.
An epidemiological investigation of the case was unable to uncover a
history of exposure to dead or diseased birds. The man had no history
of travel during the month prior to symptom onset. No recent poultry
outbreaks have been reported in the vicinity of the man's home.
Xinjiang Province had not previously reported a human case.
Of the 21 cases confirmed to date in China, 14 have been fatal.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 26
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 14 Aug 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed the country's 57th case of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus.
The case is a 17-year-old male from a remote village in Garut
district, West Java Province. He developed symptoms on 26 Jul 2006
and was referred to hospital on 9 Aug 2006. At the hospital, medical
staff suspected H5N1 infection based on his respiratory symptoms and
a history of exposure to dead poultry. Because of this suspicion,
specimens were collected from the patient and sent for testing.
Results received on 12 Aug 2006 were positive for H5N1 infection. The
patient is presently recovering.
A thorough field investigation found that chicken and duck deaths
occurred in the patient's household and neighborhood during the week
prior to symptom onset. The case reportedly had direct contact with
diseased chickens during the disposal of carcasses.
The investigation also obtained information about a 20-year-old male
who lived in a neighboring household where chickens were also dying.
The man developed symptoms on 26 Jul 2006 and sought care at the
local health center on 5 Aug 2006. He died of respiratory disease on
6 Aug 2006 before arrangements could be made for transfer to hospital
and before samples could be taken for testing. The cause of his
illness and death remain undetermined.
Of the 57 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 44 have been fatal.
