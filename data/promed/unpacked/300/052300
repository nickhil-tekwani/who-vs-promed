Grape disease blights vines in Paphos
-------------------------------------
Grapes in Paphos have been hit by an outbreak of a rapidly spreading
type of mildew that has caused widespread damage to mainly white
grapes in Laona [Plateau]. [The disease] is also known by the common
name of downy mildew.

According to Costas Michael, plant protection officer of Paphos
district, the timing of rainfall throughout May [2009] provided ideal
conditions for the disease to develop and spread. He pointed out that
the district office made announcements in the villages, but they
didn't spray their vines. "Many of these fields are on mountains. It
can be a long way for farmers to bring water to use in the sprays,"
he said. The 1st symptoms appeared on 17 May [2009] in the Laona
villages. He estimates that as much as 80 percent of some producers'
grapes has been destroyed.

Panikos Leonida, the district secretary of the Cyprus Union of
Agriculture said, "The last outbreak was around a decade ago, but the
greatest damage was caused about 50 years ago. They tell me we will
have a problem next year [2010] as well. But this year we will have
produced the smallest amount of grapes in our history."

Many families won't have an income for 2009, but will prune their
vines, which should be healthy for next year. The disease also
affected other areas but luckily these only saw 5 to 30 percent
damage. The minister of the environment and natural resources,
Michalis Polynikis, has visited the stricken area twice, and was
shocked by the devastation to the vines.

Yiannis Kyriakides from Vasilikon winery said that they can't use the
grapes that are diseased. "We can't do anything, it's out of our
hands. It will stop with the heat, but the damage has now been done.
Vine growers are dependent on these grapes, it's their life," he
stressed.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara
viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves, which later become necrotic,
and it can also affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm,
extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or
totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or
mechanical means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant
debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is
an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease
management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications
according to forecasting services, and systemic fungicides are also
available.
