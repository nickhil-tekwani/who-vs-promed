Lithuanian authorities say they have detected the presence of the new coronavirus in mink at a farm in the centre of the country. The positive tests were found in samples of 169 dead minks at the farm in Jonava district, according to Lithuania's State Food and Veterinary Service (SFVS).

One person working at the farm has also tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said.

"The results of the study show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could have been transmitted to tissues by a farm worker," the director of the SFVS, Darius Remeika, said in a statement (https://vmvt.lt/naujienos/lietuvoje-patvirtintas-pirmasiskoronaviruso-atvejis-audiniu-ukyje). "We urge all mink farms in the country to adhere strictly to all biosecurity requirements and to leave the workplace immediately."

According to the SFVS, the employee of the farm fell ill on Monday [23 Nov 2020], and all the employees who came into contact with them are in self-isolation.

The farm was immediately closed on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020], and any removal of animals, feed, or other animal products from the infected holding is prohibited.

A decision was also made to cull 22 infected cages of mink and to safely dispose of the carcasses in an animal by-products processing plant.

Unlike Denmark and Ireland [see comment], Lithuania has made no plans for a mass culling of its 1.6 million population of mink at around 86 breeding farms.

Around 60 000 animals are kept at the Jonava district farm, belonging to the companies UAB Danmink and AB Vilkijos ukis.

SFVS was notified of the increased mortality of the mink on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] and submitted samples for testing to the laboratory of the National Institute for Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment. An additional 22 samples [collected] on Wednesday [25 Nov 2020] have also been confirmed with COVID-19.

Scientists have warned about the risk of a mutation of the virus in mink that could potentially affect the effectiveness of future vaccines against COVID-19. But the SFVS has cited advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which states that the virus found in mink farms does not pose a risk to human health.

[For the decision of the Irish government to discontinue the farming of minks, please refer to a BBC report, published 19 Nov 2020, at https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55002583. According to the report, "3 mink farms in the Republic of Ireland have been told their mink are to be culled to halt a potential spread of a mutated form of coronavirus," since "authorities worry that a mutated form of coronavirus found in mink could potentially hamper the effectiveness of a future vaccine."

The report further said that "Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has said the country's farmed mink population should be culled. In a letter to the Department of Agriculture, Dr Holohan said the presence of farmed minks presents 'an ongoing risk to public health' if the COVID variant found in Denmark was to become 'the dominant strain of the virus.'

He said all mink should be culled 'as a matter of urgency.'

Irish national broadcaster RTE said there are understood to be no immediate plans to carry out the proposed cull, but officials in the Department of Agriculture have informed farm owners in counties Laois, Kerry, and Donegal that it will happen.

There is already a commitment in the Programme for Government to phase out mink farming in Ireland." - Mod.AS]

[2] Poland: 1st reported COVID-19 outbreak in mink
Date: Tue 24 Nov 2020

https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/24/polish-scientists-identify-first-cases-of-covid-19-at-a-mink-farm


Polish scientists have identified the 1st cases of coronavirus in mink at a farm in the north of the country. The Medical University of Gdansk said on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] that 8 animals were found to be infected at a breeding farm in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Scientists had examined throat swabs from 91 farmed mink in total for the presence of coronaviruses.

Poland, a major producer of mink fur, started coronavirus tests among its farmed mink and workers this month [November 2020] after a mutation of the virus was found in Denmark.

The Danish government announced a nationwide cull of more than 15 million mink but later withdrew the order because it had no legal basis for those not contaminated by the virus. Hundreds of Danish farmers and mink breeders drove past the government's offices in Copenhagen to demonstrate against the measure.

Veterinary and sanitary authorities in Poland said last week that 18 coronavirus cases had been identified among mink farmworkers since the start of the pandemic, but that it was unlikely to have been spread by the animals.

"This is the 1st case of confirmed infection of farm animals with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Poland," the Medical University of Gdansk said in a statement (https://gumed.edu.pl/62412.html). "The obtained results indicate the possibility of transmission of the virus from humans to minks. In-depth genetic research is currently underway to determine the probable origin of the virus and to enable comparison with known SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences."

Scientists say the test swabs were subjected to a similar 2-gene test used in human diagnostics.

Various research centres across Europe have been studying for infections of COVID-19 in many animal species, including minks, rabbits, bats, and rodents.

As in Denmark, industry groups are likely to object to the test results over fears Poland could introduce a nationwide cull.

Poland is the world's 3rd-largest fur producer after China and Denmark, according to animal rights groups that are campaigning for an end to breeding animals like mink for fur.

[Poland is one of the world's leading mink-farming countries. Details of previous samplings, the numbers of mink farms in Poland and Lithuania, and the size of their respective mink populations have not been disclosed.

OIE's guidance addressing COVID-19 in animals includes, among other articles, "General country information policy vs the disease." It presents the following requirements applicable to mink-farming countries (of which no official list is currently available) and information requested:

"1. Obligation of reporting the disease in the country/territory
2. Approach of the country in notification / testing. Which are the criteria used by the country to perform tests on animals? Reasons why or the context in which animals were tested?
3. Control and prevention measures: approach to positive animals / preventive and control measures applied by the country
4. Risk communication established in the country
5. Animal population survey:
a. Ongoing animal population surveys in the country
b. Data collection methods
6. Sampling information
a. Sampling strategy
b. Number of samples collected
7. Testing information
a. Details on testing (protocol, primers)
b. Number of animals tested in the country
c. Have full genome sequences been uploaded in public domain? If so, where?"

The full OIE Guidance is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/A_Reporting_SARS-CoV-2_to_the_OIE.pdf.

The outbreaks in Lithuania and Poland are yet to be officially reported to the OIE.

So far, OIE's database does not present a full list of member countries exercising mink (or other fur animals) farming. In view of the potential zoonotic hazard of COVID-19 in minks, considering the above OIE guidance becoming mandatory is warranted.

The Netherlands was the 1st country to apply systematic surveillance in farmed minks shortly after the detection of the 1st human-to-mink infection in North Brabant, late April 2020. Since then, COVID-19 continued its spread in the Dutch farmed mink while closely being monitored and studied, with findings published and shared continuously internationally. Spain experienced its 1st human-to-mink case on 27 Apr 2020 (reported in June 2020). Denmark had its 1st case on 15 Jun 2020; the samples were collected "because the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration had been informed about a person with contact to the farm who tested positive." Only after the publication of Denmark's recent findings and the concerns about mink-to-human infections with mink-mutated virus strains did other countries start their surveillance on mink farms. Such is the case currently in Poland, Lithuania, and France.

It may be asked if these 3 countries (of which 2 presented subclinical infection), as well as all other mink-farming countries that have not applied surveillance and are yet to report their 1st cases in minks, may have undergone unnoticed human-to-mink infections followed by SARS-CoV-2 circulation on farms since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in humans. Notably, in certain, if not most, mink-farming countries, the labour power on mink farms is multinational, of whom some have travelled once or more to their countries of origin. The resulting complex scenarios, with potential public health consequences, warrant internationally coordinated studies. - Mod.AS
