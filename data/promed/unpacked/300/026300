White-tail deer dying in 11 counties
---------------------------------------
The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources is
investigating disease deaths of white-tailed deer in western Kentucky.
The worst outbreak of what is suspected to be hemorrhagic disease is
in McLean County, but is also reported in 10 other counties. Wildlife
Biologist Danny Watson says the disease is carried through the bite
of gnats. He says more than 20 dead deer have been reported in McLean
County and he says weak and emaciated deer are being found in or near
water.
Watson says hemorrhagic disease is caused by a virus, and large
outbreaks occur in Kentucky about every 2 years. Other affected
counties are Breckinridge, Christian, Daviess, Hopkins, Logan,
Muhlenberg, Ohio, Simpson and Webster.
Archery season for deer opens statewide on 1 Sep 2007, and Fish and
Wildlife reports there's no reason to curtail the season. They say
Hemorrhagic disease is not infectious to humans.

Wildlife officials say disease may be causing deer deaths
-------------------------------------------------------------
Kentucky state wildlife officials suspect that a disease is causing
the deaths of numerous white-tailed deer in a portion of western
Kentucky. Tests results are not complete, but officials suspect
hemorrhagic disease carried by biting gnats is responsible. The
disease is not infectious to humans, according to the Kentucky
Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.
The worst outbreak is in McLean County, where more than 20 deer have
been reported dead. The dead or weak deer are often found in or near
water.
"Hemorrhagic disease is caused by a virus. We see large outbreaks
about every 2 years in Kentucky," said Danny Watson, a KDFWR wildlife
biologist.
Other affected counties are Breckinridge, Christian, Daviess,
Hopkins, Logan, Muhlenberg, Ohio, Simpson and Webster. Archery season
for deer opens statewide on 1 Sep 2007.
Tracy Bell, a conservation officer in McLean County, said several
people contacted him in the last 2 weeks to report dead deer. He has
retrieved 2 carcasses, one out of the yard of a home in Daviess
County, the other out of a pond in McLean County. Some of the animals
were sent to a laboratory in Hopkinsville for testing.
Mike Henshaw, regional program coordinator for KDFWR, said the lab
has not isolated a cause for the deaths, but with the lack of rain
and plenty of stagnant water, conditions are ideal for the spread of
gnats.
The last significant outbreak of hemorrhagic disease was 2003,
Henshaw said. But that mainly affected another part of the state,
leaving the herd in his area with little or no immunity, he said.
Local deer populations can be hit hard. A survey of a farm in Webster
County along the Green River found 20 dead deer, Henshaw said. Last
Friday [10 Aug 2007], Bell saw 5 deer carcasses in the water along a
stretch of the river, he said. Bell counted 3 more dead deer in the
river near Central City on Sunday [12 Aug 2007].

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is not uncommon in many states.
EHD is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild
ruminants. This malady, characterized by extensive hemorrhages, has
been responsible for significant epizootics in deer in the northern
United States and southern Canada. A similar hemorrhagic disease
called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2 diseases are
antigenically different, although there are similar clinical signs.
The 1st occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in
1955, when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_) succumbed in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was
considered a new disease of deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic
disease" was suggested to describe its main clinical and pathological
features.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily
among white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O.
hemionus_) and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have also
succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_
biting fly or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly
incriminated vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer (as in Michigan, New
Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single epizootics that do not
recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as experienced in
South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the disease
appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October)
and have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer
develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A consistent
characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially
lose their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, develop rapid pulse and respiration, and
finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the
blood result in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name
"bluetongue." Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of
observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become
prostrate, and die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by
extensive hemorrhage, ranging from pinpoint to massive in size, and
involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs
appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved
being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract.
Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the
blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel
walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant
effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers
drastically. Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild
ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals but rarely
causes disease. Presently there is no evidence that the virus crosses
into humans.
