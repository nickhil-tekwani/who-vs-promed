As many as 872 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were reported in Bihar in the year 2019. Of 872 reported cases, 176 died of the disease, said [minister of] State Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a reply to a question in Lok Sabha.

Japanese encephalitis [JE] also claimed one life in Bihar; 16 cases of it were reported in the state.

"In a reply to an unstarred question raised by many parliamentarians on the issue of acute encephalitis syndrome, the government further said that officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) visited Muzaffarpur, Bihar, for investigating the outbreak, in June 2019," said an ANI report.

Choubey, replying to the question of "whether [a] study [was] carried out by the government on aspects of acute encephalitis syndrome and Japanese encephalitis," said limited numbers of serum and litchi samples were tested for methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG) toxin. At least half were found MCPG positive.

ICMR and non-ICMR institutes tested around 90 samples for infectious agents. Few samples were found positive for dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis. However, the majority of the samples tested negative for non-infectious etiology. [Infectious etiology? - Mod.TY]

Choubey mentioned that the state and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have taken measures to control the outbreak and have reviewed the situation in Bihar.

Recently, the government told the Supreme Court that a 100-bed paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) would be set up at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur within one year.

After the deadly outbreak, 5 virology labs had been set up in different districts of Bihar, and 10-bedded pediatric ICUs will also be established in different districts. The government stressed that health is a state subject, and all possible help has been provided to Bihar to curb the outbreak.

Bihar has been battling the vector-borne disease. Children, mostly from poor rural families, died in the month of June [2019]. The disease has afflicted Bihar for more than 2 decades.

The outbreak exposed the poor healthcare services in the state and the condition of government-run hospitals that lacked major facilities and the capacity to handle a major outbreak. Families of deceased children have blamed the poor condition of hospitals and lack of modern services for the death toll to swell.

[As is often the situation, JE cases are a minority proportion of all encephalitis cases. Lychee fruit consumption has been implicated in the current outbreak of AES cases, and this report mentions that at least half of a small number of serum and lychee samples were positive for lychee (MCPG) toxin. But the numbers of serum and lychee samples tested and of positives of each is not stated. There must be a significant concern about viruses as etiological agents causing encephalitis cases or there would not be plans to establish 5 virus diagnostic laboratories in the affected area.

As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. The above report states that "few samples were found positive for dengue," but does that mean that some were, and if so, how many? Nor does the above report indicate if scrub typhus was included in the tests done.

Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY

As many as 7 patients in Arunachal Pradesh have been detected with Japanese encephalitis (JE), Health Department sources informed on Friday [12 Jul 2019]. While 5 cases have been detected in East Siang district alone, one patient each from Upper Subansiri and Papum Pare districts have also tested positive with JE, state epidemiologist Dr Lobsang Jampa informed.

The 5 cases -- 4 adult males and a 15-year-old female patient -- have been identified with JE at Pasighat, the headquarters of East Siang district, as per available reports with the medical authorities here, while a 2.5-year-old girl was admitted with JE at Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (TRIHMS) at Naharlagun near here.

The girl hails from Dumporijo in Upper Subansiri district, Dr Jampa informed, adding that another case of JE was also reported from Heema Hospital here, who had been referred to GNRC Hospital at Guwahati in neighbouring Assam.

"The 57-year-old person is from the Chandranagar area in the state capital," Dr Jampa disclosed.

He, however, added that the cases of JE in the state may rise as reports from vulnerable districts like Tirap, Changlang, Longding, Namsai, and Lohit were not available with the health authorities here.

"The state government has issued an advisory to all the districts to contain the spread of the disease and has instructed [them] to take adequate measures like fogging and focal insecticide spray to stop further spreading of the disease," he informed.

Dr Jampa added that the disease is prone to the areas where people rear pigs, ducks, swans, heron, and egrets. Encephalitis is transmitted through the bite of infected _Culex_ mosquitoes, and the JE virus is harboured in pigs and other domestic animals.

[Arunachal Pradesh state adjoins Assam state, so the occurrence of Japanese encephalitis cases at this time is not surprising. JE cases have been reported in that state before. Although pigs can serve as amplifying hosts, the virus reservoirs are wetland-frequenting birds such as herons. Other domestic animals are not epidemiologically important. Vector control is difficult. House fogging is of limited effectiveness. Curiously, no mention is made of vaccination, which is the most effective control measure available. - Mod.TY]
