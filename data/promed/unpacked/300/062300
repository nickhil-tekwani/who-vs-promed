Leprosy cases in Florida are higher than normal, and experts are blaming armadillos. 9 cases have been reported across Florida this year [2015], already nearly matching the state's average of 10 cases per year, according to the Department of Health.

Dr Sunil Joshi, president of the Duval County Medical Society, said each case this year [2015] has involved people who were in direct contact with armadillos. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, armadillos are the only animal to carry leprosy, a bacterial disease that affects the skin and nerves. The disease can be spread through saliva.

The most recent diagnosis for leprosy came in Flagler County 3 weeks ago. Joshi says the occurrences are still very rare, but urged people to stay away from the animal.

[ProMED-mail last reported in 2015 that there were 3 newly diagnosed cases of leprosy in Florida (ProMED-mail post Leprosy - USA: (FL) human, armadillo, transmission, susp 20150303.3203338). The news report above says there are now 9 cases reported in Florida so far this year (2015), compared to the state's average of 10 cases per year and each case this year has involved people who were in direct contact with armadillos.

The WHO reported 168 newly diagnosed cases of leprosy in the USA in 2012 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). Most newly diagnosed cases of leprosy each year in the US occur in foreign-born people. Persons born in Oceania, where leprosy is endemic, had the highest rate of leprosy diagnosis. Only about 30 percent of leprosy diagnoses occur in US-born persons, with an average of 56 cases in US-born persons out of a total of 186 newly diagnosed cases in the United States each year during 2009-2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6343a1.htm?s_cid=mm6343a1_w). The news report above fails to say if any of the 9 newly diagnosed cases of leprosy in Florida were born in countries where leprosy is endemic.

Also, genotyping of _Mycobacterium leprae_ from patients with multibacillary leprosy has found the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in armadillos that were captured in the wild in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and in patients who had never lived outside the USA and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos (1). This genotype had not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region (1).

It would be interesting to learn whether the 9 Florida patients had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions and if genotyping _M. leprae_ from the 9 Florida patients reveals the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ found only in the Western Hemisphere. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.
