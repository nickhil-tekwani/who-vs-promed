Mexican health officials are reporting 3 dozen new cholera cases in Hidalgo state, according to a Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Epidemiological Alert released 1 Oct 2013. The alert specifies that the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Mexico reported 36 new confirmed cases of autochthonous infection with toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa in the state of Hidalgo.

With the additional confirmed cholera cases, the national total is now 46, including 1 death; with 2 of the cases in the Federal District and 44 in the state of Hidalgo. The cases are 24 women and 22 men with ages ranging from 2 to 82 years old.

The Mexico health authorities continue to: strengthen epidemiological activities at the national level; ensure the availability of inputs and quality of care in medical units; implement actions to ensure access to drinking water and basic sanitation at the community level; and monitor and check the chlorine levels.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_.

An estimated 3-5 million cases and over 100 000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe.

Mexico is reporting upwards of 44 cases of cholera now, with one fatality, involving Hidalgo State and Mexico City. The appearance of cholera in Mexico City is deeply concerning from the standpoint of the "tip of the iceberg": we only know of the recognized cases. There are likely others out there.

A couple of points about this:

1. Totally expected to see expansion of the Nepalese cholera from Haiti to the DR [Dominican Republic], to Cuba, and now to Mexico. It is likely to include many other countries in that region before all is said and done.

2. It is likely to spread in Mexico in "fits and starts" due to lack of indigenous immunity, and will cause disruption.

3. It will likely spread along trade and migrant labor routes to the USA and other countries doing business with Mexico.

4. Communities in the US may be caught unaware due to the basic expectation of border communities in Texas serving as "canaries in a coal mine" for the rest of the country. We propose the migrant labor routes penetrate deep into the USA and far from these border communities.

5. Haiti's cholera disaster already has touched the USA via returning humanitarian workers. We have not seen substantial community transmission upon their arrival to the USA.

6. Per point 4 above, the issue is smoldering transmission in Spanish-only speaking migrant labor communities, where we often see public health issues arise and smolder for days, weeks, months, or years without notice by local public health.

7. There is going to be risk of introduction into the US food supply without proper surveillance in place as the situation evolves.

Based on meteorological patterns, we will be concerned about the May/June time frame due to seasonal temperature spike, followed by a seasonal rainfall peak expected in July. We note a seasonal spike of precipitation is expected for October, albeit with suboptimal temperatures. The May-July time frame will be an important period for cholera surveillance in the Hidalgo State/Mexico City region (http://biosurveillance.typepad.com/biosurveillance/2013/10/update-diarrheal-disease-health-climatology-for-hidalgo-state-mexico.html).
