The authorities have suspended elephant safaris at West Bengal's Jaldapara National Park until [Wed 26 Feb 2020] following the death of 5 one-horned rhinoceroses of anthrax since last [Tue 18 Feb 2020] to allow them to carry out a vaccination drive against the infectious bacterial disease. Anthrax primarily impacts herbivores animals and humans can contract the disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.

A forest official, who did not wish to be named, said they have identified a 7 sq km [approx. 2.7 sq mi] area in the park's core zone where the disease has spread. "There are around 13 rhinos in that area. We have started vaccinating all of them. Until [Sat 22 Feb 2020] morning 5 [rhinos] have been vaccinated."

The park, which is spread over around 200 sq km [approx. 77 sq mi] in the foothills of the eastern Himalayas, is known for its one-horned rhinos. It has the highest rhino population --230-- after Assam's Kaziranga National Park. The park also has 78 trained captive elephants, which are used for safaris and patrolling.

The vaccination drive was started after the blood and tissue samples of the dead rhinos tested positive for anthrax. "To date, 5 rhinos have died. We are taking all measures to contain the disease...," said West Bengal's chief wildlife warden, Ravi Kant Sinha.

Officials said tourism would not be affected as the anthrax outbreak is restricted to the park's core area, which is deep inside and far away from the tourist zone. They added there was no need to vaccinate all the rhinos. Officials were using captive elephants to reach the affected area and vaccinate the rhinos from a distance with the help of dart guns. They have also deployed drones to find out if any other animals have died or taken fallen ill.

Chief forest conservator Ujjwal Ghosh said the suspension of elephant safaris will allow them to vaccinate captive elephants against anthrax. "Every day around 4 to 5 elephants, each carrying 4 persons, would take tourists inside the forest at least 3 times daily. This has been stopped until [Wed 26 Feb 2020]...the elephants are being vaccinated against anthrax and would need some rest. We would also need additional elephants for sanitizing the area and to gear up our patrolling," said Ghosh. He added jeep safaris were being allowed inside the park.

Officials said it was too early to say how the disease spread and they were yet to ascertain whether the source was cattle from adjoining villages that often graze inside the park, where rhino deaths were reported in 1993 following another anthrax outbreak. "The local panchayat, animal resources development department and the district administration should join hands to vaccinate cattle in the adjacent villages before the problem takes a serious shape," said Animesh Bose of the Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation, an NGO.

The forest department has ruled out anthrax as the cause of 4 rhino deaths at Jaldapara National Park last week. "We sent viscera samples to Beigachhira and a private lab. The results were negative for anthrax," a senior forester said.

The department has, however, stopped elephant safaris in the park 'until [Thu 27 Feb 2020] to keep a watch on kunki elephants vaccinated over fears of an anthrax outbreak.

"The department needs to identify the disease and take measures at the earliest," said environmentalist Shyama Prasad Pandey of the Society for Protecting Ophiofauna and Animal Rights.

[A confusion of results. The latter report has detail in a respected newspaper, and the former has the authority of a national newspaper. And if it was negative, it was for 4 of 5 rhino which leaves the 5th awaiting clarification. And to diagnose anthrax one only needs blood swabs, not viscera. Long ago in the Canadian Northwest Territories we learned that a blood swab was a reliable sample. If you sent blood and it took more than 3 days to arrive and begin being cultured, it would be negative because of decomposition and acidification of the sample. I am sure there will be further reports clarifying what the truth is. - Mod.MHJ
