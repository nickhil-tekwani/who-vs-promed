Bird flu has hit another district in the Tyumen region [in Russia's official
reports to the OIE, the spelling is Tiumen] in the Urals, the region's chief
veterinarian Sergei Derkach said. 57 infected birds were slaughtered in the
village of Sladkovo, Derkach said, adding that measures were being taken to
stop the spread of the disease.
The first cases of death were reported in the region on 26 Jul 2005.
Quarantine was imposed on 1 Aug 2005 when lab tests conducted in Novosibirsk,
a large Siberian city, confirmed bird flu. About 30 500 infected birds have
been slaughtered in the region so far.
Bird flu was earlier reported in 7 settlements in the region's 3 districts.
Regional authorities have allocated 6.2 million rubles (about USD 218 000) to
curb the spread of the virus.
