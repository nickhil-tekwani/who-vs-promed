The typhoid fever outbreak that hit Zamboanga City has claimed the
life of at least one victim and infected over 47 residents, city
health authorities said Thu 12 Apr 2007.
The Zamboanga Today newspaper reported that city health officer-in
charge Kibtiya Uddin said the 47 include 37 in Campo Islam village
and 10 in Buenagatas village. Uddin did not name the victim, whom she
said was a minor. She added that most of the patients included women
and children from ages one to 30.
Blood, stool, and water samples taken from the patients and the
Zamboanga City Water District water pipes in the affected villages
have already been sent to the Zamboanga City Medical Center for
bacteriology examination.
Uddin said that as of Thu 12 Apr 2007, at least 4 patients admitted
in the hospital tested positive for the salmonella bacterium that
causes typhoid fever. She said the investigating team is looking into
whether bacteria could have seeped into leaking water pipes or
contaminated food.
Residents were advised to boil water before drinking and wash their
hands prior to eating.

The Health Ministry in the Northern Division is concerned by the rise
in the number of diarrhea and typhoid cases after the flooding. There
have been 18 confirmed typhoid cases from the village of Nasaqa,
outside Labasa Town and 10 cases of diarrhea were reported last week
from a boarding school in Nadogo.
Divisional community health general manager Sister Selina Waqa said,
"We are concerned about the number of reports and that is why we have
put more aggressive plans and strategies in place to slow down the
rate to help us handle the situation," Sr Waqa said. "Such plans are
needed, especially with the unfavorable climate we are facing."
A team of health inspectors was sent to the village to carry out
further investigations into a typhoid outbreak in the village.
Sr Waqa said although a high number of cases had been received, the
health ministry was encouraged by the community's positive move in
promptly reporting them to health centers.
