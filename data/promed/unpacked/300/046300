Cendol is a popular dessert in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia.
The main ingredients are ice, coloured syrup, boiled red beans, and strips
of green jelly. It is rather sweet.
Kelantan is a state in Malaysia. Bernama is the Malaysian national news
agency. The Straits Times does have an archive, but articles are left
online for only 1 week.

I have the article (and URL) on the cholera-infected cendol:

'Cholera infected' cendol sold in Kelantan
----------------------------------------------
Cendol sold for the breaking of fast during the Muslim fasting
month has been found to be contaminated with cholera germs in three
districts in Kelantan, health authorities said.
"The Health Department found three of the 43 samples of cendol tested to
contain _Vibrio cholerae_ germs," said the state department's principal
assistant director, Dr Wan Mansor Hamzah.
The contaminated cendol samples were traced back to hawkers in Ramadan
markets in Kuala Krai, Gua Musang and Pasir Mas, he said in a statement
yesterday.
The department had ordered the three hawkers to stop selling cendol until
the authorities were satisfied with their standard of hygiene, he said.
Cendol samples taken from Ramadan markets throughout Kelantan were tested
by the department's food control laboratories to ensure high hygiene in the
preparation.
Despite the discovery of cholera-contaminated cendol from Ramadan markets,
no cholera cases have been reported in Kelantan since last June, he said.
Dr Wan Mansor advised makers of cendol to use boiled water.

[It appears that the dessert does not contain coconut, was not exactly
recalled, & was found to be contaminated only in Kelantan state in Malaysia
& not S.E.Asia in general, as we originally reported. We regret the
misinformation - Mod.JW]
