Second mad cow case found in Japan's Hokkaido
---------------------------------------------
The Japanese government said on Wednesday that it has found the second
confirmed case of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy; BSE)
in Japan through a continuing nationwide inspection of all cows. The second
cow confirmed infected with the disease was found at a meat inspection
center in Hokkaido, north eastern Japan, the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry said.
Japan's first case of BSE was confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries on 22 September. Following the confirmation of the
brain-wasting illness found in Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo, the Health
Ministry began a nationwide screening of all cows for human consumption on
18 October.
BSE is said to be caused by meat and bone meal (MBM), a protein feed made
from the crushed internal organs, skin, and bones of cows. Early this
month, beef prices at Tokyo's central wholesale market had returned to
nearly the same levels as last year after the government declared domestic
beef free of mad cow disease.

A Holstein cow on the island of Hokkaido has contracted mad cow disease
(bovine spongiform encephalopathy), officials said on Wednesday. This, the
second confirmed case in Japan, was one of 728 animals given a routine test
on the island. The Japanese government [has tried to stem fears by stating
that the animal had not been to market.
Japan is the only country in Asia where BSE appears to have spread. The
first case was a 5 year old cow apparently infected from contaminated feed.
Since then, the government gives mandatory inspections prior to market, and
has banned imports of feed made with recycled animal parts and bones.

Health ministry finds second mad cow case in Hokkaido
--------------------------------------------------
The second cow confirmed infected with BSE was a 67 month old female
Holstein cow raised by a farmer in the village of Sarufutsu in northern
Hokkaido, but its place of birth is not known, according to the Hokkaido
government. It was slaughtered on Monday.
The cow was suspected of having the disease in an initial test and then
tested positive in a confirmation test at Obihiro University of Agriculture
and Veterinary Medicine on Wednesday morning, according to the ministry.
The meat, internal organs, and all other parts of the cow have not been
shipped, the health ministry said. The cow will be disposed of after
official confirmation of the results later in the day.
The local government said it has started tracing all the cows shipped by
the Hokkaido farmer who currently has about 70 cows. The cow confirmed to
have the disease was one of 2 cows the farmer took to a processing center
to be slaughtered, but the other cow has tested negative, it added.
The ministry said it has stopped the shipment and the distribution of
around 30 cows slaughtered after the cow confirmed of having the disease
was slaughtered, in addition to all of the farmer's cows.
The health ministry will investigate the contamination route along with the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and other institutions.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters at his official residence,
"It must be understood that the cow in question will not be put on the
market. We must take steps so as not to trigger worries [among the public".
Health minister Chikara Sakaguchi said, "It is extremely regrettable" that
another cow has been found with the disease, but added, "It is good that we
have been conducting strict tests with the determination that we must not
have one single (infected cow) reach the dining table of citizens." He
added: "The problem is what the (cow's) feed was in the past. It (the
disease) will not spread from this cow (to other cows)."
On 22 Sep, the agriculture ministry confirmed Japan's first case of the
deadly disease -- the first outside Europe. [That case was a clinical one.
- Mod.AS. On 18 Oct, the health ministry began a nationwide screening of
all cows for human consumption, following the confirmed discovery of
Japan's first case of the brain-wasting illness, found in Chiba Prefecture
in September. Around 88 000 cows had been tested as of Tuesday, according
to the health ministry. About 1.3 million cows are processed for
consumption every year.
The Hokkaido farmer reportedly did not feed the cow MBM, according to the
Hokkaido government. It is still not known how the first cow became
infected with the disease. Early this month, beef prices at Tokyo's central
wholesale market had returned to nearly the same levels as last year, after
the government declared domestic beef free of mad-cow disease 18 October.

Second BSE case confirmed in Japan
-----------------------------------
The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry confirmed Wednesday 21 Nov 2001 that
the dairy cow in Hokkaido, northern part of Japan, has tested positive for
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in both primary ELISA (enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay) as well as the follow up tests (Western blot method)
for the disease. The cow was born in April 1996, about the same time as the
government advised farmers against feeding cattle with meat and bone meal
(MBM), which is suspected of causing BSE. The cow that was earlier
confirmed to have had the disease was also born around the same date.

[BSE has been confirmed and reported, as of November 2001, in 16 European
countries. Japan is the only country outside Europe with confirmed cases of
the disease, and one of few Asian countries that have taken steps to
determine their BSE status by means of a surveillance in line with the
requirements of chapter 2.13.3 of the Office International des Epizooties
International Code. The prompt handling of the case, following the
laboratory Western blot confirmation of the initial ELISA test -- according
to the media, within 24 hours -- is remarkable. - Mod.AS
