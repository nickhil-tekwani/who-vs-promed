Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Mexico
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 21 May 2014 from Dr Joaquin Braulio Delgadillo Alvarez, [director general for Animal Health, National Service for Health, Food Safety and Quality (SENASICA), Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food], Mexico, Mexico

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Jul 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 8 Aug 2013
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 3 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 2 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: no
Causal agent: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
Serotype: other

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 83
Outbreak cluster 1: Aguascalientes, Baja California, Colima, Federal District, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Jalisco, State of Mexico, Michoacan, Morelos, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz, (83 outbreaks)
[Note: 17 states with positive samples of 19 states sampled. Mod.CRD]
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Jul 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine /- / - / - / - / -

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: following notification of an unusual mortality, mainly in piglets, in the central-western part of the country, with clinical evidence suggestive of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, the official veterinary services in coordination with farmers began a diagnosis of the situation of this disease that included epidemiological sampling in farrow-to-finish farms, fattening farms, breeding farms, backyard farms and slaughterhouses with clinical evidence. During the epidemiological investigation, 2309 samples were tested with RRT-PCR in 19 federal entities between August 2013 and May 2014. Out of the total number of samples, only 30 per cent were positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea and 70 per cent were negative, which suggests that there may be some other etiological agent involved in this event, being a multicausal process. It should be noted that, to date, it has not been possible to isolate the virus and that the States where positive cases were identified by RRT-PCR are: Aguascalientes, Baja California, Colima, Federal District, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Jalisco, State of Mexico, Michoacan, Morelos, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz. Samples from the States of Yucatan and Oaxaca were negative for the disease.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out; no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (symptomatic treatment)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Biosecurity Laboratory Level 3, SENASICA (national laboratory) / Swine / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
