China's agricultural ministry confirmed on Fri [16 Nov 2018] the 1st outbreak of deadly African swine fever [ASF] in the south west province of Sichuan, the country's top pig-producing region, raising the likelihood of a major impact to pork supplies in coming months. The outbreak was found on a farm of 40 pigs in Yibin city, in Sichuan's south east. This is the 18th province or municipality to have reported an outbreak of ASF since the highly contagious disease was 1st detected in China in early August [2018].

Sichuan produced almost 66 million pigs for slaughter last year [2017], according to official data, more than any other province. Sichuan provincial authorities last week issued a regulation banning the import of all live hogs and hog products from other regions in a bid to keep the disease out. Yibin is close to Sichuan's borders with Chongqing municipality and Guizhou province, both of which have already reported outbreaks. There is no cure and no vaccine for ASF, and the virus can survive for weeks in pork and animal feed.

The case in Sichuan comes less than 3 months ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations in early February [2019] that mark China's peak demand period for pork.

Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) confirmed its 1st ASF outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 August 2018, ASF has been officially reported from 71 villages/the smallest available admin units in 18 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities. More than 470 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread. On top of the above outbreaks in domestic pigs, the disease has been identified, for the 1st time, in a wild boar in the province Jilin, as officially reported by the Ministry on 16 Nov 2018, a significant further deterioration of the situation.

MoARA recently announced intensified requirements on pig transport vehicles within the ASF emergency response. These will include obligatory registration of the vehicles liable to their inspection and approval, obligation to equip GPS recorder with vehicles transporting live pigs between provinces or between counties within infected provinces or provinces bordering infected provinces, limiting the number of pigs per vehicle (max 15 pigs), obligation to disinfect before and after transport, and recordkeeping. These measures, presented in more detail at http://www.moa.gov.cn/govpublic/SYJ/201811/t20181101_6162105.htm, shall come into force on 1 Dec 2018.

FAO and China's MoARA are jointly organizing a "multilateral cross-border meeting in Greater Mekong subregion to strengthen collaboration of transboundary animal disease control", to take place in Beijing China, 22-24 Nov 2018. The meeting is scheduled to include "African swine fever emergency preparedness training" for Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam and China. - Mod.AS
