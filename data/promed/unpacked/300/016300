Case of novel coronavirus identified in the UK -- [11 Feb 2013]
----------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) can confirm the diagnosis of a further case of novel coronavirus infection in a UK resident, who had recently travelled to the Middle East and Pakistan. The patient is receiving intensive care treatment in a Manchester hospital. This latest case brings the total number of confirmed cases globally to 10, of which 2 have been diagnosed in the UK.

Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: "The HPA is providing advice to healthcare workers to ensure the patient under investigation is being treated appropriately and that healthcare staff who are looking after the patient are protected. Contacts of the case are also being followed up to check on their health.

"Our assessment is that the risk associated with novel coronavirus to the general UK population remains extremely low and the risk to travellers to the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries remains very low. No travel restrictions are in place but people who develop severe respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, within ten days of returning from these countries should seek medical advice and mention which countries they have visited.

"Since the 1st case of novel coronavirus was diagnosed in the UK in September 2012, the HPA has maintained increased vigilance for illness caused by this virus, working closely with national and international authorities including the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We have also produced updated guidance for health professionals in the UK on the investigation and management of possible cases."

Professor Maria Zambon, director of reference microbiology services at the HPA, said: "A battery of laboratory tests have been developed by the HPA to test for coronavirus infection when cases of severe respiratory illness are identified, which are not explained by other infectious causes. These tests, which detect the presence of virus in the body, are available for use by selected frontline HPA laboratories.

"In mid-November [2012] the HPA published the full genome sequence from the 1st UK patient, enabling scientists around the world to understand more about the diversity of this virus. This will help with efforts to determine the origin of the virus and develop strategies for treatment and prevention."

Coronaviruses are causes of the common cold but can also include more severe illness, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). This new coronavirus was 1st identified in September 2012 in a patient who died from a severe respiratory infection in June 2012. The virus has so far only been identified in a small number of cases of acute, serious respiratory illness who presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.

Notes to editors:

1. Laboratory confirmed cases to date: 10

Saudi Arabia: 5 (3 deaths)
Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
UK: 2 (1 patient from Qatar - receiving treatment, 1 patient from UK - receiving treatment)
Germany: 1 (patient from Qatar - discharged)

Novel coronavirus infection -update 11 Feb 2013
------------------------
The United Kingdom (UK) has informed WHO of a confirmed case with infection of the novel coronavirus (NCoV). The case is a UK resident who developed symptoms of illness on [26 Jan 2013]. Laboratory investigations on respiratory specimens have revealed both an Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and a confirmed NCoV infection. He is hospitalized in intensive care unit.

Preliminary investigation reveals that the patient had a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Further investigation into the case is ongoing.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has instituted stringent infection control measures around the patient and identified contacts who may have been exposed to the patient during his illness.

This is a sporadic case and does not alter the current WHO risk assessment on NCoV but the new case does indicate that the virus is persistent. As of [11 Feb 2013], a total of 10 confirmed cases of human infection with a novel coronavirus have been notified to WHO.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Testing for the new coronavirus of patients with unexplained pneumonias, or patients with severe, progressive or complicated illness not responding to treatment, should be considered especially in persons residing in or returning from the Arabian peninsula and neighboring countries.

Any clusters of SARI or SARI in health care workers should be thoroughly investigated, regardless of where in the world they occur.

New human cases and clusters should be promptly reported both to national health authorities and to WHO.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions are applied.

[This is now the 10th confirmed case of respiratory illness associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) 1st identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia with illness in June 2012 (see prior ProMED-mail post Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733). As mentioned in the HPA press release above and covered in the prior ProMED-mail posts listed in the "see also" section below, the 9 prior cases have involved 5 cases (including 3 deaths) in Saudi Arabian citizens diagnosed and treated in Saudi Arabia, 2 cases in Jordanian citizens retrospectively diagnosed (both fatal cases) occurring in a nosocomial outbreak in an intensive care unit (ICU)in Jordan in April 2012, and one case in a Qatari citizen who was diagnosed and treated in a hospital in the UK and another case in a Qatari citizen who was diagnosed and treated in Germany. This current case has a history of travel to the Middle East prior to onset of symptoms (Saudi Arabia) and Pakistan, suggesting that transmission of this novel virus continues to be isolated to areas within the middle eastern countries.

Of note is that this most recent case (in a UK citizen with a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia prior to onset of illness) was also confirmed to have a simultaneous infection with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the novel coronavirus. This is the 1st documented "coinfection" involving the nCoV and the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and one wonders if this coinfection will have an impact on the course and severity of disease.

We are still awaiting results of studies done to identify nCoV infection in animals in the region.
