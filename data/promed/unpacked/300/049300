Geography is very important in Botswana, and if you live in certain
regions, your cattle are important to the nation because of the export
earnings of livestock and livestock product. Unfortunately, this outbreak
is in the FMD free zone and its impact is therefore multiplied. Please see
Mod.AS comments in ProMED-mail posting: Foot & mouth disease, bovine -
Botswana: (Kasane), OIE 20080807.2432.

Furthermore, the regionalization strategy here is one of the oldest
attempts to divide a country by geography into sub-regions with
differential possibilities for export. This strategy is increasingly being
utilized over the past couple of decades as the world economies become
intertwined. So Botswana provides a long term perspective on
regionalization export strategy in the face of one of the fastest spreading
diseases, FMD. The strategy has generally been successful, hence the
importance of how this outbreak resolves as time goes on.

A useful map and accompanying description divides Botswana into FMD free,
FMD vaccination zones, and National Parks. Please see Neo Mapitse (2008):
