The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Wildlife announced Wednesday [31 Aug 2022] it has confirmed cases of Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) in white-tailed deer in 13 Ohio counties.

EHD, sometimes referred to as "zombie deer," is a viral infection deer get from biting midges. The infected deer can lose their fear of humans and have other neurological signs like circling, weakness, and not eating. Deer that die from EHD often have a swollen tongue, eyelids, neck or head. While it's usually fatal, some deer survive and develop immunity.

The deadly disease has been documented in other states as well. In July [2022], more than 300 deer on a Wisconsin farm were killed after the affliction spread throughout the population.

"It's a viral disease that affects a variety of different types of deer in Indiana," Katherine Michelle Benavidez Westrich, a biologist for Indiana Fish and Wildlife, told Nexstar's WXIN in 2019. "Whitetail deer are the animal that's most affected, it causes flu-like signs. So these deer oftentimes will develop fevers. For that reason, they tend to seek out water to alleviate those fevers and as the disease progresses, they start to display what looks like neurological signs. So they'll be drinking the water over and over again, they might start having what looks like seizures."

Once infected, deer can die within 36 hours of onset symptoms.

People and pets can't be infected, and it's not spread animal-to-animal.

EHD deaths typically subside after the 1st frost, when the midges die off.

Here's where the infected deer have been found: Athens, Butler, Champaign, Franklin, Greene, Hamilton, Highland, Madison, Perry, Preble, Ross, Union, and Warren counties.

Sightings of sick or dead deer should be reported to local wildlife officials.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD) in cervids is caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group or bluetongue virus (BTV) group (both Reoviridae: Orbivirus). It is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) in the United States. In North America, there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2 and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were 1st reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886.

EHDV and BTV are transmitted between their ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Available data suggest that the species of _Culicoides_ that transmit EHDV are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as for BTV. - Mod.PMB
