False alarm
-----------
A false alarm from Bali, where the realities of the rabies outbreak that started in 2008 have been quite bad enough, may already have circulated far and wide. I'm trying to overtake it.

The 13 Jan 2012 edition of the 'Bali Times' inexplicably includes an article headlined "New Death Sparks Renewed Rabies Fear." (http://www.thebalitimes.com/2012/01/16/new-death-sparks-renewed-rabies-fear/). The article begins: "Officials fear that rabies may have reached Nusa Penida, one of the few parts of Bali to remain free of the disease, after a local woman died of the disease last week. Head of rabies management at Sanglah Hospital Dr Ken Warasandhi said that 2 patients from Klungkung regency had died of suspected rabies last week. He identified them as 43 year old and 58 year old patients.

This article appears to be a paraphrasing or translation of an article which originally appeared in the local language newspaper 'Radar Bali' on 8 Jan 2011 -- just over one year ago.

[Errors of this variety are not infrequent at the turn of the year, and although understandable they need to be corrected without delay. It must be concluded that rabies has been present on the off-shore island of Nusa Penida for more than a year. [The story does fit with one reported in ProMED-mail posting: Rabies - Indonesia (02): (Bali) 20110110.0121. - Mod.SH]

An [edited] translation by Janice Girardi (Bali Animal Welfare Association) of the article referred to above from the local language newspaper 'Radar Bali', is appended below.

Rabies casualties from Nusa Penida
----------------------------------
"Within 2 days, 2 suspected rabies cases died at Sanglah Hospital. They are both Klungkung residents. One of them came from Nusa Penida, a small island which has been rabies free.

A 43 year old patient died on Thursday (1/6) at Nusa Indah Ward, Sanglah Hospital. He was treated for 2 days and had shown clinical rabies symptoms. When interviewed Dr IGB Ken Wirasandhi, secretary for Rabies Control Team of Sanglah Hospital mentioned that Kartika received no VAR (post-exposure treatment) after he had been bitten and his wound had not been cleaned. He had been bitten by a dog 3 months ago on his right foot and exhibited fear of water and light, anxiety and excess salivation.

More shocking was the death of a 58 year old patient from Nusa Penida. Apart from its small population, Nusa Penida is a small and remote island and separated from Bali island and considered to be rabies-free. This patient was treated at the Nusa Indah Ward less than 24 hours prior to her death. She had been admitted to Sanglah Hospital on Thursday (1/6) and died on Friday at 01.00 am. She was already in critical condition and suffered from rabies symptoms when admitted.

According to Sutredja, the 58 year old woman had bitten by a dog approximately a month previously. "She was bitten on her left calf and didn't received VAR," explained Sutedja. According to the information from her family, the victim was taken to a local Puskesmas (Public Health Centre) and had her wound cleaned and she received an injection. It is unknown what type of injection. Clearly, according to Sutedja her VAR history is negative.

"This is what we are afraid of, rabies crossing to the island. It is estimated that someone despite warnings had brought a dog onto the island," says Sutedja. He added, one of the obstacles in eradicating rabies in this small island is the difficult terrain and lack of knowledge about the rabies danger.

"In Nusa Penida, they have a Rabies Centre which can provide VAR. Patients do not have to travel, so that they don't need to leave the island to receive it. The VAR is supplied by Klungkung Hospital."
