Viet Nam: 10-year-old Vietnamese girl becomes 50th death
-----------------------------------------------
A 10-year-old Vietnamese girl is reported to have died from avian
influenza, local health officials say. The girl, who lived in Hanoi, is
believed to be the 50th recorded death from the virus in Asia since the
latest outbreak hit in January 2004. Viet Nam has seen 36 of those deaths,
while Thailand has lost 12 people and Cambodia 2. The 10-year-old girl died
on 27 Mar 2005 in St. Paul's Hospital in Hanoi, a local doctor told
reporters on condition of anonymity. He said test results by the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology were released on Mon 4 Apr 2005.
The government last week [1st week April 2005] announced a nationwide
clean-up of poultry farms to try to stop the spread of bird flu. The
Ministry of Health said that large commercial operations and small local
farms in every village in Viet Nam would be disinfected. North Korea is the
most recent addition to the list of Asian countries hit by avian influenza.
But its poultry have been infected with the H7 strain of avian influenza
virus, which is less deadly to humans. The strain that has decimated
poultry stocks and caused recent human deaths in Cambodia, Thailand and
Viet Nam is the more virulent H5N1 strain.

Viet Nam: 2 additional deaths confirmed; total now 50
-----------------------------------------------
Asia's [human] death toll from avian influenza rose to 50 on Wed 6 Apr
2005, when Vietnamese health officials and a hospital doctor confirmed 2
additional deaths in Viet Nam. A 10-year-old girl, who tested positive for
the H5N1 virus, died of lung failure hours after she was admitted to St.
Paul's Hospital in Hanoi on 27 Mar 2005, a hospital doctor said on
condition of anonymity. Test results by the National Institute of Hygiene
and Epidemiology were released on Monday [4 Apr 2005], the doctor said. In
addition, Viet Nam's Health Ministry confirmed one other previously
unreported death, though officials there gave no details about when the
patient died, where the patient was from, or age and gender.
Viet Nam has reported a total of 16 deaths from avian influenza since the
country's latest outbreak began in late December 2004. Since a severe stain
of the disease started surging through poultry farms in Asia in December
2003, a total of 50 people have died in the region, 36 from Viet Nam, 12
from Thailand and 2 from Cambodia.

Viet Nam: death of hospital doctor still under investigation
-----------------------------------------------
Another human fatality in Viet Nam has been attributed to avian influenza,
while health officials investigate the death last weekend [Sun 3 Apr 2005]
of a doctor who worked in a hospital where avian influenza patients have
been treated. Test results showed that a 10-year-old girl, who died on 27
Mar 2005 in a hospital in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, was infected
with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, according to Le Van Diem, director of
St. Paul's Hospital in Hanoi. The girl is the 16th Vietnamese, at least, to
have died from avian influenza since December 2004.
A male doctor, who worked at the Viet Nam-Sweden hospital in Uong Bi in
northern Viet Nam's Quang Ninh province, died on Sun 3 Apr 2005, 2 days
after falling ill at work, the Tien Phong newspaper reported yesterday [Tue
5 Apr 2005]. Tests for the H5N1 virus are being performed on samples from
the doctor, said Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy director of Viet Nam's National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. If the doctor's samples test
positive for avian influenza, it would mark the 2nd known case of avian
influenza in a health-care worker. A male nurse from the northern province
of Thai Binh tested positive for the H5N1 virus last month [March 2005].
"Suspicions that human-to-human transmission may have taken place usually
arise when cases occur close together in time and place among persons, such
as family members or health-care workers, known to have [had] close contact
with a case," the WHO stated in a January 2005 report on avian influenza to
its executive board. 2 patients who have received treatment at the Viet
Nam-Sweden hospital in Quang Ninh province have also tested positive for
the H5N1 virus, while a 3rd patient is classified as a suspected case,
according to Le Quang Dang, deputy director of the Quang Ninh provincial
health department. 2 of the 3 Quang Ninh patient cases are now hospitalized
in Hanoi, he said. At least 2 of the 3 patients were known to have had
contact with poultry, while the deceased doctor had no known contact with
poultry, Dang said. The doctor was also not known to have had contact with
any of the 3 patients, he said. "He worked in a different ward," Dang said.
"We don't think there's any connection between the doctor's case and the
cases of these 5 other people."
