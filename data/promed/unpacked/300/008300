The following background data are abstracted from Gideon and the Gideon e-book series. [1, 2] (primary references are available on request).

The 1st case of legionellosis in Italy was reported in 1981 (from Emilia Romagna), and passive surveillance was initiated in 1983. Reported disease rates in Italy and surrounding countries have increased dramatically since 2000. The rate of under-reporting for legionellosis in Italy is estimated at 21.4 percent.

(See graph and charts at source URL.)

As seen in the graph, parallel rate increases have been reported in the USA and Italy. Disease rates in the latter are approximated 5-fold those reported for the European region as a whole, and 1.3-times higher than those reported in the USA.

Approximately 63 percent of cases are reported from Northern Italy (1983 to 1994), and _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is responsible for 94 percent of cases. The male/female ratio for reported cases is 3.45/1, and 56.6 percent of the patients are above age 49 [years].

819 presumptive cases and 490 confirmed cases were registered during 1983 to March 1994, including 67 fatal cases during 1983 to 1990. A total of 9803 cases (11.8 percent fatal) were reported during 2000 to 2011.

During 1973 to 1987, 117 cases (6 fatal) were reported among tourists to Italian summer resorts. During 2002 to 2007, the annual incidence of legionellosis among European travelers to Italy ranged from 96 to 143 cases. Seven cases were reported among tourists in Rome during 1998 to 1999, and 10 cases were reported in 2000. In 2003, 64 internal (Italian) tourists acquired legionellosis within Italy.

Screen-shots from Gideon [see source URL above] summarize published outbreaks and surveys for legionellosis in Italy.
