We have a mess. 10 confirmed cases as of this AM [morning. Probably 70
dead cows & bulls and 2 horses. All cases are in extreme NW Minnesota. Most
are within a 12 mile radius with one exception. Antibiotics hold it for 3
days but then we are at risk again while waiting for the penicillin to
clear. Trying to get the vaccine in them about 7-10 days post antibiotic
therapy. Most cases are within 10 miles of MB border and on the same
watershed drainage. Quite close to the case at Sprague, MB.
[All the following herds were confirmed with anthrax except Farm #9. -

[It is clear that prompt treatment with long acting antibiotics is
beneficial and effective. Obviously it should be combined with promptly
taking the animals out of the affected pasture, if possible; effective
carcass disposal; and vaccination a week or so later. Also that delays
while waiting for a confirmed diagnosis can result in additional deaths,
pointing up yet again, the urgent need for a clinician cow-side field test.
In discussing the July 29 deaths during handling the herd, Terry commented
that these were very excited, virtually unmanageable animals; last year he
had seen similar cases and they all died. But when presented with such
animals the best way to treat them is to dart them with 20 cc of LA 200
(that is two darts of 10 cc each) and they will recover.
In support of initial antibiotic treatment, Sam Holland [South Dakota State
Veterinarian, 30 Jul 2001 commented: "We vaccinate and give antibiotics
simultaneously immediately upon suspicion or confirmation of anthrax, then
go in 7-10 days later and booster [vaccinate. I realize some scientists
say this [early vaccination doesn't work but we are able to stop death
losses almost immediately and have never seen problems with re-breaks or
recurrences. In the 15 years I've been with the state vet's office and in
the 15 years prior while in practice I've never had a reported recurrence
on the same farm in recent history. However I feel quite confident that
producers who experience anthrax continue to vaccinate each spring for a
number of years. (Of course most of them eventually stop vaccinating at
some point but after a number of years.) My recommendation is that in known
endemic areas in South Dakota, producers should ANNUALLY vaccinate. However
it is difficult to convince producers of the value of doing this when no
anthrax is recognized in their vicinity for 20 years!"
Using Sterne vaccine and antibiotics together is controversial as to any
long term benefits. But certainly antibiotics (with or without vaccine)
followed later by vaccination is a most effective management technique for
this disease in livestock. - Mod.MHJ
