1st report of _Phytophthora cryptogea_ root and crown rot on peach trees in
Chile
-----------------------------------------------
G Guzman, BA Latorre, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago,
Chile; WF Wilcox, Department of Plant Pathology, New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station, Cornell University, Geneva. Plant Dis
2005; 89: 1010, published online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1010B. Accepted for
publication 24 Jun 2005.
_Phytophthora cryptogea_ Pethybridge and Lafferty was consistently isolated
from the Nemaguard rootstock (_Prunus persica_ x _P. davidiana_) of peach
trees in Chile. Symptoms included reddish necrotic tissues at the base of
the trunk often extending to the main roots, root rot, gummosis, foliar
chlorosis, lack of vigor, and dieback, with severely infected trees dying.
Isolations with corn meal agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) amended with
antibiotics and fungicides (ACMA) (2) and pure cultures were obtained by
hyphal tip transfers to ACMA.
10 isolates from different locations were identified by morphology and
growth at cardinal temperatures (1). These isolates produced hyphal
swellings and sporangia by using carrot juice broth (2) for 48 hours
followed by the addition of one per cent (w/v) nonsterilized soil extract.
Sporangia were nonpapillate, internally proliferating, noncaducous, ovoid
to obpyriform, and with mean dimensions of 36 x 24 micrometers.
All isolates were typed as A1 using a _P. cinnamomi_ A2 culture as the test
isolate and produced oospores on clarified V8 juice agar amended with
thiamine, tryptophan, and beta-sitosterol (2) after 15 to 30 days at 20 C
in the dark. Mycelia grew between 5 and 30 C, with optimal growth at 20 C
and no growth at 35 C.
The ITS sequence analysis performed by IMI (CABI Bioscience, Wallingford,
UK) indicated a close match with _P. cryptogea_, _P. drechsleri_, and _P.
erythroseptica_, however, peach isolates were differentiated from _P.
drechsleri_ and _P. erythroseptica_ by the absence of mycelial growth at 35
C and the heterothallic production of oospores, respectively. 4 _P.
cryptogea_ isolates were pathogenic when inoculated onto one year old twigs
detached from a Nemaguard tree, causing reddish necrotic lesions varying
from 7 to 29 mm long after 15 days of incubation at 20 C. 2 year old _P.
persica_ var. _nectarina_ cv. Ruby Diamond budded on Nemaguard and
cultivated in 100-liter containers in open field conditions were inoculated
with 500ml of a mycelial suspension of 4 500 000 propagules per ml) per
plant added to 15 cm deep holes around the trunk. Plants were immediately
irrigated and maintained at field capacity during the experiment. An equal
number of noninoculated trees treated similarly were left as controls.
During the spring, plants developed a general chlorosis and declined within
90 days postinoculation. Tests were repeated with similar results. In other
preliminary tests, plants developed cankers characterized by gumming and
reddish necrotic lesions underneath the bark following trunk inoculations
with mycelium in agar of the same isolates obtained on ACMA. These tests
were also repeated.
The pathogen was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissue.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P. cryptogea_ as a pathogen on
peach trees in Chile.

[Not being able to directly comment on the collar rot and root rot disease
in Chile, I can only suggest that there may be similarities in the
production practices used by growers of peaches and apples in Kentucky and
Chilean orchards. Soilborne fungi such as _Phytophthora cactorum_, _P.
cambivora_ and _P. cryptogea_ are occasional but serious problems for many
orchardists who grow these tree fruits. These pathogens are especially
severe on apple trees that are grown on Malling Merton 106 (MM106)
rootstocks. Collar rot is most frequently associated with areas of the
orchard having heavy, poorly-drained soil. Phytophthora crown rot attacks
the lower trunk just at or below the soil surface.
In addition to good water management, fungicide applications are suggested
for those areas of the orchard likely to have collar rot problems. Because
collar rot occurs so sporadically and the cost of chemical treatments is
prohibitive, growers should consider only spot treatment of blocks with
susceptible rootstocks growing in poorly drained areas. Chemical control
can be an effective option, but must be applied before symptoms become
obvious, because by then the tree is usually girdled. Fungicides containing
mefanoxam are labeled for use on bearing apple and stone fruit trees. They
are best applied to apples in the fall after harvest.
