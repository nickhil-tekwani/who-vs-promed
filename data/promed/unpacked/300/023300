The contagious diseases dengue and chikungunya have affected
pastoralists in the Kedougou region. Treatment for these diseases and
vaccines to prevent them are yet to be found. They were detected for
the 1st time in 2008 in the Kedougou region, in the department of
Salemata. Since then, more than a dozen people have been infected [It
is not clear how many of these cases are suspected or laboratory
confirmed as dengue virus infections and how many as chikungunya virus
infections. - Mod.TY]

The 1st case of dengue was registered in that area last year [2008].
Since then, several cases have emerged in the localities Ninefesha,
Banda, Saraya, among other locations. This year, 4 cases have been
reported in adults and 15 in children. It was during the review at the
meeting at the Kedougou medical region that took place on the past 28
Sep [2000] that Dr Sow of the Pasteur Institute of that region
revealed the existence of these "time bombs". To this end, according
to the physician, ''dengue is a viral disease that is transmitted by
an insect. It has the same symptoms as malaria. Moreover, it has
caused epidemics in West Africa during 2008, notably in Cote d'Ivoire,
Mali, etc." Dr Sow indicated. The virus is heterogeneous and a
specific treatment or vaccine have not yet been found.

The treatment of patients is free and is assured by the Institute
Pasteur, which in addition studies the evolution of these diseases in
eastern Senegal and strives to find a cure for these ills. These
diseases are common in West Africa in general and in particular in
Senegal. They emerge every 4 years since the year of their appearance
in 1972 in Asia. As the saying goes "prevention is better than cure."
The state, through the Ministry of Health is called upon to solve
these "time bombs" that can explode at any time.

The governor [of Mato Grosso state], Blairo Maggi, met on Tuesday [29
Sep 2009], with officials from Cuiaba and Varzea Grande looking to
discuss public policies directed at combating dengue before the rainy
season. The initiative seeks partnerships aiming to avoid an epidemic
in the 2 cities and reduce the rates of cases reported in 2009, which
reached 11 031, with 307 serious cases and 8 deaths in the capital.
Already in the industrial city, 3800 [cases] have been recorded, 198
of them confirmed and 6 deaths.

At the meeting, the technical staff of the state Secretariat of Health
gave an explanation on the [vector abundance] indexes in the 2 largest
cities in the state, as well as some recommendations to control the
disease. Among these is integrated collaboration between the 2
municipalities, materials for health workers, the hiring of more
[health] agents for the areas not covered, training, and supervision
of the work.

According to governor Maggi, there will be a joint effort, in
partnership with municipalities, to clean the cities with the
expansion of waste disposal, elimination of the breeding sites that
are formed by the accumulation of trash, a joint legal action in
relation to the continuous cleaning of vacant lots; water supply, to
ensure a continuous supply and adequacy of water supplies; ensuring
adequate legislation for places where materials are stored that can
serve as a breeding sites (tires, old metal [junk] and other [trash]).

In partnership with Greater Cuiaba and Varzea Grande, the state
government will invest in advertising campaigns to raise awareness.
Strategies will be defined based on the results of qualitative
investigations.

"There is nobody at fault for the increase in cases, since it is a
public health [problem], which is the responsibility of us all. Thus,
we must work together to avoid that in 2010 numbers increase again,"
said Maggi.

The meeting included the deputy mayors of Cuiaba and Varzea Grande,
Galindo, and Zaeli Tiao, respectively; the state health secretary,
Moro Augustine; the health secretary of Varzea Grande, Jaqueline
Guimaraes; and the health surveillance manager for Cuiaba, Vagner
Simplicio, among other municipal secretaries.

There have been no deaths caused by dengue [virus infection] in 2009
in Aracaju. This is one of the good results achieved by the
intensification of actions in districts where there is greater
occurrence of breeding sites of the mosquito that transmits the
disease [virus]. The positive numbers are a reflection of the constant
visits by health agents to homes, construction sites, and empty lots,
as well as the training of teams and public education campaigns aimed
at prevention and guidance.

Between January and August 2009, in the capital of Sergipe, the number
of notifications of suspected cases of dengue declined by 90 percent
and the number of confirmed cases by 97 percent over the same period
in 2008. According to the coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance
of the Municipal Health Secretariat (SMS), Taise Cavalcanti, the data
are significant. "There were 1130 suspected cases dengue, with 287
confirmed cases. During the same period in 2008, 11 573 suspected
cases and 10 481 confirmed [cases] were reported," she explained.

According to the latest rapid [household] index survey for _Aedes
aegypti_ (LIRAa), conducted by SMS in early September [2009], of the
39 districts of Aracaju, 23 managed to reduce the house infestation
index (IIP) in relation to the previous survey done in July [2009].
"We found a 24 percent drop in infestation, reaching the level of 2.2
percent, which is considered average risk for the onset of an outbreak
or epidemic of dengue," said Cavalcanti.

The criteria for assessment of the IIP, according to the Ministry of
Health, classifies as 'low' or 'satisfactory' the percentage of
infestation ranging from 0-0.9 percent; as 'average' or 'alert' the
percentage of between 1-3.9, and as 'high' or 'risk of an outbreak'
with rates above 4 percent. "Of all the neighborhoods of the capital,
12 were classified as low risk (satisfactory), 21 classified as medium
risk (alert), and 6 districts as high risk (risk of an outbreak),"
noted the coordinator.

This was the 5th LIRAa conducted by SMS this year [2009]. The
initiative will give priority to areas where the number of foci found
is greatest. "At the beginning of each cycle of mosquito [breeding],
we conduct a LIRAa during the 1st week to make a diagnosis of the
Aracaju districts and to intensify and direct the actions in relation
to the problem encountered at that time," said Cavalcanti.

For her, Santa Maria is a good example of a neighborhood where the
activities of the health agents for endemic diseases have rapidly
increased and shown good results. In the July [2009] survey, the rate
of infestation in the town was 4.2 percent, considered as 'risk of an
outbreak' and is currently at 1.7 percent in the 'medium' risk category.

[The health inspectors and the public education program are achieving
good results in reducing the vector mosquito infestation rates. One
hopes that the success will continue as Brazil enters the rainy and
warm summer season when dengue virus transmission increases.

The Secretariat of Health of Parana warns of increasing cases of
dengue in the state during the rainy season. According to the
secretariat, Parana, must redouble its attention to the disease,
because a survey showed that 3 different serotypes of [dengue] virus
are circulating the state, which raises the possibility of an epidemic
of DHF.

Up to the end of August [2009], there were 814 confirmed cases of
dengue in Parana's municipal districts. Of these, 702 were locally
acquired -- contracted in the state itself -- and 112 were imported.
During the same period in 2008, 752 locally acquired cases were
confirmed.

Dengue preventive actions are directed to the elimination of breeding
sites of the mosquito that transmits the disease [virus], _Aedes
aegypti_, which breeds in stagnant water. Among the recommendations to
prevent the spread of the mosquito, are capping water tanks, keeping
the yard clean and [filling] plant pots with sand to prevent [this
mosquito] from reproducing.

"For the past 3 weeks we have been committed to dealing with cases of
dengue recorded in the Juan Jose Maya urbanization, where as of 22 Sep
[2009], the 3 [vector control] cycles had been completed." These were
the statements from the director of Environmental Health and Sanitary
Control, Quely Camacho, and the coordinator of Epidemiological
Surveillance and Environmental Health, Ineva Parra, who have confirmed
that a dengue epidemic has been going on for approximately 4-5 weeks.

They claim that they are working in this area and that communities can
attest to that. Up to this past week [week of 1 Oct 2009], the
municipalities most affected by dengue are Sucre, Jose Antonio Paez,
Urachiche, San Felipe, and Cocorote. As for cases that have occurred
in the Juan Jose Maya residential area, they stated that the patients
have been treated and have received support from the community council.

They explained that residents should keep their homes and patios
clean, with no cans, plates, or other objects that serve as water
catchments where [mosquito] larvae may occur, as those most affected
[by dengue virus infections] are children. The idea is [for everyone]
to help the health team. "There must be co-responsibility, and that
municipal councils also identify [places] where a person could be
infected. 90 percent of these activities depend on this partnership,
since home owners must eliminate the breeding sites," they mentioned.

The officials gave details on the work plan they will develop this
month [October 2009]. From yesterday [2 Oct 2009] until Sunday [4 Oct
2009], activities will be carried out in the municipalities of
Independence, Urachiche, and Pena, specifically in the areas at
greatest risk, with 3 [vector control] cycles, until increased
effectiveness is seen and cases disappear, which is why communities
must help implement the extreme [control] measures.

They indicated that fumigation would be done in the Monumento Natural
Maria Lionza, Quibayo, and vicinity, as well as in Parque Leonor
Bernabo, El Buco, and San Felipe El Fuerte around 12 Oct [2009]. They
will also visit educational institutions to give talks and deliver
educational materials. From [Mon 26 Oct 2009] to [Fri 30 Oct] they
will fumigate cemeteries.

They pointed out that mayors' offices should provide support, since
they are responsible to maintain their graveyards clean. They signaled
the importance of calling [health authorities] when a [dengue] case is
suspected.

They mentioned that the government delivered 8 light fumigation units
to reinforce those in use currently, 2 heavier [fumigation] units, and
abate [larvicide].

The director of the Teaching Hospital, Juan Ramon Barahona, referred
this morning [29 Sep 2009] to a national dengue outbreak resulting
from the winter [rainy] season. The director indicated that up to now
the Teaching Hospital is treating the cases in the preventative area
and during 3 days of intensive work, 2 adults ill with dengue and 8
cases admitted in pediatrics have been reported.

Barahona, recommended that the Honduras population comply with the
appropriate measures to prevent this epidemic that puts the population
at risk. Similarly, he called for people who live in outlying areas
from the city to bury their trash to avoid attracting all types of
insects.

"This new dengue pathology has increased severely, which has us a bit
worried and why we ask the people to comply with the hygiene measures
that are being reported in the media," said the Director. The doctor
indicated the extermination of these insect [mosquito] vectors which
cause [transmit] dengue [virus] must proceed urgently.

Dengue fever on the rise
------------------------
By the end of September [2009] Viet Nam has seen more than 58 000
cases of dengue fever, a 25 percent increase compared to the same
period last year [2008], and 44 deaths, recently said the head of the
Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine and Environment Department, Dr
Nguyen Huy Nga.

The numbers of dengue fever cases increased 8-fold in the North and
doubled in the Central and Central Highland regions, Dr Nga said.

Many dengue fever cases were found in areas with poor sanitation and
hygiene, with outbreaks grouped in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

In Ho Chi Minh City, there were nearly 7000 cases of dengue fever,
double that of the same period last year [2008].

In Hanoi, in the past 9 months, there were more than 6000 cases of
dengue fever, 1/2 of them recorded in August [2009] alone.

Dr Nga said the main reason for the outbreak of dengue fever was that
authorities and citizens have under estimated the effects of dengue
and have failed to act appropriately.

Preventive action faces a number of difficulties due to a surge in the
number of patients in general and the spread of the A (H1N1) flu.
Therefore, many places just focused on preventing A (H1N1) swine flu
and forgot dengue fever, which is dangerous if preventive measures are
not used effectively, Dr Nga adds.

[Based on the newswire above, more than 58 000 people in Viet Nam have
been infected with dengue virus during January-September 2009, with 44
fatalities. The numbers of dengue cases and deaths have been rapidly
increasing during the past 2 weeks. As of 14 Sep 2009, there were over
44 571 cases and 37 fatalities due to dengue infection (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (14) 20090916.3245).

In August 2009, the highest concentration of dengue fever cases moved
northward with Hanoi as Viet Nam's hardest-hit area, after the Mekong
Delta had accounted for 80-90 percent of all cases in 1998-2007.
Nearly 3000 people had dengue over the 1st 8 months in the capital
(see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (15) 20090918.3271).

According to the head of the Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine and
Environment Department, Nguyen Huy Nga, over the past 9 months, there
were more than 6000 cases of dengue fever in Hanoi and nearly 7000
cases in Ho Chi Minh City. The numbers of dengue fever cases increased
8-fold in the North, whereas they increased 2-fold in the South,
comparing to the same period in 2008. As May-October is rainy season
in Viet Nam, it is likely that the number of dengue cases will
continue to rise until the end of October.
