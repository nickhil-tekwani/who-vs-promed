[2] Lessons learned

Today [11 Jan 2015] is the 5-year anniversary of when the world literally and metaphorically broke. At 4:53 p.m. on 12 Jan 2010, a fault line beneath the western part of Hispaniola slipped. The 7.0 earthquake that followed obliterated Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, with an estimated death toll of more than 250 000 souls.

The world broke in the metaphorical sense because, as a global community, we failed to avoid a preventable disaster. Modern science has yet to discover how to stop earthquakes, but we are capable of preventing massive loss of life by supporting at-risk infrastructure.

Baseball fans will remember that in 1989, mere hours before Game 3 of the World Series, the Loma Prieta earthquake rattled the San Francisco Bay area with a 6.9 magnitude quake (similar to Haiti's, though its epicenter was in a less-densely populated area). While a tragedy, only 63 people lost their lives.

A key difference between San Francisco and Haiti was that the latter didn't have viable infrastructure to withstand such an earthquake. Throw crippling poverty into the mix, and the ingredients for disaster were perfectly in place.

Today's story of Ebola is eerily similar. The lessons learned from Haiti apply to the Ebola epidemic, and we see this in the patient outcomes. Among Americans treated for Ebola on U.S. soil, the survival rate is 100 percent. Eight Americans have been treated in U.S. hospitals, and all have survived. Unfortunately, this doesn't include a Sierra Leone doctor and a Liberian national, both of whom were treated in the United States and died from the disease. Including them, the survival rate for Ebola in the United States rests at 80 percent.

A different story is found with a recent World Health Organization report that highlights 20 712 Ebola cases with 8220 deaths in the 3 most-affected West African countries. The report also shows a 71 percent fatality rate among cases with a "definitive outcome" -- in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia -- which is a world away from Ebola outcomes in the United States.

These statistics are unsurprising. In the case of Liberia, the country had only 50 doctors for a population of 4.4 million. Organizations working on the ground in West Africa -- Partners In Health, Wellbody Alliance and Last Mile Health, specifically -- recognize the importance of investing in health systems and infrastructure. They understand that a faulty system precedes disease, and therein lies the hope of avoiding the next outbreak.

As globalization presses onward, our ability to treat disease will depend on the equity of systems that develop. If systemic gaps continue to persist like those in Haiti and West Africa, so too will the outbreaks of preventable disease.

The next epidemic or earthquake is already on its way. I say this not to take focus away from the earthquake recovery in Haiti or the Ebola epidemic -- both continue despite the waning attention of mainstream media -- but because we need to shift our thinking to how we prepare and respond to future health crises. We need an attitude that these events are preventable, not inevitable. This requires investments in future health systems in areas of our world that currently lack such systems. It means facilitating universal health coverage. It means expanding and supporting primary care. It means recognizing health as a human right.

If we don't reach that ethos, we will continue to play the role of a global fire department that douses the flames but that fails to ask what caused the spark.

[3] Subject: Ebola vaccine

Concern about the spread of Ebola has waned in recent weeks. It would diminish more if a vaccine existed.

Actually, one does. Scientists developed one that seemed to be effective almost a decade ago. But the serum never went to trial. Pharmaceutical companies were not willing to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to bring about a drug for a disease that, before this year, affected only a few hundred people, most of whom could pay little or nothing. If that seems hardhearted, remember: A drug company that goes out of business can't produce a cure for anything.

Circumstances obviously have changed. Two potential vaccines could start undergoing clinical trials sometime next year [2016]. The trials, likely to be run in developing African nations, will face considerable logistical hurdles. And there is debate about what sort of trial to conduct. It would not do, for instance, to test a vaccine on African citizens only to find out it not only doesn't stop Ebola but also causes terrible side effects. Good luck finding a welcome mat for Western aid workers anywhere after that.

With the crisis past, focus should shift to improving the development of vaccines and pharmaceuticals generally. Congress should work on correcting the perverse incentives that dictate behavior at the Food and Drug Administration. If the FDA approves a drug that turns out to have serious side effects, the fury from activists and the news media will be red hot. But no such fury ensues if the FDA prevents the release of a lifesaving drug, since news of the non-release never makes it beyond a small notice in an industry newsletter.

Likewise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] should return to its reason for being, which is spelled out in its name: controlling disease. That will require rolling back the CDC's mission creep, which has allowed it to stray into areas such as gun control, sports injuries, and bicycle helmet safety.

Finally, liberals and conservatives have had a grand old time debating how much appropriations for federal health agencies have or have not been cut in recent years. Total NIH spending roughly doubled from 2000 to 2006, but has been largely flat since then. Much the same goes for the CDC. Democrats and Republicans share the blame. NIH officials say an Ebola vaccine could have been a year or 2 closer to fruition had funding been adequate. The claim sounds self-serving; no agency has ever said it had enough money. It also could be true.

Either way, the Ebola scare offers a bracing reminder that basic research is a legitimate and necessary government function, especially when it focuses on disease and other threats to the nation's general welfare.

[Trials have been announced to begin either this month or next (January or February 2015). But they are not sure about vaccine stability under field conditions, and won't know for months what dose will provide solid immunity. And once you start vaccinating thousands of people with a new vaccine, you are bound to get a few cases of nasty side effects, and even the odd death which has nothing to do with the vaccine will be blamed on it anyway. You may even have vaccinated someone incubating the virus from a local infection but still without symptoms, so live virus will be recovered from the body even though there is no live virus in the vaccines! Try explaining that away to the African public. - Mod.JW]

[4] Subject: Nanobiophysics
Date: 12 Jan 2015
Source: Wired [edited]
http://www.wired.com/2015/01/nanobiophysics-ebola-pandemics/


In an age of cell phones, human genome sequencing, and Google self-driving cars, even the world's best hospitals (and airports) are still relying upon a thermometer (a 400-year-old technology) to decide who to quarantine for Ebola. These antiquated approaches for diagnosing Ebola have resulted in over 1400 Ebola suspects in the U.S. today who still have not received a definitive diagnosis.

As a physicist and physician, I have spent the last 20 years innovating new technologies at the nexus of physics, biomedicine, and nanotechnology. Through this new science of nanobiophysics, we have a pathway to quantum leap our current capabilities for combating Ebola and leave the thermometer behind. I have made this case directly to top officials in recent weeks at the Departments of Defense, State, Health and Human Services, and CDC, as well as CEOs and CMOs of our nation's leading hospitals.

The Problem with Using Thermometers to Triage Ebola Cases
--------------------------------
1st, it typically takes 10-21 days after a person has been infected with Ebola for fever to show up. Meanwhile, the Ebola virus continues to replicate in the blood during this "incubation period" so that by the time the fever manifests, the patient has between 50 000 and 100 000 copies of Ebola virus infecting every milliliter of his/her blood. The thermometer thus has low sensitivity for detecting Ebola, resulting in a high rate of false negatives. An unfortunate case in point: the 1st domestic Ebola case [in the US] showed no feverish symptoms when he entered the country from Liberia.

With the current Ebola protocol, individuals can wait in limbo for as long as 3 weeks without a definitive diagnosis. During this time, individuals are neither quarantined (i.e. stopped from infecting others) nor treated. Recent findings in monkeys and humans have shown that providing even supportive therapy to an Ebola-infected individual early in the incubation period significantly increases the likelihood of survival.

Further, without a quick and accurate way to rule out the virus, any new Ebola cases coupled with flu season could cause panic and overwhelm our healthcare systems. For worried patients experiencing Ebola-like symptoms of fever, headache, diarrhea or vomiting, a thermometer will have low specificity (i.e. high false positive rates) and not be able to distinguish between Ebola and the flu.

The costs of false positives and negatives are too high to bear. Dr. S's case [in NY, USA] alone reportedly cost New York taxpayers USD 20 million. A flare-up of a critical number of suspect Ebola cases could collapse our already fragile American healthcare system.

Disrupting the Centralized Paradigm in Healthcare
-----------------------------------
In a perfect world, pandemic response would use the gold standard for medical diagnoses. Based on 20-year-old Nobel Prize winning polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, this method measures the Ebola virus's ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the blood. But, this method requires centralized labs with expensive overhead infrastructure, trained personnel, large machines, running water, electricity and complex sample transport logistics.

This centralized lab paradigm does not work in West Africa due to the lack of basic infrastructure. Even in the U.S., we can see this model breaking down as the leading centralized lab testing companies -- Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, ARUP Laboratories and Mayo Medical Laboratories -- have all refused to accept blood from suspected Ebola patients.

The Holy Grail is point-of-care (POC) testing. Unfortunately, the current generation of such POC tests -- primarily ELISA or immunoassays -- suffer from a high rate of false positives and false negatives and hence require gold standard PCR confirmatory testing in centralized labs.

This is where nanobiophysics provides next generation tools and infrastructure to decentralize, mobilize, and personalize the delivery of healthcare. For example, by precision controlling nanomachines that read and write DNA, new technologies like Gene-RADAR can rapidly and affordably detect and quantify genetic fingerprints of various pathogens like Ebola, HIV, and the flu at the point-of-care with gold standard accuracy.

Quantifying the viral loads of viruses before symptoms appear will radically change how we stop the spread of diseases and prevent future pandemics. This will lead to early quarantine, stop the spread to others, and enable early onset of supportive and experimental therapies.

The United States can win the global war on Ebola. Congress has already committed over USD 5 billion to fight Ebola. If wisely invested, these resources could significantly upgrade our diagnostic capabilities, bolstering the heroic efforts of those fighting this viral enemy on the frontlines, whether in African villages or in American hospitals.

Our healthcare industry still operates on a paradigm of centralized infrastructure that was developed in the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s. The result is that today, billions of people worldwide lack access to adequate healthcare infrastructure, and we have a USD multi-trillion healthcare dilemma in the US. The urgent crisis we face with Ebola today might just be the catalyst needed to disrupt this old centralized paradigm and pave the way for the next generation of global healthcare infrastructure.

[Gene-RADAR is an iPad-sized mobile diagnostic platform that works off of a drop of blood or saliva to deliver a real-time diagnosis at a price point Nanobiosym claim are 10 to 100 times cheaper than conventional tests. See http://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2014/10/09/little-things-do-make-a-big-difference-globalizing-personal-health/ for more information. Of course, testing will be required to compare with conventional testing to determine sensitivity and specificity. - Mod.LK]
