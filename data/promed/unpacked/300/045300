As of today [Wed 2 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
1680 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
681 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent],
987 recoveries, and
11 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as a previously reported newly confirmed case. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Thu 27 Jul 2017], there have been a total of:
4 newly confirmed cases
0 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery.

[With the absence of an identified nosocomial outbreak, the pattern of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is one of sporadic cases. While there were 3 cases reported today (2 Aug 2017), each case was from a different geographic region, one in the north (Al Jawf region), one in the central area (Riyadh region) and one in the central-west (Makkah region).The 4th newly confirmed case in this period (reported on 29 Jul 2017) is from yet another region - `Asīr region in the south west of the country. (maps showing the location of these cases can be found at the source URLs for each of these cases).

The total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia is now at 1680 including 681 deaths.
