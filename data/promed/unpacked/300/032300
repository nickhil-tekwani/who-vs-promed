The public health authority reported a human H7N9 AIV [avian influenza virus] case in Danzhai county on 17 Feb 2017. The case was found among unknown pneumonia cases during enhanced pneumonia surveillance by the local public health sector, confirmed by the provincial CDC lab and diagnosed as a human H7N9 AIV case by a clinical expert team.

The 45-year-old patient, who lived in Danzhai county of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong autonomous prefecture, is now in hospital for treatment, and no close contacts of the patient showed ILI symptoms under medical monitoring.

[2] China - review of case surge

A surge of H7N9 avian flu activity in China that began in December 2016 shows no sign of tailing off, with 61 new cases reported last week, pushing the mainland's total to at least 419 cases, 100 more than the previous high reported during the 2nd wave in 2013-14.

The latest numbers are from an update today [16 Feb 2017] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) covering mainland cases reported from 6-12 Feb 2017. The pace of cases reported for February 2017 so far puts the month on track to top the high number of cases seen in January 2017.

The CHP said the 61 newest cases were reported from 10 of China's provinces, about half of them reported from Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. Illness onsets range from 6 Jan 8 Feb 2017. Patient ages range from 22 to 85 years, and investigations so far reveal that 25 patients had been exposed to poultry or live-poultry markets before they became ill.

A spokesman for the CHP said in the statement that the number of cases in this wave is much higher than the same time last winter. "This shows that the situation is abnormal." The CHP said the big rise in H7N9 cases in the mainland has also resulted in imported cases detected in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.

Yesterday [15 Feb 2017], Hong Kong officials met to discuss the global avian flu situation, including bird outbreaks involving the H5N6 and H5N8 strains, and plans to enhance precautions in Hong Kong.

In a statement, the CHP said it will send letters to doctors urging them to be alert for avian flu illnesses in humans. Other steps include thermal imaging at boundary checkpoints to detect fevers in inbound travelers and the activation of an electronic portal to help with early identification, testing, and notification.

Chinese researchers have said that increased levels of H7N9 in poultry are likely driving the increase in human cases. Unlike other avian flu strains that cause disease in humans, H7N9 is a low-pathogenic strain in poultry, and infected birds don't usually show signs of illness.

An update yesterday [15 Feb 2017] from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provided a glimpse of recent poultry test findings, as well as an update on poultry market closures, a tactic used to stem past outbreaks.

The FAO said the Chinese agriculture ministry, as part of January 2017 surveillance, collected about 102 000 blood samples and about 55 000 virus swabs from birds at about 6600 locations across 26 provinces. 26 swabs tested positive for H7N9, most of them samples from market poultry in 4 provinces: Guangdong, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangsu. Serum sampling yielded 33 H7-positives from Guangdong and Shandong provinces.

Testing by provincial officials has also turned up positive tests that led to poultry market closures in cities in Guangdong and Hunan. After 4 human cases were detected in Sichuan province, authorities in one city shuttered 280 live-market stalls. On 11 Feb 2017, officials in Zhejiang province closed all poultry markets until further notice.

[A WHO analysis based on live-poultry market sampling for influenza viruses in Guangdong province in December [2016] has yielded 9.4 percent positive tests, with the level for H7 in Jiangsu province even higher, at 15.8 percent, most of it H7N9.

The report also mentioned that China has seen similar sudden increases in H7N9 activity in previous years, but the geographic spread is wider during the current 5th wave. According to the WHO, 3 clusters have been reported among the latest infections, a level similar to past seasons. So far, the WHO doesn't see any changes with the epidemiology of the disease.

The population immunity to H7N9 in China is still very low, with a seroprevalence study in poultry workers in 2015-16 showing 0.17 percent positivity.

Genetic analysis of recent strains from China and Hong Kong haven't shown any known markers for increased virulence or mammalian adaptation, though some showed differences in hemagglutinin substitutions compared with the candidate vaccine virus, which has prompted a review of whether the strain will protect against the currently circulating virus.

Three of 83 viruses tested showed markers for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, which are the most common antiviral drugs used against influenza, and testing is underway to gauge in vitro susceptibility.

The WHO also said that it sees no major transmission or virologic changes, and it warned that as long as people are exposed to infected animals, more illnesses can be expected [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/02/china-now-its-worst-h7n9-avian-flu-season-record].

This study and others indicate the importance of live-poultry market surveillance based on environmental sampling for H7N9 avian influenza control. Improving live-poultry market management and sanitation and changing consumer practices are critical to reduce the risk of H7N9 infection. - Mod.UBA
