Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Mauritania
---------------------------------------------------
As of Sat 8 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health, Mauritania has reported a
total of 30 cases (11 laboratory confirmed), including 6 deaths of
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). All cases except 3 have been
reported in the city of Nouakchott, the capital. The other cases were
reported in Trarza, Brakna, and Hodh Gharbi.

Laboratory confirmation was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the
Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. The Ministry of Health, WHO, and
partners from the public health sector have formed a Coordination Committee
to respond to the outbreak.

The Ministry of Health teams are carrying out active case finding and
contact tracing. A team of entomologists and virologists from the Institut
Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal are travelling to Nouakchott, Mauritania. WHO has
sent a complete kit of protective equipment for case management and hygiene
to the country.

CCHF is a viral haemorrhagic fever of the Nairovirus group. It is endemic in
many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia, and during 2001, cases were
recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, Pakistan, and South Africa. It was first
described in the Crimea in 1944 -- hence its name -- and is a severe disease
in humans, with a high mortality rate. However human illness occurs
infrequently while animal infection is more common. The virus is transmitted
by ticks.
