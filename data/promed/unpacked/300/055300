California BSE prion comes with a different twist
-------------------------------------------------
Reports of 'mad cow' disease in the United States erupted in the news this week [week of 23 Apr 2012] after the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed that the remains of a California dairy cow had tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This marks the 4th case of BSE identified in the US, and the 1st case in 6 years.

In spongiform encephalopathy diseases, abnormally folded prion proteins accumulate in the brain, causing other proteins to deform as well. BSE has proved to be unusually adept at jumping between species; humans exposed to BSE can develop its human counterpart: variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).

In a statement released on 24 Apr 2012, Karen Ross, Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture said, "The detection of BSE shows that the surveillance program in place in California and around the country is working." Food safety advocates such as Yonkers, New York,-based Consumers Union say it's a warning sign that surveillance is inadequate and needs to be stepped up. [Ross says this because the animal was detected. Some Food Safety experts believe the detection was a fluke and the surveillance is inadequate, and only catching a few, accidentally. - Mod.TG]

Ross's statement also makes a point of noting a key feature of this particular case: The infected cow carried what is known as 'L-type' BSE, a version of the disease that has not been detected before in the US and has so far not been associated with transmission through animal feed. As the policy debate over testing rumbles on, here is a short guide to what is known and not known about this rare strain and its unexpected appearance.

How do they know that it's 'L'? After brain tissue samples turned up inconclusive results in California, scientists at the USDA's Veterinary Research Laboratories in Ames, Iowa ran 2 additional biochemical tests and got positive results for BSE. The 2nd technique, western blotting, separates proteins based on their molecular weight to create a pattern on a gel. L-type prions have low weights, and another atypical strain, H-type prions have high weights compared to classic (C) strains. "This sample produced a clear L-type pattern," said Mark Hall, head of the pathology, parasitology, and entomology section at Ames.

How is it different from C? In addition to weighing less, L-type strains also produce different lesion profiles in the brain. Both H and L types are extremely rare and found in older cattle, with only around 30 reported cases each worldwide. Perhaps this contributes to the fact that we don't know much about them. "Right now, the full pathogenesis is not well characterized," says Hall of L-type. Unlike their classical counterparts, "past studies and current diagnostic tests to detect ruminant DNA and RNA in feed haven't found atypical variants," says Jim Cullor, a veterinarian at the University of California at Davis.

Is it more contagious? "There is some evidence in primates and transgenic mice that it seems to spread faster -- meaning it maybe more virulent -- but we don't know how representative these models are of the disease in humans," says Linda Detwiler, a clinical professor at Mississippi State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. Whether or not L-type could jump species without direct injection into the brain remains unclear, but so far it can transmit to transgenic humanized, ovinized (modified to genetically mimic sheep), bovinized, and normal mice, as well as macaques in the lab. [Likely Dr Detwiler meant to say non-human primates, as opposed to human-primates. However, even in non-human primates, a close link to humans is cause for concern. - Mod.TG]

How could this animal have contracted it? "We do know that L-type can transmit from one cow to another through injection in the brain," says Detwiler. "Long term studies are beginning to look at whether or not it's capable of transmission orally through feed, but we don't have the data yet."

Whether these strains have been around for a long time or recently developed is still unknown. "No one knows the origin at this point," says Detwiler. "It might be sporadic, similar to sporadic types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. It might be some kind of genetic mutation, or it could be a modification of classical BSE or TSE." In a 2008 study, out of all known cases of atypical BSE, only one contained a genetic mutation. So, a mutant cause can't be ruled out and could arise in countries that have never seen BSE. In humans, sporadic cases of CJD -- those that aren't caused by transmission from cattle -- occur at random in humans without a clear cause.

Could it spread? The USDA bans cow material in cow feed and "specific risk material" -- meaning bone, brain, and other organs where the disease persists -- from all livestock feed. "The L-type's infectivity alone reinforces the need for regulations," says Detwiler. "It's really important to monitor any emerging disease around the world so that we can change our policies if we need to."

Some feel that the regulations aren't enough. Michael Hansen, a senior staff scientist with Consumer's Union, notes that only 0.13 percent of the 30 million cattle that go to slaughter annually in the US are tested. "I would argue that's not enough," says Hansen. "The feed ban is not a firewall."

What happens next? The USDA has sent samples to official World Animal Health (OIE) reference labs in Canada and Great Britain. An on-site farm investigation may reveal more about the source and potential extent of infection.

Whether or not the case produces any astounding revelations in the coming weeks, it has already underscored the many general unknowns that researchers face when it comes to L-type. "It's important to look at whether it can transmit orally into to cattle or other species that consume feed, and to figure out where infection occurs in case we need to look for different high risk material," says Detwiler. "With continued research and epidemiology studies, we'll get more clues."

When a dairy cow in California was recently diagnosed with a rare form of mad cow disease, agriculture officials said the animal posed no danger to human health. The assurances are more than just platitudes, scientists and a new study in mice suggests.

On 24 Apr 2012, the US Department of Agriculture announced that a 10-year-old dairy cow had been found to have bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, often called mad cow disease. The cow was the 4th animal ever diagnosed with the disease in the United States. One of those cows, an animal imported from Canada, had the classical form of the disease caused by eating feed contaminated with infected brain and nervous system material from other cows.

But the new case does not appear to have been caused by contaminated feed. This case proved to be a spontaneous type of BSE. And a new study using mice suggests that it may be harder for this atypical BSE to cause disease in people compared with the more common form of BSE even if people are exposed to it.

All forms of BSE are prion diseases, which result when a normal brain protein called PrP twists into a different shape and then converts other normal copies of the protein into the disease-causing form. Such diseases strike many different animals, including sheep, deer, elk, and people. In atypical forms of BSE, the PrP protein probably folds into slightly different shapes compared with the ones caused by eating contaminated feed. Scientists have found 2 atypical forms, the H-type and the L-type. The California dairy cow had the L-type.

About one in a million people contract the human form of prion disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). That disease strikes sporadically, meaning that it appears seemingly at random and doctors and scientists don't know why. The human disease that stems from eating beef infected with BSE, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has been recorded in only 224 cases according to the World Health Organization.

So far, no humans are known to have contracted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from cattle infected with atypical BSE.

Whereas the classical form of BSE usually strikes cattle between 4 and 8 years old, the atypical form is found in cattle older than 8 years old. No one knows exactly how often the atypical form of the disease appears in cattle, but over a 6-year period, French surveillance programs detected 13 cases of atypical BSE in 3.6 million cattle over 8 years old, says Thierry Baron, a neuroscientist at the French national food safety agency in Lyon.

Baron and his colleagues published a study in the January 2012 'Emerging Infectious Diseases' suggesting that mouse lemurs could contract the L-type of atypical BSE more easily than the classical version of the prion disease. The reason no humans have contracted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from cattle infected with L-type BSE may simply be a numbers game, he says: The disease occurs far too infrequently for people to get exposed to it.

But it may actually be harder for the L-type prion to corrupt human PrP than it is for the classical form of the prion, Rona Barron, a molecular biologist at the University of Edinburgh and colleagues, including Baron, report online 11 Apr 2012 in the 'Journal of General Virology'. The researchers created mice that make the human version of PrP in their brains at normal levels. Atypical BSE, chronic wasting disease (a prion disease in deer and elk), and atypical forms of scrapie (a sheep prion disease) all failed to cause disease in the mice.

Her study is hardly the last word on the infectious potential of atypical BSE, Barron says. Other substances in the brain may have a hand in determining whether PrP will go rogue. Regardless of how infectious the atypical prion is, worldwide surveillance efforts and bans on including the brain and nervous system of cattle in food and feed are doing a good job of keeping all prions out of the food supply, she says. "I don't think there is a cause for mass hysteria."

[There seem to be a couple of prevalent themes in these 2 pieces:
1. This cow had the L-form of BSE.
2. The L-form may be more dangerous, perhaps even to people, however this is not clear.
3. This type of BSE does not appear to be transmitted through feed.
4. Research on the mechanism of transmission, if any, and general characterization are lacking.
5. Surveillance may be inadequate as there may be more of these animals out there and the danger to humans is not well known. - Mod.TG
