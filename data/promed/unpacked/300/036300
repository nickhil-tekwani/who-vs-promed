More than 50 cows, sheep, and horses have died in France's most serious outbreak of anthrax in 2 decades, according to officials who have warned of a vaccine shortage. Authorities in the mountainous Hautes-Alpes [Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur] region of southeastern France said the infection, which can spread to humans and is deadly in its rarest forms, had spread to 28 farms since June [2018].

French vets have been battling to contain the outbreak because the Spanish laboratory which produces the vaccines has been closed throughout August [2018] for the summer vacation. "The state is in talks with its European partners to discuss the availability and purchase of vaccines" which other countries may have stockpiled, said senior regional official Agnes Chavanon [Sun 19 Aug 2018].

Cases of anthrax being passed on to humans are "extremely rare", said Christine Ortmans, a doctor with regional health agency ARS. No one has been reported ill during the current outbreak, she stressed. [Not "extremely rare." This depends on circumstances, but as anthrax is now sporadic in Europe the expectation of human cases is slight. But as farmers are now less experienced with this disease, they are more likely to do stupid things putting themselves and their stockmen at risk. - Mod.MHJ]

Senior Hautes-Alpes official Serge Cavalli said animals were being vaccinated at affected farms in the region. Those [herds] hit have been banned from production for at least 21 days while the farms are disinfected, and to provide time for the vaccinated animals to become immune. Any milk on site is pasteurised and then destroyed.

The last serious French outbreak was in 2008 when anthrax spread to 23 farms, most of them in the eastern Doubs area.

The 1st case in the current outbreak was detected in the village of Montgardin on [28 Jun 2018], killing 6 cows, and has since spread to 12 others [cows or herds? - Mod.MHJ]. Cows struck by anthrax swell in the abdomen and bleed from their orifices, and often die in less than 24 hours. The disease is fairly rare, although more than 100 cases have been registered at French farms since 1999 -- often during hot summers after periods of heavy rain.

The ARS said 103 people in the Hautes-Alpes region had been flagged as having potentially come into contact with infected animals, most of them farmers, vets or slaughterhouse workers. Half have been given preventative antibiotics, according to officials.

[There is confusion in the numbers of animals and farms affected. This report seems to have been assembled from a number of sources. But the opening statements have over 50 head of various livestock clinically acutely affected on some 28 farms. This spread is typical of summer epidemics when biting flies (tabanids) are involved as they can take the infection from herd to herd, from neighbouring pastures to some 15+ kms out.

In Europe it is traditional to go on holiday in August. Thus, the Spanish vaccine may be unavailable. However, a good source is
