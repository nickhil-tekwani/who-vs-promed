Health officials are investigating a local _Escherichia coli_ outbreak potentially tied to 4 Seattle-area restaurants that is separate from a national outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from Salinas, California. At least 7 people have been infected in the local outbreak, and 6 of them reported eating raw vegetables or leafy greens at 4 different Evergreens restaurants in King County.

All 7 of the victims were affected by the same strain of _E. coli_, which is different from the strain in the national outbreak. One ill person was hospitalized locally, and all have since recovered. The 4 Evergreen restaurants where the victims ate all have excellent food safety ratings, and health officials say it's possible that the local outbreak could be the result of a contaminated product delivered to and served at Evergreens.

"We are still investigating and do not yet have conclusive results about what caused the outbreak," said Public Health Seattle-King County in a prepared statement.

Illness onsets occurred between 10-15 Nov 2019. Meal dates were between 5-11 Nov 2019. _E. coli_ symptoms include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea. An investigation determined that all 4 Evergreens restaurants practise proper sanitizing practices to help prevent the spread of _E. coli_. Evergreens restaurants also discarded all romaine lettuce products from their stores, including romaine on the line and in coolers.

The public health department is working with the state Department of Agriculture and US Department of Agriculture on tracing back the distributors and sources for ingredients the ill people consumed in their meals.

[Although not specifically stated, this small cluster of cases is likely due to an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. The posting states that the strain was different from the current outbreak of serotype O157 from romaine lettuce but it is unclear if it is a different strain of O157 or a different serotype altogether (such as O111 or O26). - Mod.LL
