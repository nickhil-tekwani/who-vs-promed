China
Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. 9 new
cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each from Inner
Mongolia and Sichuan provinces. Ningxia, a poor province in the
remote western part of the country, announced its first case today.
Beijing reported no new cases and no new deaths. Today's figures do
not include cases in Beijing's military hospitals. The military
hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to
health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over
the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing's military
hospitals yesterday. The recent decision of military hospitals in
Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an
important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged
by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in
provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS
teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the
severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the
government.
An additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.
Hong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster
The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of
Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of
an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster
of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The
report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine
whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the
large and unusual cluster of SARS cases.
As of 15 Apr 2003, health authorities had reported a total of 321
individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A
large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats
in a single building, Block E.
Attention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system.
Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high
proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60
percent. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically
been seen in only 2 to 7 percent of cases. WHO epidemiologists are
now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by
Hong Kong's Department of Health.
Status of diagnostic tests
Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in
Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month.
The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that
a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent
that causes SARS.
With the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top
priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first
step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of
SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also
building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at
different stages of disease, including recovery.
Such a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test
that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people
become capable of infecting others. It will also help identify the
stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely
return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.
Other plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic
library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the
world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the
coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network
laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine
research and development.
Existing PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule
out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or
probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.
WHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is
being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at
no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of
security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.
Without a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted
with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate
patients and manage them according to strict infection control
practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for
patients and place a considerable strain on health services.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have
been reported from 25 countries. Countries reporting their first
probable cases on today's list include Australia (3) and Mongolia
(3). A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further
investigation, to have other, common causes.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 17 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 17 Apr 2003, there are an additional 29 patients confirmed
to have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals
earlier. They include 9 healthcare workers (3 from Alice Ho Miu Ling
Nethersole Hospital, 3 from Prince of Wales Hospital, one from
Princess Margaret Hospital, one from United Christian Hospital, and
one from Shatin Hospital). The remaining 20 were other patients and
contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 272 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and
have been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 15 were
discharged today. 118 patients are receiving treatment in intensive
care unit.
4 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 65 the total number of
deaths related to atypical pneumonia. A female and a male, both aged
69 and with a history of chronic disease, died in Tuen Mun Hospital.
A 39-year-old female died in United Christian Hospital. Another
chronically ill male patient, aged 42, died in Tseung Kwan O Hospital.
The cumulative figures for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative total no. cases/ no. discharged/ total no. deaths
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 307/ 102/ 65
Patients, family members & visitors: 990/ 170/ 0
Total: 1297/ 272/ 65
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a
relatively late stage of infection.

SARS Situation Update 17 Apr 2003
As of 17 Apr 2003, 4 additional SAR patient has been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to
95. 61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.
There are 4 additional SARS cases reported today. 2 of them were
linked to the [Singapore General Hospital] SGH cluster. One of them
is an inpatient of Ward 57 who had been transferred to [Tan Tock Seng
Hospital] TTSH for observation on 7 Apr 2003, while the other is a
visitor. The third case is a patient who was in the same ward as a
SARS patient in [National University Hospital] NUH before this
patient was diagnosed as SARS on 9 Apr 2003. As a precaution the 6
other patients who were warded in the same cubicle as the SARS
patient were transferred to isolation rooms in NUH for observation on
9 Apr 2003 The third case reported today is one of them. He developed
fever on 14 Apr 2003 and was transferred to TTSH on the same day. As
of today, the other 5 patients remain well.
The fourth case is a 53-year-old Chinese man who developed fever,
body aches, and diarrhoea on the evening of 9 Apr 2003 when he was
home. He works as a taxi driver. On 10 Apr 2003, he consulted a
[General Practitioner] GP after working from 6 AM to 9 AM. He
remained at home for the rest of that day and the next. On 12 Apr
2003, he consulted a GP again. As he was still unwell, he was
admitted to TTSH that afternoon. Apart from the 3 hours on 10 Apr
2003, he did not work on 11 and 12 Apr 2003. On 14 Apr 2003, his
chest x-ray showed changes and he was diagnosed as atypical
pneumonia. He was not classified as SARS as there was no history of
contact. However, as a precaution, home quarantine orders where
issued to 10 of his close contacts. So far they are all well except
for his 54-year-old wife, who was admitted on 15 Apr 2003 for fever.
Today, laboratory samples taken from the patient were positive for
coronavirus. In view of this finding, he has been classified as a
probable SARS case and his wife as a suspect SARS case. They are both
in stable condition. He gives a history of ferrying passengers to
hospitals. He does not ply the airport route. Investigations to
determine the source of infection are still on going.
Update on Jurong Shipyard
A 47-year-old Malaysian who lived and worked in Singapore travelled
to Pontian, Johore [Malaysia] from 24 to 30 Mar 2003 to attend his
father's funeral. He returned to Singapore on 31 Mar 2003. He was a
welder in Jurong Shipyard and returned to work from 1 to 7 Apr 2003,
excluding 2 Apr 2003, as it was his day off. On 8 Apr 2003 he stayed
at home and did not work as he was feeling unwell. He consulted a GP
on 9 Apr 2003 for fever, cough and breathlessness. He did not return
to work from 8 to 12 Apr 2003. He was admitted to Alexandra Hospital
on 12 Apr 2003. On admission his chext x-ray showed evidence of
pneumonia. As his condition was serious, he was intubated and later
transferred on the same day to TTSH Intensive Care. He died on 13 Apr
2003. As a precautionary measure, home quarantine orders were served
to 13 of his contacts. Laboratory investigations have revealed that
he had an infection of the blood caused by a bacterium,
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_. So far, post-mortem samples of the lung,
spleen, intestine, and lymph nodes are negative for coronavirus.
Further post-mortem test results are still pending.
Deceased child
So far, the preliminary laboratory investigations for the child who
died of acute respiratory distress syndrome at KKH on 15 Apr 2003 are
negative for coronavirus. Further post-mortem test results are still
pending.
Summary of SARS cases
Below is the summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 95
Hospitalised: 61 (including 17 in intensive care)
Deaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)
Total: 171
Suspected: 80 (including 8 children below 18)

[As of 17 Apr 2003 the cumulative totals are 3389 cases and 165
deaths reported to WHO from a total of 25 countries. Australia and
Mongolia were newly added to the list of countries, with 3 cases
reported by each country in the preceding 24 hours. There were 29
new cases reported from Hong Kong, 25 from China, and 5 from
Singapore within the past 24 hours. According to the WHO update, the
collaborating teams in China identified additional cases of SARS
hospitalized in military hospitals. China, like many other countries
in the world, has not previously had a unified disease surveillance
system that combines reports from the military sector with those from
the civilian sector. According to the WHO update, this coordination
is about to begin in China, and therefore when the first reports from
the military sector are made, there will be an artificial marked
increase in reported cases over a 24-hour period (the increase will
be based on new reports in a 24-hour period and not on date of onset).
A news wire report was submitted by Pablo Nart <p.nart@virgin.net>
about a possible new cluster of cases in Hong Kong associated with a
housing block other than the Amoy Gardens. Results of an
epidemiologic and environmental study conducted at the Amoy Gardens
to identify the routes of transmission are currently under review by
the WHO epidemiology team. Of interest was the observation that 60
percent of the SARS cases related to the Amoy Gardens cluster had
diarrhea, whereas other clusters had observed rates of diarrhea
between 2 and 7 percent We look forward to seeing a report based on
the results of this study. - Mod.MPP]
