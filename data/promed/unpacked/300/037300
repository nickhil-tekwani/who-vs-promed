Abstract
--------
Bats have been gaining attention as potential reservoir hosts of numerous viruses pathogenic to animals and man. Issyk-Kul virus, a member of the family _Nairoviridae_, was first isolated in the 1970s from vespertilionid bats in Central Asia. Issyk-Kul virus has been described as a human-pathogenic virus, causing febrile outbreaks in humans with headaches, myalgia and nausea. Here we describe the detection of a novel strain of Issyk-Kul virus from _Eptesicus nilssonii_ in Germany. This finding indicates for the 1st time the prevalence of these zoonotic viruses in Europe.

Issyk-Kul virus, further characterized in the above cited work, is an orthonairovirus, like the Nairobi sheep disease orthonairovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Dugbe virus and Ganjam virus. They are highly pathogenic to animals and humans.

The virus was described already more than 40 years ago in Central Asia. The findings show for the 1st time the abundance of this virus in Europe and within the species _Eptesicus nilsonii_. _E. nilsonii_ is a common bat distributed throughout Asia and Europe (including the polar regions). - Mod.PMB
