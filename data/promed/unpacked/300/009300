I believe all flights into Australia must be sprayed with insecticide
before landing. This has certainly been the case each time l have flown
back here from abroad.
I have been told (although I have not heard from any official sources) that
is to kill any fruit pests (a problem here) that may be on the plane.
I don't known about New Zealand, I'm afraid.

I was asked by some of the airlines flying into London Heathrow whether
spraying was indicated. After consultation with Dr Marci Layton [Asst.
Commissioner of Health, NYC in New York I advised that spraying was not
required. This decision was based on the information that the airports in
New York were not in the affected areas, and estimates of vector density in
the affected areas [low & getting lower. - Mod.JW.
The same advice was given to airlines flying into London's second biggest
airport, Gatwick.

When aircraft are sprayed to prevent transport of pests, it is usually
external spraying only, particularly the wheel wells and other potential
hiding places. To my knowledge, spraying of the cabin areas is never done.
It's possible that they may spray the cargo areas, but either way this
would be invisible to the passengers.

[Admittedly it was some years ago, but I remember being on a flight on
which, after landing but before the doors were opened, a flight attendant
announced that we would be sprayed according to the regulations of the
airport of arrival, then walked down the aisle with an aerosol can held
over her head, spraying the cabin. I also read that some aircraft were
being fitted with a way to inject pesticide spray directly into the
ventilation system, & that concerns were expressed about possible allergic
reactions by some passengers, or problems with asthmatics. WHO issued
regulations about permissible levels of passenger aircraft spraying in the
1980s. - Mod.JW

In years past, CDC had a field station in El Salvador. We routinely made
it a habit of carrying mosquitoes in our pocket and in the overhead. The
cabin attendant would wander down the aisle with a can of insecticide and
upon arrival in Miami all of our mosquitoes were alive and well. So much
for efficacy.
If disinfection is to be accomplished it will depend upon the receiving
country's health or agriculture authorities to do the work, and that means
parking the arriving plane on the tarmac and spraying the plane on the
ground. Meanwhile there are irate passengers, crew, customs, immigration,
etc. fuming at the fumigation. For this to be accomplished there has to be
much better evidence of risk from the hitch hiking mosquitoes.
Being neither a virologist nor entomologist I brazenly wonder if a host
that is capable of greater amplification [than a mosquito is more likely
to be a culprit. I assume there are investigations of bird importations to
zoos and parks as well as flight patterns of "migrating crows."

[Much as I hesitate to disagree with the eminent former Director of CDC &
New York City Health Commissioner, the second paragraph. recalls the common
bureaucratic response "We don´t install a traffic light at an intersection
until someone gets killed there." Given the numerous cases of airport
malaria -- where malaria-carrying mosquitoes have arrived by plane at
various European airports, disembarked & bitten a number of innocent
bystanders, causing them to get quite sick, cases of airport West Nile
fever can readily be imagined. If spraying the cabins as described above,
& the wheel wells, doesn´t do the trick, & if the WHO aircraft spraying
recommendations don´t either, perhaps we need some more input from our
entomologist colleagues.
I know quite well that only a fraction of the people bitten by a
WNV-carrying mosquito get encephalitis, but I´m thinking about when yellow
fever virus gets into a city where peri-airport _Aedes aegypti_ control is
inadequate, & the consequences of infected mosquitoes arriving in New Delhi
or Bangkok. - Mod.JW
