Indonesia bird flu death toll hits 100
--------------------------------------
A 23 year old Indonesian woman from East Jakarta has died from bird flu,
taking the country's death toll to 100, according to a report from
Indonesia's bird flu information centre on Monday [28 Jan 2008]. The woman
died on Sunday [27 Jan 2008] and 2 separate laboratory tests confirmed she
had contracted H5N1, the report said.
Earlier on Monday [28 Jan 2008], a 9 year old Indonesian boy who had tested
positive for bird flu died, the health ministry said in a statement. The
boy from the outskirts of Jakarta died at the Sulianto Saroso hospital on
Sunday [27 Jan 2008] after being treated in different hospitals for 2
weeks, said Joko Suyono, an official at the ministry's bird flu information
centre. It was not known how the boy contracted the disease.
Indonesia has had the highest number of human deaths from bird flu of any
country. A 31 year old woman and 32 year old man hospitalized at
Persahabatan hospital for fever and respiratory problems also tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 virus on Monday [28 Jan 2008], the ministry
said. According to the statement, the woman lived in East Jakarta near a
poultry slaughterhouse that kept many fowl believed to be the source of her
H5N1 infection. The man from Tangerang, west of Jakarta, is believed to
have contracted H5N1 from his neighbor's pet doves, the ministry said.
Contact with sick fowl is the most common way of contracting bird flu,
endemic in bird populations in most of Indonesia. Although bird flu remains
an animal disease, experts fear the virus could mutate into a form easily
passed from human to human and kill millions. Suyono said there are no
obvious explanations for the sudden surge of cases. "We need to carry more
tests and investigation first to be really sure."
