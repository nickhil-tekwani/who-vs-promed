[As a consequence of the fact that WHO no longer requires countries to test
and report individual cases, the number of cases reported actually
understates the real number of cases. Therefore ProMED-mail will no longer
post weekly updates of case counts. Readers wishing to follow the global
course of the pandemic should use the URLs listed toward the end of part
[1] to access the excellent weekly maps provided by WHO, and the PAHO map
cited at the end of part [2]. - Mod.CP]

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO update 70
------------------------------------
Weekly update:
As of 11 October 2009, worldwide there have been more than 399 232
laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 and more than
4735 deaths reported to WHO.

As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of
milder illness, the case count is significantly lower than the actual
number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress
of the pandemic through frequent consultations with its regional offices
and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.

Influenza activity continues to increase in the northern temperate zones
across the world. In North America, the United States is now experiencing
nationwide rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) well above seasonal
baseline rates with high rates of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus detections in
clinical laboratory specimens. Canada is reporting increases in ILI rates
for the 3rd straight week with some provinces now crossing the baseline.
Mexico also reports high intensity and active transmission in some areas of
the country. Western Europe and northern Asia are experiencing increased
rates of ILI, well above baseline in some countries but activity is
generally not as widespread as in North America. Of note, nearly half of
the influenza viruses detected in China are seasonal influenza A (H3N2)
viruses, which appeared prior to and is co-circulating with pandemic H1N1
2009 virus.

The tropical zones continue to have transmission that is mixed as some
countries have now peaked and are declining, while others are experiencing
increases. In the tropical region of the Americas, several Caribbean Island
nations are now reporting increased rates of illness while Brazil, Costa
Rica and other countries on the continent are declining. In South Asia,
most countries now report a decline in rates of illness.

Influenza rates in the temperate zones of the Southern Hemisphere have all
returned to below baseline levels and very few detections of pandemic H1N1
2009 virus are being reported.

Articles of interest published this week in the peer reviewed literature
reported 3 different series of seriously ill pandemic influenza patients in
Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand. Several important observations
were made including:

- a significant portion of patients with severe disease requiring intensive
care had no predisposing conditions. The numbers are not directly
comparable as the studies categorized conditions differently but nearly a
third of ICU patients in Australia and New Zealand had no predisposing
conditions. 98 per cent of ICU cases in Canada had a comorbid condition,
which in this report included hypertension, smoking, and substance abuse,
but only 30 per cent had comorbid conditions that were considered "major".
In Mexico, 84 per cent of critical patients had an underlying condition,
which in the report included hypertension, ever having smoked, and
hyperlipidemia, conditions that are not considered risk factors for severe
influenza outcomes. All 3 groups were impressed by the number of severe
cases occurring in previously healthy individuals.

- researchers in Australia and New Zealand reaffirmed that infants under
the age of 1 year have the highest risk of developing severe illness. The
average age of ICU patients was 32, 40, and 44 years in Canada,
Australia/New Zealand, and Mexico, respectively.

- the study from Australia and New Zealand estimated that the demand for
ICU beds due to viral pneumonia during the pandemic was as much higher than
in previous influenza seasons. The Canadian study reported that intensive
care capacity in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was "seriously challenged" at the peak
of the outbreak with full occupancy of all regional ICU beds.

All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been
antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like pandemic
H1N1 2009 virus.

Systematic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza Surveillance
Network (GISN), continues to detect sporadic incidents of H1N1 pandemic
viruses that show resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir.

The maps referred to below display information on the qualitative
indicators reported. Information is available for about 60 countries each
week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness
of reporting is expected to increase over time.

Regional update. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-------------------------------------
I: Evolution of the pandemic
----------------------------
North America
In Canada, Mexico, and the United States trends in acute respiratory
disease continued to increase and the intensity of such diseases remained
high this week. Canada has experienced increased national rate of ILI
[influenza-like illness] consultation, above what is expected for this time
of year since week 37.

The geographic spread of influenza continued to be widespread. Based on
information available from Mexico's webpage, as of 13 Oct 2009, the
greatest numbers of cumulative laboratory-confirmed cases were seen in the
Federal District, Chiapas, Yucatan, Nuevo Leon, Jalisco, San Luis Potosi,
and Tamaulipas. When comparing with cases reported in the previous week (8
Oct 2009), the greatest increases were observed in Nayarit, Durango, Nuevo
Leon, Sonora, Morelos, and Guerrero.

Caribbean
Few Caribbean countries reported qualitative indicators for this week, but
those who did reported increasing or unchanged trends in acute respiratory
disease. Reporting CAREC [Caribbean Epidemiology Center] countries,
maintain a low level of respiratory disease activity, but there have been
reports of outbreaks in school settings.

Cuba continued to report a high intensity of acute respiratory disease.
Overall, impact on health care services due to acute respiratory disease
was moderate.

Central America
Most countries providing an update this week report widespread geographic
spread of influenza except for El Salvador, which continues to report
regional spread. Trends of acute respiratory disease were reported as
decreasing or unchanged, with the exception of El Salvador, which reported
a new increasing trend. The intensity of acute respiratory disease was
mostly low/moderate, again with the exception of El Salvador, which again
reported high intensity. Impact on heath care services due to acute
respiratory disease was low or moderate.

South America
Andean
This sub-region still notes moderate pandemic influenza activity compared
to southern temperate regions, albeit in decreasing trends. Colombia was
the only country to report an increasing trend of acute respiratory
disease. The impact on health services of acute respiratory disease was low
or moderate.

Southern Cone
The Southern Cone of South America is experiencing a decrease in intensity
of respiratory disease, except in Paraguay, which newly reported a high
intensity. For the remaining countries in this sub-region the situation
reported remains largely unchanged since last EW.

Weekly Summary
- the intensity of acute respiratory diseases in North America was high in
Canada, Mexico, and the US
- in Central America had a low or moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease; with the exception of El Salvador, which had a high intensity of
acute respiratory disease and an increasing trend of acute respiratory disease
- Caribbean countries reported increasing or unchanged trends in acute
respiratory disease, with outbreaks in schools.
- most of South America had a decreasing trend and low or moderate
intensity of acute respiratory disease; Colombia, however, had an
increasing trend in acute respiratory disease
- 81.95 per cent of subtyped influenza A viruses were pandemic (H1N1) 2009
- 133 new confirmed deaths in 10 countries (3539 cumulative deaths)

II: Descriptions of hospitalizations and deaths among confirmed cases of
pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-----------------------------------------------
Among hospitalized confirmed cases (data tabulated in the original
document), about half were women. While the greatest number of cases was
among young adults, the highest rates of hospitalization were observed in
children.

Pregnant women also had a higher burden of morbidity and mortality. In
Canada, while 1 per cent of the population is pregnant in a given year,
about 5 per cent of hospitalized cases and 5 per cent of the deaths were in
this group.

The Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) reports that 30 per cent of the
hospitalized cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, which is
higher than what was seen in non-hospitalized cases (20 per cent).

In assessing the deaths among confirmed cases, women represent 49 to 60 per
cent. The deaths have taken place mostly among adults. More than two thirds
of deceased cases had underlying comorbidities, and the percentage of
pregnant women ranges from 20 to 27 per cent.

III: Virus circulation
----------------------
For the purpose of this analysis, only countries which reported data on
influenza A subtypes were considered.

We excluded from the calculations of the percentages results from samples
of influenza A that were not subtyped or were unsubtypeable. Until week 39,
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 appears to continue to be the influenza virus in
circulation.

IV: Antiviral resistance
------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) complete antiviral
susceptibility testing on isolates submitted by various countries in the
Region. To date, all 163 samples submitted from 18 countries have been
found to be sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and
zanamivir) but resistant to adamantanes.

As of week 40, the United States and Canada each reported a new case of
oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009, bringing their total to 13 and
3 cases, respectively.

As of 16 Oct 2009, a total of 160 129 confirmed cases have been notified in
all 35 countries in the Americas Region. A total of 3539 deaths have been
reported among the confirmed cases in 26 countries of the Region. Trinidad
and Tobago reported its 1st deaths during this epidemiological week.

The following overseas territories have confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1)
2009: American Samoa, US Territory (8); Guam, US Territory (1); Puerto
Rico, US Territory (20); Virgin Islands, US Territory (49); Bermuda, UK
Overseas Territory (1); Cayman Islands, UK Overseas Territory (103, 1
death); British Virgin Islands, UK Overseas Territory (12); Turks and
Caicos Islands (36); Martinique, French Overseas Community (44, 1 death);
Guadeloupe, French Overseas Community (27); Guyane, French Overseas
Community (29, 1 death); Saint-Martin, French Overseas Community (19);
Saint Bartholomew, French Overseas Community (2); Netherlands Antilles,
Aruba (13); Netherlands Antilles, Bonaire (31); Netherlands Antilles,
Curacao (50)*; Netherlands Antilles, St. Eustatius (1); and Netherlands
Antilles, St. Maarten (24). (* 3 cases were reported on a cruise-ship.)

The distribution of cases and deaths at the 1st sub-national level can be
