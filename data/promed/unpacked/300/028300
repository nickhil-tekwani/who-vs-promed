The Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health has classified the mysterious condition that recently emerged among school students of Al Taweisha locality in North Darfur as cases of hysteria and not paralysis. [A diagnosis of "paralysis" had previously been made for patients seen at El Fasher Teaching Hospital about 1 week ago. See a related news report at https://www.radiodabanga.org/node/65964.]

A report issued by the Federal Department of Epidemiology has acknowledged 90 cases at Al Taweisha Hospital after the federal investigation team's arrival. They report 30 cases of hysteria on [23 Jan 2014] among basic schoolgirls between 7-14 years. The Epidemiology Department statement pointed out that after the arrival of the team, the cases rose to more than 90, complaining of abdominal pain and headaches.

These were diagnosed as hysteria after ruling out all other diseases. Likewise, 90 cases from a school for boys at the same village, were also diagnosed as hysteria. The statement reported 2 cases at the same school on [29 Jan 2014], followed by 7 new cases recorded in the following day, ruling out contaminated meals at schools in the region.
