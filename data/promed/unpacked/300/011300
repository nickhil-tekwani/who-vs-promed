Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (VSF), an international non-governmental organization, last week started rolling out 3400 anthrax vaccine doses for cattle and other livestock in Mayom County in Unity State, a state official said. Johnson Bol, the director general of the ministry of animal resources and fisheries in Unity State, confirmed receipt of the vaccines and said the vaccination campaign targets over 8450 livestock.

"We have started a plan for a livestock vaccination campaign for the next year in June 2023 to vaccinate animals against anthrax," he said. "As you have heard, flooding affected animals in Mayom County and anthrax broke out 5 months ago and it was confirmed by the state ministry of health through the national laboratory. So, there is a need to vaccinate animals against anthrax."

Meanwhile, Francis Kamau, VSF's emergency response officer, said they plan to vaccinate cattle and other livestock including sheep and goats. "What we have donated is anthrax vaccines and medicine for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), black quarter, and hemorrhagic septicemia," he said. "These vaccines are for animals and small ruminants."

Kamau however advised the public not to consume meat from dead animals due to the ongoing infection. Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. It occurs naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals.

["Mayom County is an administrative region in Unity State, South Sudan to the west of Bentiu. The county headquarters is Mayom. Mayom County is in the northwest of Unity State. The largest town is Mayom. Other towns are Tam, Mankien and Wang-kay. Large villages include Rier, Thargana, Buoth, Wicok and Toic. Mayom lies in the Block 4 oil concession to the south of the Kaikang oilfield." For a map showing the location of this county, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayom_County.

This is an excellent policy, both in itself and by utilising the normal spring vaccinations against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), black quarter, and hemorrhagic septicemia -- all dangerous and expensive livestock diseases. We look forward to seeing how it works out and in hope that other countries will following this South Sudan vaccination policy. Thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
