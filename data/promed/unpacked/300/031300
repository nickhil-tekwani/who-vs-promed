The Ministry of Health has confirmed that, as of Tue 2 Oct 2007, a
total of 25 out of 76 suspected cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever
from the province of Kasai Occidental have now tested positive for
the disease. A further 187 contacts are currently under medical
observation and will remain so until each has reached the end of
their respective potential incubation periods without developing any
symptoms of the disease.
Although there is now strong clinical and epidemiological evidence to
suggest that the outbreak is slowing, identifying and isolating all
suspect cases is still a priority for the response teams to ensure
that the chains of transmission are broken. This includes following
up any contacts over the incubation period in order to isolate them
immediately if they become ill. Two consecutive incubation periods
must elapse, a total of 42 days following the identification and
isolation of the last confirmed case, before the outbreak is
considered controlled.
The international response team, with the participation of members of
the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, is continuing to work
with the Ministry of Health in all areas of disease control including
community health education, social mobilization, contact tracing,
clinical management, infection control in health facilities and rapid
on-site laboratory diagnosis. The international team is also
assisting in conducting retrospective epidemiological studies to
further characterize the outbreak.
