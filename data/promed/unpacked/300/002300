[Sheep pox and goat pox is a viral disease that was considered eradicated in Spain since 1968, although sporadic cases had been detected within the EU, the last ones in Greece and Bulgaria in 2014. It also remains endemic in Africa (including countries in the north of the continent, such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), as well as in the Middle East and Asia.

The Official Veterinary Services (OVS) of the Regional Government (Junta) of Andalusia have notified on 19 Sep 2022 an outbreak of sheep and goat Pox in a breeding sheep farm with a census of 314 sheep and 11 goats, located in the municipality of Benamaurel, in the province of Granada.

The suspicion arose from the appearance and communication of clinical signs and lesions compatible with the disease to the OVS of the Regional Government of Andalusia on 14 Sep 2022. The OVS went to the farm, detecting 50 clinically affected sheep (30 dead), in which the corresponding data collection was carried out. Samples were taken for analysis at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LCV) of the MAPA in Algete (Madrid), the national reference laboratory for the disease in Spain. The samples were confirmed as positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for sheep pox virus.

The Andalusian authorities have immediately adopted the control measures contemplated in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/687 of the Commission, which completes Regulation (EU) 2016/429 of the European Parliament and of the Council about standards relating to disease prevention and control of the disease.
