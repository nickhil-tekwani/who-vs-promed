A Comment on the Isolation of Avian Influenza Virus from Wild Birds
-------------------------------------------------------------------
While I understand the concerns about avian influenza A (H5N1) virus and the
possibility that it could evolve into a pandemic influenza strain, why does
there seem to be so much dire concern about the isolation of avian influenza
virus strains from wild birds? From my reading, wild waterfowl are a natural
reservoir for avian strains of influenza virus. This has been probably the
case for thousands of years.
Obviously if one looks, one will always be able to find one avian influenza
virus strain or another from wild waterfowl. However, what does that really
mean with respect to human health? Our species has lived more or less in
harmony with waterfowl for millennia.
By all means, we should seek to gain greater knowledge about the ecology and
epidemiology of avian influenza virus strains. However, I can't see how all
these rather panicky accounts of isolations from various parts of the world
are particularly helpful. Some clarification about this would be very helpful.

[The initial concern following the rapid spread of highly pathogenic variants
of avian influenza A (H7N7) virus in the Netherlands and avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus in East Asia was that there might be greater opportunity for
interaction between avian and mammalian strains of influenza virus to interact
in a common host (a "mixing vessel"), facilitating reassortment of genome sub-
units and evolution of a pandemic virus carrying surface antigens to which the
human population had not been exposed. This has not happened and in the past
has been an extremely rare event (there has been one major pandemic and 2
lesser pandemics since 1900).
Concern has shifted to the possibility that the spread of influenza virus from
waterfowl, where transmission probably occurs predominantly by an enteric
route, to domestic (terrestrial) poultry, where transmission may occur
predominantly by a respiratory route, a circumstance that may promote the
evolution of viruses with enhanced virulence for mammals and a propensity to
spread by a respiratory route. There is some circumstantial evidence that such
a process may be occurring.
Dr. Gould may be correct to state that our species has lived more or less in
harmony with waterfowl for millennia, but the changed dynamic is the vast
increase in recent years of the production and global trading of poultry as a
source of food for an ever-expanding human population. My personal opinion,
however, is that Dr. Gould is correct to query the relevance of the spread of
avian influenza viruses by migratory birds as a factor in spread of human
disease. It is more likely that a novel pandemic virus would spread along
trade and communications routes rather than via the migratory pathways of free-
living birds. The evidence so far is equivocal.
Outbreaks of disease have occurred along migratory routes, but the majority of
migrating birds have proven to be free of H5N1 virus, and the minority of
birds exhibiting disease may be victims rather than carriers of disease
(the "dead birds do not migrate" hypothesis). The most westerly H5N1-positive
bird (recovered in Finland) carried a low-pathogenicity -- possibly
indigenous -- virus (see ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza - Europe (08):
Finland, seagull, LPAI, conf. 20050830.2560).
I favour Dr. Gould's contention that the current spate of accounts of
detection of H5N1-positive free-living birds is not particularly helpful and
requires critical evaluation. - Mod.CP]
