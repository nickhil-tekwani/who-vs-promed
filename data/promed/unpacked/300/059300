MAREK'S DISEASE - ECUADOR (GALAPAGOS ISLANDS)
=============================================
Date: Thu, 08 May 1997 16:20:25 -0900
From: afdcd1@UAA.ALASKA.EDU (Dr. David Duffy)
The 'latest' Conservation Biology, Feb 1997, reports in a note in an
article on alien plant threats in Galapagos (vol. 11, page 262) a December
1995 outbreak of Marek's Disease "introduced with chickens from continental
Ecuador" and states that it could be a "catastrophe" for Darwin's finches
and other endemic Galapagos birds.
Does anyone have more information on this outbreak, its impact and Ecuador's
response?
