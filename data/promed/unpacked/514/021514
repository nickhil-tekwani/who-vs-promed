A 3rd case of cutaneous anthrax has been confirmed in a drug user (at the heroin injection site) in Berlin.

The patient responded to treatment and as there is no history of travel to Bavaria or of obtaining drugs from the region of the earlier cases, it is now assumed that circulation of contaminated heroin is more widespread than previously thought.

[As we feared. Further information on this, the 3rd German heroin addict with injection anthrax in the present series, has been requested from our German colleagues.

Our thanks and appreciation to Sabine for this report. She sent it in the midst of packing her car for an overnight drive to the UK. - Mod.MHJ
