The number of Ross River virus cases in Mandurah has surged more than 61% since the last season, but the Peel Mosquito Management Group (PMMG) says this is a "positive and pleasing outcome for the city."

There were 47 reported cases of the mosquito-borne virus for the 2020-21 season compared to 29 for 2019-20, a 61.7% increase in one season. The Peel region also experienced a rise in numbers, increasing by 67.6% to 105 cases up from 71 the season prior.

La Niña conditions, a weather event which sees cooler surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, provided an ideal environment for saltmarsh mosquitoes to breed more rapidly.

Despite the surge in cases, PMMG reported only 2 months of the season recorded case numbers above the moving average for the region. The PMMG has attributed this "pleasing outcome" to the sophisticated mosquito management activities undertaken by the City of Mandurah, the WA Department of Health and the PMMG.

The group manages mosquito populations through aerial larviciding, a treatment that has little impact on the environment and residents. Across the 2020-21 season, the PMMG covered its largest area ever with a total 6808.1 hectares [16 823 acres] treated with the mosquito-killing agent.

While the City was warned the weather conditions could drive a serious outbreak of Ross River virus due to increased virus detection in mosquito populations, cases were kept relatively low in respect to the elevated breeding conditions.

It is estimated mosquito-borne diseases like Ross River virus cost about AUD 5000 [USD 3504] per case in medical expenses and loss of earnings.

[This report provides an excellent example of how environmental factors such as the La Niña event initiate a chain of events that result in an increase in human disease. The La Niña event increases rainfall, which provides more habitat for Ross River virus (RRV) vector mosquitoes, leading to an increase in virus transmission and more human cases. The report also underscores the importance of timely surveillance resulting in intensified mosquito management. Now, cases of RRV infection are occurring with the potential for more cases as the summer there continues.

RRV infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. Preparing to deal with an increase in vector mosquito populations is prudent, as is informing the population of possible increased risk of infection with advice to avoid mosquito bites.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious, and the infection can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. - Mod.TY
