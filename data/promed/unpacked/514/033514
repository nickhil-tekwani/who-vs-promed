The army is being called in to help the fight against foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) in Northumberland after a further 3 cases were confirmed.
News of the fresh outbreak has come as a major blow to farmers after 2 days
in which no new cases were reported in the county.
One of the infected farms, Greyside at Fourstones in Hexham, is outside the
"blue box" restricted area currently covering around 400 square miles of
the Allendale Valley. It means the biosecurity zone will now have to be
extended to prevent any further spread of the disease. So far 16 cases have
been reported.
UK Disease statistics
----------------------
Cases so far: 1992
Animals slaughtered: 3 778 000
Awaiting slaughter: 15 000
Soldiers and slaughtermen now face the task of culling and disposing of 280
cattle at Elrington Hall farm, 211 cattle and 1419 sheep at Low Eshells and
383 cattle and 1038 sheep at Greyside.
25 soldiers, from the 101 Northumbrian Royal Artillery Volunteer Regiment,
will be deployed over the weekend to help oversee the process.
Almost 18 00 animals, including almost 2000 cattle and more than 15 000
sheep, have been or are waiting to be slaughtered since the resurgence of
the disease in Northumberland.
The first outbreak, confirmed last Friday, was at a farm between Hexham and
Alston, with the majority of the remaining cases in the neighboring area of
Allendale. The figure includes livestock on infected farms and those
classed as contiguous contacts on neighboring farms. The cluster came more
than 3 months after the last confirmed case in May and throughout the FMD
crisis the Allendale area had remained disease free.
Food and Rural Affairs Minister Lord Whitty is visiting the emergency
disease control centre on the outskirts of Newcastle to meet vets and staff
who are battling to contain the disease.
A spokesman for Defra said: "Following veterinary advice, Lord Whitty will
not be visiting the infected area."
Shadow Defra secretary Tim Yeo welcomed the input the soldiers would give
to the fight against the disease.
The Conservative MP for Suffolk South said: "The decision to bring in the
army suggests that this outbreak is more serious than the government would
admit. We welcome this action but hope it will be just part of a more
effective strategy to halt the further spread of the disease. Meanwhile the
confusion over vaccination urgently needs clearing up."
