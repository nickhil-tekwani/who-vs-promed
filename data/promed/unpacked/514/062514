All faculties of the Uva-Wellassa University [in Badulla, Sri Lanka] have been closed until further notice due to an outbreak of chickenpox among the student population.

Dozens of students staying at the university's hostels have already become infected with the highly contagious disease.

As such, a university official stated that a decision has been taken by the university administration to close down the university as a precaution in order to prevent the spread of the viral infection.

[Temporarily closing the University and vaccinating all unvaccinated students is probably the most effective approach to stopping spread of the virus. Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The rash appears first on the stomach, back, and face and can spread over the entire body causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example.

The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. Children, adolescents, and adults should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, it is usually mild -- with fewer red spots or blisters and mild or no fever. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe disease.
