[The graphs in the above report clearly show that the Lassa fever virus transmission peak has passed. However, the 7 new confirmed cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission continues, and a few more cases might occur. Fortunately, no health care workers were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak has been widespread, occurring in 21 states and 71 local government areas. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this area.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus, _Mastomys natalensis_ can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
