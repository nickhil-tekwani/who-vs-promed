MALARIA CHEMOPROPYLAXIS IN G6PD DEFICIENCY (2)
==============================================
[This posting collects 3 responses to the query concerning appropriate
malaria chemoprophylaxis in patients with G6PD deficiency
(deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]

For prophylaxis, G6PD deficiency affects the use of primaquine. For
Maloprim, there is a possibility that the dapsone component may make
this unsafe, but this has not to my knowledge been shown in practice
for the prophylactic dose.
Other available prophylactics are considered safe although
manufacturers may have a caution for treatment.

Primaquine -- the treatment of choice for the latent, exoerythrocytic liver
stage of P.vivax and P.ovale -- is an inducer of hemolysis in individuals
with G6PD deficiency.
[Normally,] persons with acute illness due to P.vivax may be treated with
chloroquine, but should also be treated with primaquine following the
acute illness (one primaquine 26.3 mg tab [15 mg base] daily orally for
14 days), in order to eradicate the latent liver form of the parasite and
to prevent relapse.
In general, individuals with G6PD deficiency should NOT receive primaquine.
This is especially true for the more severe form of G6PD deficiency found
in persons of Mediterranean descent who tend to have extremely low (less
than 1% of normal) levels of G6PD and are prone to severe drops
in hematocrit when challenged with primaquine.
A less severe form of G6PD deficiency is seen in 10% of African-Americans
(G6PD levels 15% of normal), whose hemolytic episodes are usually
self-limited and reversed upon witholding the inducing drug.
G6PD deficient individuals infected with P.vivax may be treated acutely
with chloroquine, and advised of the possibility of relapse, and the need
for repeat treatment if symptoms recur.
Primaquine should also be avoided in pregnant women. Each relapse should
be treated with chloroquine. After delivery, primaquine may be given to
eradicate the latent liver stage of P.vivax.

G6PD-deficient individuals are probably partly protected against
severe effects of falciparum Malaria.
Anti-relapse therapy of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria in patients
with G6PD deficiency would be with weekly single doses of
45 mg Primaquine for 8 weeks, provided it is administered
under close medical supervision. There is some evidence that various
antimalarial agents (i.e. chloroquine) inhibit G6PD in erythrocyte
extracts (in vitro) but - as far as I know - it never had a
clinical relevance.
I suggest that one could administer chloroquine, proguanil and/or
mefloquinin [Mefloquin] in supressive doses to G6PD-deficient
individuals without inducing haemolysis.
