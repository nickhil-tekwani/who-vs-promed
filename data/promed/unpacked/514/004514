A mum has praised Heartlands Hospital for quickly treating a rare case of measles that left her daughter so poorly she initially feared she would die.

[D] drove [E] to A & E [emergency department or casualty] after her temperature soared to 39C [102.2F] in what they later discovered was a rare case of the highly infectious illness.

[D] claims her local GPs' surgery in Harborne twice misdiagnosed [E's] symptoms as chicken pox after she began to fall ill early last week [week of Sun 31 Dec 2017].

The 23-year-old was eventually diagnosed at Heartlands and transferred to an infectious diseases ward, where she is thought to have become one of 21 people in the Midlands treated for the viral illness over the past 12 months.

[D], a telemarketer, said: "When [E] came out in a rash we 1st went to our GP in Harborne, who thought it was chicken pox and gave her antibiotics.

[E] was put into isolation at Heartland Hospital "Her temperature continued to go up so we went back and another GP also said it was chicken pox. "I phoned 999 on [Wed 3 Jan 2018] evening and was told it would be a 2 --4 hour wait for someone to come out. We decided to trust the GPs at that stage and sit it out. "Then by [Thu 4 Jan 2018] evening her temperature was around the 39C [102.2F] mark and she was really, really ill. "I thought I was going to lose her, so we got in the car and I drove her to A & E."

The charity administrator was swiftly diagnosed at the hospital.

"A nurse took one look and immediately got a consultant who took her temperature and sent her on for X-rays which were taken within 5 minutes of them seeing her," [D] said. "They sent off the blood tests and put her into isolation.

"At this stage I thought it might have been pneumonia or meningitis but they came back and said it was measles. After she was put into isolation another consultant from infectious diseases told us it was a really infectious illness which should have been wiped out with inoculations. "If it hadn't been for the team at Heartlands, I don't even want to think about what could have happened. "They were absolutely fantastic."

[E] was discharged on [Sun 7 Jan 2018] evening after 3 nights at the hospital in Bordesley Green East.

She had one set of MMR inoculations as a child but [D] wants other families to be aware that measles has not been eradicated and the full course is needed.

The viral illness is uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccinations, according to the NHS. However a total of 70 cases were confirmed in 5 areas of England - including Birmingham - in December [2017]. None of the patients had received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

[E] who had a temperature of 39C [102.2F] after falling ill with rare measles, said: "The team at Heartlands were absolutely fantastic. "I ended up with mild hepatitis on my liver and part of my lungs were slightly affected by it. "I had viral meningitis 2 years ago [2016] and this felt like a walk in the park by comparison....-more

[The individual described in this report had a single dose of MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93 percent effective, reports the CDC. Although the difference in efficacy between one and 2 doses seems minimal, it is clear it is important to be fully immunized. See CDC report in [4] below.

Some 3382 cases of measles were detected in Ukraine during 11 months of 2017, including 5 deaths, Health Minister Ulana Suprun told reporters on [Fri 12 Jan 2018].

According to her, all the lethal cases were recorded in Odesa region, where 3 children and 2 adults died from this disease.

"Back in September 2017, when serious outbreaks of measles disease began in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil and Odesa regions, we established a headquarters for the Health Ministry and recommended that in these areas we limit the stay of unvaccinated children in children's groups - schools, kindergartens.

Ternopil and Ivano - Frankivsk regions heeded and their incidence declined, and Odessa region continued to allow children to go to school without vaccination. After the death of 5 people, they finally realized that this should be banned, and now they demand that children be vaccinated," she said, while adding that almost 80 percent of measles were not vaccinated.

Suprun also reported that at present the measles vaccine is in sufficient numbers in all areas. She recommended, in the case of information on the lack of vaccines, to report this to the Health Ministry's hotline or to the agency's Facebook page.

"We will be able to answer you how many vaccines are available in your area, or redistribute, if there are no vaccines for some reason in your area," she said.

Previously, the Health Ministry reported that in Ukraine over the past 15 years, outbreaks of measles have been recorded 3 times: in 2001, 2006 and 2012. In particular, 13 000 people had measles in 2012.

https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/health/wa-health-authorities-issue-measles-alert-over-infected-thai-airways-passenger-ng-b88712233z


WA Health authorities have issued a measles alert, after a confirmed case in an airline passenger who was infected in Thailand.

The Health Department has warned the public to be aware of an increased risk of the disease because the Thai Airways passenger may have been infectious on a flight to Perth and in several locations in the northern suburbs during the past week [week of Sun 31 Dec 2017].

The passenger left Bangkok on Thai Airways flight TG483 which arrived in Perth about 7.50am on [Tue 2 Jan 2018].

People who were on this flight, especially those seated around the ill passenger, were potentially exposed and may be at risk of measles. In addition, people could have been exposed to measles in Perth [see URL for full list of locations].

WA Health Medical Epidemiologist Gary Dowse said public health staff had been contacting potentially exposed individuals directly where they were known, but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places.

"Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash, and children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune," Dr Dowse said.

"A person is considered immune to measles if they have previously received 2 doses of a measles vaccine or were born before 1966."

Dr Dowse said individuals who developed a fever with other symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash, within 1 - 3 weeks of potential exposure to someone with measles, should stay at home and consult their doctor.

"Anyone who thinks they are infected should call ahead and mention their possible contact with measles so they can be isolated when they arrive at the GP surgery or Emergency Department, to prevent infecting other patients and staff," Dr Dowse said.

Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral illness spread by tiny droplets released when infected people cough and sneeze.

Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later.

Complications following measles can be serious and include ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 40 per cent of cases require hospitalisation and about one person in every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.

http://www.newsandtribune.com/news/iu-bloomington-confirms-case-of-measles-on-campus/article_2ee88636-f61a-11e7-b739-dbfeb14835ff.html


Indiana University and state and local health officials are investigating a confirmed case of measles on the Bloomington campus.

The university is working with the Monroe County Health Department and the Indiana State Department of Health to identify and directly notify anyone who may have been in close contact with the student and to implement measures to help prevent the additional transmission of the virus, according to a news release.

Measles is a serious disease, which in extreme cases can lead to hospitalization and even death. It is extremely contagious among the unvaccinated. However, most students, faculty and staff at IU -- and most residents of Indiana -- have received necessary vaccinations or are already immune to measles.

Public health officials are working to track down those potentially exposed to measles during the period from the student's travels to Bloomington on [Tue 2 Jan 2018] until the student's diagnosis and self-isolation on [Sat 6 Jan 2018]. This student, a resident of the McNutt Residence Hall, arrived before the start of the semester to participate in new student orientation.

"We take measles very seriously and ask the public to do the same," said Dr. Diana Ebling, medical director at the IU Health Center. "We will contact campus and community members who may have been exposed, but we also want our students and staff to review their own immunization history and take appropriate steps."

Students at Indiana University are required to have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine -- and the documentation to prove it -- before enrolling for their 2nd semester of classes. It is requested that all students receive their vaccines before arriving on campus, but some receive them in the following weeks.

In addition to notifying people who may have been exposed, vaccines will also be made available to them if needed through a partnership between IU and the Indiana State Department of Health. The federal Clery Act also requires Indiana University to notify students and staff on the Bloomington campus about the measles case and how to protect themselves. Measles is caused by a virus, so it is not treatable with antibiotics, but the same hygiene practices that can help prevent the spread of influenza and other contagious diseases can help prevent the spread of measles.

"Frequent handwashing throughout the day and sneezing or coughing into tissues or your elbow help prevent the spread of many serious communicable diseases, including measles," Ebling said. "This is particularly important in classroom and shared living and dining spaces."

The best protection and way to prevent measles is to have had 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR). Two doses are about 97 percent effective against measles. If you are unsure of your vaccination records, check with your primary-care provider. Even a single dose of MMR up to 72 hours after exposure to someone with measles can prevent it or greatly reduce symptoms.

It can take anywhere from 10 -- 21 days after a person comes in contact with someone with measles for that person to develop symptoms. These typically begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body. In some cases, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth 2 --3 days after the onset of symptoms. Common complications for measles include ear infections and diarrhea, seen in about 10 percent of patients.

A person is contagious 4 days before the appearance of rash and the 4 days after the onset of rash. The highly contagious virus spreads easily by coughing, sneezing or even being in the same room with an infected person.

Because there is no cure, treatment is geared toward alleviating symptoms. Rest, pain and fever reducers, fluids, vitamin A supplements, and the use of a humidifier are often recommended.

Health authorities declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world.

In addition to practicing good hand hygiene habits, avoid sharing drinks, food and utensils.

Students with symptoms should stay home, isolate as much as possible and call before going to the IU Health Center

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated their 2018 Watch Level 1 Travel Alert status for countries experiencing measles outbreaks.

On [Mon 8 Jan 2018], the CDC has issued a Watch Level 1 status for the following countries: Indonesia, Romania, Ukraine, Italy, Democratic Republic of Congo.

In the United States, most measles cases result from international travel. The disease is brought into the United States by people who get infected in other countries.

A 2017 study found that more than half the measles cases imported to the U.S. were from adult travelers who were not immune to the disease prior to traveling abroad.

Of U.S. adult travelers who presented pre-travel consultation, 16 percent met criteria for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, but fewer than 50 percent of these travelers were vaccinated.

Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 -- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States.

The CDC recommends that international travelers protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.

The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93 percent effective, reports the CDC.

Before departure from the United States, infants (6 through 11 months of age) should have one dose of MMR vaccine, and adults and children over one year of age should have 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.

Measles is a disease caused by a virus that is spread through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Measles virus is highly contagious and can remain so for up to 2 hours in the air or on surfaces.

Since the cost estimates for treating a measles case ranges up to $181 679, getting the MMR vaccination is a less expensive preventative measure.

Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally, says the CDC.

In the USA, Merck is the manufacturer of 2 mumps vaccinations. MMR and ProQuad both contain the protection for mumps, as well as protection for measles and rubella.

The CDC Vaccine Price List provides the private sector MMR vaccine prices for general information.

Most pediatricians and pharmacies offer the MMR vaccine, and vaccine discounts can be found here.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects, says the CDC. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the FDA or CDC.

[Vaccines are one of the most important scientific inventions of all time, preventing millions of cases of disease every year and helping to consign once-deadly outbreaks to history. Yet these vital public-health tools are under threat from growing public mistrust in immunisation and the rise of so-called "fake news" drowning out expert voices. This "anti-vax" sentiment and pushback against scientific evidence threatens public health around the world, from measles outbreaks in the US and across Europe, prompting stricter vaccination laws, to persisting polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan. If this trend continues, 2018 could see a devastating resurgence of deadly diseases previously on the brink of eradication. - excerpted from http://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-fake-news-could-lead-to-epidemics]. - Mod.LK
