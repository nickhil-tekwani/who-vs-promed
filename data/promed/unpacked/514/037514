As remarked more than once in the past, the designation of "species" as "birds", in an OIE disease notification, is scientifically and epidemiologically debatable. Which bird species has (have) been involved in this event? And what husbandry was applied for their maintenance? (for example, held indoors or rather free-ranch?) Such issues could be also addressed under the article "affected population", which is allowed by OIE's questionnaire. As one can see in the "see also" list below, in the past, various avian species were involved in LPAI events in Germany, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese.

In view of the recent experience in China, when an avian influenza LPAI H7 virus strain has been found to cause a serious human infection, any such finding deserves to be addressed with caution -- as the German authorities indeed did, applying stamping out policy. Those handling the infected birds would probably be liable to clinical follow-up; conjunctivitis could serve as an indicator for possible infection. - Mod.AS]
