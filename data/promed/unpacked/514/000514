Situation report on atypical pneumonia 18 Apr 2003

The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:

As of 1 PM 18 Apr 2003, there are an additional 30 patients confirmed
to have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals
earlier. They include 2 healthcare workers (one from Pamela Youde
Nethersole Eastern Hospital and one from Princess Margaret Hospital).
The remaining 28 were other patients and contacts of patients with
atypical pneumonia.

A total of 322 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and
have been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 50 were
discharged today. 112 patients are receiving treatment in intensive
care unit.

4 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 69 the total number of
deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. A 63-year-old female and 2
men, aged 73 and 67, all with a history of chronic disease, died in
Princess Margaret Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, and Pamela
Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, respectively. A 42-year-old male
died in Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The cumulative figures for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:

Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths*

Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 309/ 106
Patients, family members & visitors: 1018/ 216

Total: 1327/ 322 / 69

* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a
relatively late stage of infection.

[The total number of deaths is given for all reported cases and is
not provided by type of case (healthcare environment related vs.
other close contact cases). Apparently this table was erroneously
interpreted in prior postings. - Mod.MPP]

As of 18 Apr 2003, 2 additional SARS patients have been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to
97. 59 SARS patients remain hospitalised.

One additional SARS case was reported today. She is the wife of a
probable SARS case who had been previously admitted to [Tan Tock Seng
Hospital] TTSH as a suspect case. Her husband had visited the
Radiology Department at [Singapore General Hospital] SGH on 1 Apr
2003 and later developed clinical signs consistent with SARS.

Situation Update at SGH
So far, 62 persons are linked to the SGH cluster, comprising 25 SGH
staff, 20 inpatients, and 17 contacts. 48 are probable cases.

Precautionary measures for SGH Ward 74
SGH had moved all patients who had been through Wards 57 & 58 to TTSH
on 6-7 Apr 2003. A patient who was previously in Ward 57 between 26
and 28 Mar 2003, and subsequently transferred to Ward 74 between 28
Mar 2003 and 6 Apr 2003 for neurological management, was later
transferred to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003. In view of this, Ward 74 was
placed on close surveillance. On 9 and 10 Apr 2003, 3 nurses from
Ward 74 B2 station (Neurology ward) were noted to have low-grade
fever (37.6 degrees C). They were given medical leave. 2 of them were
admitted to our Isolation Ward for observation. All 3 of them became
afebrile after 1 day and were sent home with further medical leave.

On 14 Apr 2003, one of the medical officers in the Neurology unit
also reported sick with a low-grade fever for a day. He was put on
medical leave. On 14 Apr 2003, SGH noted that there were 3 patients
in one cubicle in Ward 74 who had fever. However, these were patients
who had had fever intermittently for some time, in part due to the
nature of their underlying illnesses. As a precaution, we transferred
all 6 patients in that cubicle to our Isolation Ward on the same day
(14 Apr 2003). One of these 3 patients was admitted on 27 Mar 2003
with a fever. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on 29 Mar 2003, treated
with antibiotics and improved. However, on 17 Apr 2003, he became
chesty and breathless. On 17 Apr 2003 evening, as a further
precaution, a decision was made to transfer all 3 patients to TTSH.
They have been classified as suspect cases.

As a further precaution, the 3 Ward 74 nurses have also been recalled
to be re-evaluated in TTSH today. SGH will also move all 55 patients
of Ward 74 to TTSH starting tonight (17 Apr 2003). The neurologists
at TTSH, who are part of the [National Neuroscience Institute] NNI,
will look after these patients. The clinical management of these
patients will not be disrupted. 2 neurologists have been assigned to
handle communication issues with the patients' relatives. One will be
stationed at SGH and the other at TTSH to update patients' relatives
on the transfer of patients and the management of their medical
condition at TTSH. This is to ensure a smooth transfer of patients to
TTSH.

SGH's clinical departments started working on a modular system on 10
Apr 2003. Each team is mapped to a fixed location (such as a part of
a ward or an outpatient clinic). With this mapping of persons to
place, the risk of exposure is reduced. As such, SGH's neurology
outpatient service can still continue to function while the inpatient
neurology doctors are put on Hospital Enforced Quarantine. 2 of the
neurologists from the outpatient service team will now be deployed to
cover the inpatient area.

As a precaution, some 100 staff from this latest development in Ward
74 will be put on Hospital Enforced Quarantine. Active contact
tracing of patients, visitors, and staff of Ward 74 is in progress.
Visitors to Ward 74 after 26 Mar 2003 to date should monitor their
temperature.

These strong precautionary measures are in line with SGH's intention
to do everything possible to deal with the SARS outbreak.

Added Precautions in Public Hospitals
Starting today, all public hospitals will restrict visitors to one
per patient per day. This is an added precaution to reduce the risk
of the virus spread.

A summary of the SARS cases to date:
There was one additional death today, bringing the total deaths to 16
(of which 2 are pending further post mortem test results). This was
the [National University Hospital] NUH inpatient who was in contact
with a previous NUH SARS case.

Discharged: 97
Hospitalised: 59 (including 17 in intensive care)
Deaths: 14 + 2 (pending further post mortem test results)
Total: 172

Suspected: 80 (including 5 children below 18)
Under home quarantine orders: 444

Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases: 18 Apr 2003

Since yesterday, no additional probable cases of SARS have been
reported in Canada. A total of 132 individuals who meet the probable
case definition and 172 who meet the suspect case definition of SARS
have been reported, including 13 deaths. In addition to British
Columbia and Ontario, which are reporting probable cases, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island are also
reporting suspect cases of SARS (Table 1).

At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at
approximately 4.3 percent of probable or suspect cases (13 of 304
probable or suspect cases). Most of the case fatalities occurred in
patients with underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly
patients over the age of 70 years.

Table 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 18 Apr 2003

Province/Territory: Individuals meeting the criteria for probable
case (1)/ suspected case (1)/ deaths

British Columbia: 4/ 41/ 0
Alberta: 0/ 5/ 0
Saskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0
Ontario: 128/ 119/ 13 (2)
New Brunswick: 0/ 2/ 0
Prince Edward Island: 0/ 4/ 0

Total: 132/ 172/ 13
(1)These persons may be excluded the probable or suspect case list if
another cause is identified to fully explain their illness
(2) 12 of 13 deaths were in probable cases, and one of the 13 deaths
was recently re-classified as a suspect case.

A summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada
as of 18 Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 54 individuals have been
discharged (41.5 percent) and of the 64 individuals currently
hospitalised, 41 (64.1 percent) are improving or in stable condition.
In addition, nearly all of the suspect cases reported in Ontario,
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Prince
Edward Island have either recovered or are presently recovering.

Table 2: Currently known reported status of probable cases of SARS in
Canada: 18 Apr 2003
(N=130, excludes 2 for whom status is unknown)

Current Status: Number/ probable cases (percent)
Hospitalised: 64/130 (49.2 percent)
Improving 14/64 (21.9 percent)
Stable 27/64 (42.2 percent)
Critical/Deteriorating 13/64 (20.3 percent)
Unknown 10/64 (15.6 percent)
Discharged(1) 54/130 (41.5 percent)
Deceased 122/130 (9.2 percent)
Total no. probable cases for whom current status is known: 130 (100 percent)

(1) includes cases who have either recovered or are recovering
(2) 1 death not accounted for in this table, has recently been
re-classified as a suspect case

The current evidence suggests that respiratory droplet transmission,
requiring close contact with a case of SARS, is the predominant mode
of transmission. In the province of Ontario, the majority of cases
have been associated with specific transmission settings, such as
household, hospital, and specific community groups or settings. There
are currently 30 cases reported amongst approximately 500 members of
a religious group in Toronto. The index case of this community
cluster is linked to the first hospital cluster. The disease spread
to a total of 14 members of the index case's extended family as well
as to other members of the religious group. The key transmission
settings include a gathering held on 28--29 Mar 2003, the funeral
visitation for the index case held on 3 Apr 2003, and other social
gatherings during and after these dates. Local health authorities
have implemented isolation of all contacts of suspect and probable
cases, including all 500 members of the religious group, in an effort
to contain any further spread within and outside of this social
network. Case finding and contact tracing efforts in the group are
continuing.

Travellers who have returned from an affected area in Asia and their
close contacts account for the remaining cases in Ontario and the
other provinces. The number of probable cases by reported symptom
onset date and type of exposure (where known) is provided in (Figure

mentioned that until further testing is completed on the sensitivity
and specificity of the diagnostic tests, cases will not be
"confirmed" or "ruled out" based on laboratory testing results.
Hence, cases are defined based on clinical and epidemiological
criteria. - Mod.MPP]

Subject: FDA issues guidance on blood collection regarding SARS

On their website <http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/sarsbld.htm>
and the associated Talk Paper
<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01215.html>

The recommendation is to ask donors whether they have had SARS or
suspected SARS in the last 28 days, whether they have had close
contact with a person with SARS or suspected SARS in the last 14
days, and whether they have travelled to an area with SARS in the
last 14 days (using the geographic areas in the CDC case definition,
to be modified as the CDC updates).

[Full details on the proposed position paper with recommendations for
blood banks can be found at:
<http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/sarsbldgd.htm>. A similar action was
implemented by Health Canada several weeks ago upon the recognition
of the transmission chains of SARS in Ontario. The rationale for
excluding individuals for 2 weeks following possible exposure is
allowing for passage of the accepted incubation period for SARS,
which is currently described as 2-10 days. Waiting 28 days following
the diagnosis of SARS allows for termination of infection, so that
the virus would presumably no longer be present in blood of an
infected individual. Both of these time frames are based on
epidemiologic investigations and not on laboratory studies of large
numbers of cases. - Mod.MPP]

[A] India from the India Express 18 Apr 2003
<http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=22298>

One more patient "assumed to be normal" by the health authorities has
tested positive for SARS in the preliminary Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) tests. The patient is a 42-year-old tourist from New Zealand
who landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi,
from Bangkok at around 11 PM on Thursday night [17 Apr 2003]. He has
been admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. According to
sources at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New
Delhi, genetic sequencing is being matched and the results will be
declared in the next 24 hours.

The New Zealander was moved to the hospital with symptoms such as
cough and breathlessness. The official version this evening was that
the patient was 'afebrile' with no symptoms. "His X-ray is normal and
he has no fever," they said. According to sources at the airport, the
patient had attracted attention of the doctors at the health
counters, as he showed breathlessness. According to the NICD, the
passenger had travelled to Australia, where he stayed in New Port
with his brother, who was suspected to be infected and had been
quarantined. He had also stayed in Bangkok for 13 hours before flying
to India.

[B] China - Beijing - reported on Time.com
<http://www.time.com/time/asia/news/daily/0,9754,444684,00.html>
and on CNN
<http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/18/sars.china/index.html>

[Our thanks to Jack Steinmann <jsteinmann@CLYNCH.COM> for submitting
the Time.com report on this - Mod.MPP]

Both reports mentioned an intentional physical hiding of suspected
cases of SARS from the WHO teams during the visits of the teams to
the hospitals: "...hospital officials removed dozens of SARS patients
from their isolation wards and transferred them to locations where
they could not be observed by the inspectors" (from the Time.com
article).

The full reports of these allegations apparently made by physicians
working at the involved hospitals can be read at the above given URL
links.

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>

[In the news brief section there is a report of another suspected
case in India, with mention that preliminary results of PCR testing
were positive. According to that report, the patient (an individual
from New Zealand) travelled from Bangkok, which to date has not been
reported as having areas of local transmission. We await further
information on this case, and possible exposure. It should be
mentioned that the PCR test is capable of producing not only false
negative results (negative when there is a real infection), but also
false positives (positive when the individual is not infected with
the virus). Therefore, a positive PCR at present does not "confirm"
that this is a case of SARS (see discussion in [4][A] related to
change in case definitions used by the USA for reporting).

The WHO is recommending -- and all countries to date have been
complying with -- the application of a case definition based on
clinical and epidemiologic criteria, and not based on results of
laboratory diagnostic testing, now that tests are available. Data
from laboratory testing are being collected and analyzed to better
define the sensitivity (ability to detect the virus when present,
resulting in a low false negative rate) and specificity (ability to
rule out the presence of the virus when not present, resulting in a
low false positive rate) of the tests currently available.

The reports on the possible "hiding" of SARS patients from the WHO
team involved in the inspections come on the eve of the Chinese
political leadership mandating that full international cooperation be
provided in the ongoing investigation and control measures related to
the SARS outbreak. This announcement was made by the Chinese
president (see SARS - worldwide (56): cases 20030418.0951), and
included full disclosure and reporting of all suspected and probable
cases to the Ministry of Health and from the Ministry of Health to
international organizations. The above newswires are very critical
and make serious allegations regarding intentional underreporting of
SARS cases. Confirmation might be expected soon, in the form of
marked increases in numbers of probable cases reported in a very
short time frame. In the absence of this, one must speculate that
these accusations were not based on fact. We await further
clarification. - Mod.MPP]
