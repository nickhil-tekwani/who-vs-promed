A total of 43911 cases and 1777 deaths (CFR 4.0%) has been reported in
Uganda since the beginning of the epidemic in late 1997. In some areas the
situation is mainly stable or a downward trend is occurring. No cases have
been reported in Central Region for over a month. The districts of Arua and
Moyo in the Northern Region, Kamuli in the Eastern Region and Bushenyi in
the Western Region are still reporting high numbers of cases whereas other
districts in these regions are reporting either less than 10 cases per week
or no cases at all. Although some areas of the Western Region (Hoima,
Kasese, Kibaale and Masinidi Districts) and Busia District in the Eastern
Region have not reported for some time, the last information received
indicated that there had been a downward trend in the number of cases.
