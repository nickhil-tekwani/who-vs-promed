An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever that has killed 29 people in Guinea may have spread across the border into neighboring Sierra Leone, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) document and a senior Sierra Leone health official.

Guinean health officials have registered 49 [now 80] cases of infection in 3 southeastern towns and the capital Conakry since the outbreak was first reported on 9 Feb 2014.

While the exact type of the fever, which is characterized by bleeding, has yet to be identified, a senior official in Guinea said on Friday preliminary tests had narrowed down the possibilities to Ebola or Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever.

[This is the first time a human outbreak of Ebola has been identified in this region of West Africa (i.e., west of Cote d'Ivoire where a single case was reported in 1995). Logic says that therefore all the forests from Guinea to Cameroon may be harbouring the virus in wildlife. Coastal counties with forest should alert all health facilities to watch out for cases of high fever, diarrhoea & vomiting with bleeding, to take barrier healthcare precautions, and special burial precautions. In this day and age, there is no need for doctors, nurses, other health staff or burial parties, to die from viral haemorrhagic fever.

For comprehensive information on Ebola fever see the WHO Fact Sheet at http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en.
