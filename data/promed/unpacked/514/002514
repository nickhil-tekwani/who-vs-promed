[1] Cholera - Iraq (northern)

According to local authorities on Sat 8 Sep 2007, 6 cholera cases
were reported in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil, capital of the
autonomous Kurdish region, as an operation room to contain the
epidemic was set up. Arbil's hospitals have been receiving 10-15
suspected cases of cholera on a daily basis, but most of these
patients receive the proper medication and are released a few hours
later, according to Khaled Abdullah, head of the local Health Department.
Arbil is the 3rd reported city to witness an outbreak since the
cholera scare was announced in August 2007. Cholera has already
spread to 2 northern Iraqi provinces, killed at least 9 people, and
infected at least 131 according to figures released by Iraqi health
officials last week.
Poor water quality and problems with sewage treatment are the causes
of the outbreak. Health authorities warned earlier of possible
outbreaks in other areas, such as Baghdad, where suspected cases of
cholera have been recorded.
On Sat 8 Sep 2007, the Association of Muslim Scholars, the largest
Sunni organization in Iraq, claimed that several people had already
caught the epidemic in Baghdad, and that the government was "covering
up" the cases for lack of resources to fight the outbreak. Other
reports named the Shiite enclave of Sadr City in eastern Baghdad and
Kazimiyah in the north as places where the infection reportedly spread.

given numbers as high as 6000 for those affected by cholera. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - India (Orissa)

The death toll from an outbreak of cholera and other waterborne
intestinal diseases in eastern India rose to 197 Friday [7 Sep 2007],
with thousands of people still being treated, officials said. Most of
the deaths have been reported in 3 districts some 500 kilometers (310
miles) southwest of impoverished Orissa state's capital, Bhubaneswar,
with Koraput district the worst hit.
"So far, 85 people have died due to cholera and other acute water-
and food-borne intestinal infections in Koraput," the town's top
medical official Rama Chandra Agarwal told AFP, adding that more
emergency treatment centers had been opened. In the adjacent Rayagada
district 83 deaths have been reported, while another 29 died in Kalahandi.
But health activists and opposition parties dispute the official
figures, saying the real toll is much higher. "At least 500 people
have died since the outbreak of cholera. It's surprising that the
Orissa government still refuses to call it an epidemic," Communist
Party of India (CPI) leader AB Bardhan told a news conference Thu 6 Sep 2007.
