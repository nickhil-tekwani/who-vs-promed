A patient succumbed to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, increasing the death toll to 3 [in Punjab province].

The Health Department has confirmed the death toll. According to local reports, a patient who had symptoms of CCHF died in Lahore [Punjab province] on Thursday [7 Nov 2013].

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease which is mainly transferred to humans from pets [more probably agricultural livestock]. Its symptoms include fever, flu, bloody urine, vomiting and nose bleeding. About 30 percent of the cases result in death on the 2nd week of the illness.

[This was the 3rd death caused by CCHF virus infection in Punjab province in recent days [see: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (07): (PB) fatal 20131023.2017084]. However, the provincial Health Department has not, so far, confirmed diagnosis of the cause of death officially.

CCHF virus is transmitted to people either directly by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. CCHF is a tick-borne disease, and humans acquire infection directly by tick bite or by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Confirmation of the diagnosis by laboratory diagnostics is awaited.

Recently Zhaorui Zhou and colleagues have analysed "Reassortment and migration analysis of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus" [J. Gen. Virol. November 2013 vol. 94 no. Pt 11 2536-2548 http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/94/Pt_11/2536.abstract], and concluded from phylogenetic analyses that migration depended greatly on the nature of the hosts of the tick vector. In Africa, long-distance migration occurred frequently where the tick vector parasitised birds, whereas short-range migration was observed where the tick vector was carried predominantly by domestic livestock. In the case of Pakistan, there was clear evidence from phylogenetic analyses that CCHF virus was migrating into Pakistan from Afghanistan.
