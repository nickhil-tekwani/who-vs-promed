Confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong under CHP investigation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [29 Jan 2014] investigating a confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong affecting a man aged 75. The patient, with multiple underlying illnesses, lived in Tin Shui Wai. He developed cough with sputum in Shenzhen on [26 Jan 2014] and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) last night [28 Jan 2014] for fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently transferred to the isolation ward. His condition deteriorated and he passed away this morning. His nasopharyngeal aspirate was positive for avian influenza A(H7) virus upon preliminary laboratory testing by TMH and was confirmed as H7N9 upon further testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.

Initial epidemiological investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled alone to Baoan, Shenzhen, from 20 to 26 Jan 2014 and had stayed in his relative's residence close to a live poultry market. The patient's 5 home contacts in Hong Kong (regarded as close contacts) have remained asymptomatic. They will be admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for testing and observation.

Further investigations into his travel and exposure history are ongoing, in parallel with tracing of other contacts of the patient, including 4 patients who stayed in the same cubicle with the patient in TMH, healthcare workers of TMH and the ambulance service, who will be put under medical surveillance.

The CHP will liaise with relevant Mainland health authority to follow-up the patient's contacts during his stay in Shenzhen. The case has been referred to the Coroner for investigation.

This is the 4th confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong. The CHP will notify the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Health and Family Planning Commission as well as health and quarantine authorities of Guangdong and Macao. Locally, enhanced surveillance of suspected cases in public and private hospitals is underway. The CHP will continue to maintain liaison with the WHO, the Mainland and overseas health authorities to monitor the latest developments. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations.

"In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong and multiple cases reported in the Mainland, the activity of the virus is expected to be higher in the winter season. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong during Lunar New Year [31 Jan 2014] should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged. "All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

The spokesman advised travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

[The circumstances in this case (and the preceding 3 cases) are consistent with infection occurring during travel in or residence in Mainland China prior to expression of symptoms. On each case no onward person-to-person transmission has been demonstrated to have occurred so far in the Hong Kong SAR. - Mod.CP
