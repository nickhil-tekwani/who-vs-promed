Started: 10 Sep 2022
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds (domestic) / 2610 / - / - / 2610 / - / -

Affected population: A backyard producer [premises]. Clinical signs included lethargy, depression, and death. State officials have quarantined the affected [premises].

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N4, Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed on a backyard producer premises in Teton County, Montana. This lineage is highly pathogenic for poultry and is a reassortant of the initial Newfoundland-like virus introduced December 2021 with North American wild bird lineage segments PB2, PB1, NP, and NA. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI H5N4 in poultry in the United States. NOTE: this outbreak was first reported on follow-up report 31 for the ongoing H5N1 event 4309 in the United States; the N-type was characterized on 10/17/2022.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: zoning, surveillance outside the restricted zone, surveillance within the restricted zone, quarantine, movement control

Control measures different from event level, additional measures: disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / First result date / Last result date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames, Iowa / bird / 1 / gene sequencing / 15 Sep 2022 / 17 Oct 2022 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames, Iowa / bird / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 15 Sep 2022 / 17 Oct 2022 / positive

Mexico, influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 8 Oct 2022
Confirmed: 16 Oct 2022
Resolved: 16 Oct 2022
Reported: 21 Oct 2022
Reason for notification: new strain in the country
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Metepec, Mexico
Started: 8 Oct 2022
Ended: 16 Oct 2022
Epidemiological unit: body of water
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Gyrfalcon (wild) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: This was a gyrfalcon (_Falco rusticolus_) used for falconry, which fed on prey collected in the Lerma River basin, located in the state of Mexico. The animal became ill, showing mainly respiratory and nervous signs and blindness, and was taken to a veterinary clinic. The animal died 72 hours after showing clinical signs. The event was immediately reported by the veterinarian to the health authority. Specialized personnel performed the necropsy and observed congestion and generalized hemorrhages.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: This report represents the 1st isolation of an HPAI virus subtype H5N1 in Mexico, which occurred in a non-poultry bird and in one of the migratory wild bird corridors that cross the country, with no cases detected so far in backyard and commercial birds. As anti-epidemic measures, risk areas have been defined, and a situation diagnosis is being carried out through epidemiological tracing in the focal and peri-focal zones, with the objective of identifying new cases. Notification of suspected cases is encouraged through local authorities and personalized visits to backyard poultry farmers, and poultry producers are invited to reinforce their biosecurity measures and report any abnormal behavior in their flocks.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: surveillance within the restricted zone, surveillance outside the restricted zone

[This immediate notification complements the information already published in ProMED posting 20221017.8706196.

A press release [in Spanish] published on 14 Oct 2022 by the Government of Mexico mentioned that the "National Service for Health, Safety and Agri-food Quality (Senasica) urges commercial and backyard poultry producers to increase biosecurity measures on their farms, comply with Dinesa's provisions, and report suspicious cases.

"The Senasica is currently taking more samples in the region, with the purpose of confirming the presence or absence of the virus in other wild birds."
(https://www.gob.mx/agricultura/prensa/reporta-agricultura-caso-de-influenza-aviar-ah5n1-en-aves-silvestres-317115)

"Migratory wild birds, especially waterfowls, are the natural host and reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Within their respiratory or intestinal tracts, they can carry different avian influenza virus strains. Depending on the virus strain and the species of bird, the virus can be harmless or fatal to the wild bird. When birds have little or no symptoms of the virus, it allows them to spread the viruses between neighbouring countries or over long distances, along their migratory pathways. Wild birds also play a major role in avian influenza virus evolution and maintenance during low seasons.

"The main wild species involved in the viral cycle of avian influenza are waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species. Direct exposure of farmed birds to wild birds is a likely transmission route of the virus. Therefore, it is critical to limit their exposure to wild birds to lessen the risk of introduction of avian influenza into flocks."
