Sudan Outbreak Strain of Ebola Virus Not Now Considered to be a Novel Strain
----------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Tue 24 May 2004 that 5
people [one more than previously reported] have died of Ebola [haemorrhagic
fever] in southern Sudan, but dismissed fears that a new variant strain of
the disease had emerged. In addition to the dead, 14 other people have
haemorrhagic fever, WHO stated. The U.N. agency stated that a known form of
the virus was responsible for the outbreak.
On Saturday, WHO said it believed a new, milder strain of Ebola virus could
have caused the outbreak. This was wrong, said Dick Thompson, spokesman for
the U.N. health agency. "The reason was that initial lab tests were very
confusing," Thompson said.
The Ebola virus is spread by contact with body fluids, including sweat and
saliva. Outbreaks of the disease are rare, and no one knows [the source and
vector of Ebola virus].

[Dr. Burkhard Rieke DTM&H (Liv.) of the Centre for Travel Medicine,
Dusseldorf, Germany has pointed out that the BBC News report quoted in the
ProMED-mail report -- Acute hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (W Equatoria) (03):
Ebola conf. 20040524.1387 -- omitted mention of the well-documented 1995
outbreak in Kikwit /then Zaire, now DRC.
The Ebola viruses responsible for the outbreaks in Sudan in 1976 and 1979
are phylogenetically distinct from the filoviruses associated with
the haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Cote d'Ivoire (in 1994), Gabon (in
1996), and Zaire (in 1976 and 1995). The Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, and Zaire
isolates cluster together, whereas the Sudan isolates cluster with the
viruses isolated from primates imported into an animal facility in Reston
(Virginia, USA), which proved to have limited pathogenicity for humans.
These various viruses have been designated distinct virus species by the
ICTV: namely, Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus, Reston Ebola virus, Sudan Ebola
virus, and Zaire Ebola virus. Further information on the precise
relationship of the current Sudanese outbreak strain is awaited with
interest. - Mod.CP]
