--------------------------------------
_Ceratocystis radicicola_ [previously _Thielaviopsis punctulata_ - Mod.DHA] has been reported as an economically important pathogen causing serious diseases on date palm such as rhizosis and black scorch, or in association with diseased palms. We report for the 1st time that _C. radicicola_ also causes black scorch disease in Qatar.

In 2013, we conducted a survey where 3 out of 11 farms had an average of 10 percent disease incidence. Infected trees manifested different symptoms such as black scorch of leaves, inflorescence blight, and heart and bud rot.

[From] infected tissues, 5 fungal isolates [were examined by] electron microscopy to delineate species by spore morphology, [showing] characteristic features of _C. radicicola_. Amplification of ITS rDNA region from 5 isolates confirmed the isolated fungus as _C. radicicola_ with no intra-specific variation among the isolates. The length of ITS-rDNA sequence was 534 bp and had 99 and 93 percent sequence identity with ITS-rDNA regions from _C. radicicola_ and _C. paradoxa_, respectively.

A pathogenicity test was conducted using 3-year-old trees from 3 cultivars (Khalas, Khneezi, Barhi) growing in sandy loam soil under greenhouse conditions (25 to 29 C and 12/12h light/dark). Three inoculated and 3 mock-inoculated plants from each cultivar were used. Four days post inoculation (dpi), a rusty black infection appeared on the plants. 15 dpi, the whole leaf showed typical symptoms, and the re-isolated fungus was confirmed as _C. radicicola_. All 3 cultivars showed symptoms, with variable severity [between] cultivars.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of black scorch disease caused by _C. radicicola_ in Qatar. This report highlights the incidence of black scorch disease in Qatar demanding future research to control the pathogen.

[Black scorch of date palm has been reported to be caused by _Ceratocystis radicicola_ (previously _Thielaviopsis punctulata_) and _C. paradoxa_ (previously _T. paradoxa_), either alone or as coinfection. The disease has been reported in all date growing areas worldwide and on many date varieties. The pathogens cause a range of symptoms on the host, which has led to other disease names such as bud rot, bending head, crazy disease (Medjnoon), inflorescence blight, trunk rot, stem bending, dry basal rot and heart rot. Symptoms mostly include dark lesions on leaves, necrosis of affected tissues and black discolouration ("scorch") of fronds and fruit stands. If, in severe cases, the terminal bud is affected, the palm most likely dies. Occasionally, palms have been reported to have recovered, showing a characteristic bend in the region of infection which reduces fruit production for years. External stress factors are thought to increase host sensitivity to infection.

Not much appears to be known about the epidemiology of the black scorch fungi. Other species in the genus can be soil borne and are also spread by water, mechanical means (for example on cutting tools), and with plant material. Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts. Disease management for black scorch may include orchard sanitation (burning of infected plant matter or whole palms), disinfection of cutting tools and wounds resulting from harvesting or frond pruning, and sprays of copper-based fungicides.

An undiagnosed disease of date palm was reported in Qatar in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20121213.1448829), leading to a 30 percent loss of national date palm yields annually. The report above appears to have identified at least one component of the problem.

Other _Ceratocystis_ species cause diseases in a range of crops (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), including kiwifruit (wilt), mango (sudden decline), coconut and other palms (stem bleeding), sugarcane (pineapple disease), clove (decline) and lettuce (black rot).
