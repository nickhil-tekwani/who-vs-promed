Mumps outbreak declared at Heartland Community College: Illinois
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Illinois Department of Public Health [IDPH] has declared a mumps outbreak at Heartland Community College [Normal, McLean County, Illinois]. The IDPH says 4 cases have been found at the college. Letters are being sent out to students, faculty and staff the health department has determined were in close contact with those who were infected.

As of [16 Sep 2015], 6 cases of mumps have been identified in McLean County and more test results are pending.

The symptoms of mumps include fever, headache and swollen salivary glands, and malaise. Symptoms usually appear 12 to 25 days after [a person becomes] infected.

[This outbreak appears to be part of the larger epidemic affecting students in more than one educational establishment in the state of Illinois. Further information would be appreciated regarding the source of the virus responsible for the initiation of the outbreak and the failure of vaccination to contain the spread of the outbreak. So far it has been reported [in ProMED-mail post 20150828.3608518] that: "Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] is experiencing the largest outbreak of the mumps ever to hit the area with around 100 cases confirmed as of Wednesday morning [26 Aug 2015]. Researchers say the mass mumps outbreak began this spring [2015] on the University of Illinois campus. They attribute the spread of the infection to students living in close quarters and interacting in large social settings. The best protection against the mumps is the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine, but the standard 2 doses only offer 85 percent protection. So the CDC and the Illinois Department of Public Health recommend everyone in the community get a 3rd booster shot, which increases that immunity level to 95 percent." - Mod.CP
