An adult from Bethel might have contracted botulism from a "Native Salad" that they bought at the Cama-i Dance Festival last weekend [17-18 Mar 2018]. While the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation suspects that this is a botulism case, the diagnosis is still unconfirmed. The Alaska Section of Epidemiology heard about the suspected case on [Wed 21 Mar 2018]. In a press release this afternoon, [Fri 23 Mar 2018], YKHC said that they have sent a sample of the salad to a testing facility in Anchorage. They will know if the salad tests positive for the botulism toxin in about a week.

In the meantime, the health care provider advises those who ate some of the dish to watch for signs of botulism. Symptoms typically start to appear 1 to 3 days after people eat food that contains the toxin. They include a dry mouth, blurred or double vision, difficulty swallowing, drooping eyelids, dilated pupils, voice changes, dizziness, and shortness of breath.

Botulism can be a life threatening illness. If you have any of these symptoms, YKHC advises going to your local emergency room or calling your clinic immediately.

[It is not stated in the posting what ingredients were contained in the "Native Salad" but it is certainly possible that the salad contained fermented marine animal products. These products are often associated with type E botulism cases in native American and Canadian populations.

The following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques which appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):

"This report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12-36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27 per cent of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.

"In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4,5).

"Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31 per cent during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77 per cent) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3)."
