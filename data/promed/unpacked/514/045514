A study of essential and frontline workers in 6 US states who tested positive for COVID-19 and received 2 or 3 mRNA vaccine doses before delta infections and 3 doses before omicron infections suggests that they had significantly milder infections and lower viral loads than their unvaccinated peers.

In the study, published today [18 Oct 2022] in JAMA [see citation below] HEROES-RECOVER Network researchers analyzed the weekly self-collected nasal swabs and whole-genome sequencing results from 1199 frontline workers infected with COVID-19 from 14 Dec 2020 to 19 Apr 2022, with follow-up until 9 May 2022.

The workers, primarily healthcare professionals and 1st responders, were located in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, and Utah. Median age was 41 years, 59.5% were women, 72.6% were White, 19.3% were Hispanic, 14% were infected with the wild-type strain, 24.0% had a delta variant case, and 62.0% had omicron.

More symptom-free days
----------------------
Of the 352 COVID-19 infections among the unvaccinated, 12.5% were asymptomatic, and 6.8% had uncharacteristic symptoms. Asymptomatic cases were more often linked to omicron than delta infections (odds ratio [OR], 5.6).

Among participants with symptoms, those with omicron infections had symptoms for, on average, 12.3 days, compared with 15.6 days with wild-type infections and 16.4 days with delta. Omicron-infected participants reported an average of 2.6 days sick in bed, 1.2 days fewer than those with wild-type infections and 2.0 days fewer than those with delta. Vaccinated patients had milder delta illnesses, but the precision of the estimates varied.

Workers who received their 2nd vaccine dose 14-149 days before delta infection were significantly less likely than their unvaccinated participants to have symptoms (77.8% vs 96.1%; OR, 0.13). When they were symptomatic, 3rd-dose recipients were significantly less likely to have fever or chills (38.5% vs 84.9%; OR, 0.07), had symptoms for fewer days (10.2 vs 16.4; difference, -6.1), and reported fewer hours of work missed (47.1 vs 62.8; difference, -15.2).

Among omicron-infected workers, the risk of symptoms didn't differ significantly between 2-dose compared with unvaccinated participants but was significantly higher for 3-dose recipients (88.4% vs 79.4%; OR, 2.0). Workers with symptomatic omicron infections who received a 3rd vaccine dose 7-149 days earlier were significantly less likely to have fever or chills than the unvaccinated (51.5% vs 79.0%; OR, 0.25) and were less likely to seek medical attention (14.6% vs 24.7%; OR, 0.45).

Symptoms tied to higher viral loads
-----------------------------------
"In a cohort of US essential and frontline workers with SARS-CoV-2 infections, recent vaccination with 2 or 3 mRNA vaccine doses less than 150 days before infection with delta or omicron variants, compared with being unvaccinated, was associated with attenuated symptoms, duration of illness, medical care seeking, or viral load for some comparisons, although the precision and statistical significance of specific estimates varied," the researchers wrote.

Symptomatic participants had significantly higher average viral loads than those with no symptoms. Delta- and omicron-infected workers who received a 2nd vaccine dose 14-149 days earlier had a significantly lower average viral load than their unvaccinated counterparts.

"Although viral RNA shedding cannot be directly attributable to transmission, the relatively high viral load of omicron infections together with the higher frequency of asymptomatic infection supports previous studies suggesting an association with increased transmission, particularly during the 1st 3-5 days when viral load peaked," the authors concluded.

[2] Global life expectancy

Two new studies uncover the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global life expectancy (LE), one showing substantial and sustained LE losses in the United States and Eastern Europe, and the other finding a link between LE at 60 years of age before the pandemic and excess deaths amid COVID-19 only in countries with older populations.

Lifespan fell further in 2021 in 12 nations
-------------------------------------------
In the 1st study, a team led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany and the University of Oxford used the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations Database to examine all-cause mortality and LE changes in 29 countries, including the United States, most of Europe, and Chile, since 2019. The research was published this week in Nature Human Behaviour (1).

Eight of the 29 countries saw substantial rebounds from 2020 LE losses, including Belgium (+10.8 months), Switzerland (+7.7), Spain (+7.6), France (+5.0), England and Wales (+2.1), Italy (+5.1), Sweden (+7.5), and Slovenia (+3.1).

But on top of the 2020 losses, LE fell further in 2021 in 12 countries: Bulgaria (-25.1 months), Chile (-8.0), the Czech Republic (-10.4), Germany (-3.1), Estonia (-21.5), Greece (-12.4), Croatia (-11.6), Hungary (-16.4), Lithuania (-7.9), Poland (-12.1), Slovakia (-23.9), and the United States (-2.7). In Scotland and Northern Ireland in 2021, LE showed no rebound from 2020.

In 2021, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden all rebounded completely from substantial 2020 losses. 3 countries, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, saw no LE loss in 2020, but only Norway had a significantly higher LE in 2021 than in 2019.

All countries saw lower-than-expected LE in 2021, as prepandemic trends continued. Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia all experienced much higher LE deficits in 2021 than in 2020.

Older people became less vulnerable
-----------------------------------
In 2021, pandemic deaths shifted toward younger age-groups, with US mortality for ages 80 and older returning to prepandemic levels, possibly due to higher COVID-19 vaccination uptake in this group, but LE losses worsening in ages 60 and younger. An increase in deaths in the younger age-group contributed to LE losses of 7.2 months in 2021 over 2020, cancelling the LE rebounds in the older age-group and yielding a net drop of 2.7 months in 2021.

Excess deaths in Americans younger than 60 years were behind 58.9% of LE losses since the pandemic began. Losses in this age-group, especially for men, were much higher in the United States than in most other countries in 2020.

Women had higher LE in all countries amid the pandemic, with a difference ranging from 3.17 years in Norway to 9.65 years in Lithuania, and the female advantage rose significantly in 16 of the 29 countries. The largest increase in the sex gap occurred in the United States, where it rose from 5.72 to 6.69 years.

COVID-19 deaths explained most LE losses in 2021 across all countries except for the Netherlands, where other causes made up 51.7% of the LE deficit. Higher vaccination coverage by October 2021 was tied to smaller LE deficits in the last 3 months of 2021 across countries and across age-groups.

"Human populations faced multiple mortality crises during the twentieth century, yet LE kept increasing globally in the medium and long term, especially in the 2nd half of the 20th century," the researchers wrote. "While COVID-19 has been the most severe global mortality shock since World War II, we will have to wait to know whether and how longer-term LE trends are altered by the pandemic."

In a University of Oxford news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/967956], coauthor Jose Manuel Aburto, PhD, said that Brazil and Mexico [not included in the study] saw even worse LE losses in 2020 than the United States. "So it is likely these countries may have continued suffering mortality impacts in 2021 -- even potentially exceeding the 43 months we estimated for Bulgaria," he said.

Aging and excess mortality
--------------------------
In a research letter today in JAMA Network Open (2), investigators from Jikei University in Tokyo describe their analysis of LE at age 60 before the pandemic and excess mortality from January 2020 to December 2021 in 158 countries. Across countries, the median proportion of the population aged 60 years or older was 9.7% (range, 2.8% to 34.0%). After adjustment in 40 countries with aging populations, 3 factors were linked to excess mortality, including LE at 60 years, per-capita gross domestic product, and the proportion of fully vaccinated residents. But in a multiple linear regression analysis, only LE at 60 years remained significant.

The likelihood of dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease at 30 to 70 years of age was most strongly associated with excess mortality. Death rates in people 15 to 60 years old and children 5 to 14 years old, however, had weaker associations with excess mortality, and the death rate in those 5 and younger was not associated.

"The results suggest that long life expectancy at old age in aging countries may be considered a proxy variable associated with high-quality health care systems and resilience to health care crises, including pandemics," the authors concluded.

[3] Subvariants
[A] What to be concerned about

COVID subvariants: What to know and should you be concerned?
------------------------------------------------------------
Offshoots of the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants are increasing in the US.

Even as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations driven by the omicron subvariant BA.5 continue to fall in the United States, the proportion of infections attributed to other omicron offshoots is rising.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, BA.5 currently makes up 67.9% of new virus cases as of last Friday [14 Oct 2022].

The remaining cases are made up of BA.4.6 -- which has been circulating in the US for weeks -- as well as newly identified subvariants like BQ.1, B.Q.1.1 and BF.7, which have been spreading mainly in Europe.

The subvariants have been attributed to an increase in infections in Europe. According to the latest weekly report from the World Health Organization [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---12-october-2022], published 12 Oct 2022, there were more than 1.66 million COVID-19 cases recorded across the continent, up from more than 1.53 million cases recorded in the previous report published on 5 Oct 2022 [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---5-october-2022].

Throughout the course of the pandemic, Europe has been considered a bellwether of what's come in the US.

Should we be concerned about the new subvariants? Experts told ABC News that the US may see a new wave as we enter the colder weather months and move indoors and it's important to remain vigilant.

"In the next few months, I think there's reasonable expectation that we'll probably see a fall wave," said Dr John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. "But the magnitude of that wave, I think, is still very much in question."

What are the new subvariants?
-----------------------------
The subvariant that makes up the most cases after BA.5 is BA.4.6. An offshoot of the omicron subvariant BA.4, it's estimated to account for 12% of new cases, according to the CDC.

Then there are newer subvariants, which have recently begun steadily spreading in the US: BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. Both are offshoots of BA.5 and make up 12% of new cases together. This is a rapid rate of increase considering they made up just 3% of new cases for the week ending 1 Oct 2022.

"It seems to have come out of nowhere," Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told ABC News. "But it didn't really come of nowhere. It was first seen in Nigeria in summer [2022] and then spread to other countries in Europe and Asia, and now in the United States."

Another offshoot of BA.5 that is picking up speed is BF.7. It makes up 5.3% of new cases in the US, up from 3.2% just 2 weeks prior.

Meanwhile, there have been reports of another subvariant called XBB, which combines multiple strains of the omicron variant and other COVID-19 variants and has been detected mostly in Asia. So far, it has not been detected in the US.

Not much is known about any of these newer subvariants. Preliminary data suggest they have mutations that are better at evading immunity, whether from vaccination or prior infection, and may be more transmissible [bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787].

Another reason these offshoots could be spreading more rapidly is because human behavior has changed. Travel is reaching pre-pandemic levels, children are back in school and most restrictions -- including masking, social distancing and vaccinations requirements -- have ended.

There is some good news. Since September [2022], bivalent boosters that target BA.4 and BA.5 have been approved in the US for those aged 12 and older and for those aged 5 and older since last week. Early data suggests the booster increases antibody response [https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-early-data-clinical].

Because these subvariants are related to BA.4 and BA.5, it's likely that the booster will provide at least some protection against them as well.

"I think there's a very reasonable expectation that the vaccines, especially with the new boosters, will provide good protection," said Brownstein. "But we're still missing a lot of real-world data, especially given that these new sort of omicron variants of BA.5 and BA.4 are starting to take hold in various parts of the world."

"We'll hopefully have reasonable insight from other countries that will help inform some of the forecast for the coming months, but that data is still being compiled," he continued.

Chin-Hong said it's also reasonable to expect, as with previous variants, that those most at risk are Americans with the least amount of protection.

"For people who are unvaccinated, those over age 65 who've never gotten a booster, or people who are immunocompromised, they may become more seriously ill and die if they don't protect themselves," Chin-Hong said.

Should we be concerned?
-----------------------
Brownstein said he thinks public health officials should remain vigilant and keep tracking the spread of these subvariants but the public should not yet worry.

"I think it's too early to tell the level of concern," Brownstein said. "Of course, everyone should be concerned about how new variants emerge, especially when there's uneven vaccination across the US and then across the globe."

He added, "The brunt of that concern should be on public health and scientists right now, as we try to work out [what's happening]."

Brownstein said Americans should be willing to modify their behavior -- like masking indoors again -- if cases spike or a new variant emerges.

According to CDC data, the daily average of COVID-19 cases sits at 35 000 as 16 Oct 2022 and the average estimate of new hospital admissions is 2990 as of 15 Oct 2022.

Brownstein said if the healthcare system becomes overwhelmed by a surge, city- or state-level officials might consider masking to reduce the number of patients entering hospitals.

"I think that clearly targeted masking, especially in high-risk places like healthcare settings and long-term care facilities, will be critical, because those places are charged with protecting the most vulnerable," Brownstein said. "Beyond that, I think it's going to be really driven by local level cases."

[B] Omicron variants
Date: Sat 15 Oct 2022 12:00 GMT+2

https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/15/covid-omicron-split-multiple-variants-peaking-different-countries-same-time-scenarios-fall-winter-pandemic-epiidemic-endemic-xbb/


COVID has splintered into multiple variants dominating different countries at the same time. Experts say these are some scenarios could play out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's autumn again, which means COVID cases are on the rise. But for the 1st time in the pandemic's history, the variants that make up the mounting wave look drastically different, depending on where you are in the world.

In England, omicron spawn BA.5.2 is the most prevalent variant, with a long list of competitors relatives vying for dominance. In the US, once globally dominant BA.5 is still leading the way. But it's steadily decreasing as BA.4.6 -- dubbed "Aeterna" by some on the Twitterverse -- rises, with BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 on its heels. And in Singapore, cases of XBB, or "Gryphon" -- a combination of 2 omicron variants that can evade immunity and antibody treatments--are surging.

Scientists are watching a quickly growing menagerie of omicron offspring struggling to rise to the top in different parts of the world right now -- a scenario top experts tell Fortune is "unprecedented." The competing variants all feature concerning traits like improved immune evasion, increased transmissibility, or both.

As each spawns its own new strains in exponential fashion, experts say that the pandemic is at a crossroads--the virus could morph into something more akin to the generally predictable and mild flu, or spiral even further out of the reach of science and its lagging vaccines.

"There have been times when different variants were on the move in different parts of the world, like the Gamma variant in South America, and Beta in South Africa," Dr Eric Topol is a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research and founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told Fortune.

"But this is different because now we have variants with extreme levels of immune evasion, and in any given country, potentially a few that could be in play at the same time."

How did we get here?
--------------------
It wasn't so long ago that any COVID variant that hit the UK was headed to the US in a few short weeks, making it relatively easy to forecast virus conditions in the near term.

But now the variant -- or swarm of variants -- to next plague North America is anyone's best guess.

There are a few reasons for this, experts say, including a widespread abandonment of COVID-prevention measures, animals carrying the disease, and the brewing of variants in those with long-term COVID infections. But it largely boils down to waning population immunity. Antibody immunity decreases with time -- just 3 to 6 months, on average. As more people forgo booster shots, and as time passes after their last COVID infection, the virus has a better chance of mutating and spreading.

"Many people globally are becoming susceptible all over again due to warning immunity from the vaccine and infections," Dr Ali Mokdad, a professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Fortune. "People who have gotten omicron BA.5 are susceptible 5, 6 months later. Therefore anything circulating out there, they're going to catch it."

The 1st round of vaccines and COVID infections has also put "intense pressure" on the virus to adapt.

"The more people who have had infections and the more vaccines and boosters they've had, the more the virus has to evolve to bypass those routes of host defense," he said.

That's why predicting which country will be hit with a specific variant has come down to "chance," according to Mokdad. "It's the luck of the draw."

What lies ahead?
----------------
A fragmented cluster of COVID variants has been scattered across the globe, in a scene unlike any the world has seen thus far. But what happens next?

One possibility is that the virus is becoming more flu-like, according to Mokdad, which several experts have predicted will eventually happen.

COVID's recent global splintering mimics the cycle that happens each year with the flu, he says. Each North American flu season starts out with several suspicious strains covered by the vaccine -- and by the end of the season, a few strains mutate and rise to prominence.

He thinks that COVID will eventually become like the flu -- worse during the winter, but with some level of cases in the summer, and with the variants of some years worse than others. Such a shift could make it possible to target the virus with a single annual shot, updated each year like the flu vaccine.

But "I would never say that this virus is done with us," he added.

Another possible scenario is that each new variant continues to spawn exponentially, making it harder for those who develop vaccines and treatments to even attempt to keep up.

The fact that so many potentially superior versions of the virus are circulating is unsettling and makes the future more difficult to predict, experts say. With mask use and social distancing largely abandoned, the only defense society has left is immunity from either the vaccines or infection.

If new variants route that, "we have Paxlovid as a backup, but the virus could also develop resistance to that over time," Topol said. "That's the problem."

New omicron boosters released in the US in early September [2022] were intended to provide protection against BA.4 and BA.5. But BA.4 has become nearly extinct, and levels of BA.5 are dropping in many locations in lieu of other variants. The virus has already outpaced the vaccine.

The good news is that new variants taking over tend to be spawns of one or the other, which bodes well for the integrity of new boosters in the near term, experts say. But more variants could make vaccine design much more challenging.

"If you have 20 variants out there, it becomes a bit more complicated," Mokdad said.

Topol doesn't foresee the virus completely routing the vaccines because of the protection provided by T cells -- the part of the immune system that softens the blow of infection, though it's unable to prevent it. But society has "already seen some dent" in protection against severe disease and death offered by shots, thanks to viral evolution.

"It was 95% through delta -- it's now maybe 80%," he said. "And it could drop down to 70% or 60%."

In a worst-case scenario, fully boosted but high-risk people, like the elderly, could be hit even harder than they are now. "Hopefully we don't see that," he said.
