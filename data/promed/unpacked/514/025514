Guernsey's wild rabbit population appears to be infected with a new fatal disease, the States Vet has confirmed. David Chamberlain said evidence suggested the source of Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease 2, which has been confirmed in a rabbit that died in the GSPCA (Guersney Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)'s care as well as another privately owned pet rabbit, was likely to have been from wild rabbits.

It is yet another disease that faces the island's wild population and RVHD-2 eradication is "generally impossible" if the virus becomes established in wild rabbit populations, Mr Chamberlain said.

"It is disappointing that Guernsey's wild rabbit population appears to be infected and this is likely to be as a result of midges and mosquitoes being carried on the wind from France," he added. "It is likely that the wild rabbits across the Bailiwick are infected with RVHD-2 if it has been introduced by midges and mosquitoes. RVHD-2 is an additional challenge to Guernsey's wild rabbit population which is still challenged by feral ferrets and suffers cyclical outbreaks of myxomatosis."

Myxomatosis and RVHD-1 and 2 do not cause disease in dogs, cats or humans.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment.

The incubation period varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute infection and are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present. There is primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

Over the past year there has been increasing concern regarding rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease "new variant 2" (RVHD-2) becoming a cause of several cases of rabbit mortality in the UK. RVHD-2 has been noted in the UK for at least 2 years.
