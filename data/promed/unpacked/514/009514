Subject: Emergency Management Warning 81: Exotic Management Warning 81:
Exotic Newcastle Disease Confirmed in the United States
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the State of
California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 22
commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also
confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada. A backyard flock was
confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of Arizona. On 9 Apr 2003,
END was confirmed in backyard fowl in Texas. Clinical signs in infected
birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality
is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final
validation. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel
and other federal government personnel are working with the States to
consider additional resources to meet the labor demands at the Task
Forces. APHIS has implemented a plan for enhanced national END surveillance.

Operational Update
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
Effective 10 Feb 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
all of La Paz and Yuma Counties and a portion of Mohave County, AZ.
Effective 10 Apr 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
all of El Paso and Hudspeth Counties, TX, and Dona Ana, Luna, and Otero
Counties, NM. The federal quarantine was placed on counties beyond the
infected county due to their proximity to the infected county.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, and New
Mexico. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within
Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas.
Currently there are 22 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END. The breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as
follows: 4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 7
premises in San Diego County (7 infected), and 11 premises in San
Bernardino County (11 infected).
* Of the 2588 premises designated for depopulation, 98.2 percent have been
completed.
* APHIS, enhanced surveillance plan includes the surveillance of 22 410
premises from the Central California Task Force, 3474 premises from the
Inland Desert Task Force, and 750 premises from the South Coast Task
Force. All of these premises currently reside outside the quarantined area
in the State of California.
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed and
working cooperatively with approximately 15 - 20 county officials to
implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.
Outreach Activities
* The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) distributed a 5550-piece END
mail-out to veterinarians, bird owners, producers, and agriculture teachers
who do not have access to e-mail or fax machines. TAHC also faxed to
approximately 3300 sites and e-mailed to an additional 30 000 sites
information regarding the END outbreak in Texas.
* TAHC veterinarians held a local news conference with the El Paso County,
TX, emergency preparedness officials to brief the public on the END situation.
On a daily basis, Task Force personnel are communicating information
concerning surveillance, depopulation, and cleaning and disinfection
operations to all affected city managers in Southern California.
Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450 calls
per week from the public through the Joint Information Center phone
bank. This is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls in October
2002. On average, approximately 300 of these calls require follow-up
action by the Inland Desert or South Coast Incident Command Posts.
The Task Force information staff provides daily updates to approximately 50
media outlets in California. In addition, in Area Command alone, the
information staff field approximately 70 media calls per week.

FAX (512) 719-0719

For immediate release 10 Apr 2003
Exotic Newcastle Disease Confirmed in Texas;
5 Counties Quarantined in Texas and New Mexico
Birds and poultry movement from 5 counties in Texas and New Mexico is being
prohibited after laboratory tests completed late Wed 9 Apr 2003 confirmed
Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) had infected a backyard flock of chickens
last week near El Paso. As a preemptive measure, state and federal animal
health regulatory officials earlier this week destroyed the flock, but are
concerned that END, a highly contagious foreign-origin virus, may have
spread to other poultry and birds in the area.
El Paso County has been quarantined by the Texas Animal Health Commission
(TAHC), and the New Mexico Livestock Board has quarantined Luna, Dona Ana,
and Otero Counties in New Mexico. By mid-afternoon Thu 10 Apr 2003, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is expected to place a federal
quarantine on these counties, in addition to Hudspeth County in Texas.
"As of Wednesday evening, infection has been confirmed only in El Paso
County," explained Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas state veterinarian and executive
director for the TAHC. "However, the 5 counties quarantined in Texas and
New Mexico are considered to be a trade area in which there is significant
movement of birds and poultry. State and federal authority is being imposed
so that disease surveillance, testing and diagnosis can be conducted. It
is customary for the USDA to quarantine additional counties, in order to
create a 'buffer zone' around an infected county. The END outbreak must be
stopped before it spreads to other backyard, hobbyist or exhibition
flocks, or to the commercial poultry industry."
Dr. Hillman explained that the USDA is providing fair market payment for
birds that must be destroyed during this disease outbreak. He stressed
that END does not affect human health, nor does it affect poultry products
or eggs.
"We are depending on bird and poultry owners to assist us in eradicating
this disease outbreak," said Dr. Steven England, state veterinarian for the
New Mexico Livestock Board. "Please report illness or unexpected death
losses to your private veterinary practitioner or to the TAHC or New Mexico
Livestock Board." The TAHC has a 24-hour hotline that can be reached at
1-800-550-8242, and the New Mexico Livestock Board can be called at (505)
841-6161.
END usually has a 2- to 15-day incubation period, and infected birds or
poultry may exhibit signs of respiratory distress, including gasping or
coughing. The virus also affects the central nervous system, causing
infected birds to become paralyzed, develop muscle tremors, or twist their
necks. In some flocks, disease may strike quickly, and the only sign is
death loss.
"We are asking for full cooperation from bird and poultry owners. Do not
move birds from the quarantine area. Do not move birds within the area,
either," he said. "If at all possible, keep birds in isolation on your
premise, and ensure that no birds are introduced onto your property during
the quarantine period."
Dr. Hillman said that the quarantines will last until state and federal
animal health officials are certain all disease has been eradicated and
that it is safe to resume normal movement and activities.
"Take precautions," said Dr. Hillman. "Clean your boots prior to entering
bird pens. You could pick up contaminated manure on your footwear at the
feed store, at the coffee shop, or at your neighbor's place. Use bleach
and water or a commercial disinfectant to spray or dip your boots. Wear
clean clothes when working with the birds. Clothing, too, can pick up
viruses that can be transmitted to your birds."
"We can stop the spread of this disease, but only if we all work together
quickly and cooperatively. Report illness in your birds. Abide by the
quarantines. Practice good biosecurity," said Dr. England. "By addressing
this problem together, we can stop this disease before it has a chance to
become widespread in Texas or New Mexico."
