A total of 17 children and 2 adults from the Arab village of Barta'a
in Wadi Ara arrived this week [week of 4 Jan 2010] at the emergency
room of Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tzrifin.

Showing high fever, bloody stools and confusion, they were diagnosed
with infection with the _Shigella_ bacteria that cause dysentery.

The infection apparently came from drinking polluted water from a well
in the village. They were given liquids and antibiotics, and the
Health Ministry was informed.

Another 500 people have been infected with cholera in Papua New Guinea
over the holiday period, raising the total to about 1900 cases. Close
to 40 people have died since the beginning of the outbreak more than 5
months ago.

The World Health Organization's PNG representative, Dr Eigil Sorensen,
says new cases are still showing up in the affected East Sepik,
Morobe, and Madang provinces. "The total number of cases now is close
to 1900. There's an increase in cases. It's still, I would say, a low
level transmission, although it seems to move to new focal areas and
new hotspots."

The 1st case of cholera has been reported in Papua New Guinea's
capital Port Moresby. 5 months into a national cholera outbreak, a
woman transferred to a city hospital from East Sepik province has
tested positive for the disease. She has since recovered.

The executive manager of Papua New Guinea's National Health
Department, Doctor Enoch Posanai, says a long term solution requires
national action. "Part of the long term sort of approach to address
these water related diseases like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid we have
to address the whole water supplies and sanitation at the community
level."

people with acute diarrhea who were admitted to local hospitals in the
Mekong Delta province of An Giang between 19 and 28 Jan 2010, were

Takeo and Kandal provinces to An Giang for treatment, according to the
Department of Preventive Health and Environment. The department did
not clarify whether all the patients were Vietnamese or not.

The disease has ravaged northern Vietnam 2 times, in 2008 and 2009,

The Ministry of Health warned of a potential cholera outbreak on
Sunday [10 Jan 2010] after a cluster of infections, including a
fatality, were reported in Phnom Penh's Russey Keo district. Health
officials have been tracking a rash of cholera infections across the
country over the past 45 days, said Dr Sok Touch, director of the
Communicable Disease Control Department at the Ministry of Health. "I
suggest that health officials in every province take urgent action to
prevent peoples' exposure to contaminated water," he said.

On 5 Jan 2009, a 28 year old garment worker from Phnom Penh's Russey
Keo district, died 12 hours after she was hospitalized for diarrhea
and vomiting. "The woman's fatal infection came from contaminated food
or water she consumed outside of the workplace," said Pok Vanthat,
deputy director of the Occupational Health Department at the Ministry
of Labor.

So far 6 villagers in Prey Veng province have been stricken with an
illness that one commune official said he believed to be cholera,
although health officials have yet to hand down an official diagnosis.
The villagers from Reak Chey commune have suffered from intense
diarrhea and vomiting since Mon 1 Feb 2010, commune chief Hong Sophal
said.

"We have sent a man to Calmette Hospital [in Phnom Penh] because he is
suffering, even though the doctors here have tried to help him," he
said. The man's daughter said her father's condition has not improved
since entering the hospital, and that doctors have not told her what
is causing her father's illness. "He is still in bad condition," she
said. "I am worried about his life."

Health officials have not confirmed the presence of cholera in the area.

[7] Cholera - Thailand (Pattani province)

Chief of Pattani provincial health office prepares the SRRT
(surveillance rapid response team) to investigate and control a
cholera outbreak in villages after cholera [bacteria] were found in
village pipe water.

A cholera outbreak in Pattani is still ongoing. Recently, the epidemic
has spread to not only fishing communities on the Pattani riverbanks,
but also to other villages located further away from rivers and the
coastal area. One of the reasons is that people consume seafood that
fishermen catch from infected areas. Nowadays, pipes water in the
villages have been found to be infected with cholera [bacteria], and
some villagers in 12 districts have contracted the disease.

According to Dr Udomkirt Poolsawat, senior medical officer of Pattani
provincial health office, cholera bacteria have recently been found in
village water system. It has been requested that chlorine be added to
water tanks in the villages in order to limit the spread of the
disease. In the meantime, health care teams and SRRT have been set up
to investigate and control the outbreak in the field.

Since the beginning of 2010, there have been more than 80 people
infected with cholera. Patients are distributed in every district.
However, none of the patients is in critical condition. Pattani health
officials make every effort to continually educate the communities and
improve environmental sanitation in order to prevent a reemergence of
the cholera outbreak.

[According to the 2009 summary report of the Bureau of Epidemiology
about the situation of acute diarrhea and cholera in Thailand, as of
23 Dec 2009, there were 315 confirmed cholera cases with 2 fatalities
(one case in Pattani province and another in Narathiwat province).
Among those 315 cases, 128 were Thai, 103 were Myanmar, 71 were
Cambodian, and 13 were Laos. 82 percent of cases (259/315) were caused
by _Vibrio cholerae_ El Tor Ogawa, and the rest (56/315) were caused
by _V. cholerae_ El Tor Inaba.

The 5 provinces with the highest number of cases were Pattani (121),
Tak (71), Rayong (38), Ranong (26), and Narathiwat (19), see (in Thai)
<http://203.157.15.4/surdata/vc/dailyreport/y53/c301252.pdf>.

The outbreak of cholera in Pattani started in mid-October 2009. Most
of the infected people were fishermen and their family members, who
live in fishing communities on the Pattani riverbanks. As of 29 Dec
2009, there were 216 cases in 8 districts of Pattani (out of a total
of 12 districts) (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Cholera Thailand (02):
