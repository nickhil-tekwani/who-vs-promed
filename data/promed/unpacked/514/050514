Quality and pharmacovigilance information on Nobivac Rabies

...

Upon request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development - MoAG, MSD Animal Health conducted an investigation concerning the Nobivac Rabies batch that was recently distributed in Israel.

The following is a summary of the investigation conducted by MSD Animal Health:

The concerned Nobivac Rabies batch was manufactured, tested, released, and transported according to its approved procedures and methods. All the results of final product testing were within the testing specifications according to the registered parameters at the time it was released to the market.

The clinical signs reported in pharmacovigilance cases for the concerned batch mainly include typical signs of hypersensitivity reaction / anaphylaxis or injection site reactions. Those signs are in line with the product profile and cumulative global pharmacovigilance data.

It is important to note that the overall incidence of animal suspected adverse reactions for the concerned batch of Nobivac Rabies after recommended and extra label use is rare (>=1/10 000 and <1/1000) in relation to the sales volume.

Based on available adverse event data received for the concerned batch, it is concluded that the safety and efficacy of Nobivac Rabies were in line with the cumulative global experience to date and that the benefit/risk ration did not change.

[As reported in ProMED post 20220802.8704804, the letter/circular distributed by the State Veterinary Services on 1 Aug 2022 included, inter alia, the following information:

"1. Most of the complaints referred to the following side effects: fever, vomiting, itching, pain in the injection site. There have been few reports of serious reactions such as anaphylactic shock which required medical intervention. So far, no confirmed deaths have been reported.

"2. As is well known, side effects may follow the use of any medical product; most of such effects are detailed in the accompanying leaflets. In each case, an examination of the animal is required, addressing the severity of the phenomenon, its frequency, and whether it can be attributed to the vaccine.

"3. As of this date, no information supporting the cessation of the marketing of the named vaccine has surfaced. Follow-up is continued.

"4. In accordance with the European legislation, adopted in Israel, side effects must be reported to the manufacturer or importer. Their address appears on the label and/or the product leaflet."

A press release, published by Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [MOARD] on 31 Jul 2022, includes comprehensive additional information about the event and is available (in English) at https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/rabies_vaccine.

Annual licensing and rabies vaccination of all dogs are compulsory in Israel. Most of the vaccinations are performed by authorised practitioners, who are supervised by their respective municipal veterinarians, to whom the vaccination performance of each dog is reported. Until recently, vaccinations of dogs against rabies were required on an annual basis. This requirement has been undergoing a change, with vaccination becoming prescribed every 2nd year following the primary and booster vaccinations. - Mod.AS
