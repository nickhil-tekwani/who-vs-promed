A farm owner who had traveled to China appears to be responsible for
the spread of foot-and-mouth [FMD] last month [April 2010], which led
to the culling of some 50 000 animals.

The state-run National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service
(NVRQS) said on Monday [17 May 2010] that a 48-year-old rancher from
Ganghwa Island seems to have carried in the highly contagious disease.

"We learned that [he] had travelled to China in early March 2010 and
returned home without undertaking proper quarantine measures," NVRQS
official Lee Sang-jin said.

"FMD was 1st detected at the rancher's ranch on Ganghwa Island, where
9 out of 177 cattle came down with the fatal virus, which eventually
spread to other areas."

The rancher is not legally liable for the initiation of the outbreak,
but his compensation for the destruction of the 177 cattle is reduced
in order to discourage trips to countries where the disease is common.

Since the outbreak was 1st reported on 8 Apr 2010 at his farm in
Ganghwa, 60 km west of Seoul, there have been 11 more cases in
various scattered locations in Gyeonggi and South Chungcheong provinces.

In order to prevent the spread of the disease, around 50 000 animals
were destroyed within a 3-km radius of the outbreaks. Yet, the
disease has yet to be contained.

"If there are no new cases next week, we can heave a sigh of relief.
But we should remember the virus can be brought over anytime from
neighboring countries," Lee said. "As the disease is common in
northeast Asian countries, we cannot be complacent. We plan to make
every effort to bring it under control." For example, over 85 000
animals have been culled in Japan this year [2010] due to the
disease, of which outbreaks have already reached 3 digits.

When FMD [serotype A] was found at a farm in January 2010 in [S.
Korean] Gyeonggi province, the damage was relatively small. The
state-backed agency said that a migrant worker appears to have been the cause.

FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals, mostly domesticated ones,
including cattle, goats, pigs, deer and sheep. The problem is that
vaccination is difficult as the virus seamlessly evolves and mutates.

It is widely believed not to affect humans, though this fact is
disputed. In Korea, there have been no reports of anyone suffering from it.

"We strongly recommend ranchers or farmers not to travel to northeast
Asian countries for the time being. We cannot lawfully force them,
but if they do not follow our recommendation, they can face financial
losses when it comes to culling animals," Lee said.

[Since the S. Korean and Chinese FMDV serotype O strains are of a
similar genoype, and in view of the coincidence of the outbreak
starting on a farm owned by a person returning from China, where the
disease was reported earlier this year (2010), the above speculation
is plausible. However, the infected animals were, reportedly, cattle,
a species known to get infected by the respiratory route (compared to
pigs, mostly infected by the digestive route); more details of the
epidemiological investigation are anticipated.

The FMD virus is known to be extremely contagious; it can be
transmitted on fomites including clothing, footwear, vehicles etc.
Virus stability increases at lower temperatures. It was reported to
survive on bran and hay for more than 3 months in a laboratory. It
can also remain viable for approximately 2 months on wool at 4 C,
with significantly decreased survival when the temperature increases
to 18 C (64 F), and for 2 to 3 months in bovine feces. Organic
material protects the virus from drying and enhances its survival on
fomites. Virus survival is also enhanced when FMDV is protected from
sunlight. FMDV is inactivated at pH below 6.5 or above 11. This virus
can persist in meat and other animal products when the pH remains
above 6.0, but it is inactivated by acidification of muscles during
rigor mortis. It can survive for long periods in chilled or frozen
lymph nodes or bone marrow.

In humans, FMDV may be carried in the nasal passages for a period of
time, though some observations put this route in doubt, since the
virus was not transmitted by people when personal hygiene and
biosecurity protocols were followed.
