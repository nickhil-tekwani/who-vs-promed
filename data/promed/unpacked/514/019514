Following the outbreak of a dangerous strain of avian influenza in 7 provinces, Iran Veterinary Organization [IVO] released a biosafety directive on Tuesday [27 Dec 2016] calling on all poultry farm owners to take extra precautionary measures during the remaining cold months of the year.

The statement, comprising 18 items, provides strict protocols on how to keep fowls safe from the H5N8 virus. It directs all poultry farm owners to prevent farm birds from having any form of contact (through common food, water sources) with outside or wild birds in the area. It also advises them to stop transferring chicken manure (used as organic fertilizer) inside or outside of the facilities.

The IVO has also urged farmers not to take any action regarding diagnosis and treatment of the flu without checking with the IVO network.

Iran has culled hundreds of thousands of birds in recent weeks as avian flu spread across 7 provinces, according to local news outlets.

More than 1000 wild birds, mostly geese, have been found dead in the Mighan Lagoon wetland in Markazi Province, central Iran. Besides Markazi, bird flu has been detected in Alborz, Qom, East Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, Mazandaran and Tehran.

According to IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency], 63 000 chickens, along with 800 000 fertilized eggs and day-old chicks, were culled at a farm in Qazvin Province in recent days after an outbreak of the deadly H1N8 and H1N5 strains [sic; should read H5N8; see comment] strains of the disease.

This adds to the 725 000 birds destroyed since mid-November [2016] across the country following the outbreaks.

Afghanistan was the latest country to ban the import of chicken and eggs from Iran. Iraq, Azerbaijan Republic and Iraqi Kurdistan banned Iranian import of poultry and related products a week ago.

[The HPAI strains H1N8 and H1N5, mentioned in the above media report (and in several others, distributed in several countries during the last days), are erroneous and should read H5N8.

As informed by EpiCore Surveillance Project member Zahra B. Seyed, who is gratefully acknowledged, "the (said strains) are a journalistic oversight. The official follow-up report (to the OIE) is accessible via http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21973."

The mentioned OIE follow-up report, No. 3, submitted to the OIE on 20 Dec 2016, specified the causative agent as HPAI H5N8; no other strains were mentioned. The report addressed 2 new outbreaks in commercial layer farms, in the provinces Qom and East Azerbaijan, and 2 events in wild birds, in 2 provinces: the Mighan wetland, Arak, Markazi province and the Miankale wetland, Behshahr, Marzandaran province. The locations can be seen in the included interactive map.

The following epidemiological comments were included:
1- These new outbreaks were detected under the ongoing avian influenza surveillance program.
2- A post outbreak investigation to trace the source of infection is ongoing to detect the probable spread and circulation of this sub-type.
3- Active surveillance is ongoing.
4- Epidemiological investigation is ongoing and as preemptive control measures, 523 000 birds at farms located in a 3-km [about 2-mile] radius around the affected farms have been slaughtered following confirmed negative result for HPAI.

On top of poultry, the following species were named among the birds tested by IVO Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory), with positive real-time PCR results for HPAI H5N8:

Ardeidae (unidentified); bean goose; greater flamingo; Gruidae (unidentified) Laridae (unidentified); little grebe; Phoenicopteridae (unidentified); tufted duck.

A weekly update is anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[The summary of the Israeli H5N8 epizootic, since the start of the outbreak on 9 Nov 2016, in relation to poultry (excluding wild birds) is, according to WAHID report archive, the following:

Total outbreaks = 13 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 198 900 / 26 800 / 21 300 / 145 500 / 0

Among the affected farms, there was a single layers farm (table-eggs producer in Naham, the Jeruslam district). A media report addressed the possibility that table eggs from this farm had been marketed prior to the identification and subsequent culling of the farm's bird population, in line with a decision taken mutually by the Ministries of Agriculture and Health (in Hebrew, http://www.themarker.com/news/macro/1.3182120). The need/sensibleness of a recall of table eggs is ongoing, with attention paid to the fact that HPAI H5N8 is not regarded, thus far, zoonotic. Information on the policy applied in such cases in other countries will be useful. - Mod.AS]

[An official follow-up report (No. 10) to the OIE, addressing the above 2 new outbreaks, has been submitted to the OIE on Thu 29 Dec 2016 by Dr Krzysztof Jazdzewski, the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer. It includes an interactive map indicating their respective locations, and is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22110.

The summary of Poland's HPAI H5N8 event since its start on 28 Oct 2016, available on OIE's WAHID reports archive, as of 29 Dec 2016, is as follows:

Total outbreaks = 20 (Submitted; including wild birds)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds (poultry) / 223 765 / 5407 / 5407 / 218 358 / 0
Anatidae (unidentified) / - / 10 / 10 / 0 / 0
Laridae (unidentified) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Herring gull / - / 4 / 4 / 0 / 0
Mute swan / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

(For the detailed report, including the information in the immediate notification, 10 follow-up reports and a map showing all accumulated outbreaks, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000022110_20161229_153738.pdf.)

An update (as of 26 Dec 2016) of the HPAI H5N8 epidemiological situation in Europe since October 2016, is available in the French Plateforme ESA website: http://plateforme-esa.fr/article/situation-%C3%A9pid%C3%A9miologique-iahp-h5n8-en-europe-depuis-octobre-2016-point-de-situation-au-2 (with a PDF version of their last weekly update available at the end of the article).

The following summary table of reported outbreaks per country/branch, as of 26 Dec 2016, including 17 EU countries (including Switzerland), is copied from the said report:

Captive / Domesticated / Wild
-----------------------------
Austria / - / 2 / 3
Bulgaria / - / 6 / 1
Croatia / - / - / 2
Denmark / - / 1 / 35
Finland / 1 / - / 7
France / 1 / 49 / 5
Germany / 4 / 19 / 139
Greece / - / - / 1
Hungary / - / 214 / 4
Montenegro / - / - / 1
Netherlands / 1 / 6 / 38
Poland / - / 12 / 5
Romania / - / - / 5
Serbia / - / 3 / 1
Sweden / - / 2 / 10
Switzerland / - / - / 84
UK / - / 1 / 4
Grand total / 7 / 315 / 345

The website includes a map showing all reported outbreaks during the covered period. An 18th EU member country is likely to be added to the list since the OIE publication of Slovakia's immediate notification of an outbreak in backyard laying hens -- pullets and adults up to 4 years of age, dated 29 Dec 2016 (final serotyping pending).

Several EU countries (e.g. Hungary, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany) have submitted follow-up reports since 26 Dec 2016 (all OIE's follow-up reports can be accessed at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/WI/index/newlang/en).

Tunisia submitted on 28 Dec 2016 a follow-up report confirming the similarity of the circulating virus to the one on the European continent. It included the following epidemiological comments: "The H5 sequence fragment was sent to the Reference Laboratory in Padova to identify the neuraminidase (N). The Reference Laboratory confirmed that the H5 sequence fragment is directly related to highly pathogenic H5 virus sequences clade 2.3.4.4 (including the H5N8 viruses currently circulating in Russia and Europe). - A phylogenetic analysis is on-going at the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Venice (OIE Reference Laboratory). - The situation is stable."

HPAI H5N8 is already circulating in 3 continents (Asia, Europe, Africa). Its distribution in Europe, in domestic fowl and in wild birds, exceeds the one presented at the peak of the HPAI H5N1 panzootic during the 1st decade of the 21st century. Luckily, so far this highly infectious strain has not turned to affect humans and other mammals, in distinction with HPAI H5N1. - Mod.AS]
