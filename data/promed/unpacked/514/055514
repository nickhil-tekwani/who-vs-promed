Nebraska Cattle: West Nile Virus Positive Serology & Neurological Symptoms
-------------------------------------------------
Cornell University has just informed us that 2 bovine sera from Brown
Co.(N. Central) and Nemaha Co.(SE) Nebraska have tested positive for West
Nile virus (WNV) with serum neutralizing titers of 1:1024 and 1:128,
respectively. The first animal, an adult female Holstein, has been down for
3 weeks, but is still alive. When first examined, she was thin, showed rear
limb ataxia, but was alert and eating. Within 3 days, she was totally down
and showed no response to treatment with electrolytes, dexamethasone and
banamine. The owners are still providing nursing care at last report.
The submitting veterinarian reported that the owners had lost a horse to
WNV very early in the Nebraska outbreak (early August 2002). The second
animal, a 900-pound steer, exhibited ataxia in hind limbs, progressing to
paresis, did not respond to treatment with banamine, dexamethasone, or
antibiotics but was alert and afebrile at all times. The duration of
illness was 3 weeks, at which time the owners requested euthanasia, with no
further testing. We have been unable to confirm WNV as the causative agent
of disease, due to lack of availability of samples for further testing.

[The interpretation of these observations is difficult in view of the
absence of any follow-up data. There is accumulated serological evidence,
mainly from Africa, also from Asia and southern Europe, on the ability of
West Nile virus to infect various species of mammals, bovines included.
This moderator has not been able, however, to trace clinically-related WNV
observations for cattle. For example, in Israel -- a country where WNV has
been known for decades -- no clinical suspicion of West Nile virus
infection in bovines has been reported so far. This, in spite of a very
intensive clinical care service of the dairy cattle industry, assisted by
the computerized, on-line milking lists, which enable early detection of
health problems by their reflection upon the milk production.
However, as suggested also by our WNV-experienced colleague Mertyn
Malkinson, the Nebraskan results cannot be dismissed lightly in view of the
extent of the West Nile virus outbreak in that state, particularly in
equines, and the previous reports of West Nile virus infection in sheep and
goats. Additional data, such as results of serological tests from other
cows in the affected herd for "environmental" exposure, might be helpful.
Data from other WNV countries, with special reference to South Africa, will
also be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
