[1] Germany: new deaths

More than 2 weeks after a food poisoning epidemic broke out in
northern Germany, at least 14 people have been reported dead and
hundreds have fallen sick from an extremely dangerous strain of the
_E. coli_ bacterium found on imported cucumbers.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control described the
outbreak "one of the largest worldwide and the largest ever reported
in Germany."

German authorities urged people to avoid eating raw vegetables after
traces of the bacteria were found on organic cucumbers last week [week
of 23 May 2011]. The vegetables were apparently imported from Spain.

The number of confirmed and suspected cases has reached 1200,
according to media reports. The outbreak has hit countries that
include Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, but most of the
cases appear to involve people who had recently traveled to or from
Germany.

[The overall case number as well as the number of those affected by
HUS and the total death count continue to rise. It remains to be
determined where and how the contamination of the cucumbers (and any
other contaminated salad ingredients) occurred related to this unusual
VTEC serotype that is eae-negative and possesses a very antimicrobial
reistance phenotype. - Mod.LL]

[2] Source of pathogen still unclear

German authorities have warned that the source of an outbreak of VTEC
_E. coli_ blamed for 10 [now 14] deaths and hundreds of people falling
ill, has yet to be pinpointed.

"Until experts in Germany and Spain are able to positively identify
the source of the pathogen, general warnings about vegetables remain
valid," consumer minister Ilse Aiger told the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper. "The relevant authorities are doing all they can to clear
this up, nationally and internationally."

The epicentre of the outbreak has been in northern Germany, with
hundreds of other suspected cases reported, but cases have also been
reported in France, Sweden, Denmark, Britain, Switzerland, Austria,
and The Netherlands.

Suspicion has so far turned on Spain, with the European Commission
saying on Fri 27 May 2011, that organic cucumbers grown in the
southern provinces of Almeria and Malaga are suspected as a source of
the outbreak. Southern Spanish authorities said yesterday, 28 May
2011, they had introduced restrictions on 2 distributors suspected of
exporting tainted cucumbers. Andalusia's regional council said suspect
batches had been withdrawn pending tests.

But the European Commission also said that a batch of cucumbers
originating either in The Netherlands or in Denmark, and traded in
Germany, was also under investigation.

[3] Denmark: cases, Danish cucumbers suspected
Date: Sun 29 May 2011

Danish cucumbers are suspected of helping spread the _E. coli_
bacteria believed to be triggering a deadly outbreak of intestinal
infection in Denmark and Germany, local media reported Sun 29 May
2011. School authorities in the Danish city of Odense said up to 1500
children may have been exposed to the bacteria after eating cucumbers
of Danish origin at a school festival on Fri 27 May 2011, the local
Fyns Times reported.

The cucumbers came from a Danish wholesaler which also delivers farm
products to a German supplier where vegetables contaminated by the _E.
coli_ bacteria have been found earlier this week.

The Danish cucumbers were mixed in Germany with cucumbers originating
in the Netherlands, making it difficult to determine if Danish
cucumbers are in fact contaminated.

According to Denmark's National Serum Institute, there are 9
confirmed cases, with at least another 8 people suspected of having
the intestinal infection, also known as VTEC, in Denmark. 4 of the
confirmed cases show symptoms of kidney failure, which marks an
advanced stage of the sickness, the institute said Saturday [28 May
2011].

The Odense school authorities have advised parents to monitor the
affected children for signs of the infection. Denmark's Veterinary and
Food Administration (DVFA) said earlier that the suspicion against
Danish cucumbers was "vague," but advised Danish consumers not to eat
raw tomato, lettuce, and cucumber from Germany, and cucumber from
Spain. It is now checking Danish cucumbers for traces of _E. coli_.

[4] Sweden: 1st death outside Germany
Date: Tue 31 May 2011

An additional 2 deaths linked to a bacterial outbreak in Europe
blamed on tainted vegetables were reported Tue 31 May 2011, including
the 1st outside Germany, as the number of people falling ill continued
to rise. The deaths brought to 16 the total number of fatalities
linked to the _E. coli_ outbreak, with northwestern Germany the
hardest-hit region.

Hospital officials in Boras, Sweden, announced the death of woman in
her 50s who was admitted on 29 May 2011 after a trip to Germany. In
Paderborn, Germany, the local council said an 87-year-old woman who
also suffered from other ailments had died.

In Germany, the national disease control center said 373 people were
sick with the most serious form of the outbreak, hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, or HUS, a rare complication arising from an infection most
commonly associated with certain toxic-producing _E. coli_. That
figure was up from the 329 reported Mon 30 May 2011.

Susanne Glasmacher, a spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, said
another 796 people have been affected by the enterohemorrhagic _E.
coli_, also known as EHEC, bacteria -- making a total of more than
1150 people infected. Hundreds of people also have been sickened in
other European countries, but until Tue 31 May 2011, Germany had seen
the only deaths.

Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment is still warning
consumers to avoid all cucumbers, lettuces, and raw tomatoes as the
outbreak is investigated.

European Union officials have said that German authorities identified
cucumbers from the Spanish regions of Almeria and Malaga as possible
sources of contamination and that a 3rd suspect batch, originating
either in the Netherlands or in Denmark and traded in Germany, is also
under investigation.

They have also noted, however, that the transport chain is long, and
the cucumbers from Spain could have been contaminated at any point
along the route.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said Tue 31 May 2011,
that no traces of EHEC bacteria were found in tests conducted over the
weekend.

"There is therefore nothing that indicates that Danish cucumbers are
the source of the serious _E. coli_ outbreak that has infected several
patients in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden," the agency said.

[This posting reports the 1st death outside Germany but acquired
there, associated with the quite large and still growing outbreak. As
the number of cases continues to rise, one wonders if this is related
to some cases with a longer incubation period, the inability of
getting the cucumbers and other salad vegetables off the market and
out of people's homes, or continued contamination.

Again, the method and site of the contamination remains unclear. -

[5] Spain, Austria, Britain, Netherlands, USA: possible 1st cases ex
Germany

http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/health/news/article_1642552.php/First-possible-E-coli-case-reported-in-Spain


A 1st possible case of _E. coli_ infection has been discovered in
Spain, Basque health officials said on Tue 31 May 2011.

Germany has blamed Spanish cucumbers for the _E. coli_ [O104]
outbreak that has claimed 14 [now 15 in Germany and 1 in Sweden -
Mod.LL] lives in Germany. Spain has rejected such accusations,
stressing that nobody had caught the bacterium in Spain itself.
Doctors now suspect that a 40-year-old man who is in intensive care at
a San Sebastian hospital may have been infected with _E. coli_ (EHEC).
It was, however, deemed possible that the man had not caught the
bacterium in Spain, since he had returned recently from a trip to
Germany and the Czech Republic. A Spanish athlete is also being
treated for an EHEC infection in the German city of Hamburg, where she
participated in a marathon.

At a European Union agriculture ministers' meeting in Hungary on Tue
31 May 2011, Spain was preparing to seek financial compensation for
the damage the _E. coli_ outbreak had caused to its vegetable exports,
which have become virtually paralyzed to Central Europe and Russia.

In addition to Germany, there have been almost 4 dozen EHEC cases
reported in 5 other European countries, Austria, Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Sweden, with another 3 found in the USA. All have so
far only involved people who recently were in Germany or German
nationals travelling abroad.

[This is the 1st report of possible cases in Spain, Austria, Britain,
Netherlands & USA, all apparently acquired in Germany. No information
is seemingly available regarding the USA cases such as their location
and severity. More is likely to be forthcoming since the USA has just
finished a 3 day holiday weekend. - Mod.LL]

The Ministries of Economy, Health and Agriculture announced in a
joint statement on Sat 28 May 2011, 3 suspected cases of _E. coli_
O104 infection linked to an outbreak in Germany due to bacteria found
in cucumbers, are under investigation in France.

It was announced that a batch of cucumbers considered suspicious was
delivered into French territory, but that the withdrawal from the
markets was immediately requested.

In Switzerland, a woman who recently traveled in northern Germany was
suffering from diarrhea, probably caused by EHEC, the Federal Office
of Public Health (BAG) said Fri 27 May 2011. She had eaten salad at a
meal after which other guests fell ill in Germany. She suffered no
further complications. Analysis of a 2nd and a 3rd case of infection
in Switzerland is currently underway to determine if it is the same
serotype of bacteria responsible for the deaths in Germany. The
results should be presented next week, said Daniel Koch of the Federal
Health Office (BAG) to [the news agency] ATS.

[Animal faecal contamination of growing fruit and vegetables is known
to be an important source of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
infections. It will be of particular interest to discover the source
of contamination in the current event. If initial reports of possible
involvement of organic produce are confirmed, this will lead to the
need to re-evaluate the application of animal-derived fertilizers
(such as organic manure) and requirements for their treatment in
organic agriculture. - Mod.AS]
