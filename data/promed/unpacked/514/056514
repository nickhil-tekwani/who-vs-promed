Speculation grew about a possible geographic cluster of illnesses in
Viet Nam's Bac Kan province as The World Health Organization (WHO)
today [9 Apr 2010] confirmed Egypt's latest human H5N1 case and death
[posted previously in ProMED-mail report archived as: "Avian
influenza, human (27): Egypt, 109th case/34th death 20100405.1090"].

Influenza Internet message boards and blogs today [9 Apr 2010] are
citing new media reports, some of them from local Vietnamese language
sources, that appear to confirm and provide fresh details about an
earlier report on a potential geographic H5N1 cluster. The affected
area is Bac Kan province in northeastern Viet Nam, home to the
country's latest confirmed H5N1 case-patient [see: ProMED-mail post
archived as: "Avian influenza, human (28): Viet Nam (BK), RFI
20100405.1092."].

On Mon 5 Apr 2010, Voice of Viet Nam, a news outlet that publishes
English-language reports, said provincial health authorities
confirmed [avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection] in a 22-year-old
man who was hospitalized in critical condition. The same report said
4 other people from the man's commune in Cho Moi district had similar
symptoms and were being treated and quarantined at the Bac Kan
regional hospital.

Today [9 Apr 2010], Voice of Viet Nam reported that [avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection] has been confirmed in another patient from
Cho Moi district, a 27-year-old man who visited the area 4 or 5 days
before he got sick. A Bac Kan media report from today, obtained,
translated, and reported on the FluTrackers internet message board,
said avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection has also been confirmed
in a 27-month-old toddler and that medical authorities are tracking
21 other suspected cases, of which 7 have reportedly been
hospitalized. The report said their symptoms include fever, cough,
and shortness of breath. Some of the patients are reportedly the
child's family members, and the local media report suggested that
they may have shared exposure to infected poultry or contaminated
meat. The news report also mentioned control measures such as
disinfection of affected areas and that the area has received a
supply of oseltamivir, personal protective equipment, and medical sup!
plies, according to FluTracker translations of the story. Media
reports have also noted that checkpoints have been posted on roads
leading to the affected area.

Mike Coston, a former paramedic who covers and analyzes breaking flu
news on his Avian Flu Diary blog, noted today [9 Apr 2010] that
machine translations of foreign-language news reports are valuable
but can sometimes contain glitches and lack key nuances. "Still, the
stories coming out of Viet Nam appear to be reasonably consistent and
have persisted now for several days. They are worthy of our notice,"
he wrote. Sharon Sanders, editor-in-chief of FluTrackers, told CIDRAP
News that if health authorities confirm the findings, it will be Viet
Nam's 1st geographic H5N1 cluster since late 2008 and early 2009,
when 2 sisters were infected.

[Previously confirmed clusters of human cases of avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection have been extremely rare. Official
confirmation of these cases of suspected avian influenza (H5N1) virus
infection is awaited.
