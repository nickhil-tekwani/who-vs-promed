Abstract
--------
A nosocomial cluster induced by co-infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) viruses occurred in 2 patients at a hospital in Zhejiang Province, China, in January 2014. The index case-patient was a 57-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had been occupationally exposed to poultry. He had co-infection with H7N9 and pH1N1 viruses. A 71-year-old man with polycythemia vera who was in the same ward as the index case-patient for 6 days acquired infection with H7N9 and pH1N1 viruses. The incubation period for the 2nd case-patient was estimated to be less than 4 days. Both case-patients died of multiple organ failure. Virus genetic sequences from the 2 case-patients were identical. Of 103 close contacts, none had acute respiratory symptoms; all were negative for H7N9 virus. Serum samples from both case-patients demonstrated strong proinflammatory cytokine secretion but incompetent protective immune responses. These findings strongly suggest limited nosocomial co-transmission of H7N9 and pH1N1 viruses from one immunocompromised patient to another.

[According to the authors, 41 clustered cases from 20 disease clusters of H7N9 virus have been reported in China since the virus was first recognized to infect man in 2013. The clustered cases accounted for only 5.9 per cent of the total cases (676 cases to 4 Jan 2016). This study identified one nosocomial cluster caused by co-infection with H7N9 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Transmission occurred between 2 immunocompromised patients, but the exact route of exposure is not known. Co-infection may pave the way to reassortment in infected humans, and consequently increase the risk of creating a new pandemic strain. Enhanced surveillance is important during influenza transmission season to detect clusters of infection and detect co-infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and other influenza virus subtypes.
