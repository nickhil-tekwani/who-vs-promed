Kansas state health officials and health officials from Sedgwick County continue to investigate cases of illness of shigellosis associated with Tanganyika Wildlife Park in Goddard, Kansas, just outside of Wichita. Initially, there were 3 cases that were identified as linked to the park. These cases have tested positive for the _Shigella_ bacterium. Additional testing is underway to determine if the bacteria from each person are related.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) became aware of the possible link between the cases on Friday [18 Jun 2021] and began investigation the same day.

On 20 Jun 2021, KDHE and Sedgwick County Health Department (SCHD) released a survey for people who had visited Tanganyika and experienced fever, diarrhea or vomiting. More than 200 people have responded to the survey. Further analysis of the survey results will determine which respondents may be connected to this investigation. The Tanganyika Splash Park is served by a water line from the City of Goddard. At this time, records indicate that the City is supplying compliant drinking water based on their routine monitoring.

This investigation remains ongoing.

A Kansas mom says her children are still sick more than a week after visiting Tanganyika's splash park. This is after the Kansas Department of Health [KDHE] linked 3 cases of _Shigella_ to the park.

"Two Wednesdays ago [9 Jun 2021], we went to the storytime which my daughter, my daughter loves, and then, we went to splash pad after," said a local mother. What started out as a fun trip with the family turned awry in hours.

"We had fun, we went home, she took a nap, and then, she woke up, and both of them I mean, my son also has it. They have had the runs [diarrhea] very bad," said the mother.

Dr. Tom Moore, a local infectious disease physician, said the bacteria is spread through exposure to contaminated feces. "_Shigella_ is an infection that often requires treatment. Patients are usually very sick or feel sick, and they seek medical attention. It's not subtle," said Dr. Moore. "It can be self-limited over time, but that is you know, people very often will get over it on their own, but there's no reason to do that."

Dr. Moore suspects as KDHE continues to investigate more cases will be found. "I think the main thing is, you know, KDHE is going to have to do some investigation about the adequacy of chlorination of the water," said Dr. Moore.

The mother said her kids have been sick for 2 weeks now. "It was pretty bad. She didn't want us to change her diaper because the wipes would burn it, and she didn't want to take a bath because she didn't want the water touching it," she said and added that her kids are starting to feel better, and they will visit the wildlife park again.

The director of Tanganyika released a statement saying he is relieved the county and KDHE were able to confirm the bacteria. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with fever, diarrhea or vomiting.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

ProMED awaits further additional information regarding this small outbreak and any information regarding the specific modality of transmission of the organism here. With a splash park feature, transmission via water is certainly likely. Despite the presence of wildlife, the organism is not zoonotic. Classically, however, the Illness typically begins 1-2 days after exposure, with symptoms lasting 5-7 days. Based on the description in the 2nd posting, the illness began on the day of travel to the park and lasted for more than 2 weeks, which potentially brings into question where the infection was acquired and whether multiple enteric pathogens were involved. The circumstances related to the 3rd case, as well as if other cases in visitors to the park have occurred, are not stated.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
