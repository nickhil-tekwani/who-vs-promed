Thank you for posting an interesting case.

I noticed that a wrong statement has been made regarding NTV [nerve
tissue vaccines]: "Nerve tissue vaccines have been associated with
more severe adverse reactions and are generally more immunogenic than
the CCEEVs and are no longer recommended for use by WHO."

NTVs are more reactogenic but less immunogenic than modern rabies
vaccine. Therefore, we have to use 5 mL per dose. Regarding AEFI,
there are interesting findings in India, particularly for measles
vaccine. Sometimes [an event such as this] is due to negligence from
health workers, such as use of different diluents or not considering
allergy to milk or chicken protein.

It was not mentioned whether the vaccine was PCECV or PVRV or PDEV. I
have never encountered any serious adverse effect of modern rabies
vaccine except for a local reaction. Let us wait for the investigation
report.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Gongal for pointing out the error
in the original post.

In fact, the WHO position paper on rabies vaccines clearly states:
"Nerve tissue vaccines induce more severe adverse reactions and are
less immunogenic than CCEEVs; therefore their production and use is
not recommended by WHO." This moderator inadvertently erred while
editing the information and apologizes for any problems created by
this error.

Dr. Gongal raises some additional points and questions that we are
awaiting answers to as well. - Mod.MPP]
