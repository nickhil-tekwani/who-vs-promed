Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC
[further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan through 4 Oct
2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health
departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and
other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 2016 cases, 790 (39 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1093 (54 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 133 (7
percent) were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state
case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections), less than one
percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F,
Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New
York, 1999: Results of a household-based seroepidemiological survey.

West Nile Virus Infections in Organ Transplant Recipients,
New York & Pennsylvania, August-September, 2005
-----------------------------------------------
In September 2005, West Nile virus (WNV) infection was confirmed in 3
of 4 recipients of organs transplanted from a common donor. 2
recipients subsequently had neuroinvasive disease, one recipient had
asymptomatic WNV infection, and a 4th recipient apparently was not
infected. This report summarizes the ongoing investigation.
Clinicians should be aware of the potential for transplant-associated
transmission of infectious disease.
Organ Donor
-----------
The organ donor, a New York City resident, was hospitalized on 23 Aug
2005 after a traumatic head injury and underwent emergency evacuation
of an epidural hematoma, during which he received one unit of packed
red blood cells (PRBCs). He was declared brain dead on 26 Aug 2005.
Liver and associated vessels, one lung, and both kidneys were
recovered. On 28 Aug 2005, the liver and kidneys were transplanted
into 3 recipients at 2 transplant centers in New York City, the lung
was transplanted into a recipient at a transplant center in
Pittsburgh, and the vessels were discarded.
After unexplained neurologic illness occurred in 2 organ recipients,
an investigation was initiated. Investigators determined that the
donor had lived near an area where mosquitoes positive for WNV were
collected on 16 Aug 2005. The donor's wife reported that he had spent
time outdoors and felt febrile before sustaining the fatal head
injury. Serum and plasma collected from the donor on 27 Aug 2005 were
retrieved. The samples tested positive for WNV immunoglobulin M
antibodies (IgM) and IgG by enzyme immunoassay but negative for WNV
RNA by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunohistochemical
analyses of liver, gallbladder, kidney, and epidural hematoma were
negative for WNV antigens. The PRBC unit received by the organ donor
was donated on 30 Jul 2005 and was negative for WNV RNA by minipool
nucleic acid-amplification test (mpNAT). A repeat donation on 22 Sep
2005 was WNV mpNAT and IgM negative.
Liver Recipient
---------------
The liver recipient had end-stage liver disease caused by hepatitis C
virus infection. She initially did well after the transplantation.
She required multiple transfusions of blood products, all of which
were WNV RNA negative by mpNAT. On post-transplant day 13, she had a
fever and altered mental status. On day 18, she experienced
respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation. A lumbar
puncture revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (8 cells/mm3) and
elevated protein (81 mg/dL). She became comatose and developed acute
flaccid paralysis consistent with WNV encephalitis.
Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens collected on day 23
were positive for WNV IgM, and CSF contained WNV RNA. That day, the
patient began treatment with 4 doses of intravenous Omr-IgG-amTM
(Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Tel Aviv, Israel, supplied by the National
Institutes of Health [NIH]), an immune globulin with high antibody
titers against WNV under an investigational new drug (IND)
compassionate-use protocol; however, the patient had no subsequent
clinical improvement and remains in a coma.
Lung Recipient
--------------
The lung recipient had end-stage lung disease caused by pulmonary
fibrosis. The initial post-transplant course was uneventful aside
from blood-product receipt. The patient went home on post-transplant
day 16 but was re-admitted the following day with fever and dyspnea
requiring endotracheal intubation, followed by altered mental status,
seizures, and acute flaccid paralysis consistent with WNV
encephalitis. On day 23, a lumbar puncture revealed elevated CSF
protein (149 mg/dL) but no white blood cells; a brain magnetic
resonance image taken the same day was normal. Serum collected on day
19 was negative for WNV IgM, but, by day 23, serum was IgM and IgG
positive. CSF from day 24 was negative for WNV IgM and WNV RNA, but
CSF from day 27 was positive for WNV IgM and IgG. The patient
completed experimental treatment with 4 doses of Omr-IgG-am, without
clinical improvement, and remains in a coma.
Kidney Recipient 1
------------------
The 1st kidney recipient had end-stage renal disease attributable to
IgA nephropathy. She had no immediate post-transplant complications,
received no blood products, and was discharged home on day 3. Serum
collected on day 22 was negative for WNV IgM but positive for IgG
(consistent with a previous flavivirus infection) and was positive
for WNV RNA. The patient was re-admitted to the hospital on day 27
for experimental Omr-IgG-am treatment and remains asymptomatic.
Kidney Recipient 2
------------------
The 2nd kidney recipient had end-stage renal disease caused by Alport
syndrome. He received blood products after the transplant and was
discharged home on post-transplant day 7. Serum collected from the
patient on day 16 was negative for WNV IgM, IgG, and RNA. As a
precaution, the patient was re-hospitalized on day 27 for
experimental Omr-IgG-am treatment. He remains well.

Editorial Note:
---------------
This report describes the 2nd case of WNV transmission associated with organ
transplant (1). Several important differences exist between this and the
previously reported occurrence. The 1st organ donor-associated WNV
transmission, reported in August 2002, occurred after the donor received a
transfusion of WNV-positive blood one day before organ recovery [see ProMED
refs. under 2002 below. - Mod.JW]. A serum sample collected immediately before
organ recovery subsequently tested positive for WNV by PCR and culture but
lacked WNV IgM antibodies. All 4 organ recipients were infected and became
ill. In contrast, the current organ donor was likely infected via a mosquito
bite rather than through blood transfusion, and a serum sample obtained one
day before the organs were recovered had WNV IgM and IgG antibodies but was
PCR negative. The lung and liver transplant recipients had severe WNV
encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis with respiratory failure; one kidney
recipient had a positive PCR test result in serum 22 days after
transplantation and remains asymptomatic, and the other kidney recipient had
no evidence of WNV infection.
Serologic and clinical studies indicate that organ-transplant
recipients have a risk approximately 40 times that of the general
population for neuroinvasive disease after WNV infection (2).
Infected organ-transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed
persons typically have prolonged WNV incubation periods [as judged
from a longer time than normal needed for the emergence of specific
immunoglobulins, - Mod.RY], during which asymptomatic viremia can be
detected (3). The infected kidney recipient had asymptomatic viremia
22 days after transplant. All of the recipients were treated through
a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved IND compassionate-use
protocol with Omr-IgG-am, an intravenous immunoglobulin product with
high-titered neutralizing antibody to WNV. No proven effective
treatment or prophylaxis for WNV infection exists; a randomized
placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of Omr-IgG-am is under way (5).
Investigation of 30 recognized cases of WNV transmitted by blood transfusion
documented to date indicated that the donors' viremias can be of low titer and
that all resulted from IgM antibody-negative donations (4). Conversely,
transfused viremic donations that were recognized only after retrospective
testing did not transmit WNV infection if IgM antibody was present (6). Since
2003, the U.S. blood supply has been screened for WNV using NAT, which has
reduced the risk for transfusion transmission (4). The organ-transplant-
associated WNV transmission described in this report suggests that
transmission through solid organ transplantation can occur from donors with
IgM and IgG antibodies and without detectable nucleic acid by PCR in their
serum. Experimental evidence in humans and animals suggests that WNV might
persist in organs after clearance of viremia (7). Further testing of the donor
serum using a highly sensitive NAT assay for blood-donor screening is pending.
Organ donors are screened to identify infectious risks on the basis
of national organ-procurement standards (8). Screening of all organ
donors with WNV NAT is not currently required or routinely performed
because of 1) NAT availability only through IND applications for
blood screening, 2) the length of turnaround time to obtain WNV NAT
testing, and 3) the unproven test performance on donated organs. One
analysis suggested that WNV NAT screening might result in a net loss
of years of life among certain types of potential transplant
recipients (9) by excluding healthy donors from an already limited
donor pool. National guidelines for organ-donor screening are
continuously reevaluated by the Health Resources and Services
Administration in consultation with FDA, CDC, and organ-procurement
organizations (10).
Clinicians should be aware that transplant-associated infectious
disease transmission can occur and should be vigilant for unexpected
outcomes in transplant recipients, particularly when they occur in
clusters. Cases of suspected WNV infection through organ transplant
should be reported promptly to local and state health departments and
CDC.
