The epidemiological situation of Ebola Virus Disease dated 24 Aug 2018:
- A total of 107 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 79 confirmed and 28 probable.
- Of the 79 confirmed cases, 14 are cured, 23 are hospitalized, and 42 have died.
- 6 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Mabalako and 1 in Oicha. All are known and followed contacts.
- 3 new people healed, including 2 in Mabalako and 1 in Beni.
- 3 deaths from confirmed cases in Mabalako.

News of the response

Water, hygiene and sanitation
- A health team disinfected and closed a clinic in Beni health zone after it reported 3 cases, including 2 confirmed and 1 probable. The Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH) Commission and Biosafety is the commission responsible for measures to stop the transmission of infectious diseases to other people and health workers. Thus, it deals in particular with the distribution of personal protective equipment to health workers, the installation of chlorinated water points and the disinfection of households and health facilities.

Vaccination
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 3481 people have been vaccinated, including 1712 in Mabalako, 761 in Beni, 887 in Mandima and 121 in Oicha.

[In the original source tables, there are 3 cases (2 confirmed and 1 probable) in Oicha. It is unclear which of these cases corresponds to the doctor in Oicha who was reported as a new case in the recent WHO press briefing by Dr. Peter Salama, and whether one of the confirmed cases is his wife, who reportedly contracted Ebola in Beni. The 121 vaccinees in Oicha is greater than the 97 given as the number of contacts of the said doctor, which is another indicator of multiple cases in Oicha. The simple fact that there are multiple cases in this "highly insecure" zone is more important than their individual identities, even aside from patient privacy concerns.

Also noteworthy is the statement in the 25 Aug 2018 report that all (that is, both) of the 2 new confirmed cases are "known and confirmed contacts." Since 100% is the declared DRC MOH target "percentage of new confirmed and probable cases previously registered as contacts," it would be extremely helpful if concordance with registered contacts could be indicated along with every updated figure of new confirmed cases. - Mod.LXL]

[Uganda Ministry of Health Press Release]
http://health.go.ug/press-release

The Ministry of Health would like to inform the general public that a 32-year-old female who died at Naguru Hospital, also Known as China-Uganda Friendship Hospital, succumbed to Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) contrary to what has been making rounds on social media.

[We previously reported [Ebola update (68) 20180815.5966397 and Ebola update (69) 20180816.5968689] on this case of a pregnant woman who died of antepartum hemorrhage in a Uganda hospital who was initially (and, it turned out, erroneously) reported to have Ebola. The complete text of the above press release can be viewed and downloaded as an image-only PDF at the URL given above.

This report underscores 2 points that we have previously raised in these updates; namely:
- Ebola virus disease does not usually present primarily with hemorrhagic manifestations, which are more prominent with classic viral hemorrhagic fevers.
- Viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as the fatal CCHF case reported here, should not simply be regarded as "false alarms" unworthy of further attention, because they too require prompt and careful infection and prevention control measures, such as the safe burial accorded this unfortunate patient, described in this press release. - Mod.LXL]

Published Article:
Experiences and challenges in the health protection of medical teams in the Chinese Ebola treatment center, Liberia: a qualitative study. Li Y, Wang H, Jin XR, Li X, Pender M, Song CP, Tang SL, Cao J, Wu H, Wang YG. Infect Dis Poverty. 2018. doi: 10.1186/s40249-018-0468-6 [Free download available at https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-018-0468-6].

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Health care workers are at the frontline in the fight against infectious disease, and as a result are at a high risk of infection. During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia, were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero-infection rate was achieved.

METHODS:
Data were collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis.

RESULTS:
This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics.

CONCLUSIONS:
The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.

[As highlighted during Dr. Peter Salama's recent WHO press briefing, health care workers (HCW's) have played a significant role in amplifying the current Ebola outbreak, by dint of becoming inadvertently infected before awareness of the local emergence of Ebola, and by their high number of subsequent contacts. As of this writing, there are now 3 purpose-built ETU's in North Kivu, co-staffed and co-managed by the DRC MOH and foreign NGO's (MSF, ALIMA, and IMC). Thus, measures to educate, protect, and monitor Ebola HCW's should be a key component of this and other Ebola outbreak responses.

The article by Li et al. is the most recent of many articles to address these issues in retrospective fashion based on the 2014-2015 West African Ebola epidemic experience. It also highlights the contributions made by foreign Ebola responders deployed by national governments, such as those of China and Cuba, in contrast to those of NGO's such as MSF and IMC, which are more likely to be reported by the Western press.

The systematic measures utilized by the Chinese medical teams to protect the health of the medical teams are well described and discussed in the article. Medical personnel from the Chinese PLA Hospital in Beijing ("503 Hospital") also staffed an ETU near Freetown, Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola epidemic. This ETU was fashioned by cordoning off a portion of the Chinese-built Jui Friendship Hospital (which was closed during this period), and was equipped with separate rooms and closed-circuit TV similar to the Chinese PLA ETU near Monrovia described by Li et al. To my knowledge, no Ebola infections occurred in HCW's in this Sierra Leonean facility as well, a commendable achievement.

However, neither this article nor any other study of which I am aware has examined the differences between the ETU's of Chinese medical teams and the ETU's co-managed between the national MOH and NGO's. Key unanswered questions about these real and potential differences include:
1. What is the nature of the construction and infrastructure of these different ETU's?
2. What is the Ebola caseload (and therefore HCW workload) of these different ETU's?
3. How are foreign Ebola responders recruited and managed as teams?

The following factual excerpts from contemporaneous news articles help to fill in details that are not described in the featured article above:

"About 160 Chinese health workers arrived on Saturday [8 Nov 2014] in Liberia, where they are due to staff a new USD 41 million Ebola clinic that, unlike most other foreign interventions, is being built and fully run by Chinese personnel ... a mix of doctors, nurses, technicians and engineers."
- 15 Nov 2014. Chinese team arrives in Liberia to staff Ebola clinic https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-liberia-china/chinese-team-arrives-in-liberia-to-staff-ebola-clinic-idUSKCN0IZ0RU20141115.

"...we took just a week to transport the construction materials, medical equipment and 500 construction workers to Liberia in 6 chartered flights. ... The opening of the ETU, which took a month to construct, is the 1st international humanitarian relief project that is built, operated, and managed by the Chinese PLA."
- 25 Nov 2014. China Dedicates 1st Class ETU. https://www.liberianobserver.com/news/china-dedicates-1st-class-etu/

"More than 350 paramedics of the People's Liberation Army staffed the 100-bed facility located at the Samuel K. Doe Sports Complex in Paynesville, outside the capital, Monrovia. A modern ETU fully equipped to respond to the infectious disease cost the government of China USD 7 million. Since it was established, the facility admitted 110 patients, with 10 confirmed Ebola cases, 6 survivors, and Liberia's last Ebola patient to survive came from the Chinese ETU."
- 14 May 2015. Chinese Ebola Treatment Unit decommissioned in Liberia http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-05/14/c_134236642.htm.

"During this Ebola outbreak, some of the largest Ebola isolation units ever constructed were built in Liberia. The country has 21 in total, many of which were built by the U.S. military as part of President Obama's multibillion-dollar response to the crisis... Not to be outdone, the Chinese built the most lavish of any of the ETUs. While the others are in tented structures, the Chinese hospital is an air-conditioned, modular building. It offered patients private rooms and has closed-circuit video monitors, so nurses could check on a patient without the danger of going to the bedside.
- 9 May 2015. What Should Liberia Do with Its Empty Ebola Treatment Units? https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/15/406982308/what-should-liberia-do-with-its-empty-ebola-treatment-units

With regard to the 1st question, it is quite clear that the Chinese purpose-built ETU's had amenities, such as private rooms and close-circuit video monitors, which would likely enhance patient comfort and worker safety. Such features are unlikely in what can be described as "pop-up" ETU's that have to be rapidly built, using low-cost locally available materials, wherever an Ebola outbreak happens to emerge. The time, experienced labor, and expense required for purpose-built concrete structures would be impracticable in remote locations such as the current North Kivu outbreak epicentre, and likely suitable only for sustained urban outbreaks, such as those in Monrovia and Freetown where the Chinese ETU's were constructed.

The differences in Ebola case load between ETU's is also worth examining in greater detail. The Chinese ETU near Monrovia suffered no Ebola infections among its HCW's, but it took in comparatively few (10 total) confirmed Ebola patients. By contrast, an ETU co-staffed by an American NGO in Mafurki, Port Loko district, Sierra Leone, did experience one foreign HCW who became infected with Ebola and had to be evacuated along with close contacts (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/world/africa/possible-ebola-exposure-sends-10-aid-workers-back-to-us.html). Over a 4-month period from November 2014 to February 2015, the Mafurki ETU triaged 958 patients, admitting 870 with suspected Ebola, of which 348 had confirmed Ebola infection, who suffered a mortality rate of about 50% (Partners in Health, unpublished data). In other words, the weekly average intake of new Ebola patients at this one Western NGO-partnered facility during the height of the West African epidemic was more than twice the number of Ebola patients admitted to the Chinese Monrovia ETU over its entire working period. In addition, from the above articles, it can be deduced that 4 out of the 10 Ebola patients cared for in the Chinese ETU died, for a mortality rate of 40%. Although this is a small sample size, the case-mortality rate does not appear to be significantly different between the Chinese institutional ETU's and the NGO pop-up ETU's. It is, therefore, difficult to ascertain which if any of the structural or functional differences between these ETU's contributed to improved patient outcomes.

Finally, the composition of teams of foreign HCW's for the Chinese ETU's was also radically different from those of Western NGO's. The latter generally have to be recruited ad hoc from various countries, extracted from existing employment obligations, and trained to work as a unit despite very different individual work backgrounds and experiences. The Chinese teams, on the other hand, were made up of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and lab technicians who all came from a single institution, a very large military referral hospital in China. These individuals already had the experience of working with each other and in response to domestic infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS. Therefore, these Ebola responders could be recruited and formed into a cohesive work unit far more quickly than those of Western NGO's. This centralized, government-directed approach could thus serve as an institutional model for "pre-assembled" rapid response teams for disease outbreaks, akin to a medical or paramedical national guard, by other countries.

A comprehensive retrospective review of HCW experiences in multiple different ETU's would be useful and instructive, and so would a comparative study of national (native) and foreign Ebola workers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices, especially given the vastly higher Ebola morbidity and mortality suffered by national HCW's compared to foreign Ebola responders. To my knowledge, neither has been published. In lieu of comprehensive comparative studies, then, ProMED readers may be interested in the following selection:
