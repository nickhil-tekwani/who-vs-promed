Local mumps outbreak in Hungary, 2007
--------------------------------------------
9 cases of mumps have been reported recently in a village in Heves
County in northern Hungary. The illnesses occurred between 5 Jan and
24 Feb 2007 and were epidemiologically related and laboratory-confirmed.
Outbreak description
--------------------
Blood samples taken from 2 patients diagnosed with salivary gland
inflammation tested positive for mumps-specific IgM at the national
reference laboratory on 28 Feb 2007. On the following day, an
epidemiological investigation was carried out in the village the
patients came from.
This established that the 1st case in this outbreak had returned home
on 22 Dec 2006 from the town of Berehove in Ukraine, near the border
with Hungary, where he had previously worked for 8 months. He
developed symptoms on 5 Jan 2007. During January and February 2006,
more inhabitants of the village presented with symptoms such as fever
or elevated temperature and unilateral or bilateral swelling of the
parotid gland. The patients were aged between 22 and 31 years and
were connected with one another through family, friends or work
relations. By 15 Mar 2007, 9 mumps cases had been identified
retrospectively through an epidemiological link and laboratory confirmation.
All 9 patients were treated either by a local family doctor or at an
emergency ward on duty in the nearest town. Two patients were
referred further to an infectious diseases specialist. The 1st
clinical diagnosis in 5 cases was mumps, in 2 cases salivary gland
inflammation, in one case conjunctivitis and acute pharyngitis, and
in one case infra-auricular lymphadenitis.
The serological analysis performed at the national reference
laboratory confirmed all 9 cases to be mumps infection. By the time
of the epidemiological investigation, however, all patients had
already recovered. According to the patient history, none of the
patients have been previously vaccinated against mumps.
Discussion
----------
The above example shows that the mumps virus circulation in a group
of closely interrelated susceptible individuals can trigger a local
outbreak. In 2003, comparable outbreaks affecting a similar number of
cases were reported in close communities of unvaccinated people
(student houses, schools).
The childhood vaccination coverage for mumps in Hungary is high, so
the risk of infection is predominantly by virus importation. The
present outbreak could have been avoided had the 1st cases been
correctly diagnosed. In Hungary, laboratory testing of all suspected
mumps cases has been mandatory since September 2006.
In the outbreak described here, only the cases with manifest parotid
swelling have been identified; no wider investigation of other
possible symptoms and complications has been carried out. In general,
mumps is a mild and self-limited viral infection; an estimated 1/3rd
of infections are asymptomatic. However, mumps infection can lead to
serious complications, such as meningitis, of which a small
percentage can progress to encephalitis. In addition, mumps causes
unilateral or bilateral orchitis in approximately 20-30 percent
post-pubertal males. It is therefore very important to prevent the
virus from circulating in groups of young adults.
Background information
----------------------
The trivalent measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) was introduced
in Hungary in March 1991. As a result, the MMR vaccination coverage
in children born after 1 Jan 1990 is more than 98 percent. Between
1993 and 1996, follow-up vaccination campaigns were carried out
targeting cohorts born between 1 Jun 1985 and 31 Dec 1989. The
revaccination started in 1999 at 11 years, and, therefore, cohorts
born after 1 Jun 1987 should have been vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR
vaccine. The present routine childhood immunization schedule uses the
MMR vaccine given as a 1st dose at 15 months of age, and as a 2nd
dose at 11 years of age.
Since 1973, mumps has been a mandatory notifiable disease in Hungary.
Between 1973 and 1990, there were 20 000 to 50 000 mumps cases
registered per year. After the introduction of the universal
vaccination program in 1991, the incidence began to decrease slowly;
2000 cases were registered in 1994, and 500 cases in 1995. Between
1996 and 2001, the number of cases reported per year ranged from 180
to 240, whereas between 2002 and 2005 the number of reported cases
was around 100 per year.
