[Oz made the suggestion that scrapie might be effectively controlled by only
using certified genetically resistance rams. The following reply came from
the Netherlands. May we presume that a similar service exists in Canada? -

Maybe I can give a short explanation of these tests as carried out by us in
the Netherlands as well as by the MAFF.
Blood samples are collected from i.e. breeding rams or from all sheep
residing in a single flock. Total DNA is extracted by various methods. Both
alleles of the PrP-ORF are PCR amplified and further analyzed by:
Sequencing (MAFF?!) DGGE (NL ref Bossers et al. JGV 1996 77:2669-2673)
ASA+RFLP (UK+?+NL Belt et al. ref JGV 1995 76:509-517)
New fast and cheap techniques are in development like Taqman (combining PCR
and ASA in a single tube measuring fluorescense).
The advantage of sequencing is that new polymorphisms can be discovered and
that all known polymorphisms can be determined. Disadvantage:
timeconsuming, expensive,..... The advantage of DGGE is that new
polymorphisms can also be discovered, all known polymorphic positions can
be determined by a semi-rapid and not so expensive test. One more important
fact is that using DGGE polymorphisms occuring within a single allele can
be determined (i.e. 136V171R can in DGGE be scoored as alle1 136V... +
allele 2 171R. Not as 136V171R as allele 1 and wt as allele 2). This may
become a problem as soon as more than a single polymorphisms is found
within a single sheep PrP allele (like the FFI/CJD 129M178N->FFI while
129V178N->CJD).
The advantage of ASA+RFLP is that it is quick and cheap, however no new
polymorphisms will be discovered as well as nothing extra will be known
about linking polymorphisms to a single allele.
The latest method still in development 'Taqman' has the great advantage
that it is quick, cheap and the total procedure from blood sample to final
result can be automated. Monster [sample flow can (and will) be very high.
Especially interesting for eradication programs.
Some price INDICATIONS:
Sequencing (MAFF UK) about 30 pounds per sample DGGE (NL) about 85 dutch
guilders per sample Future Taqman about 50 dutch guilders or less per sample
All the prices are dependant on no of samples, time of testing (breeding
season) etc. Monster [sample flow of DGGE is low at the moment. Monster
flow of the taqman test will be 60,000 samples minimum per year (only
breeding seasons!). For instance, 60,000 samples will be analyzed for PrP
genotype in a period of about 3 months using a fully automated Taqman test.
Contacting persons are again:

Hope this was the information you were looking for!
