CDC [US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention] is now leading the
environmental investigation into a tularemia cluster that may have
afflicted as many as 17 Utahns, traced to the west side of Utah Lake.
According to the Utah Department of Health, 8 cases have been confirmed and
another 8 are classified as probable.
From ongoing and future efforts, health experts hope to learn more about
the actual ecology of the illness, how it dissipates, and the course of
recovery. They also want to know what puts people at greater risk. Hundreds
of people were in the area at the time of the cluster, but only a small
number became ill or developed lesions, initially mistaken for a spider
bite or staphylococcal infection, said Ilene Risk, director of the
epidemiology bureau in the Salt Lake Valley Health Department. From Salt
Lake County alone, where more than half those in the cluster reside, 200
people were potentially exposed.
Local health officials are collecting data and interviewing people who were
infected, hoping to get a clue as to what puts people at greatest risk, she
said.
CDC is testing the field specimens collected as part of the investigation
and will work with Brigham Young University to monitor flying insects in
the area. During a field assessment, CDC and the Salt Lake Valley Health
Department set up 14 flying insect traps, 26 rabbit traps, and 150 small
rodent traps, then collected samples for lab analysis. The CDC will lead
mitigation efforts, should it decide they're needed.
Tularemia is a bacterial infection caused by _Francisella tularensis_,
found in animals, particularly rabbits. It's typically transmitted by flea,
deerfly, or horsefly bite, but can be spread by direct contact with an
infected animal (including eating meat that's not well cooked). It can be
spread by drinking contaminated water or inhaling contaminated air, as
well. It doesn't pass person to person.
People made ill in the cluster were at the lake between mid-June and the
1st week of July 2007. Cases are reportable to the state, but initial
investigation belongs to the area where the individual lives, not where
infection occurred, said Lance Madigan, spokesman for the Utah Department
of Health. So health officials from Davis, Iron, Salt Lake, Utah, and Weber
counties have been involved.
The 1st 3 cases reported were linked to a youth camp at the lake, which
gave public health investigators a probable location. Utah usually has a
few cases statewide each year, but a cluster such as this one is unusual.
It took public health workers less than a day to identify it as tularemia,
the result of what Risk calls epidemiologists who were "hustling" and very
good work by the public health lab. The epidemiologists collected lab
specimens, interviewed those who were sick, some hospitalized and some not,
and took samples from and pictures of the skin lesions.
By the 3rd interview, they'd found a pattern emerging from what had been
nonspecific early reports: "A group went to a conference, and several had
been ill. It was not defined, and they had not had close contact or
compared symptoms." But the initial reporting source, Risk said, was
"excellent, with good locating information" so they were quickly able to
put it together. At that point, all those who were sick were being treated
but not with the right antibiotics. Tularemia requires a very specific
protocol that includes IV and oral antibiotics and lasts about 2 weeks.
Recovery can take a long time, Risk said.

[More cases are being confirmed as tularemia in this Utah cluster. It is
not specifically stated that the cases were not due to pneumonic disease,
but given the postings inferring an arthropod vector, glandular or
ulceroglandular disease appears to be occurring and not air or waterborne
infection. - Mod.LL]
