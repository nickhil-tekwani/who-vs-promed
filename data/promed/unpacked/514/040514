A total of 21 people have died in an outbreak of yellow fever [YF]
since the disease was detected in November [2009] in Cote d'Ivoire's
northern province of Ordienne, local media reported Monday [28 Dec
2009]. A total of 37 suspected cases were also reported in the
province, media reports said.

Health authorities said the disease is transmitted by the mosquito
and vaccination is the most effective way to prevent it. The
government has already allocated USD one million for vaccines for
some 290 000 people. Medical teams have been sent to the affected
regions to help with the vaccination.

There are an estimated 200 000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each
year, causing 30 000 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization.

[This same report was also issued by UB!Alert
(<http://www.ubalert.com/a/13467>). Assuming that it is accurate,
there have been 2 additional YF deaths in the past 2 days in this
region. The Denguele region, the YF location cited in earlier
reports, is located within Ordienne province of Cote d'Ivoire, so
this report undoubtedly addresses the same YF outbreak. Application
of the vaccine to people in the affected area is urgent.
