Regarding ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis, fatal - Sri Lanka (04): (NW,
W, S) 20111119.3405, this situation might be described as a leading
coincidence similar to Henry David Thoreau's remark about discovering
a trout in the milk, and brings into view the Law of Unintended
Consequence as well.

On 26 Dec 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami hit Sri Lanka, and, like many
natural disasters, left behind excellent breeding conditions for rats.
The dog population was reduced by the tsunami, and other rat predators
were hit as well, but the major factor was simply that lots of food
for rats was exposed and accessible, while humans were preoccupied
with matters other than rat-proofing homes that were reduced to
rubble. They were still excellent homes for rats, but not for people.

During the next 2 months, the animal relief effort, funded initially
by Animal People and the Best Friends Animal Society, focused on
anti-rabies vaccination. The Tsunami Animal People Alliance alone
vaccinated 14 000 dogs in the 1st 8 weeks after the tsunami.

As public fear of a rabies outbreak subsided, this effort rolled over
into a dog sterilization campaign. The Tsunami Animal People Alliance
had sterilized 30 000 dogs through mid-2011, many of them in areas
that were previously inaccessible due to civil war. The Kandy animal
welfare organization KACPAW has sterilized many thousands of dogs
within this same time frame. Other organizations have taken up
high-volume dog sterilization as well. Dog sterilization, rather than
the sporadic and ineffective extermination campaigns previously waged,
has become the prevailing policy of both the national and local
governments.

In consequence, while Sri Lanka still has a lot of street dogs, it has
had ever fewer since 2005 than previously. Fewer dogs mean less
competition for refuse that ends up getting eaten by rats instead of
dogs. Fewer dogs also mean much less predation pressure on rats. More
rats mean more opportunity for infected rats to spread leptospirosis.

This is not a situation unique to Sri Lanka. We have actually seen the
same phenomenon in many other warm climates where dog population
reduction through sterilization has succeeded. When the cat is away,
the mice will play; when the dog is away, the rats will play, and
leptospirosis, unfortunately, often comes with the rats.

[ProMED-mail thanks Merritt Clifton for his comments concerning the
unintended consequences that the decline in the dog population could
hypothetically have had on the rat population in Sri Lanka and thereby
on the incidence of leptospirosis.
