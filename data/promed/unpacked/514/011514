[According to South Africa's reports to the OIE, since the start of
this outbreak near Mamre in the Western Cape Province, on 26 Feb 2011,
a total of 31 outbreaks have been officially reported. See all reports
and an interactive map at

The following information has been derived by the UK/DEFRA
publication "African Horse Sickness in horses in South Africa -
Preliminary Outbreak Assessment" dated 10 Mar 2011 (ref: VITT/1200
AHS, South Africa 2011):

"Under Commission Decisions 2004/211/EC and 1993/197/EEC, South
Africa is only approved for the import of registered horses, temporary
import of registered horses, horses for breeding and production and
semen from registered horses from a small region in Cape Town into the
EU and that approval is dependent on surveillance of horses in the
neighbouring region and continual disease freedom in this region. Most
horses in the area are vaccinated against AHS. Registered horses and
horses for breeding and production to be exported are required to be
pre-export tested and kept in an approved vector free quarantine
station prior to movement for a period of 40 days. Horses should also
be accompanied by a certificate stating the animal's vaccination
status and mandatory testing. EU rules require that all imported
equidae from 3rd countries are checked (i.e., a documentary, identity
and physical or DIP check) at the port of entry to the EU. Post import
testing of equidae may be carried out if deemed a risk by the
veterinary inspector at the border inspection post. BIPs in the UK
have been notified and will increase checks on horses from Cape Town.


"The South African authorities have put certain control measures in
place (Department of Agriculture, 2011):
1. Advising horse owners to keep vaccination up to date, to stable
horses around sunset and sunrise when vector activity is highest and
to use insect repellent;
2. Movement controls of all equidae into and out of the restricted
zone in Western Cape province.
3. Ring vaccination in immediate vicinity of the cases.
4. A ban on horse export from the Cape Town area will be put in place
[European Commission (2011) African horse sickness (AHS) in the
surveillance zone around the AHS-free area of Metropolitan Cape Town.
Urgent Fax 10/3/2011 received 10/03/2011]".
