In a major policy shift, agriculture minister Taku Eto announced Friday [20 Sep 2019] that the ministry now plans to vaccinate pigs against [classical] swine fever [CSF].

The ministry judged that doing so is inevitable if Japan is to stop the unabated spread of the infectious disease after the 1st outbreak in the country in 26 years was confirmed in September last year [2018]. Eto also said the ministry will ask pharmaceutical companies to increase production of [CSF] vaccines.

Currently, Japan has a stock of vaccines against the disease for about one million pigs, but the government believes increased output is necessary and that more areas will need vaccinations. The vaccination program is expected to mainly cover pig farms near areas where outbreaks of the disease have been recorded.

The disease affects only [domestic] pigs and wild boars, and has a high fatality rate. It does not affect humans even if meat from an infected animal is consumed.

Basic responses to [CSF] outbreaks stipulated under the government's epidemic prevention guidelines for the disease are to cull pigs at affected farms, including uninfected pigs, and at present these guidelines do not allow preventive vaccinations to be administered. The ministry plans to review the guidelines.

But it is believed to be difficult to eradicate the [CSF] virus as long as there are wild boars around, which are said to carry the virus and pass it on to domesticated pigs. Therefore, a vaccination program may have to be carried out over a long period of time, and related costs could be high.

Some experts caution that vaccinations would make it difficult to distinguish between infected and uninfected pigs, possibly leading to a delay in responding to new outbreaks.

In addition, starting a vaccination program will mean Japan will lose its status as a [CSF]-free country under rules drawn up by the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE], and the number of countries restricting imports of pork from Japan will likely increase as a result. The country declared the virus eradicated in 2007.

For these reasons, the government had [earlier] taken a negative stance toward any vaccination programs.

But the situation changed on [13 Sep 2019], when an outbreak of [CSF] was confirmed at a pig farm in Saitama Prefecture, a major pork-producing area, following infections mainly in the Chubu region.

This was the 1st outbreak in the Kanto region since an infection was 1st confirmed at a pig farm in Gifu Prefecture in September last year [2018]. That was the 1st case of [CSF] to be recorded in Japan in 26 years.

Pigs infected with [CSF] have been confirmed in 6 prefectures -- Gifu, Aichi, Mie, Fukui, Saitama and Nagano. In those 6 prefectures, as well as in Osaka and Shiga prefectures, to which piglets infected with [CSF] were shipped, a total of over 135 000 pigs have been culled since September last year [2018].

[Since the start of the CSF epizootic in Japan, a total of 966 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, most of them in wild boar that further infected domestic pigs. A summary of the event since its start on 3 Sep 2018, links to the 36 reports, and a map presenting all outbreaks in domestic pigs and wild boar, updated 13 Sep 2019, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871 (zoom in on the map for the required resolution).

All outbreaks, including 40 involving domestic pig farms, were located in the Chubu region, in the middle of Honshu, Japan's main island. This region encompasses 9 prefectures: Aichi, Fukui, Gifu, Ishikawa, Nagano, Niigata, Shizuoka, Toyama, and Yamanashi. The recent 41st outbreak in domestic pigs, in Saitama, is the 1st one outside Chubu; it was detected only when infected pigs, originating in the farm, reached a slaughterhouse in Yamanashi, outside the known infected prefectures of Chubu. This outbreak is located in the Kanto region, an eastern geographical area of Honshu. For a map presenting Japan's regions and prefectures, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan.

Reportedly, wild boar have been earlier vaccinated in Chubu by oral vaccine baits (20190223.6333082, 20190330.6395122). Information on the observed efficacy of this operation will be useful.

The announced change in vaccination of domestic pigs policy is dramatic. Japan's domestic pig population, according to OIE's most recent available data (2016), is about 9 million in 5681 establishments.

Japan is a major importer of pork; during 2018, it imported the highest dollar value worth of pork globally, estimated USD 4.4 billion (15.5% of world's total pork imports; http://www.worldstopexports.com/international-markets-for-imported-pork-by-country/). - Mod.AS
