SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY: HUMAN CASES LINKED TO BSE? (4)
=========================================================
I have read the official statements from the UK and the SEAC. I am
amazed how much they remind me of statements made back in 1981 when
HIV first surfaced. I am certain everyone remembers that HIV began as
five cases of unusual disease. We had no diagnostic test then, and we
were totally unaware of a huge reservoir of infection about to become
manifest as AIDS cases. We appear to be on the edge of a possible new
emerging disease.
