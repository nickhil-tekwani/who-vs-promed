Page 133 on Cryptococcosis (Torula):
Pigeon droppings as a disease reservoir -
"_Cryptococcus neoformans_ can be isolated consistently from old pigeon
nests and pigeon droppings and from soil in many parts of the world. "
"While there have been no case clusters traced to them, the ubiquity of _C.
neoformans_ in weathered pigeon droppings suggests the removal of large
accumulations should be preceded by chemical decontamination, such as by an
iodophor, or thorough wetting to prevent the aerosolization of the agent."
Page 263, Histoplasmosis
"The reservoir for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ is soil with high organic
content and undisturbed bird droppings, in particular that in and around
old chicken houses, in caves harboring bats, and around starling,
blackbird, and pigeon roosts."
"Minimize exposure to dust in a contaminated environment, such as chicken
coops and their surrounding soil. Spray with water or oil to reduce dust;
use protective masks." (page 264)

[There have been many outbreaks of histoplasmosis that have been associated
with exposure to bird excreta. This is not true for cryptococcosis, in
which the association between exposure to bird excreta and human
cryptococcal disease has been the topic of conjecture for years. A recent
case report, Nosanchuk J., Shoham S., Fries B., Shapiro D., Levitz S., and
Casadevall A. Evidence for zoonotic transmission of _Cryptococcus
neoformans_ from a pet cockatoo to an immunocompromised patient. Annals of
Internal Medicine, 132:205-208 (2000), provides good evidence of
transmission from bird-to-human of _Cryptococcus neoformans_. In this
paper, isolates of _C. neoformans_ from the feces of the cockatoo and from
the patient's clinical isolate had identical biochemical profiles,
monoclonal antibody immunofluorescence patterns, and could not be
distinguished by RFLP analysis. This has not been demonstrated for pigeons
but is certainly a concern. - Man. Ed. DS
