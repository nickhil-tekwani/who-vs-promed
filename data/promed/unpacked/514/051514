According to the Portuguese Ministry of Health, as of 9 Dec [2012], there have been 2050 cases of dengue infection from the Autonomous Region of Madeira. This total is up from 1993 cases reported 4 days prior.

During the current outbreak than began on 3 Oct [2012], 12 people required hospitalization for their illness.

Although the vast majority of the cases were in the local population, the number of European tourists to the island contracting the mosquito-borne viral disease has continued to rise.

The ECDC reports, as of 12 Dec 2012, that 58 patients have been diagnosed with dengue after returning from Madeira. The United Kingdom has reported 20 cases, Germany 14 cases, France 3, Finland 4, Croatia, Denmark, Norway and Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland have all reported one case each.
