The West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) has confirmed the presence of _Theileria orientalis_ Ikeda genotype in 3 West Virginia counties. The WVDA is working with the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine's diagnostic laboratory at Virginia Tech to determine the extent of the disease across the region and understand its impact on the livestock industry. Additional surveillance samples are being collected throughout West Virginia.

_Theileria_ is a protozoan parasite transmitted to susceptible animals in the saliva of ticks or by direct blood transmission. Clinical signs can include anemia, fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, exercise intolerance, and fetus abortion. Multiple species of _Theileria_ are found worldwide, but the _T. orientalis_ genotype Ikeda are known to infect cattle, water buffalo, and yaks. Other _Theileria_ species are known to infect livestock such as sheep, goats, deer, and camels.

"If _Theileria_ infection is suspected, or livestock losses include signs of anemia, it should be reported to a local veterinarian immediately," said Commissioner of Agriculture Kent Leonhardt. "We strongly suggest folks implement good biosecurity procedures, including standard tick control measures and not sharing farm medical instruments such as OB sleeves. Tattooing and other shared devices should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before use on other animals."

The recently discovered Asian longhorned tick is a known carrier of _Theileria_. The WVDA is encouraging cattle producers to reduce tick exposure or tick populations on their farms, as there are no approved treatments for _T. orientalis_ in the United States. This disease represents no known threat to human health.

"A veterinarian specializing in large animals can provide assessments and herd health plans to livestock producers, as well as prescribe preventive measures to decrease livestock diseases and associated losses," said State Veterinarian Dr. James Maxwell. "Thus far, testing has identified only _T. orientalis_. Additional testing will help to determine whether other species and genotypes are present in West Virginia."

The WVDA, Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, and Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services are collaborating to monitor the disease in the region. As counties are identified positive for the disease, a corresponding map will be shared and subsequently updated. _T. orientalis_ Ikeda genotype has been found in 28 Virginia counties.

For further information or to report any suspected clinical cases, contact the WVDA Animal Health offices at 304-558-2214.

[The Asian longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) was 1st identified in New Jersey in 2017. In 2019, Virginia identified it in 24 counties. There are a number of ways this tick could easily travel to West Virginia, a neighboring state.

The Ikeda subtype referred to in the article is recognized for its virulence. Studies from New Zealand have found that about 5% of cattle infected with this subtype die; those surviving often grow more slowly, produce less milk, and are more likely to miscarry their calves.

_T. orientalis_, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a tickborne hemoprotozoan affecting erythrocytes and leukocytes and contributing to chronic anemia, ill-thrift, and persistent subclinical infections in livestock. In Australia and elsewhere, the longhorned tick serves as the primary vector for _T. orientalis_. Formerly, though, the strains of _T. orientalis_ found in North America had low levels of virulence in cattle; however, recall the Ikeda subtype is the more virulent form of this disease.

The CDC has previously noted that the Ikeda subtype has caused animals to remain positive by PCR for at least 5 months. This could present a challenge and an economic consideration to those with affected animals.

The Asian longhorned tick seems to be moving pretty quickly. Hopefully a repellant to the tick and cure for the diseases it carries will soon be found.

In Australia, _Theileria_ sp. has been affecting the cattle for some time. The farmers are suffering, the animals are suffering, and the number of exportable cattle will decline as _Theileria_ rages through the country unchecked. Consequently, not providing adequate treatment to the affected animals may already be affecting the number of exports available.

This bovine disease has long been seen in the Antipodes (Australia and New Zealand). A single injection of the drug buparvaquone, if administered early in a cow's infection, can greatly reduce mortality rates. There are any number of drugs in various countries having long withholding times. The drugs are necessary to save the animals and the livelihood of the people who raise the animals.

In the US, this withholding time after treatment has several solutions including to be used only by licensed and accredited veterinarians and other various record-keeping options. Even a blood test prior to market could be developed. (Researchers, hope you are listening and working on this situation.)
