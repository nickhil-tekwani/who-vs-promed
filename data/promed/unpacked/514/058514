A general alert has been sounded with the death toll of migratory
birds in the Okhla Bird Sanctuary on the banks of the Yamuna,
registering yet another casualty on Sunday, taking the total number
of dead birds up to 48. Birds of 8 species comprising 40 shovellers,
2 common teals, a lesser black-backed gull, a brown-headed gull, a
little egret, a medium cormorant, a little cormorant, and coot were
recovered from the area. Some of the recovered bodies were already
putrefied and some were fresh, indicating that death would have
occurred at least 2 days before.
While the death of the migratory birds in Okhla Bird Sancutary has
raised concern about the plight of these annual winged visitors to
India, death due to bird flu has been ruled out after a post-mortem.
Indications are that the deaths could well have been caused by high
levels of toxins in the Yamuna.
"The post-mortem findings revealed rigor mortis, blotches of
haemorrhagic spots on the heart and kidneys and congestion in the
lungs. Interestingly, in the gizzard of one of the dissected birds, 3
fish were found undigested. This indicates that the birds had fed
recently before dying. 3 dead shovellers were handed over to the
Forest Department to be sent to the Indian Veterinary Research
Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, and High Security Disease Investigation
Laboratory, Bhopal, for confirmatory tests [for] toxicity and bird
flu. One dead bird has been sent to Bhopal and 2 to Bareilly. The
rest of the birds and fish were incinerated on the site in the
presence of the Forest Department officials," said Programme Officer
Wildlife Trust of India's Prajna Paramita Panda, who had established
contact with the director, High Security Animal Disease Investigation
Laboratory, Bhopal, and its satellite centre Regional Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory, Jallandhar, to carry out extensive post
mortems of the birds collected from the area.

[The additional observations in the above update apparently indicate
that the possibility of avian influenza's role in this event is
extremely remote. Final laboratory results are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
