Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection - WHO Update 30
---------------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Thailand
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country's 10th
case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The case is a 47-year-old
woman from Lopburi Province who has fully recovered. She fell ill with
fever and cough on 3 Feb 2004 and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 20 Feb
2004. Hospital discharge followed 5 days later. She had exposure to
diseased and dead chickens at her home in January 2004.
To date, Thailand has reported 10 cases, of which 7 have been fatal.

Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection in 10 Patients in Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------
[The following is the Abstract of a paper published online in the New
England Journal of Medicine on 25 Feb 2004 by Tran Tinh Hien and 27 others
for the World Health Organization International Avian Influenza
Investigative Team. The paper will appear in the March 18 print issue of
the Journal. - Mod.CP]
Recent outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in poultry
throughout Asia have had major economic and health repercussions. Human
infections with this virus were identified in Viet Nam in January 2004.
We report the clinical features and preliminary epidemiologic findings
among 10 patients with confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection who presented to hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi,
Vietnam, in December 2003 and January 2004.
In all 10 cases, the diagnosis of influenza A (H5N1) virus infection was
confirmed by means of viral culture or reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction with primers specific for the H5 and N1 genome subunits.
None of the 10 patients (mean age, 13.7 years) had preexisting medical
conditions. 9 of them had a clear history of direct contact with poultry
(median time before onset of illness, 3 days). All patients presented with
fever (temperature, 38.5 to 40.0 C), respiratory symptoms, and clinically
significant lymphopenia (median lymphocyte count, 700 per cubic
millimeter). The median platelet count was 75 500 per cubic millimeter. 7
patients had diarrhea. In all patients, there were marked abnormalities on
chest radiography. There was no definitive evidence of human-to-human
transmission. 8 patients died, one patient has recovered, and one is
recovering.
Influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, characterized by fever, respiratory
symptoms, and lymphopenia, carries a high risk of death. Although in all 10
cases the infection appears to have been acquired directly from infected
poultry, the potential exists for genetic reassortment with human influenza
A viruses and the evolution of human-to-human transmission. Containment of
influenza A (H5N1) virus in poultry throughout Asia is therefore urgently
required.
