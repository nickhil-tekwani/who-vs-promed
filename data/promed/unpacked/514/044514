On 8 Jan 2008, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MOH) announced a
yellow fever [YF] disease alert for tourists and diplomats residing
in Brazil, due to a number of suspected and confirmed human yellow
fever cases during December 2007 and January 2008.

As of 11 Jun 2008, 45 confirmed cases of yellow fever have been
reported, including 25 deaths. Among the most recent cases, 2 human
yellow fever cases have been reported in the state of Sao Paulo near
the ecologic reserve of Jatai, specifically in the rural areas of
Luiz Antonio and Sao Carlos. This area is beyond the southeastern
edge of previously identified yellow fever risk areas in Sao Paulo.
Additionally, there have been 2 cases of human yellow fever reported
from rural areas in central west Parana State (in the rural area of
Laranjal). Although the map of yellow fever risk areas in Brazil
represents the best understanding of current risk, this is an
evolving situation, and cases may occur outside the boundaries of the
areas indicated in the map.

The Brazilian MOH alert states that travelers to "areas of risk" for
yellow fever should be vaccinated 10 days before going to such areas.
In addition to areas previously identified in CDC's guidance to
travelers, the Brazilian MOH has identified 2 additional states with
yellow fever risk: the northern part of Espirito Santo and the
western part of Santa Catarina.

Brazil currently does not require yellow fever vaccination for
persons entering Brazil (see Brazil country-specific requirements).
The new yellow fever vaccination recommendation by Brazil for
travelers is to protect the travelers' health in response to this
recent situation.

[Although there have been subsequent cases of sylvan YF in Para state
after the data above were assembled (see ProMED archive 20080708.2070
of 8 Jul 2008), this YF alert will be of value to those traveling to
the areas where cases have occurred and to travel health clinics
advising them. However, the absence of reported human or monkey YF
cases in tropical South America should not be construed as firm
evidence of the absence of YF virus transmission, especially in
remote, sparsely populated areas where detection and reporting are
difficult. The Brazilian MOH is to be commended for updating its maps
and warnings.
