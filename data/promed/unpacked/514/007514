The New York State Department of Health (DOH) is expanding their area of collection sites of ticks in Saratoga County after announcing that a 2nd confirmed case and a probable 3rd case of Powassan virus have been found in residents in Saratoga County on [Tue 18 Jul 2017].

[The 1st confirmed case died on 8 Jun [2017], and] the 2nd victim is currently hospitalized.

"It wasn't surprising but we want to investigate what's going on and see if it's a coincidence that these cases occurred in the same county or if there's something else larger going on," Melissa Prusinski, Research Scientist at the Wadsworth Center, said.

The DOH collected 200 ticks in Saratoga County this year [2017] at 5 sites and did not find any positive for Powassan virus. Health officials say it's rare compared to Lyme disease but without being able to sample a larger population it's hard to know the true statistic.

"Dragging only samples about one percent of the population at any given time so 99 percent of the ticks are elsewhere," Prusinski said.

There are a number of important things you can do to protect yourself from ticks. "What people may want to do is ramp up the amount of times that they check themselves," Bryon Backenson, Epidemiologist at NYS DOH, said.

Another thing that can help if you're going to be out in nature is to wear very light colored clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. You can also wear 30 percent DEET repellent, which lasts 4 to 8 hours and [be aware of] some symptoms for Powassan virus. "Kind of the earlier signs of that is a horrible headache. It's a headache that won't go away," Backenson said.

The department says the cases of Powassan occurred in 3 different towns in Saratoga County.

"To try and figure out if there a higher infection rate or has the infection rate moved from zero to something else that maybe we haven't picked up yet."

[This is another new case of Powassan virus infection in the Upper Hudson Valley in New York state. Although cases in New York are not common, they do occur sporadically. As noted in the previous post (archive 20170714.5173571), in 2013, there were several cases of encephalitis caused by Powassan virus (POWV) infection in New York's lower Hudson Valley, and especially in Putnam County (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). A follow up study provided a good description of the tick virus vector and POWV relationship in the 2007-2012 period, and the prevalence of POWV in ticks during that time span (see Tick-borne encephalitis virus - USA: (NY) Powassan virus 20140823.2716624). There is no reason to think that the prevalence and geographic distribution of ticks and virus is restricted in New York state to the lower Hudson River Valley. Saratoga county is located in the upper Hudson River Valley. - Mod.TY
