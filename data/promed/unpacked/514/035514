[_Bacillus anthracis_, the soilborne bacterium which causes the disease, commonly infects herbivorous animals. Anthrax outbreaks and single cases in wild elephants have been reported many times. Most anthrax cases are observed during the wet season, although elephant anthrax mortalities occur primarily during the dry season (May to September).
