Indonesian authorities were unlikely to ban European food imports amid a
scare over contaminated Belgian products, but were still mulling the
situation, the health ministry said in reports Friday.
"We are still discussing the issue with the animal husbandry section of the
ministry of agriculture, which is actually in charge of the matter. We will
soon issue a decision," health ministry spokeswoman Mariani told the
Jakarta Post.
However, Indonesia did not import a significant amount of farm and dairy
products from Europe, she added. "It would be unlikely for Indonesia to
take an extreme action, such as banning or destroying European foods here.
However, we advise all concerned parties to exercise caution until a final
decision is made."
China on Thursday added its name to the list of Asian countries restricting
Belgian - and sometimes European - food imports, including Thailand,
Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Hong Kong has also
issued a ban.
But the European Union's senior diplomat in southeast Asia Michael
Caillouet has called on Asian governments to lift import bans, saying there
was no evidence European products were tainted with potentially
cancer-causing dioxins.
Caillouet told reporters in Bangkok that the contamination of Belgian
products had been isolated to one animal feed producer in Belgium and
brought under control.

BELARUS: (Itar-Tass, 10 June, 1999) St. Petersburg - Imports of meat
products, including poultry meat, have been curtailed by Belarus since
March. In January-February Belarus imported 836 tons of poultry meat from
Belgium. The imported poultry was immediately processed and sold, Itar-Tass
was told by Chief Veterinary Inspector of Belarus, Alexander Aksyonov.
Since June 2, exports of poultry meat have been strictly banned until the
results of tests of meat suspected of being contaminated with dioxin are
announced in Western Europe, the chief veterinarian said.
He pointed out that since 1972 no incidents of foot-and- mouth disease or
pig plague had been registered in Belarus. The Vitebsk, Grodno and Brest
regions have eradicated tuberculosis among cattle. By the year 2000
Byelarussian veterinary services are planning to prevent incidents of
leucaemia among animals, Aksyonov said.
CHINA: (Xinhua, 10 June, 1999) Bejing- Chinese health authorities have put
a halt to imports and sales of meat and dairy products from 4 European
countries because of contamination by dioxin.
An emergency circular from the Ministry of Health (MOH) asks local health
departments to thoroughly check livestock and poultry and dairy products
that have come from Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands since
January 15. Products that are suspected of containing dioxin are to be
sealed, the Ministry said, acting in accordance with the nation's food
hygiene law.
PHILIPPINES (10 June, 1999, Xinhua) Manila- Philippine Agriculture
Secretary Edgardo Angara directed the National Meat Inspection Commission
(NMIC) to inspect all meat processing plants nationwide to make sure that
no imported meat, dairy products and feeds from Belgium, Germany, France
and the Netherlands are being processed.
Earlier, he ordered the banning of importation of feeds, meat and meat
products, including eggs and processed foods, from the four countries
following reports of dioxin contamination on these commodities.
Meanwhile, NMIC Executive Director Edgardo Dimalanta reported it has
recently put on hold the release of two 40-foot container vans containing
some 24,000 kilograms of frozen pork fat, which came from France, and some
20,000 kilograms of animal feeds from the Netherlands.
"All inventories and on-going shipment of the above-stated products
produced from January 1999 to present shall be subjected to certification
that these are dioxin-free by authorized veterinary officers of the source
country before its release," Dimalanta said.
"When the country of origin issues a certification saying that their
products, based on analysis are dioxin-free, only then will we release
their products," he stressed.
ANGOLA: (Xinhua, 10 June, 1999) Luanda - The Angolan ministries of
agriculture and trade decided Thursday to immediately ban nationwide
imports from Belgium of animal products including chicken meat, eggs, port
and beef.
And it warned the consumers against products made in or imported from
Belgium.
Since then, many countries including the two Congos, Sierra Leone, Guinea,
Cote d'Ivoire and some other African states have decided to ban imports of
meat and dairy products from Belgium because of a scare over dioxin
contamination.
WEST AFRICA: (Reuters, 10 June, 1999) Brazzaville - Congo Republic and
Sierra Leone announced measures on Thursday to keep out selected European
food imports following the scandal over the toxic chemical dioxin in
Belgian food.
The directorate of commerce in Congo said in a statement it had suspended
the issue of import licences for poultry, eggs and pork from Europe,
particularly from Belgium.
Congo imports frozen foods, mainly chicken, eggs, meat and milk products,
from Europe to the value of about 100 billion CFA francs ($160 million)
annually, according to official figures.
In the war-ravaged Sierra Leone, the government suspended the import of
chicken and mayonnaise from Belgium, the Netherlands and France.
The objective was "to prevent meat, chicken, butter and mayonnaise
contaminated with dioxin from infiltrating the Sierra Leone consumer
market," it added.
Industry officials said 70 percent of such imports came into Sierra Leone
from the Netherlands, and the remainder mainly from Belgium, France and
other continental European states.
Guinea and Ivory Coast announced similar measures on Wednesday.
But witnesses said efforts to dispose of stocks of imported chicken in
Guinea were hampered when poor street kids lifted dumped meat from the
designated tip in the capital Conakry for sale elsewhere at knock-down
prices.
In Ivory Coast, officials said imports of all meat from Belgium had been
banned until further notice and stocks that had arrived this year had been
set aside for testing.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo banned imports of chicken meat and
eggs from Belgium and said all suspect items would be withdrawn from the
market for analysis.
SOUTH AFRICA: (Reuters, 10 June, 1999) Johannesburg - South Africa became
the latest country to ban imports of meat and dairy products from Belgium
because of a scare over dioxin contamination. The agriculture department
said the ban was imposed last Friday on poultry, pork, beef and dairy
products.
Some non-EU countries, including the United States, Canada, China and
Singapore, have also taken steps to impose restrictions on imports of food
products from the EU.
SAUDI ARABIA: (Reuters, 10 June, 1999) Riyadh - Saudi Arabia has widened
its ban on food imports from Belgium to include beef and any food products
using chicken, eggs and beef, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
The ministry said the ban, which last week covered Belgian chicken and egg
imports, now extended to beef and any Belgian food products containing
eggs, chicken or beef, including frozen food as well as milk, butter,
yoghurt and chocolate. [Chocolate: probably because of the milk component.
- Mod.TG
It also banned dealings with 10 Belgian, one French and one Dutch food
companies. It did not name them.
Other oil-rich Gulf Arab states have also imposed bans on Belgian chicken,
eggs and beef.
Experts say local poultry farms supply 60 percent of Saudi chicken meat
demand, and imports supply the rest, mainly from Brazil and Europe. They
estimate the kingdom imported 300,000 tons of chicken meat last year.
