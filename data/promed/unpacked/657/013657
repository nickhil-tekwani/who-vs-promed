Anthrax attacks horses in the North
--------------------------------------------
According to official information from the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry (Magfor), over the past few days, a virulent anthrax
attack caused the deaths of 42 horses from rural communities in the
municipalities of Pueblo Nuevo and Condega.
Sergio Torrez Rivera, veterinarian and regional coordinator of animal
health for Magfor, reported that the outbreak of the fatal disease
was controlled through the massive vaccination of animals in the
affected villages.
In Condega, the disease affected the communities of Honduras Azul,
San Jose de Pire, El Algodonal, Potrerillos, Nispero, and Las
Labranzas 1 and 2, while in Pueblo Nuevo, it affected the villages of
La Palagua, El Rosario, and La Pava. Torrez indicated that this was a
sporadic outbreak that had been controlled and explained that farmers
had neglected to vaccinate their animals, particularly horses,
resulting in the propagation of the disease.
Torrez Rivera commented that there is an outbreak of equine
encephalitis in Honduras, and that the Animal Health Department of
Magfor has adopted the appropriate measures to avoid its introduction
into Nicaragua. [Equine encephalitis] has been traced along the
border with Honduras, and although no cases have been detected [in
Nicaragua], anthrax was discovered in the municipalities of Condega
and Pueblo Nuevo. In 2002, anthrax killed 15 horses in the area of
Las Brisas, in Santa Maria, a municipality on the border with
Honduras.

[It is clear from this report that we have a repeat of the Salvadoran
bias of only seeing this disease in horses, though it is patently
present in farm livestock as well ... one cannot have a "massive"
vaccination programme when only horses are vaccinated. The disease is
erratically reported in Nicaragua: 10 outbreaks (16 cases) in 2001, 3
(13) in 2000, and 3 (47) in 1996. A 'sporadic' outbreak affecting 10
villages is more characteristic of the disease being spread by horse
flies (Tabanids). Also, it was found only when the stock in border
villages were checked for encephalitis, which is reminiscent of the
situation in southern California, where END has apparently been
widespread but was not found until every backyard was checked. You
cannot report a disease unless there is someone to report it to, e.g.
the local veterinarian. And if the veterinary presence is transitory,
nothing happens except serendipitously. - Mod.MHJ]
