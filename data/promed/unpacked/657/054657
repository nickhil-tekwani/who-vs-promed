More than 350 cases of Japanese encephalitis and nearly 90 deaths due
to the viral disease were reported in Assam this year [2011], the
Rajya Sabha was told Tuesday [23 Aug 2011]. There were 351 cases and
89 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] reported in
Assam till 9 Aug [2011] in the current year, Minister of State for
Health and Family and Welfare Sudip Bandyopadhyay said.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes,
causing inflammation of the membrane around the brain, often fatal if
not treated soon.

"For the prevention and control of the vector-borne disease [virus],
including Japanese encephalitis, the Indian government is implementing
an integrated National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)
under the National Rural Health Mission," the minister added.

[Unlike other reports on encephalitis cases coming out of India over
the past 3 months, this report makes no reference to cases of "acute
encephalitis syndrome" of undetermined etiology. Rather, all cases are
attributed to Japanese encephalitis virus. ProMED would be interested
in learning more about the National Vector Borne Disease Control
Programme. Vaccinating susceptible people in areas of risk may be more
feasible technically and more cost-effective than attempting to
control populations of _Culex_ mosquito vectors over large areas.
