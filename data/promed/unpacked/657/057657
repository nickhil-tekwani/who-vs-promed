Officials on Thursday [1 Aug 2013] confirmed North Carolina's 5th case of eastern equine encephalitis, a rare but serious disease that is spread to horses by mosquitoes.

A 5-year-old female quarter horse in Cumberland County was euthanized on 24 Jul 2013, 2 days after showing clinical signs of the disease, according to the North Carolina Veterinary Medical Association. The horse was not vaccinated against the virus.

The case is the 3rd for Cumberland County. A 4-year-old donkey died on 23 Jul 2013, and a 16-month-old horse was euthanized on 16 Jul 2013. The 2 other cases were in Brunswick and Pender counties.

Eastern equine encephalitis can be transmitted to humans and animals from the bite of a mosquito, although people cannot transmit it to each other. One of the most severe viruses spread by mosquitoes, it causes brain inflammation, disorientation, seizures and coma.

The North Carolina Veterinary Medical Association is encouraging all horse owners to make sure their animals are vaccinated for both eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile [virus].

Eastern Equine Encephalitis Reported in Citrus Park Area
--------------------------------------------------------
A horse has tested positive for the disease. This comes on the heels of a human case reported back in March [2013].

Officials from the Hillsborough County Health Department are asking Carrollwood area residents to be on high alert for mosquitoes that like to come out at dusk and dawn.

A horse from the Citrus Park area has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis. The mosquito-borne disease is considered "one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most [human] survivors," according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control website.

Only a few human cases are reported each year throughout the United States, the CDC says. Hillsborough has already had one human case this year [2013].

Symptoms of infection in humans include sudden onset headaches, high fevers, vomiting and chills.

The Citrus Park horse is believed to have been infected in mid-July 2013, according to an email from the Hillsborough County Health Department. The animal has since been euthanized.

While this most recent case involves a horse -- not a human -- Steve Huard, spokesman for the agency, said it serves as a warning for residents to avoid contact with mosquitoes.

"In March of this year [2013], we had a human case, and now we've seen it in a horse," Huard said. "The simple fact we're seeing it locally still really means folks in the community need to take extra precautions and try not to get bitten at all."

Eastern equine encephalitis or not, Huard said mosquitoes can be pretty nasty and well worth avoiding in Florida. "If you live in the subtropics, which we do, you've got to be aware of this every day," he said. "Now that we saw the horse, we want to make extra certain people pay attention."

All of Hillsborough County has been under a mosquito-borne advisory since 25 Mar 2013, the health department's email said. Other threats from mosquitoes include West Nile virus.

The health department offers these tips for avoiding bites:

DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.

DISCARD old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used.

EMPTY and CLEAN birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week.

PROTECT boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.

MAINTAIN the water balance (pool chemistry) of swimming pools. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

COVER your skin with clothing, and use mosquito repellent.

CLOTHING: If you must be outside when mosquitoes are active, cover up. Wear shoes, socks, long pants, and long sleeves.

REPELLENT: Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective. Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months. Keep mosquitoes out of your house. Repair broken screens on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

[Mosquitoes can transmit EEE to horses and to people, but horses cannot transmit EEE to people [through mosquito bite].

Preventative methods for horses include vaccination. A vaccination in combination with West Nile virus vaccine is very effective at protecting horses. Mosquito repellent designed for horses should be applied.

People need to take precautions and use repellents and long sleeves and remove water sources that may provide breeding pools for mosquitoes. The tips listed in the 2nd article for protecting yourself are very important.
