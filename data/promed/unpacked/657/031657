Lassa fever has reportedly killed one man in Igbeagu community in the Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. He died on Friday [27 Dec 2019].

O and his sibling, UO, had been admitted to St Vincent Hospital in the area. The 2 of them were suspected to have been infected by the disease.

A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "We are in a big trouble again. This killer disease has come again. The last time we experienced it, it wasn't funny. It killed over 4 persons. Now it is here again. It is important that stakeholders know about its presence and the implication. They should intervene and save us from it."

Meanwhile, the Ebonyi State Government has directed the evacuation of the victim's sibling and other patients to the South-East Virology Centre, Abakaliki, for further treatment.

Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Media, Mr Francis Nwaze, had equally directed the closure of the hospital with immediate effect.

The governor's aide said, "The governor directed that all the family members and close relatives of the above be quarantined at the South East Virology Centre, Abakaliki for comprehensive medical examination. Also, Governor Umahi has directed that the Ministry of Health under the watch of the Commissioner for Health in conjunction with the members of Staff of Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki to immediately address all issues relating to the Lassa fever outbreak including comprehensive examination of all suspects and cleanup of St. Vincent Hospital. Place precautionary announcements in all media houses in the state on preventive measures of Lassa fever."

[Lassa fever [LF] cases have not been unusual in Ebonyi state this year (2019) beginning with a Lassa fever outbreak in Ebonyi state in February 2019, when the Ebonyi state government successfully treated and discharged 14 Lassa fever patients brought to the centre. To date this year (2019), 7% of all Lassa fever cases have been in the state.

There is no mention of the circumstances under which the individuals contracted Lassa fever virus infections. Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

There is no specific mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
