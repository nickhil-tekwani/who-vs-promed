Virus hunters, swathed in protective gear, were on Tuesday [7 Aug 2007]
preparing to enter a lead and gold mine in a remote part of western Uganda
in search of what they think may have been the source of the latest
outbreak of deadly Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
The hunt is one of the medium and long term measures being taken by the
Ministry of Health to deal with the Marburg [outbreak] that was declared
'contained' by Health Minister Stephen Mallinga yesterday [Thu 9 Aug 2007].
The announcement was made on the 25th day since the last contact with the
last case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever was buried on 14 Jul 2007.
"Theoretically, the transmission chain has been broken. It has been stopped
and the outbreak contained," Dr Mallinga said. As a precautionary measure,
however, the Ministry has decided to maintain active surveillance, case
management, infection control, and social mobilisation activities for
another 21 days.
The source of the Marburg virus is still a mystery to scientists. Speaking
to journalists yesterday [Thu 9 Aug 2007], Dr Pierre Formenty, a
hemorrhagic fever expert at the World Health Organization (WHO), said
Colobus monkeys that are suspected to be reservoirs could actually be
victims. "We cannot tell what the reservoir is. We are studying bats,
contact tracing is very important," he said. The scientists are therefore
hoping that the recent outbreak in western Uganda can provide them with a
breakthrough, which should explain their visit to the area.
Dr Formenty and about 2 dozen others from WHO, the United States' Centre
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF),
the Ugandan Ministry of Health and other partners, will don special gowns,
boots, masks, goggles, and leather gloves before entering the mine,
swarming with different species of bats, which some believe could play a
role in transmitting the Marburg virus to humans.
The medical investigators will attempt to catch 1000 live bats, to be
transported to a mobile laboratory nearby. There, they will take fresh
blood samples to look for antibodies and live virus, before killing the
animals and removing their livers and spleens.
Marburg [virus infection] causes headaches, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
In severe cases, the central nervous system is attacked, and patients may
bleed from the eyes and ears.

[It seems likely that the July 2007 Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak in
western Uganda has been contained. A deceased mine worker is the only
confirmed case of the disease and infection has not spread to any of his
caretakers or to other workers at the mine. His companion, who cared for
him and became ill and has since recovered, has not been confirmed as a
Marburg hemorrhagic fever case. Likewise it has not been confirmed that the
Colobus monkey, skinned by the deceased worker and his companion, was
Marburg virus infected.
The outcome of the expedition to investigate the role of cave-dwelling bats
in transmission of Marburg virus is awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
