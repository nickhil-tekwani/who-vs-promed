----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am in UK but have been watching and learning about AHS [African horse sickness] via social media for almost a year. I am a BHS [British Horse Society] Volunteer Horse Welfare Officer.

Horse owners in SA [South Africa] are desperate to get info out to the world. The info/statistics in the Movement Statement comes from AHS Trust (http://www.africanhorsesickness.co.za/).

The Trust records ''approved'' cases only, that is, those tested by an OIE Accredited laboratory, so currently only the OVI (Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute).

The OVI lab is very slow, so at least 60 percent of tests are done by the more efficient faster ERC laboratory (Equine Research Centre) but those results are not included in AHS Trust numbers.

South Africa reports to OIE immediately, but ONLY cases in the Western Cape which affect the Export Zone.

Other cases are reported -- eventually, using the statistics from AHS Trust but SA is behind with annual reporting of all diseases (as is the UK!!)

AHS Trust does not make serotypes available except for cases in the Western Cape.

I note the historical months of January to June no longer apply, AHS is occurring 9 months of the year. Historically the disease overwintered in Kruger National Park and spread south west. This season the 1st outbreaks were in the Eastern Cape with many deaths due to serotype 6 and this is ongoing.

The people keeping the unofficial social media statistics will be in touch as soon as possible.

[We appreciate Ms Parr sharing with us the data on African horse sickness.

The African horse sickness site she provides (http://www.africanhorsesickness.co.za/) has some very useful information and I suggest our readers peruse the site.

The following comment is extracted from that website:
African horse sickness (AHS) is a highly infectious non-contagious, vector born viral disease affecting all species of Equidae. It is classified as an Orbivirus of the Reoviridae family of which there are 9 serotypes. All serotypes (1-9) are distributed throughout South Africa, although there is a variation in their temporal distribution. It is endemic to (occurs naturally on) the African continent, and is characterized by respiratory and circulatory damage, accompanied by fever and loss of appetite.

Animals affected are, all breeds of horses (mortality rate of 70-90 percent), mules, and donkeys. Wild life equine species (zebras) are resistant to the disease. The vector host, _Culicoides_ midge, spreads AHS virus.

AHS does not spread directly from one horse to another, but is transmitted by the _Culicoides_ midge, which becomes infected when feeding on other infected equidae. It occurs mostly in the warm, rainy season when midges are plentiful, and disappears after frost, when the midges die. Most animals become infected in the period associated with sunset and sunrise, when the midges are most active.

The disease manifests in 3 ways, namely the lung form, the heart form, and the mixed form. The lung (dunkop) form is characterized in the following manner:
- very high fever (up to 41 deg C) [105.8 deg F].
- difficulty in breathing, with mouth open and head hanging down.
- frothy discharge may pour from the nose.
- sudden onset of death.
- very high death rate (90 percent).

The heart (dikkop) form is characterised in the following manner:
- fever, followed by swelling of the head and eyes.
- in severe cases, the entire head swells ("dikkop").
- loss of ability to swallow and possible colic symptoms may occur.
- terminal signs include bleeding (of pinpoint size) in the membranes of the mouth and eyes.
- Slower onset of death, occurring 4 to 8 days after the fever has started.
- Lower death rate (50 percent).

The mixed form is characterized by signs of both the dunkop and dikkop forms of the disease.

The clinical signs described above may assist with an initial diagnosis of AHS. This diagnosis can only be confirmed by identifying the virus in a laboratory. It is, therefore, essential that blood samples be taken from the horse during the fever stage of the disease for analysis. As AHS is a controlled disease, horse owners are obliged by law to notify the local State Veterinarian of suspected cases.

Control of African horse sickness
---------------------------------
African Horse Sickness (AHS) is one of a number of diseases known to be potentially damaging to the livestock economy. By way of the Animal Diseases Act (Act No. 35 of 1984), AHS has been declared a state controlled disease, thereby empowering the state to implement measures to control the disease. Horse owners are also required by this law to notify their local state veterinarian of any cases of AHS. The Act also requires that all equines (horses, donkeys and mules) must be vaccinated at least once a year with an approved AHS vaccine. - Mod.TG
