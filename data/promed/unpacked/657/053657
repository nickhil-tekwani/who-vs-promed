Canada: 16th outbreak of norovirus-like illness in Calgary this year
-----------------------------------------------
Health officials say norovirus infection is once again likely to be
the cause of an outbreak of illness at a Calgary hospital. The
Calgary Health Region reported on Sat 20 Nov 2004 that 6 patients and
7 staff at the Foothills Hospital are suffering from gastrointestinal
illness, likely [caused by a] norovirus. It is the 16th outbreak of a
norovirus-like illness in the city this year [2004].
"It has not been confirmed yet by the lab (as norovirus infection),
but, with the symptoms, and with the amount of norovirus we know is
out in the community, we are expecting that's what it is," said Dr.
Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer for the Calgary Health Region.
"The unit has been closed to new admissions, and enhanced
housecleaning is underway."
A Norovirus outbreak was confirmed at the Rockyview General Hospital
on 18 Nov 2004. MacDonald said she doesn't know exactly why the city
has seen so many outbreaks this year [2004], but she expects to see
more cases in the near future due to the easy transmission of the
virus from person to person. Lab tests proved that norovirus
infection made over 100 people sick at a homeless shelter in the city
2 weeks ago. Hundreds of people were locked in the shelter, as
officials tried to determine what was making people ill. At one
point, about 140 people were isolated on one floor of the building,
while paramedics doled out fluids and medicine to help with nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea.
Other Alberta cities are facing the same situation. "Edmonton, in the
Capital Health Region, had reported increases in the gastrointestinal
virus, norovirus, beginning in October [2004]," MacDonald said.
Norovirus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral cycle and can be
passed on through food, water, or person-to-person contact. Health
officials say hand washing is the best preventative measure against
the virus. "Good old-fashioned soap and water is most important,"
MacDonald said, cautioning against alcohol-based hand sanitizers, as
they are ineffective against the virus. Anyone visiting family or
friends at hospitals or care centers is urged to delay their visit if
they are experiencing any symptoms of the virus, which include
diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Those infected are contagious for at
least 3 days after recovery.

UK: Norovirus outbreaks in England and Wales; 2003 and 2004
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency's Communicable Disease Surveillance
Centre (CDSC) has collected standardized data on general outbreaks of
infectious intestinal disease (IID) since 1992 [1]. Norovirus is the
most common cause of IID in England [1,2]. The number of outbreaks of
IID due to norovirus varies, but is generally between 130 to 250
outbreaks each year. 2 distinct peaks of norovirus activity have
occurred in England and Wales since 1992: one in 1995-96 with 368
outbreaks, and, in 2002, there was an unusually high number of
outbreaks (686) that coincided with the emergence of a new variant
genogroup II 4 (3) (illustrated as a figure, not shown here).
79 percent of all outbreaks reported have occurred in healthcare
settings, either in hospitals or residential care homes. Hotels (7
percent) and schools (5 percent) are the next most frequent settings.
Table 1 shows the mode of transmission and setting of norovirus
outbreaks in England and Wales between 1992 and 2004.
Table 1; Mode of transmission for norovirus outbreaks England and
Wales: 1992 to 2004
Outbreak setting / Number of foodborne outbreaks (percentage) /
Number of person-to-person outbreaks (percentage) / Number of
other/unknown outbreaks (percentage) / Total
Food outlets / 89 (58.2) / 38 (24.8) / 26 (17.0) / 153
Hospitals / 12 (0.9) / 1222 (93.2) / 77 (5.9) / 1311
Residential homes / 32 (2.7) / 1066 (91.0) / 74 (6.3) / 1172
Schools / 4 (2.8) / 129 (89.0) / 12 (8.3) / 145
Hotels / 51 (23.8) / 140 (65.4) / 23 (10.7) / 214
Other / 39 (28.3) / 88 (63.8) / 11 (8.0) / 138
Total / 227 (7.3) / 2683 (85.6) / 223 (7.1) / 3133
Outbreaks in the healthcare sector show a marked seasonality, with
peak occurrence in the winter months (illustrated as figure, not
shown here), although other settings do not appear to show this
seasonal pattern. Outbreaks in healthcare settings are also
associated with higher rates of mortality and last longer than
outbreaks in other settings, but tend to involve fewer people and are
less likely to be foodborne [1]. A recent study in the South West of
England examining the impact of IID outbreaks in healthcare settings
showed norovirus to be the predominant cause and was identified in 63
percent of outbreaks. The cost to the health service in England was
estimated to be GBP 115 million [USD 214 million], after
extrapolating the cost of bed days lost plus staff absence. Outbreaks
were seen to be shorter when control measures were implemented
quickly, such as closing wards to new admissions within 4 days of the
beginning of the outbreak [4].
In 2003, there were 220 outbreaks of IID due to norovirus, and by
October 2004, 148 outbreaks had been reported to CDSC. The regions
with the highest number of outbreaks in 2003 are the North West and
Yorkshire and Humberside. To date, the North East and Yorkshire and
Humberside have the highest number of outbreaks reported in 2004
(Table 2).
Table 2; Norovirus outbreaks in England and Wales: 2003 to 2004
Region / Year 2003 / Year 2004*
North East / 36 / 37
Yorkshire and Humberside / 46 / 30
East Midlands / 2 / 2
East of England / 38 / 15
London / 10 / 12
South East / 10 / 10
South West / 7 / 13
West Midlands / 12 / 6
North West / 52 / 23
Wales / 7 / -
Total / 220 / 148
*Data provisional
78 percent of norovirus outbreaks identified in 2003 were in
healthcare settings, and 74 percent in 2004 (Table 2).
The most common mode of spread is person-to-person. Of all outbreaks
identified since 1992, 86 percent occurred via this route of
transmission, 4 percent through contaminated food, and 3 percent
through food followed by person-to-person. Table 3 shows the setting
for outbreaks in 2003 and 2004.
Table 3; Norovirus outbreaks in England and Wales by setting: 2003 to 2004
Setting / Year 2003 / Year 2004*
Hospital/residential care home / 171 / 110
Hotel / 11 / 6
School / 20 / 18
Restaurant / 4 / 3
Club/center / 6 / 3
Other / 8 / 8
Total / 220 / 148
*Data provisional
The majority of outbreaks are spread from person-to-person, with 88
percent in 2003 and 87 percent in 2004 spread in this manner (Table 4)
Table 4; Norovirus outbreaks in England and Wales by mode of spread:
2003 to 2004
Mode of spread / Year 2003 / Year 2004*
Person-to-person / 183 / 125
Foodborne / 5 / 2
Foodborne then person to person / 4 / 1
Water / - / 1
Other / - / 2
Unknown / 28 / 17
Total / 220 / 148
*Data provisional
From September to mid November 2004, there have been 33 reports of
outbreaks of IID due to norovirus, a similar number of outbreaks to
that seen in the same period in 2003. The number of outbreaks in 2004
will rise, as further reports are received, and all data for 2004 are
provisional at this time.
