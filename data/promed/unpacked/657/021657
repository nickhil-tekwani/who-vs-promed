Swiss authorities have identified a cow with the infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), a respiratory disease, in the eastern canton of Grisons [Graubunden], local officials said on [Wed 23 Dec 2020].

The disease, which is incurable in animals but harmless to humans, poses a threat to cattle. There have been no cases of IBR in Switzerland since 1993, the officials said [but see 20020918.5340 and comment. - Mod.AS].

"In order to determine the possible spread of the disease, it is being clarified which contacts the affected animal had with other animals. All farms with animals that had contact with the affected animal will be blocked as a precautionary measure," cantonal veterinary officials said in a statement.

[Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed world-wide, but has been eradicated from a number of European countries and others have active eradication programmes.

The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease) and by conjunctivitis.

Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Postmortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever'. The semen of an infected bull may contain BoHV-1, and the virus can thus be transmitted by natural mating and artificial insemination.

Vaccines usually prevent the development of clinical signs and markedly reduce the shedding of virus after infection, but do not completely prevent infection. Several eradication campaigns have been carried out or are currently running in different countries including test-and-removal programmes or vaccination campaigns.

IBR/IPV is an OIE-listed animal disease; it is not zoonotic. Parts of the above and additional information are available at
https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.11_IBR_IPV.pdf.

According to Switzerland's most recent (2019) annual report to the OIE, the last IBR/IPV occurrence in the country dates back to May 2015. There were 3 outbreaks, in 3 different cantons (Appenzell Ausser-Rhoden, Graubunden and Sankt Gallen), a single infected animal identified (and culled) in each. - Mod.AS
