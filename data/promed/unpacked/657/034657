A case of influenza H5N1 in a broiler breeder pullet flock in Ein
Shemer [Israel's report to the EU]
-------------------------------------------------
[This report includes detailed information, additional to yesterday's
[2 Feb 2010] post 20100202.0355. - Mod.AS]

Following is a description of the case and the measures we have taken
up to this point [2 Feb 2010]:

Avian influenza H5N1 was detected in a 115 days old broiler breeder
pullet flock in Ein Shemer, which is in Haifa province in Hadera
district [map available at the source URL].

Description of the farm
-----------------------
The flock was housed in a high biosecurity farm. The farm is enclosed
by a fence and the only access is via a sanitary facility (shower and
changing all clothes in and out). The distances from the sanitary
facility to the entrances of the poultry houses are between 50 and 100
meters. The farm consists of 3 adjacent environmentally- and
light-controlled poultry houses. Each poultry house is divided into 4
rooms. The disease was discovered only in the middle house and no
disease was diagnosed in the 2 adjacent poultry houses until the time
of culling.

The location of the outbreak is 8.3 km [5 mi] away from the last H5N1
outbreak in Binyamina in 2008. The outbreak in Binyamina occurred also
in January.

Quarantine and surveillance
---------------------------
A protection zone of 3 km [2 mi] and a surveillance zone of 10 km [6
mi] have been applied, according to the Israeli procedures based on
Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 Dec 2005 on Community measures for
the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC.

List of the villages with commercial or pet birds in the protection
and surveillance zones (see map): Protection zone: [9 locations
specified]. Surveillance zone: [21 locations specified] [The names of
all locations are available at the source URL above].

Diagnosis
---------
On 17 Jan 2010 due to a slight increase of mortality in the middle
poultry house, tracheal and cloacal swabs were submitted to the
northern poultry health laboratory and tested by PCR and viral
isolation and were negative (these sample have been re-tested and were
found negative). On 24 Jan 2010 there was a high increase in mortality
and further birds, tracheal and cloacal samples were submitted to the
northern laboratory and the Avian and Fish Division in the Kimron
Veterinary Institute. Samples from the chickens were positive to H5N1
virus by real time-PCR and viral isolation. IVPI [intravenous
pathogenicity index] is pending.

Culling and disinfection
------------------------
On 27 Jan 2010, the birds in the diseased house were culled by foam
[for details on this procedure, see
<http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/poultry_depopulation.asp>.
-Mod.AS]. The remaining 2 houses were culled by the morning of 28 Jan
2010. Cleaning and disinfection was finished on 2 Feb 2010. It was
decided not to cull any other farms as the diseased farm and poultry
house were high biosecurity facilities as are all the farms within 2
km [1.2 mi].

Immediate surveillance
----------------------
105 farms in 30 villages are located in the 10 km [6 mi] radius. 9
farms in the protection zone (0-3 km) [0-2 mi] and 24 farms in the
surveillance zone (3-10 km) [26 mi] were empty. In the protection zone
there are 3 hatcheries. Immediate surveillance was carried out on all
poultry farms and backyard flocks in this radius as detailed in the
following table:

Poultry type / Protection zone / Surveillance zone
Meat turkeys / 1 / 12
Breeding turkeys / 0 / 3
Broiler chickens / 4 / 3
Table egg pullets / 6 / 2
Table egg layers / 7 / 3
Broiler breeder pullets / 5 / 2
Broiler breeders / 7 / 5
Egg breeder pullets / 1 / 0
Backyard flocks / 6 / 1
Total 68 / 37 / 31

Tracheal and cloacal swabs from all these flocks were tested and [all]
found negative.

These samples and blood samples were saved for future viral isolation
[attempts] and serology if necessary.

Continuing surveillance
-----------------------
All movements of poultry and/or eggs out of the protection and
surveillance zones are preceded by PCR and clinical testing of all
houses on the farm according to the following protocols.

1. Marketing of table eggs: 4 egg sorting plants, located in the
vicinity of the zones are authorized to receive eggs from the zones.
The farmers were informed in writing as to which plants they could
market their eggs. The vehicles that collect the eggs from the farms
operate only in the protection and the surveillance zones. The eggs
are transferred to the egg sorting plant marked with the name of the
farm of origin and date of collection from the farm. These eggs are
stored in a quarantine area. A veterinarian visits each of the farms
twice a week and clinically examines the birds. If any disease will be
suspected, appropriate samples will be obtained and sent to the
laboratory. The veterinarian informs a government poultry officer that
the flocks are healthy and he, in turn, issues a permit to release to
the market eggs that had been collected from the farm at least 3 days
prior to the inspection.

2. Marketing of broilers and meat turkeys for slaughter or pullets to
other farms: 3 poultry slaughter houses, all located within or in the
vicinity of the surveillance zone, are authorized to slaughter and
process broilers or turkeys from the zones. During the pre-slaughter
inspection on the farm the clinical veterinarian samples tracheal and
cloacal swabs by house, from all houses to be marketed. These samples
are sent to the Kimron Veterinary institute for Real Time PCR testing
for influenza. Upon receiving a negative result a government poultry
officer issues a permit to market the birds. These permits are valid
for 72 hours after sampling. In a similar fashion table egg layer
pullets and turkey poults are tested before being moved out of the
zones.

3. Hatching eggs: the farmer samples tracheal and cloacal swabs by
house, from all the houses on the farm. These samples are sent to the
Kimron Veterinary institute for Real Time PCR testing for influenza.
Upon receiving a negative result a government poultry officer issues a
permit to market the hatching eggs to a hatchery. These permits are
valid for 72 hours after sampling.

As of this date [2 Feb 2010] , none of the farms tested in the
protection and surveillance zones have been found to be infected with
HPAI H5N1. Monitoring activities of sick and dead wild birds in the
zones has been stepped up.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
The epidemiologic investigation revealed that no birds were introduced
into the farm since the chicks were placed and that no birds were
moved out of the farm. The 2 workers on the farm had no contact with
other birds [poultry] since the chicks were placed. Movements of the
vaccinating crew and the treating veterinarian have been investigated
and 3 contact farms were identified. These 3 farms are located with
the surveillance zone and therefore are under the surveillance
procedures. Feed was delivered to the poultry houses from outside the
fence by underground feed pipes.

The epidemiological report did not reveal any specific reason
concerning the introduction of the virus into the affected poultry
house. One possible scenario is the introduction of the virus [into
the single infected house] by stepping on infected droppings in the
area between the sanitary facilities (where clothes and shoe changing
and showering take place) and the entrance to the poultry house. No
foot baths were used at the entrance to the houses. Within several km
of the farm there are fish ponds and sewage treatment ponds, which
attract a large number of wild birds in general and waterfowl
specifically. During the investigation, wild ducks, cormorants, and
egrets [a species of heron] were seen flying over the farm.
