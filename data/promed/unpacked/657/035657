Six-fold increase in measles cases
----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has recorded an increase in the number of
measles cases in the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zakarpattia and Rivne
regions, according to deputy health minister Raisa Moiseenko. She
explains this increase as due both to the rising incidence of measles
throughout Europe, and to the fact that in 2008 Ukraine was unable to
conduct a large-scale campaign of immunization of adolescents and
young people against the disease.

Deputy minister Moiseenko said in comparison with the previous year,
measles incidence has increased six-fold, and the number of cases as
of October [2011] was 193. In the summer the Health Ministry had
discounted the threat of a measles epidemic in Ukraine.

Government issues national measles alert
----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health yesterday announced that there is a national
measles outbreak in eastern, central, and western Uganda, warning the
public to report suspected cases early.

The director-general of health services in the ministry, Dr Jane Ruth
Aceng, said in a statement that they have identified cases in Bududa,
Bukedea, Bushenyi Kabarole, Kampala, Rakai, Ntungamo, Luweero,
Namayingo, Nakasongola, and Namutumba districts.

The contagious disease was first suspected in Namayingo in November
[2011] after a total of 112 children were admitted with measles
symptoms. To curb the airborne disease, Dr Aceng said they had opened
up a measles unit at the National Referral Hospital, Mulago, and other
upcountry hospitals and health centres to attend to any reported
cases. She warned the public to "avoid and immediately take any
suspected measles cases to the nearest health facility."

Although reported cases of measles in Uganda have declined by over 90
per cent, due in part to the initiation of nationwide vaccination
campaigns in 2003, it continues to claim more lives of children than
any other vaccine-preventable disease.

Dr Edward Mwesigwa, the Bushenyi district health officer, said 4 cases
had been identified in that district. He identified the type of
measles as German rubella [that is, German measles caused by Rubella
virus], which broke out 2 weeks ago before they reported the case to
the Ministry of Health. They sent samples and the disease was
confirmed, he said. [It is presumed that the measles cases reported
elsewhere in the country have been caused by measles virus infection,
and not by rubella virus. - Mod.CP]

Measles is highly contagious and can rapidly spread among children who
are not immunised. While measles does not kill, it can cause
blindness, malnutrition, deafness or pneumonia.

In Ntungamo, Mr Rodgers Kizito, the district cold chain officer --
responsible for immunisation services -- said there was one case of
measles in the district early November in Rweikiniro Sub-county. The
victim is said to have contracted the measles in Kampala. "She was
treated and she recovered; none of her family members contracted the
disease," Mr Kizito said, adding that there is a large number of
children in Ntungamo who are not immunised which increases their
susceptibility to measles.

[3] Jamaica (alert)

Island-wide alert for measles importers
---------------------------------------
In keeping with increased reports of outbreaks and the ongoing spread
of measles in several countries in Europe (UK, France, Spain) and the
Americas (Canada, USA), the Ministry of Health has heightened its
alert for imported cases of measles.

"In light of the expected increased travel to and from these areas
during the holiday season, the Ministry is urging parents and
guardians to ensure that their children, one year and over, are
adequately immunised against measles, mumps and rubella with the MMR
vaccine," said Dr Eva Lewis Fuller, chief medical officer. "If
children are not immunised or parents are not sure of their
vaccination status, they should be taken to their doctor or the
nearest health centre immediately to get the vaccine." Measles is a
highly contagious disease, which is characterised by fever, cough and
a fine, red skin rash which starts on the face and spreads to the
body. The disease is spread through coughing and sneezing.

"At this time, Jamaica has not confirmed any case of measles but the
Ministry remains vigilant as the country prepares to be certified as
having eliminated measles," the ministry said. Persons can contact the
toll free number 1-888-663-5683 daily between the hours of 9:00am to
5:00pm for more information.

Four more measles cases
-----------------------
A second wave of measles has broken out in Tairawhiti. Two East Coast
children and two Gisborne teenagers presented with measles-like
symptoms at the weekend. Test results due later this week are "very
probable" to confirm measles, says Tairawhiti District Health (TDH)
medical officer of health, Dr Geoffrey Cramp. The 4 new cases come
less than a fortnight after a boy at Gisborne Intermediate [school]
and a boy at Campion College were confirmed as having contracted
measles.

"Between them, these 4 new cases have been in contact with hundreds of
people. Those most at risk are non-immunised people, babies, pregnant
mothers and those with weakened immune systems. I cannot stress enough
the importance of immediate immunisation."

TDH has established an emergency operations centre to manage the
situation. TDH will also ensure non-immunised people who have had
contact with these cases stay away from work or school. Dr Cramp
advises people with measles symptoms to phone their doctors prior to
arrival, so arrangements can be made for them to be put into an
isolated room. "This is very important -- the sick person needs to
stay outside the clinic, until staff are ready to take them to the
isolated area. We all need to take responsibility to limit the spread
of this horrible disease.

"If you are unwell and think you have the measles phone your GP, or
call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for free advice from a registered
nurse. It is very important that you stay away from school and stay
away from work."
