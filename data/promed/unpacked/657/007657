[Over the past few years, we have seen several outbreaks of varying
size and geographic dispersion in the United States. In 2009, an
outbreak was limited to horses in New Mexico (3 premises and 4 total
horses) and Texas (2 premises and 3 total horses). In the 3 previous
U.S. outbreaks, both horses and cattle were involved.

In 2006, there was an outbreak limited to Wyoming affecting 9 premises
and 2 counties. However, in 2005, a much more extensive outbreak
occurred in both cattle and horses. There were 445 premises in 69
counties spanning the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,
Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming; i.e., large portions of the Rocky
Mountains areas in the western United States. In 2004, there were 294
outbreak premises, in 43 counties covering the western states of
Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.

The strain this year [2010] is again New Jersey as it has been for the
last several outbreaks. This year, let's hope we get a year with less
extensive spread rather than one of those years with multiple states
and multiple species involved.

Further surveillance details,maps and a nice PowerPoint on previous
U.S outbreaks by Sabrina Swenson, Lynn Creekmore, and Larry White can
be found at the USDA-APHIS website at

[The epidemiology of VSV is an enigma. It has been isolated from a
wide range of biting insects, and sandflies (_Lutzomyia_ spp.) are
principal suspects, but not proven. It is not known how the virus
persists between years with major outbreaks, in widely separated
localities; a wild reservoir host has not been identified. - Mod.JW]
