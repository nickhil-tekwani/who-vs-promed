Nearly 7% of blood donors in Northern California who were randomly tested
were found to be positive for a new type of virus, known as TT
[transfusion-transmitted] virus. The virus was first identified in 1997 in
Japan when researchers found it in 3 of 5 patients who developed hepatitis
after blood transfusions. However, it is still not clear if the virus is
harmless, or something to be concerned about.
Bernie R Betlach and colleagues at the Sacramento Medical Foundation Center
tested a total of 194 samples from volunteer blood donors in a 13-county
area of Northern California. The researchers tested 119 healthy volunteers
and 75 donors with elevated blood levels of liver enzymes.
"In each group, 6.7% tested positive for TT virus," Betlach told Reuters
Health in a telephone interview. All the samples were negative for other
viruses checked during routine donor blood screening.
It is possible that the virus may account for some cases of
transfusion-associated hepatitis in those cases in which an individual
tests negative for any of the known hepatitis viruses, according to
Betlach, but more study is needed to find out if this proposed link is true.
