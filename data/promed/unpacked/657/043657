[This year (2007), 22 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) have been
registered in the Volgograd [region]: 15 cases in inhabitants of
Volgograd (city), 6 cases in Voljskiy [also known as Volzhskiy]
district, and one case in Sredneakhtubinsky district. Of these, 2
people died as a result of immune system weakening: a 70-year-old
woman and 59-year-old man.
It should be noted that WNV was 1st detected in [Russia] in 1999,
when more than 300 people contracted the disease and 30 cases ended
with a fatal outcome

[Volgograd is considered an endemic zone for WNV. However it is
unclear from the message whether the cases took place earlier this
year [2007] or if the outbreak is happening at the present time. - Mod.NR
This region in Russia has been the site of repeated WN virus
outbreaks since the 1st cases were recorded in 1999. It would be
interesting to know if the virus is being reintroduced by migrating
birds or has become endemic in the area, perhaps overwintering in
adult mosquitoes.
