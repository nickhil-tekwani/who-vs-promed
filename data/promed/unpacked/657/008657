Information received on 5 Feb 2003 from Dr George Khoury, Director of
Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform,
Damascus:
Report date: 5 Feb 2003.
With reference to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in
Damascus Province that occurred in February 2002, a modified
stamping-out policy was applied in the infected farm. The farm is
still under quarantine restrictions. Movement of live animals from
one province to another is still prohibited and controlled.
No new suspected cases have been detected since the outbreak. A
survey was conducted within a diameter of 70 km around the outbreak
(see table below). The results of the survey showed that all the
samples were negative to the FMD antigen detection test.

The Central Veterinary Laboratory in Syria is implementing FMD
sero-monitoring under an FAO Technical Cooperation Project. To date,
290 serum samples from different places have been tested (Laboratory
results of FMD sero-monitoring). All these samples were negative for
the presence of any field strain, and showed a high level of
antibodies against strains A, O, and Asia1, which are all included in
the vaccine used.

is very useful for future efforts. We appreciate that this
