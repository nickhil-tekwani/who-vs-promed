Korea's Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
confirmed on 18 Feb 2009 that avian influenza recently occurred on 3
chicken farms in Korea's Suncheon and other parts of Jeollanam-do
[South Jeolla] Province.

The Ministry said that tests carried out on blood samples taken from
poultry on 3 chicken farms in Suncheon, Gokseong County, and Boseong
County in Jeollanam-do Province confirmed that the avian influenza
virus found on all 3 chicken farms is low pathogenic H5 subtype.

A total of 22 000 chickens on the 3 farms have been culled.

[According to OIE's International Animal Health Code, all
low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5 or H7 subtypes are
notifiable, hence termed "low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza"
(LPNAI). The pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses is defined
according to criteria which are detailed in the code: highly
pathogenic viruses are those which have an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 in 6-week-old chickens, or, as an
alternative, cause at least 75 percent mortality in 4-to 8-week-old
chickens infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which do not have
an IVPI of greater than 1.2 or cause less than 75 percent mortality
in an intravenous lethality test, should be sequenced to determine
whether multiple basic amino acids are present at the cleavage site
of the haemagglutinin molecule; if the amino acid motif is similar to
that observed for other highly pathogenic isolates, the isolate being
tested should be considered as highly pathogenic notifiable avian
influenza (HPNAI).

LPNAI are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that are not
HPNAI viruses. Further background on the laboratory diagnosis of
avian influenza is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.03.04_AI.pdf>

In October 2008, LPNAI H5N2 was identified in Southern Chungcheong
and reported to the OIE. This event was reportedly resolved on 31 Dec
2008 (see OIE report at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7646>).

Confirmation (or otherwise) of the Xinhua News Agency information and
-- in case confirmed -- typing of the neuraminidase component of the
current South Korean LPNAI virus, and its notification to the OIE,
are expected soon. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu hits 9 of Viet Nam's provinces
-----------------------------------------------------
Bird flu is plaguing in 9 provinces in Vietnam with a newly-reported
coastal province Khanh Hoa also finding the virus, according to the
Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development on Wednesday.

In Khanh Hoa province of south central Vietnam, bird flu has killed
27 fowls raised at a local farm, said the department, Vietnam
watchdog of bird flu.

Samples of dead ducks found in the province tested positive to the
H5N1 virus, said the department.

So far this year, 9 provinces of Vietnam nationwide have been hit by
avian flu, including 4 provinces in Mekong Delta, namely Ca Mau, Soc
Trang, Hau Giang and Bac Lieu, 2 northern provinces of Bac Ninh and
Quang Ninh, 2 central provinces of Nghe An and Quang Tri, and the
newly-confirmed southern Khanh Hoa, said the department.

[On Mon 16 Feb 2009, Viet Nam submitted its follow-up report on H5N1
to the OIE, with details concerning 15 new outbreaks recorded between
26 Jan-14 Feb 2009. The total number of susceptible birds in the said
outbreaks was 7751, of which 2997 were clinically affected and 1819
died. 5832 birds were culled. The report, including a map showing the
respective locations of the 15 outbreaks, is available at
