[The Israeli animal health authorities are to be commended for the
high degree of transparency evidenced by this report of an increased
number of serological positive animals in an unexpected manner. Such
reporting can be useful in determining any spatial correlation with
the human cases referenced in ProMED-mail posting 20070914.3054.
Another notable item in this report is the use of the term airborne
to describe the mode of transmission. West Nile Virus is generally
thought to be transmitted by mosquitoes, an example of vector-borne
transmission. - Mod.PC]
