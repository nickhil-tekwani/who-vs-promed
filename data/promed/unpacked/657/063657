The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said Thursday [4
Sep 2008] a fatal viral disease is the cause for the death of more
than 50 deer along the Clinton River in Oakland and Macomb counties
in recent weeks.

Officials sent some stomach contents and tissue samples to the
Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State
University and tentative results diagnosed the deer with epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD), DNR spokesperson Mary Dettloff said. The
lab has one more test to run but is confident the diagnosis will
remain the same.

The viral disease is often found in wild ruminant -- hoofed animals
-- like deer, that are infected through biting flies and an insect
called a midge. In as little as 7 days deer develop symptoms of loss
of appetite, they grow progressively weaker, excessive salivating,
rapid pulse and high fever.

"That's why many of the deer in Oakland and Macomb are found near
water sites. They are driven to the water because of the extremely
high fever," Dettloff. "Then they eventually become unconscious and die."

But this is not the 1st deer die-off because of the disease. It was
initially seen in the state's white-tailed deer in 1955, and the most
recent was in Allegan County in 2006 where upwards of 50 deer died
from the disease.

Dettloff said there is "no evidence" that the disease can be
transmitted to humans. But other wild animals like elk and moose can
contract the virus.

[In ProMED-mail 20080830.2712, the Freep article specifically said
that EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease) had been ruled out. Now the
DNR is coming back and saying it has been diagnosed. This had to have
been a miscommunication somewhere along the line, as laboratories may
say the testing is not complete, but they rarely reverse themselves,
as these conflicting articles have.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is closely related to bluetongue
virus infection (BTV). Both diseases are carried by biting midges.
Recently Europe has experienced a significant upswing in BTV. It also
moved further north than had previously been thought possible. EHD
may be following a similar pattern. This could indicate the virus is
changing its virulence or has become more resistant to cold weather.
The virus has, in some way, changed its character. As such, it means
veterinarians and producers in more regions not previously seeing EHD
will now need to add this disease to their differential list. - Mod.TG
