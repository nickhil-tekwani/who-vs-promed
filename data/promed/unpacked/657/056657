The Department of Justice (DOJ) yesterday [19 Jul 2011] sought to
settle confusion over court documents in the civil trial related to an
anthrax victim's death, which initially seemed to undercut earlier FBI
findings about government microbiologist Bruce Ivins' role in the 2001
anthrax letter attacks.

Court documents in the trial that portrayed the DOJ as casting doubt
on Ivins' ability to make anthrax powder at the US Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases lab in Fort Detrick, Md.,
were 1st reported on by an investigative group from ProPublica, an
independent, nonprofit journalism group; the Public Broadcasting
Service (PBS) program Frontline, and McClatchy Newpapers. The DOJ
documents were filed on 15 Jul 2011 in a US District Court case in
Florida brought by the family of a Boca Raton photographer who was the
1st of 5 people to die in the anthrax attacks, the investigative team
reported in their original 18 Jul 2011 report.

In a 2nd report yesterday [19 Jul 2011], the investigative group said
that the DOJ filed a 7-page correction that retracts statements
questioning the FBI's findings but does not strike testimony from
individual government researchers who challenged the FBI's findings
about Ivins.

The DOJ's original 15 Jul 2011 court filings said the biocontainment
area of Ivins' lab did not contain the equipment he'd need to
transform liquid anthrax into powder and did not explain how he could
have prepared it, according to the investigative group's 1st report.

The DOJ's assertions appeared to be a startling new development in
the anthrax case and, according to the investigative report, raised
complaints at the FBI and among prosecutors who handled the criminal
case.

Ivins committed suicide in July 2008 while the FBI was preparing to
file charges against him. One month later, the FBI announced its
conclusion that Ivins perpetrated the attacks in the fall of 2001,
which led to 22 anthrax cases and 5 deaths. After some experts
disputed the FBI's findings, FBI Director Robert Mueller asked the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct an independent
scientific review.

In February 2011, the NAS released its review, saying that the
available scientific evidence by itself was not adequate to allow a
definitive conclusion about the source of the anthrax spores used in
the attack. Though the FBI's methods did show genetic similarities
between the letter samples and anthrax spores that were stored in a
flask in Ivins' lab, the methods didn't rule out possible explanations
other than a direct link.

Yesterday [19 Jul 2011], DOJ spokesman Dean Boyd said in a statement
that DOJ civil division attorneys submitted "inaccurate information"
in the 15 Jul 2011 court filings and that the DOJ and the FBI back
their findings that Ivins had the equipment needed to make the spores,
according to the ProPublica report. Yesterday's [19 Jul 2011]
correction said Ivins had ordered his own lyophilizer machine, which
could be used to dry anthrax spores, and that it was labeled as
"property of Bruce Ivins" and kept in a nearby biocontainment suite,
the report said.

Boyd's statement said the DOJ and FBI "have never wavered from the
view that Dr. Ivins mailed the anthrax letters," according to the
ProPublica report.

The investigative reporters and other media outlets have suggested
that the DOJ is likely poking holes in the case against Ivins as a
strategy to defend the government in the civil suit, which claims
negligence. For example, the Frederick (Md.) News Post reported
yesterday [19 Jul 2011] that in a motion to dismiss the case, the DOJ
argues that any doubt about Ivins' guilt would make it more difficult
for the victim's family to show government negligence.

The ProPublica group said it's unclear how the DOJ's civil court
filings came to be so at odds with the case put forward by its
prosecutors, and that the DOJ has not offered an explanation.

[Let me make it clear: My interest in this investigation is that as
long as there are any serious doubts as to what happened in 2001,
which increasingly there are, this event can be repeated. If you don't
know what happened, you cannot come up with a cost-effective
preventive decision and actions. A firm belief is not the same as hard
knowledge, and the Bruce Ivins hypothesis is presently in doubt.
