[Although the outbreak peaked between weeks 39-45 in 2017 (23 Sep-10 Nov 2017), cases continue to occur beyond the usual transmission season that ends in June, with sporadic cases occurring every month to date in 2018. ProMED-mail readers interested in this outbreak can access the map and graph included in the report above at the source URL. The report provides the most recent update of the monkeypox situation in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area in a short period of time. The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of monkeypox virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people. As mentioned earlier, prevention will require a proactive public education effort to convince local people to take measures to prevent contact with the infected rodents and their excreta to avoid transmission -- a difficult task involving so many local people over such a large geographic area.

Non-human primates are not monkeypox virus reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents (genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). - Mod.TY
