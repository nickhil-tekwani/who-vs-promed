CDC and public health officials in many states are collecting different types of data to investigate multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections with serotypes Enteritidis, Hadar, and Infantis. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with backyard poultry is making people sick.

As of 20 May 2021, a total of 163 people infected with one of the outbreak strains have been reported from 43 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 12 Feb 2021 to 25 Apr 2021. Sick people range in age from less than one to 87 years, with a median age of 24 years, and 58% are female. Of 109 people with information available, 34 (31%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2-4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 92 people interviewed, 81 (88%) reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same type of animal.

On 15 Apr [2021], public health officials in Ohio collected samples from a sick person's ducklings for testing. WGS showed that the bacteria, _Salmonella_ serotype Hadar, in duckling poop are closely related to bacteria from sick people. This means that people likely got sick from contact with backyard poultry.

WGS was also used to identify any predicted antibiotic resistance. Among bacteria from 125 sick people's samples and one animal sample, 63 (50%) were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antimcrobial: ampicillin (1%), chloramphenicol (1%), streptomycin (50%), sulfamethoxazole (2%), and tetracycline (48%). CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently conducting standard antibiotic susceptibility testing. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if antimicrobials are needed to treat people in this outbreak with severe illnesses, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of therapy.
