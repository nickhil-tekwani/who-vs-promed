ANTHRAX, HUMAN, LIVESTOCK - ITALY (BOLZANO)

We have an anthrax outbreak in North Italy (Bolzano).
The outbreak developed in a non-endemic area. During this outbreak, 6
bovines died. This is an atypical outbreak because, during this period
(winter), the animals don't graze because they live in a mountainous area,
and during this season, the pastures are snow-covered.
Probably, the origin of the outbreak is the hay (fed to the cows). The
farmer produces hay and imports hay from another region.
The farmer wasn't familiar with anthrax, and he slaughtered 2 bovines
during the agonic phase. The infected blood was collected in a tank that
usually is used to collect manure. The tank is very big, 20 meters x 6
meters x 3 meters. The official veterinary service is using 5 percent
formaldehyde for sterilization. (Is this correct?).
The farmer and his wife contracted cutaneous anthrax.
I have received the DNA of the isolated strain and am working on the hay.
We will vaccinate the animals in the next week. I will further inform you
within the next few days.

[Many thanks, Antonio. Dr. Fasanella is the Director of The Italian Anthrax
Reference Laboratory in Foggia, so we can accept this report as correct and
authoritative. Firstly, anthrax is, frankly, very uncommon if not rare
outside of Southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia. The outbreaks in the north
are historically connected to industrial sources, hides, hair mills, etc.
It is not impossible for hay to be contaminated. This happens when it rains
during hay making, and muddy contaminated soil gets mixed in with the hay.
If I were to make a bet, it would be that the farmer unknowingly bought
contaminated hay, in which case there may well be outbreaks in other herds
that bought hay from the same source. Winter bovine cases are more usually
from contaminated dairy concentrate feed containing contaminated bone
meals. Genomic characterization of the isolates will go far to indicate the
source, as historic northern isolates have been of typical industrial
strains, as of Turkey, Pakistan, and India, and very different from the
strains in Southern Italy.
Whether 5 percent formaldehyde will work depends on how much is used,
obviously, as one normally aims at a final concentration near this value.
Contact with organic materials will degrade it fairly quickly. On the other
hand, if oxygen is not introduced, sporulation will be minimal (on the top
surface where the formaldehyde may come to be anyway), and anaerobic
fermentation in the tank contents will deal with the vegetative bacteria in
the blood. I imagine that Antonio will be taking samples in his thorough
investigation. - Mod.MHJ]
