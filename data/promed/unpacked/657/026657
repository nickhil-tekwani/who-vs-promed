DEC detects VHS in dead fish found at Skaneateles Lake
------------------------------------------------------
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)
announced today [19 Jun 2007], that an ongoing fish kill of
smallmouth bass and rock bass in Skaneateles Lake has been linked to
Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS).
Skaneateles Lake, one of New York's Finger Lakes, is the 2nd location
where VHS-infected fish have been found in a New York water body
outside of the Great Lakes. VHS has been previously confirmed in Lake
Ontario, the St. Lawrence River, Lake Erie, the Niagara River, and
Conesus Lake.
VHS is a pathogen of fish and does not pose any threat to public
health. VHS is a disease that causes the hemorrhaging of the fish's
tissues, including internal organs. Often, infected fish do not
exhibit any external signs of having the disease. The disease affects
all sizes of fish and not all infected fish develop the disease, but
can continue to carry it and spread it to others. There is no known
cure for VHS. The impact of this particular strain of VHS on fish
populations is uncertain. It has caused fish mortalities ranging from
a few to thousands of fish.
On 8 May 2007, DEC staff investigated a fish kill of rock and
smallmouth bass at Skaneateles Lake. Moribund rock and smallmouth bass
were collected and sent to the College of Veterinary Medicine at
Cornell University for testing. The tests were positive for VHS, and
fish have been sent to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Lab
in Seattle, Washington, for confirmation. Since the initial
collection, sporadic die-offs have resulted in thousands of [dead]rock
bass and smallmouth bass washing up on shore in various locations
along the Skaneateles Lake shoreline. DEC continues to monitor the
situation.
On 6 Jun 2007, DEC finalized regulations to help prevent the spread
of VHS and other diseases into New York's inland waters. The
regulations restrict the movement of bait fish and the stocking of
fish into New York's waters. A copy of the final regulations is
available online as a PDF [pp. 7-13] from the Department of State at
<http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/register/2007/jun6/pdfs/rules.pdf>.
Frequently asked questions can be found on the DEC website at
<http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/33072.html>. DEC staff is also
continuing to sample water bodies throughout the state for VHS to
determine how far the disease has spread.
In addition to following the fish health regulations, anglers should
be vigilant in keeping live wells clean. Live wells should be cleaned
with a solution of 10 percent bleach to water (1 3/4 cups bleach per
gallon of water). This will kill the VHS virus and other aquatic
invasive species such as zebra mussels.
The public is advised to contact the nearest DEC regional office if
they witness a large number of dead or dying fish (usually 100 or
more).
Questions about VHS and potential DEC actions to prevent its spread
can be e-mailed to <fwfish@gw.dec.state.ny.us>, or for more
information call 518-402-8896. The public is also advised to
regularly check the Department's website at <http://www.dec.ny.gov>
for updated information on VHS in New York State.
