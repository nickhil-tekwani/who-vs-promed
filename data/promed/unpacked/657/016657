In November 2013, a rare salmonella bacteria strain, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Coeln, has been confirmed in 18 people in Norway by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). The patients were infected in Norway and live in several counties (Buskerud, Oslo, Rogaland, Akershus, Nordland, Oppland, Oslo, Troms, Vestfold, Hordaland, Vest-Agder and Ostfold).

"The patients include 3 children and 15 adults. Salmonellosis is not usually serious and does not need treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have been notified of approximately 0-3 cases of salmonellosis per year due to this strain," said senior adviser Line Vold in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the NIPH.

The NIPH collaborates with the municipal health service, the Norwegian Veterinary Institute and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority in the investigation around each patient. Interviews and samples from the patients in their local environment are routinely taken to try to identify a common source of infection.

"This work takes time and is not always successful in finding the source of infection," says Vold.

[Outbreaks of salmonellosis in the Scandinavian countries are less common than in the USA, in part due to dietary differences. _S._ Coeln is an uncommon serotype as well. We await more information regarding the vehicle of this outbreak. - Mod.LL
