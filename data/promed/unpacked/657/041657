More than 1000 waterfowl, shorebirds and songbirds have died of
a suspected outbreak of avian botulism at Milton Reservoir in Weld
County, Colorado, USA.
"We have sent samples to Oregon to be analyzed and won't have
results for a couple of days, but everything is consistent with avian
botulism," said Colorado Division of Wildlife spokesman Fred
Quartarone.
The disease isn't harmful to humans. Biologists say it is a bacterial
poison birds contract the same way humans do -- by eating tainted
food.
The bacteria are found in wetlands in spore form resistant to heat
and drying, the Audubon Society's Encyclopedia of North American
Birds says.
_Clostridium botulinum_ type C occurs naturally in soil. It thrives on
decaying plants and dead animals in warm water where there is an
abundance of decaying animal matter, maggots and a lack of
oxygen.
As there are more dead birds, more flies lay their eggs which hatch
into botulism-infested maggots that birds eat. The toxin paralyses
the neurological system of the bird, which then dies.
An outbreak of type C in the U.S. and Canada a few years ago
killed millions of birds.
Officers have almost cleaned up the carcasses. They are being
buried in a landfill. "The good news is after scooping up dead birds,
we now are starting to see more and more live birds on the water
and the shoreline, so we are hopeful we've cleaned it up," he said.
