Namibia: RVF under control for the time being
---------------------------------------------
Namibia got off lightly from the recent outbreak of Rift Valley fever
(RVF). However, should farmers not take precautionary measures by
vaccinating their animals, they might be in for a rough ride next summer
[2010-11]. So says Dr Cleopas Bamhare, acting chief veterinary officer in
the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry.

According to Bamhare, no new RVF infections have been reported since the
ones reported on 6 farms in the Hardap Region and one in the Karas Region.
The onset of winter played a significant role in bringing the [zoonotic]
disease under control for the time being, he said.

A total of 17 animals died in the 2 affected regions in what was regarded
as the 1st RVF outbreak in Namibia since 1985. Hundreds of animals and
close to 20 people died of RVF in neighbouring South Africa (SA) recently.

If Namibia does not prepare adequately against a follow-up outbreak, the
country might be worse off than it was during last month's [May 2010]
outbreak. "It is the next season that we are worried about. For now, it is
under control," Bamhare said.

No human infections have been reported in Namibia.

Bamhare said the department of veterinary services dealt with the outbreak
"textbook-style", which helped convince trade partners to lift restrictions
on imports of Namibian animals and meat products within weeks. "And a
situation like that [trade restrictions] could take months to bring under
control, crippling the industry," he said.

He said there are still no proper statistics available of the number of
animals that have been vaccinated against RVF. In terms of an agreement
with SA, live animals must have been vaccinated at least 21 days before
being allowed into that country.

Bamhare spoke to The Namibian at an aquatic animal health training seminar
that started in Swakopmund on Tuesday evening [15 Jun 2010]. The workshop
continues until Saturday [19 Jun 2010].

no human infections were reported.
