Worried about deaths of monkeys in certain of [Goiania?s] green zones
suspected of having contracted yellow fever, the Municipal
Environmental Agency (AMMA) this morning (13 Dec [2007]) convened a
meeting of municipal and state health representatives and wildlife
protection and management authorities. They discussed measures that
would be adopted in relation to infected wild animals which live in
the green zones. They asserted that they will carry out monitoring in
the localities where the dead macaques were found and provide an
explanation to the local populace.

In Goiania [capital of Goias state. ? Mod.JW] in recent months, a
female monkey was found dead in forested land on private property on
the banks of the Joao Leite River. In a reserve within the Jardins
Madri condominium 4 dead [monkeys] (3 females and an adult male) were
found. In Vila Redencao, adjacent to the Botanical Garden, 3 adult
monkeys died.

The public health laboratory also indicated that it had initiated an
investigation of vectors (transmitters of the virus) [it is not clear
if they are speaking of mosquito vectors or of vertebrate hosts in
this case. - Mod. TY] in the area of Santa Genoveva and the Condominio
Jardins Madri. Since Goias state is an endemic area for yellow fever
[virus], any suspected cases of this disease necessitate
investigation. "We request that the population be vaccinated against
yellow fever; the vaccine is available in any health unit in the
prefecture. Since it is not possible to vaccinate wild animals, it is
very important that all unvaccinated people receive yellow fever
vaccine as soon as possible, to avoid greater problems, " explained
Marize Moreira, the head of Wildlife Protection and Management.

[ProMED requests information confirming if the monkey deaths were due
to yellow fever virus infection or not, and the results of the surveys
that are planned, as soon as this information becomes available.

Goias state and Goiania can be accessed at:

[If these monkey deaths have been going on for months, the people
living in these locations are very lucky not to have contracted YF ?
unless the monkeys died from other causes, or most of the local
inhabitants were already vaccinated. The enormous delay in reporting
these deaths indicates that the population of the city is not aware of
the threat. Under the new IHR (International Health Regulations),
Brazil should have reported these findings to WHO/PAHO last week. ?
