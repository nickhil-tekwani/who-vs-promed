With respect to travel advisories and "the other cruise ship" operating out
of the Dominican Republic:
Canadian LCDC, UK PHLS and US CDC public health authorities collaborated on
obtaining information to assess the risk to citizens from these three
countries, in spite of the fact that neither country had any legal
jurisdiction (the ship did not enter the waters of these countries).
Once the magnitude of the risk was defined, LCDC advised the company that
it would issue a travel advisory on April 20th for all Canadians. However,
the issuance of the advisory was postponed due to special circumstances,
i.e., the ship declined to board additional passengers during the third
cruise; a binational Canadian-UK epidemiological investigation was underway
on board; the ship departed to cross the Atlantic for seven days, so that
no additional persons could board and be exposed; all susceptibles on board
were probably exhausted; and the company planned a five day hiatus before
its next cruise to undertake extensive sanitation measures.
Further advice to potential passengers awaits the outcome of the binational
epidemiological investigation. Data analysis is nearing completion in the
UK at present.

[It seems clear that Canada has done what is needed to protect its
citizens. What the British can perhaps tell us is whether the results of
the investigation will be available before the ship sails again -- today?
-- after boarding passengers in Europe? - Mod.JW
