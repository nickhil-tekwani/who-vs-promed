FACT SHEET - April 4, 1997
CDC Issues "Recommendation Not to Sail" to MS Royal Odyssey
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a
"Recommendation Not To Sail," to the ship MS Royal Odyssey. The
recommendation was issued to protect the health of passengers and crew
because of diarrhea cases reported on three consecutive cruises following
sanitary inspections and epidemiological investigations.
Norwegian Cruise Line has cooperated fully with CDC in all aspects of this
investigation. Their actions have been responsible and appropriate. All
recommendations and counsel have been followed expeditiously.
During the first cruise (March 4-14, 1997) preliminary investigations
revealed that passengers and crew aboard had reported diarrhea illness. The
subsequent investigation found small round structured viruses (SRSVs),
which included Norwalk or Norwalk-like viruses. While the ship's staff
indicated they had followed CDC's recommendations for decontamination and
prevention of subsequent cases, additional diarrhea cases continued to be
reported. During this last cruise (March 25 - April 4, 1997), approximately
39% of the passengers and 17% of the crew reported at least one episode of
vomiting and/or diarrhea.
Norwalk virus is a gastroenteritis illness and is usually associated with
contaminated water and foods. General symptoms are nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
CDC epidemiologists are at the ship's port in Miami, Florida and continuing
the investigation. All passengers disembarked this morning.
CDC became involved in inspecting cruise ships in the 1970's as a
cooperative effort with the cruise ship industry. The program assists the
industry in fulfilling its responsibility for developing and implementing
comprehensive sanitation programs in order to minimize the risk for
gastrointestinal diseases.
CDC Office of Communication Media Relations Division: 404-639-7290 or
404-639-2888 and request on-call press officer.
---------------------------------------
This is reproduced here in relation to the recent outbreak on a different
cruise ship from which Norwalk virus was also isolated. Note that this
advisory was issued after outbreaks on 3 successive cruises. The 1998
outbreak also spread over 3 successive cruises, but since the vessel
operates out of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, under a British flag, I
suppose CDC has no jurisdiction, and is therefore unable to issue a travel
advisory, even to protect U.S. citizens from possible exposure.
This illustrates an aspect of travel health that needs addressing. In a
case such as this where British, Canadian and American passengers are
involved, Filipino crew, and destinations in the Caribbean and
Mediterranean, it should be possible for advisories to go out to all
countries involved, in the interest of public health.
