An outbreak of the parasitic infection, trichinosis, has been reported in the city of Bahia Blanca, a city located in the southwest of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, according to a La Verdad Online report (computer translated).

The local media reports that more than 100 people have been infected with 20 percent of those sickened being children. The consumption of dry sausages has named as the source of the infections.

The dry sausage is from a clandestine Grunbein [Bahia Blanca] farm where 6 pigs and 2 kilos [4.4 lb] of products were seized. In addition, it was confirmed that there are 3 persons admitted in the Penna Hospital for their illness.

In February [2015], it was reported that in the city of Pehuajo more than 160 people with trichinosis were infected after consuming tainted dry sausages.

Trichinellosis, or trichinosis, is a parasitic disease caused most commonly by the roundworm _Trichinella spiralis_. If someone ingests undercooked or raw meat with the encysted larvae, the stomach acid releases the larvae which mature to adults in the intestine. After about a week the female starts releasing larvae which enter the bloodstream and find their way to skeletal muscle where they encapsulate.

There can be gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking acute food poisoning when there is activity of the adults in the intestine.

Sudden appearance of fever, muscle soreness and pain, with swelling of parts of the face are early classic signs. This can sometimes be followed by retinal hemorrhages and other ocular signs.

With heavy infections cardiac, respiratory, and neurological problems may ensue with death from heart failure being most common. The more larvae you ingest, the more serious the disease.

[There have been several reports of trichinellosis from Argentina. The problem seems to be that pigs are slaughtered and the meat sold without the mandatory veterinary inspection for _Trichinella_. Thus, it is advisable not to buy homemade meat products, especially sausages that may not have been cooked, from markets in Argentina. - Mod.EP
