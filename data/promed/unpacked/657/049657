From: Ron Arndt <greer_ivrm@abts.net>

The North Carolina Public Broadcasting TV network, local ABC, NBC and CBS
TV affiliates broadcast from Charlotte, NC and Charlotte Observer newspaper
report that animal rabies cases in Western North Carolina have shown an
alarming increase. Some counties which had not seen any cases for 20 years
are seeing 2 to 3 new cases per month, often in areas near housing
subdivisions. They are reporting on cases from animal control and county
health departments, mainly in Catawba, Lincoln, Caldwell, Burke county areas
in the "Foothills" area of western North Carolina.
