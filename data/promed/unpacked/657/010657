Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 11 Jun 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On 26 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of the Islamic Republic of Iran reported to WHO the 1st 2 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The 2 patients are sisters and residents of Kerman Province.

The following details were provided to WHO:
- a 52 year old woman became ill on [11 May 2014] and was admitted to the hospital on the same day. The patient is currently in a critical condition. She is known to have an underlying medical condition. The patient did not have a history of travel. She did, however, have a history of close contact with a woman who had an influenza-like illness (ILI) and had travelled to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah. The patient had no history of contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill.
- a 50 year old woman became ill on [11 May 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on [17 May 2014]. She is currently in a stable condition. The patient is known to have an underlying medical condition. She does not have a history of travel. She is reported to have had close contact with her sister, the above mentioned 52 year old patient. The patient had no history of contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill.

All close contacts of the above mentioned cases, including family members, other patients in the hospital, and healthcare workers are currently under investigation by the provincial health authorities and the Iranian Centre for Disease Control. Some control measures have been put in place at the hospital where the 2 cases are hospitalized. Relevant information and instructions have been disseminated to relatives, airport personnel, pilgrims returning from Umrah, and travellers.

Globally, 683 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 204 related deaths have been reported officially to WHO. This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 44 laboratory-confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between [19 May 2014 and 2 Jun 2014]. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and impaired immunity are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‚ÄêCoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular handwashing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[The report above is a bit disconcerting as it suggests that there was person to person transmission of the MERS-CoV in Iran, following contact with an individual returning from the Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. While the report identifies the 2nd case as having contact with the 1st case as the probable source of infection, the fact that both cases had the same date of onset suggests there was a common exposure for both of the cases, or perhaps a common exposure to fomites on surfaces that both cases had contact with. It also suggests that at least one individual returned from Umrah with transmissible MERS-CoV infection that was not detected by the routine surveillance activities in the country. This serves as an indicator of probable under-reporting of MERS-CoV infection globally.

[3] Algeria, 1 death - media report

Algeria reports 1st MERS death
------------------------------
Algeria said a 66 year old man died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the 1st deadly case of the virus in the North African country. The man died late on Monday [9 Jun 2014] at a hospital in western Algeria where he had been receiving treatment since the confirmation of his infection late last month [May 2014], the Health Ministry said in a statement.

The man was one of 2 identified with MERS after returning from a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, which has seen a jump in cases. A 59 year old man, the 2nd confirmed case, is still being treated in hospital and his health has improved, the statement said.

[4] Tunisia ex Qatar, retrospective confirmation fatal case - EID publication

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In 2013 in Tunisia, 3 persons in 1 family were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The index case-patient's respiratory tract samples were negative for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription PCR, but diagnosis was retrospectively confirmed by PCR of serum. Sequences clustered with those from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.

[Details on the original report of the Tunisia cases can be found at MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (05): Tunisia ex Saudi Arabia/Qatar, fatal, RFI 20130520.1725864. According to the EID article referenced above, the case was a 66 year old Tunisian male with a 4 year history of untreated diabetes mellitus, who traveled to Qatar and Saudi Arabia during the period 20 Mar 2013 to 27 Apr 2013. The authors present a timeline of travel and maximum incubation period for MERS-CoV infection in Figure 1 at the source URL, showing that transmission of the MERS-CoV infection had most likely occurred while in Qatar. While this case was classified as a probable case by WHO, it was not classified as a confirmed case since nasopharyngeal testing was negative for MERS-CoV. The presence of a viremia was retrospectively confirmed through PCR testing of serum, and one suspects this case will be officially added to the global total of MERS-CoV infected individuals. This moderator strongly recommends reading the full article available at the source URL above.

For a map of Tunisia, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2534478,71.

According to the WHO update, the global total of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected cases is 683, including 204 deaths (case fatality rate: 29.9 per cent). This tally does not include cases reported by Saudi Arabia after 2 Jun 2014, or the delayed confirmation of another case in Tunisia, or the reported death of one of the Algerian cases.

Since 2 Jun 2014 there have been a total of 125 new cases and 97 new deaths reported by Saudi Arabia. If this moderator's calculations are correct, this would bring the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 809 including 303 deaths (case fatality rate 37.5 per cent).

It is noteworthy that it appears as though transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia has significantly decreased. Graphs showing the number of confirmed symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection by week of report based on date of onset of illness for 2014 are available at the source URLs of the Saudi MOH reports. It is clear from these graphs that there has been low level transmission during the period January through mid-March 2014 followed by an increase in transmission, peaking in late April-early May 2014, followed by a decrease and return to low level transmission by late May-early June 2014. - Mod.MPP]
