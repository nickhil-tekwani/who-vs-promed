FDA Public Health Notification (13 Feb 2007)
Information on RotaTeq and Intussusception
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is notifying health care
providers and consumers about 28 post-marketing reports of
intussusception following administration of Rotavirus, Live, Oral,
Pentavalent vaccine (trade name RotaTeq), manufactured by Merck and
Co., Inc. Intussusception is a serious and potentially
life-threatening condition that occurs when the intestine gets
blocked or twisted. One portion of the intestine telescopes into a
nearby portion, causing the intestinal obstruction. The most common
site is where the small intestine joins the large intestine.
Intussusception can occur spontaneously in the absence of
vaccination. Of the reported 28 cases of intussusception, the number
that may have been caused by the vaccine, or occurred by coincidence,
is unknown.
FDA is issuing this notification both to encourage the reporting of
any additional cases of intussusception that may have occurred or
occur in the future after administration of RotaTeq, and to remind
people that intussusception is a potential complication of RotaTeq,.
Current Status
Approximately 3.5 million doses of RotaTeq have been distributed in
the United States through [1 Feb 2007]. Not all of these doses have
been administered. Since its licensure on [3 Feb 2006] until [31 Jan
2007], 28 cases of intussusception have been reported in the U.S. in
infants who received RotaTeq. These cases have been reported to the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The reported 28 cases
occurred after dose 1, dose 2 and dose 3. Approximately half of the
cases occurred 1 to 21 days after vaccination, with a range of 0 to
73 days. Sixteen of the 28 infants with intussusception required
hospitalization and surgery on their intestine. The remaining 12
infants had reduction of the intussusception by contrast or air
enema. No deaths due to intussusception were reported.
The number of intussusception cases reported to date after RotaTeq
administration does not exceed the number expected based on
background rates of 18-43 per 100 000 per year for an unvaccinated
population of children ages 6 to 35 weeks (CDC, unpublished data).
History
RotaTeq is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis
and was studied pre-licensure in a clinical trial population of
approximately 70 000 infants (35 000 infants received RotaTeq and 35
000 received placebo), and no significant increased risk of
intussusception was found (e.g., 6 cases were seen in RotaTeq
recipients vs. 5 in placebo recipients). However, a different
rotavirus vaccine, which is no longer marketed, may have increased
the incidence of intussusception following its use. Therefore, to
further evaluate whether, in the general population, RotaTeq could be
associated with increased rates of intussusception or other serious
adverse events, not only is VAERS data being evaluated continually,
but Merck is conducting a post-marketing study of approximately 44
000 infants, and the CDC Vaccine Safety Data Link is conducting a
post-marketing study of approximately 90 000 infants.
Recommendations
Because vaccine adverse events are not always reported to FDA, there
may be additional cases of intussusception following vaccination of
which we are unaware of at this time. This information is important
in helping FDA and CDC assess whether RotaTeq may be associated with
an increased risk of intussusception and, if so, to what degree.
Therefore, we are encouraging all health care professionals, and any
other individuals, to report any cases of intussusception or other
serious events that may be associated with the use of RotaTeq to
VAERS, which is maintained by FDA and CDC. For a copy of the vaccine
reporting form, call 1-800-822-7967 or report on line to www.vaers.hhs.gov
Parents should contact their child's doctor immediately if the child
has stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in their stool or change
in their bowel movements, as these may be signs of intussusception.
It is important to contact the child's doctor if there are any
questions or if the child has any of these symptoms at any time after
vaccination, even if it has been several weeks since the last vaccine dose.
FDA and the CDC will continue close monitoring of intussusception and
other adverse events associated with RotaTeq. The RotaTeq label and
Patient Product Information have been updated to include
post-marketing reports of intussusception. The dosage and
administration schedule remains unchanged in the label.

Getting More Information
Additional questions may be directed to FDA's Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research at 1-800-835-4709 or by e-mail at <octma@cber.fda.gov>.
The intent of this public health notification from the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research is to provide an update of safety
information to health care providers as new information becomes
available and our understanding of an issue is still evolving. We
will revise this notice as new information merits and so encourage
you to check this site for updates.

[At present, the data do not support a cause and effect relationship
with use of the currently available rotavirus vaccine, as the numbers
cited above are well within the range of the expected numbers of
cases of intussusception in the pediatric population at
large. Unfortunately, the above alert, and request for active
surveillance for intussusception is a "deja vu" for events that
occurred following widespread vaccination with the earlier rotavirus
vaccine (see prior ProMED-mail postings below). The earlier vaccine
was ultimately withdrawn from the market due to a documented
association with increased incidence of intussusception following its use.
One certainly hopes that this current vaccine will be "exonerated"
through more active surveillance activities. Rotavirus infection is
worldwide, with estimates of 600 000 deaths per year in the less
than 2 year old population attributable to rotavirus infection, with
additional significant morbidity in that population. (see
<http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/rotavirus/en/index.html> for
further information). - Mod.MPP]
