Sheep measles threat rises in shooting season
---------------------------------------------
The duck shooting season is here again, and with it an increased
threat to sheep on farms -- not from buck shot, but sheep measles.

The large number of hunters' dogs going onto farms and other rural
land can spread the _Taenia ovis_ parasite to sheep and lambs, if the
dogs have not been dosed.

Sheep measles is not a health risk, unlike hydatids, a related
disease, which is now officially eradicated in this country.

But it leaves unsightly cysts in the carcases of sheep, which can
cause meat plants to reject them, at a cost to the farmer.

The meat industry is continuing its efforts to get rid of it, through
the Ovis Management company. Project manager Dan Lynch says the rate
of infection is being kept below one percent of lambs processed at
meat plants.

But he says duck shooting is always a risky time of year.

He says sheep measles tablets are readily available from vets and
some rural livestock traders.

[Sheep ingest tapeworm eggs from the pasture. These eggs then develop
into cysts in any muscle tissue (such as diaphragm, heart and skeletal
muscle of sheep). If dogs are then fed the infected raw meat, a
tapeworm will develop in the dog's gut, mature, and start producing
eggs in about 35 days. Tapeworm eggs will then appear in the dog's
droppings, and so the cycle repeats.

Never feed raw meat or untreated offal to dogs. All sheep (or goat)
meat needs to be treated before being fed to dogs. Treatment involves
2 options:
1. Freezing: freeze meat at -10 deg C (14 deg F) or below for at
least 7 days before feeding. Write the date (+8 days) the meat went
into the freezer on the bag so that you know when the meat is ready to
be fed.
2. Cooking: heat meat to a core temperature of 72 deg C (162 deg F)
or greater until brown all the way through. Tinges of red indicate
inadequate treatment, and further cooking is necessary.

As biosecurity, keep dogs under direct supervision and keep them
close when not working. Require all dogs to be treated with an
appropriate medication for the parasites within 48 hours of entering
your premises.
