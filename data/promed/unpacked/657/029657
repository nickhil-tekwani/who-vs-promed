The government has confirmed 2 positive cases of avian influenza (H5N1)
infection between February and April this year [2010], with one death.

The 1st case, who died, was a 4 year old girl from the Riau capital of
Pekanbaru. She tested positive for H5N1 on 28 Apr 2010 after being admitted
to Arifin Ahmad Hospital on 19 Apr 2010. The Ministry of Health said in a
statement on Wednesday [5 May 2010] that the patient's x-ray results while
being hospitalized had shown deterioration of her condition. She died on
the same day she tested positive [See also: Avian influenza, human (35):
Indonesia (RI) 20100502.1425.].

The other patient, a 45 year old housewife from Malang, tested positive
through a routine surveillance of influenza-like illness in a community
health center in the East Java city. She was admitted to the health center
with influenza-like complaints. After a swab collection of a specimen from
her nose and throat and an examination at the laboratory, the patient was
declared positive for the virus. The patient has recovered and is now in a
healthy condition, the release said.
