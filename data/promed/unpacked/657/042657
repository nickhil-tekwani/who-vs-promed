Health authorities in the central Zambezia province in Mozambique
were on high alert after the deaths last week of 2 people out of more
than 20 reported cases of cholera, the daily Noticias reported on Tue
27 Nov 2007. It was reported that health authorities in the Chire
region of Morrumbala district had increased the amount of diagnostic
equipment used in the treatment of cholera in the districts of the
province located near the Malawian border.

In October 2007, health authorities reported the death of 2 people in
the same province, while another 6 were hospitalised in the same
district. Authorities blamed the occurrence of the transmittable
disease on the consumption of contaminated water.

Cholera outbreaks had often been reported in Mozambique's rural and
urban centers during the rainy season, which began in November 2007.
Health officials were encouraging residents to boil or treat their
water before drinking it or using it to wash vegetables and fruit.

Four people have died out of the 222 cases of cholera diagnosed in
Maputo city and province since the current outbreak began in October
2007, according to Mozambican Health Minister Ivo Garrido.

"If we do not remain on maximum alert, then the number of cases may
increase, and we may lose many more lives," warned Garrido. He
stressed that all people suffering from severe diarrhea and vomiting,
the main symptoms of cholera, should be taken urgently to the nearest
health post.

Garrido pointed out that in the 1st 10 years after Mozambican
independence in 1975, there were no cholera outbreaks, even though
living standards were lower than they are now. He attributed this
success to the post-independence health education campaigns, to the
regular days of voluntary cleaning of city neighborhoods, and to the
close links then between the Health Ministry and local communities.
But with the passage of time, the close ties between health staff and
communities declined, and increased population put huge stresses on
the city water and sanitation systems. There are now cases of urban
neighborhoods with one latrine for more than 20 households.

More cases of the recent cholera outbreak in Panyimur Sub-county of
Nebbi have been reported, with the number of victims now at 162. One
person had already been reported dead. The District Health Inspector,
Mr Anthony Andrionzi, said poor hygiene and sanitation is escalating
the spread of the deadly disease. He said most cases are emerging
from neighboring DR Congo, where there is lack of health facilities.

Andrionzi said that some cholera victims in Congo are fleeing into
the area in search of medical facilities. Mr Andrionzi said some of
the Congolese have been hiding their identities to access medication,
stretching the available resources in health centers. Most affected
parishes include Parwo and Pangere in Parombo, Uguta and Kituna in
Akworo and Nyakagei parish in Panyimur Subcounty.

According to the latest statistics, Dei centre has 59 cases; Panyimur
HC III has 22 cases, while Parombo and Akworo sub counties registered
81 cases. A fresh outbreak of the disease was 1st reported in Akworo,
Parombo and Panyimur, with 42 cases. As a result of the poor hygiene
and sanitation, there has been a sharp increase in cholera cases in
the last 3 weeks.

He said the lakeshores of Dei are the most affected areas, since
there is poor waste disposal in the area. At Dei center, 8 to 10
cases are reportedly registered daily.

The UN raised new concern Wednesday [28 Nov 2007] about a possible
cholera outbreak in Baghdad ahead of the rainy season, saying the
capital accounts for 79 percent of all new cases despite a national
decline.

The UN Children's Fund said 101 cases had been recorded in the
capital, most in the past 3 weeks, making it the source of 79 percent
of all new cases. It said no single source for the outbreak had been
identified, but the main Shiite enclave of Sadr City was among the
areas hardest hit.

"While national caseloads are declining, we are increasingly
concerned about a possible outbreak in Baghdad," UNICEF said in a
statement. "UNICEF is working with WHO to try to limit the spread in
the capital and treat the sick as Iraq's rainy season sets in."

The humanitarian organization said it was providing oral re-hydration
salts and water purification tablets for families, as well as jerry
cans at water distribution points. It also was transporting 180 000
liters (47 552 gallons) of safe water per day to Baghdad's most
affected districts, including schools and other institutions.

The outbreak has now spread to half of the country's 18 provinces.

"In general, Iraq's water and sanitation networks are in a critical
condition," UNICEF said, estimating that only one in 3 Iraqi children
can rely on a safe water source, particularly in Baghdad and southern
cities.

The city administration is currently investigating the cause of a
diarrhea outbreak in North Jakarta. Deputy Governor Prijanto said
Tuesday [28 Nov 2007] he suspected refill water as the main cause of
the outbreak, which had killed 7 people as of that morning.

As many as 86 infants and 8 adults were being treated at Koja
Hospital in North Jakarta for diarrhea on 27 Nov 2007, according to
City Health Agency deputy head Salimar Salim. The number of patients
at the hospital had increased from a total of 33 on 22 Nov 2007 to 43
and 81 on successive days and peaked on 26 Nov 2007 with 113
patients, including 105 babies and 8 adults. The outbreak has killed
6 infants and an adult. "The babies were admitted to the hospital too
late, and they were severely dehydrated," Salimar said.

Most of the patients being treated are from Rawa Badak and Lagoa
subdistricts in Koja district, and Tanjung Priok subdistrict in
Tanjung Priok district.

Salimar said other diarrhea patients were also being treated in a
number of hospitals, including North Jakarta Islam Hospital, Tanjung
Priok Port Hospital and Sulianti Saroso Hospital, all in North
Jakarta, as well as Tarakan Hospital in Central Jakarta. The number
of diarrhea patients at Tarakan Hospital was also high, she said,
reaching 36 as of 27 Nov 2007.

[6] Cholera - India: (Manipur)

Following detection of cases of cholera in 2 patients admitted to
Shija Hospital and Research Institute in Imphal, the matter has been
reported to the State Health Department. Interestingly, apart from
its rare occurrence in Manipur and negligible reports of new cases in
other parts of the country over the last many years, the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare stopped manufacturing the vaccine for
cholera 10 years ago.

According to information received by The Sangai Express from Shija
Hospital, after the recent flood in the State in October 2007, 2
patients, one from Yairipok Bamon Leikai and the other from Uripok
Haorungbam Leikai, suspected to be suffering from cholera were
admitted to the medical center for treatment on 15 Nov 2007. During
the course of laboratory testing of the blood samples of the
patients, their cases were confirmed as cholera. Both the patients
were cured and discharged from the hospital.

Along with carrying out health surveillance of the other family
members of the 2 patients to find out whether they too suffered from
similar symptoms of the disease which is spread mainly through
contaminated food and water, the authority of Shija Hospital has
reported the matter related to detection of cholera cases in the
State to the Health Department for taking up necessary preventive
measures.

Officials of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said the confirmed
the cases of bacillary dysentery in the central city of Taichung have
increased to 38. But they said the whole situation is under control
and denied the outbreak has spread to neighboring communities as
reported by the media. Most of the 38 cases were samples gathered
from pupils of Beitun Elementary School in Taichung before preventive
strategies were applied on 23 Nov 2007.

All 4 members of the same family were among the confirmed cases. Both
parents were on the faculty at the school, while their 2 children are
pupils in different grades. Officials said 2 children of one of the
cooks at the school, one studying at the same elementary school and
the other at a private senior high school, checked into the Chinese
Medical University Hospital last week. Although the hospital reported
that both showed symptoms of bacillary dysentery, the CDC will have
to make a further examination to clarify the cases in 3 or 4 days.

There were an additional 114 samples gathered from pupils on 24-25
Nov 2007 that have to be verified. But they stressed that no new
pupils have reported any signs related to bacillary dysentery so far,
suggesting the situation is now under control.
