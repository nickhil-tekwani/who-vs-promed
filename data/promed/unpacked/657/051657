[The Saudi MOH MERS-CoV webpages have been unavailable for the past several months, so regular updates on reports from their website have not been available. Updated information for the period 22 May 2018 through 6 Aug 2018 has just become available, and the following information comes from these updated pages. - Mod.MPP]

As of today, 6 Aug 2018, there have been 1864 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV infection reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) to the World Health Organization (WHO). [These figures include the newly available information added to the official WHO reported statistics available through 30 Jun 2018. I expect the EMRO MERS-CoV monthly update for July 2018 should be available in the coming days. - Mod.MPP].

During the period 1 Jun 2018 to 6 Aug 2018, there have been 20 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. A summary of information available on these newly confirmed cases follows:

[I would like to thank Michael Fraser for sending all the above information to us, thereby alerting us to a new URL for current reports on newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia.

Of the 20 newly confirmed cases since 1 Jun 2018, 4 (20 per cent) were secondary household contacts in Najran, a cluster reported by the Saudi MoH at the time [see MERS-CoV (20): Saudi Arabia (NJ) susp. family cluster 20180602.5835120; MERS-CoV (19): Saudi Arabia (NJ) household cluster conf. 20180531.5830431; and MERS-CoV (18): Saudi Arabia (NJ) susp. family cluster, RFI 20180530.5829389 for more details]. A total of 11 (55 per cent) of the 20 cases were associated with contact with camels, 4 (20 per cent) were classified as primary community acquired cases (presumably high-risk exposures not identified at the time of official report of confirmation of case), and one (5 per cent) case was a secondary hospital-acquired case. A total of 2 of the cases were noted to have died preceding the official report. Information on outcomes of the remaining 18 cases was not available.

So, although we have not had many reports on MERS-CoV activity in the past 2 months, there has been continued low-level "sporadic" transmission of the virus, primary associated with contact with camels, in Saudi Arabia with the occasional secondary case.
