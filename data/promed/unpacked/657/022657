So far - no new cases.
The affected area in Manitoba [this year, 2001 is essentially
contiguous with the affected area in Minnesota [USA. The region had
flooding right up to Christmas last year, with excessive rainfall
again this spring. For the last 3 weeks, we have had rain, high
humidity, and temperatures in the high 80's and low 90's. Coincidence
or contributing factors, who knows for sure. Another theory being
bantered about is that excessive fly and mosquito pressure is forcing
cattle to congregate in small areas, with constant milling around,
leading to soil disturbance and "surfacing" of anthrax spores.
In Manitoba last year, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
required that all anthrax vaccinations be administered by an
accredited veterinarian, and that all cattle vaccinated be identified
with a Health of Animals ear tag. After much lobbying, we convinced
CFIA to allow the vaccine to be sold over the counter through
veterinarians, for administration by the producer. Cattle do not have
to be tagged -- just a record of number of doses, farm identification,
and location. [Which is more precise than vaccine company records. -
Mod.MHJ This change has made for much better uptake of vaccination.
Producers were not at all keen on the extra expense of having a
veterinarian doing the vaccination.
We had about 20 000 head of cattle vaccinated in the area last year
[under the old CFIA regulations, and [more than 10 000 done again
this spring. Those numbers should be reflected in the reduction in
cases reported. CFIA vaccinated all the cattle on the infected farms
last year -- approx. 1000 head -- and boosted them this spring at no
charge. "Anthrax fever" was at a very high level last year, and
producers [in spite of the cost and inconvenience were intent on
vaccinating, even given the CFIA rules. They
complained vigorously about the cost and the logistics of getting of a
veterinarian to do the work, but their fear of the disease pushed them
to vaccinate anyway.
This spring, with thoughts of last summer's outbreak beginning to fade
in the collective memory of the area producers, the number of
vaccinated cattle was down, but still significant. Prior to 2000, no
cattle in Manitoba were vaccinated for anthrax. And the number would
have been considerably less than 10 000 had the vaccination protocol
not been changed.
By the way, the rough estimate of the cattle population in the SE
Manitoba area is 35 000 -- so there is still a significant population
at risk. However, the area is quite large, with distances of approx.
80-100 miles from the outbreak area to the other end of the region.

[If a vet has to do the vaccinating, this adds significantly to the
cost per cow and to the delay. With the Manitoban ranchers doing the
vaccinating now it does make it all much easier and gives them less
excuse for doing nothing. Also I suspect that there are psychological
benefits in having the rancher vaccinate his own stock. Thanks to Alan
for explaining what has been going on in Manitoba. I should point out
that part of the present problem in Minnesota is that under MN state
rules a veterinarian must vaccinate the cattle. As there is only one
large animal veterinarian in the affected area, he is being run off
the wheels on his pickup. - Mod.MHJ
