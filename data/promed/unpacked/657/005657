- This issue is based on data reported in week 51/2010 by 42 Member
States in the WHO European Region.
- Influenza activity remains low in most countries, but influenza
virus detections are increasing.
- 34 percent of sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, influenza B and influenza A(H3N2)
viruses are circulating in the Region.

Current situation - week 51/2010
--------------------------------
Increasing consultation rates were reported by 8 of the 32 countries
submitting data on influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory
infection (ARI), mostly in children aged 0-4 years. Of the 9 countries
presenting calculated baseline thresholds, France, Israel, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine reported clinical consultation rates above
their thresholds. Of the 31 countries reporting on the geographical
spread of influenza, most reported either no (7) or sporadic (12)
activity, while 6 reported local, 2 regional and 4 widespread
activity. The impact of influenza on health care systems was low in 17
of the 18 countries reporting on this indicator, with Israel reporting
moderate impact. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also
circulating, and 15 countries reported detections during week 51.

Virological situation - week 51/2010
-----------------------------------
Sentinel physicians collected 906 respiratory specimens, of which 309
(34 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 212 (69 percent) were
influenza A and 97 (31 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 165 were subtyped: 133 (81 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 32
(19 percent) as A(H3). For the 16 countries testing 20 or more
sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent to 80
percent, with a median of 28 percent (mean: 30 percent). Influenza
positivity was highest in Belgium (80 percent), Finland (61 percent),
and Israel (50 percent). Among specimens tested from non-sentinel
sources, 698 were positive for influenza: 433 (62 percent) influenza A
and 265 (38 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 339 were
subtyped: 320 (94 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 19 (6 percent) as
A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 182 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 97 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like;
25 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 6 were B/Florida/4/2006-
like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 54 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like
(B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). Based on the genetic characterization of 39
influenza viruses, 27 belonged to the pandemic A/California/7/2009
A(H1N1) clade; 3 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/
16/2009; 4 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by the A/Victoria/
208/2009 - A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 subgroup; 4 belonged to the B/
Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata) lineage; and one to the
B/Florida/ 4/2006 clade (Yamagata) lineage.

Cumulative virological update - weeks 40-51/2010
------------------------------------------------
A total of 3927 influenza virus detections have been reported, of
which 2541 (65 percent) were influenza A and 1386 (35 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 1580 have been subtyped: 1362
(86 percent) as pandemic influenza A(H1); 217 (14 percent) as
influenza A(H3); and one (under one percent) as influenza A(H1) [not
pandemic].

Comment
-------
Overall, influenza activity remains low in most countries of the WHO
European Region. In week 51/2010, 34 percent of sentinel samples
tested positive for influenza compared with 39 percent in the previous
week. This apparent drop in positivity probably relates to fewer
consultations and/or lower reporting of data owing to the Christmas
and New Year holidays. This interpretation is supported by the facts
that the number of countries reporting influenza detections and the
rates of positivity in sentinel samples observed in individual
countries are increasing. Pandemic A(H1N1) 2009, influenza type B, and
influenza A(H3) viruses have all been detected, and RSV [respiratory
syncytial virus] continues to circulate.

Report - week 52 (2010) [edited]

Influenza activity continues to increase across the UK. GP [general
practitioner] consultation rates are now above baseline levels in all
4 countries [England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland]. Influenza
A H1N1 (2009) and B are the predominant circulating viruses with few,
sporadic A (H3N2) viruses detected. The H1N1 (2009) virus strain is
virologically and epidemiologically similar to that seen during the
pandemic. The virus strains circulating are overall well matched to
the current influenza vaccine. The HPA expects to see continued
elevated influenza activity for several weeks.

In week 51 (ending 26 Dec 2010), the weekly ILI [influenza-like
illness] consultation rates increased across the UK. Weekly influenza
ILI consultation rates remain above baseline levels in England (124.4
per 100 000) and Wales (92.1 per 100 000). The rates have now
increased above the baseline in Scotland (58.4 per 100 000) and
Northern Ireland (99.4 per 100 000).

The weekly national proportion of NHS Direct cold/flu calls for week
51 has increased; however, the daily proportion has decreased slightly
to 10.4 percent on 28 Dec 2010, from a peak of 12.9 percent on 21 Dec
2010. The proportion of calls for fever in the 5-14 year age group
decreased from 21.6 percent to 16.8 percent, though this remains above
the baseline level of 9 percent. This suggests the possibility that we
may be approaching the peak of influenza activity.

Two acute respiratory disease outbreaks were reported in UK in week
51, one in a primary school and one in a prison. This brings the total
reported this season so far to 122. It should be noted that most
schools across the UK were on holiday in week 51.

126 of 189 (66.7 percent) specimens from patients with ILI presenting
to sentinel GPs in England in week 51 were reported as positive for
influenza. The proportion of specimens reported to DataMart (England)
as positive for influenza has increased to 43.2 percent (1711 of
3959). The proportion of samples positive for RSV [respiratory
syncytial virus] and rhinovirus is stable or decreasing.

Currently, the main circulating influenza strains are influenza A
(H1N1) and influenza B. From week 36, 39 deaths associated with
influenza infection have been reported. The majority of fatal cases
reported were unimmunised. By week 50, the proportion of people in
England aged over 65 years who had received the 2010/11 influenza
vaccine was 68.5 percent. For those in a risk group aged under 65 it
was 43.0 percent.

On 21 Dec 2010, the UK Department of Health issued a letter to NHS
staff in England to inform them that the use of antiviral drugs is
recommended for treatment of influenza in high risk patients. In
Europe, most countries are starting to report early influenza
activity. In the USA and Canada, overall influenza activity has
increased.

[These data put the current situation in Europe in perspective and may
help to dispel some of the more alarmist speculations currently in
circulation. The influenza outbreak in Europe is following the normal
seasonal pattern, and the seasonal vaccine seems well-matched to the
current epidemic strains. However, the level of protective vaccination
in the population of some countries is less than desirable - Mod.CP]
