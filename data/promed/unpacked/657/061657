As of 12 Aug 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been notified of 539 cases of cyclospora infection from the following 19 states: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York (including New York City), Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Most of the illness onset dates have ranged from mid-June through mid-July 2013. At least 32 people are reported to have been hospitalized in 5 states.

On 12 Aug 2013, FDA released information regarding the trace back investigation of Taylor Farms de Mexico salad mix and the company's decision to suspend "production and shipment of any salad mix, leafy green, or salad mix components from its operations in Mexico to the United States."

It is not yet clear whether the cases from all of the states are part of the same outbreak. Additional cases are currently under investigation and will be included on this page as confirmed. Cases in this outbreak are defined as laboratory-confirmed cyclospora infection in a person with onset of illness since June 2013 and no history of travel outside of the United States or Canada during the 14 days prior to onset of illness.

[Our last report on the outbreak from 9 Aug 2013 reported 504 cases. This report included 539 cases and the latest CDC update (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/outbreaks/investigation-2013.html) reports that there are now 548 cases in 19 states. It is still unclear whether the exact source has been identified. Contaminated products from one manufacturer have been withdrawn from the retailers, and if this was the only source, the outbreak should end. - Mod.EP
