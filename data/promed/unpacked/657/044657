The Philippines Department of Agriculture's (DA) Veterinary Quarantine
Services (VQS) has officially confirmed that their examination of 358 blood
smears from imported Australian feeder cattle found that 26 samples
contained the blood parasite. A report submitted by Dr. Castor Leo A
Ejercito, chief of the Veterinary Quarantine Office, to DA Regional
Director Dennis B. Araullo dated March 1st, revealed that the 26 samples
were found positive for the blood parasite _Anaplasma_ sp. despite being
"certified free" in their health certificates from the exporting country.
Dr. Ejercito further said that the "result is a clear violation of our
import permit requirements and a clear scientific evidence against the
importation of Australian feeder cattle".
In the conclusion of his report, the chief of the Veterinary Quarantine
Office in General Santos asked: "If the Australian government is so strict
against our fruits, why can't we do the same to their cattle?" At the same
time, Philippine livestock firms that have been importing cattle from
Australia for years, have linked the discovery with the Australian
government's delaying tactics regarding Philippine fruit exports to
Australia. Among them are the Lorenzo Plantation Company, Inc., with
offices in Lanang, Davao City, and East Asia Integrated Livestock, Inc.,
with offices at the Manila Bank building, Ayala Avenue, Makati City.
Copies of their communications to their Australian trading counterparts
were presented to the DA regional office here and read in part as follows:
"Our country has been importing feeder as well as breeder cattle from
Australia since 1986. Since then, these importations have accumulated a
huge agricultural imbalance of trade between Australia and the Philippines.
We therefore enjoin your company to make a representations with the
Australian government to ease up its hard stance against our mango, bananas
and pineapple exports to your country. We have to work together for a fair
and freer globalization of our agricultural products."

[Anaplasmosis is a disease of domestic and wild ungulates such as sheep,
cattle, deer, elk, bighorn sheep, etc., and is caused by _Anaplasma
rickettsia_. The rickettsia are transmitted by blood feeding arthropods
(biting flies and ticks). In the western U.S., transmission is through the
bite of ticks of the genus _Dermacentor_. In Australia, the stomoxys fly
has been implicated in the transmission of _Anaplama_ spp. to cattle.
_Anaplasma marginale_ belongs to Genogroup II of the same genogroup as the
human granulocytic ehrlichia transmitted by the _Ixodes scapularis_
(_dammini_ - deer tick), _Ehrlichia equi_ (disease of horses transmitted by
the _Ixodes_ spp.) and _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ (disease of sheep,
cattle, deer transmitted by the _Ixodes ricinus_). It is a disease of
cattle affecting the erythrocytes producing a severe anemia in the infected
cattle. It is transmitted by the _Boophilus_ spp, _Rhipicephalus_ spp. and
other tick species. MPP, - Mod.TG
