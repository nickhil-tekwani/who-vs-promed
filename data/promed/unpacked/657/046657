At least 19 villagers fell ill of suspected chikungunya fever in the villages of San Juan and San Vicente in Santo Domingo town in Albay in November [2012], the provincial health office (PHO) reported.

Chikungunya fever is similar to dengue but is milder in form and without bleeding. Symptoms include on-and-off fever, rashes, and muscle and body pains.

The 19 cases brought to at least 100 the number of people who had been stricken by this other forms of mosquito-borne disease toward the last quarter of this year [2012], records from the PHO showed.

Dr. Luis Mendoza, Albay provincial health officer, said he and a team from the provincial epidemiology office went to Santo Domingo on 22 Dec [2012] to validate reports that 18 villagers from Barangay San Juan and one villager in San Vicente got sick of chikungunya virus [infections]. Mendoza said they brought along medicines to treat the patients who fell ill with chikungunya fever. The team noted that those who fell ill showed influenza-like symptoms with rashes and joint pains on the extremities, clinical symptoms of chikungunya [virus infections].

Mendoza said the suspected chikungunya cases occurred in November 2012, and the victims' ages range from 4-67 years old. Mendoza said most of the suspected victims did not seek medical consultation because they thought they only had flu.

The villages of San Juan and San Vicente are 3 km [2 miles] away from the town proper.

Albay Governor Joey Salceda on Monday [24 Dec 2012] directed the provincial health office to closely coordinate with the Santo Domingo municipal health office and involve the community in implementing measures to stop the spread of the disease by eliminating breeding places for mosquitoes.

The PHO epidemiology surveillance team have started gathering [specimens for]laboratory examination from the patients, and these will be sent to the Department of Health in Bicol for analysis, he said.

In September 2012, chikunyunga fever also afflicted at least 83 residents of Barangay San Ramon on Batan Island, Rapu-Rapu, Albay. The Rapu-Rapu municipal health office reported that cases of the mosquito-borne disease were initially reported as 70 cases but surged to 83 by the end of September 2012.

[This is the 2nd report of a chikungunya virus outbreak in Albay province within the past 3 months. The earlier report indicated that the outbreak was spreading, and the above report supports that observation. Chikungunya virus outbreaks are not new to the Philippines, having caused sporadic outbreaks in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985-1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120929.1315954), mainly in the center and south areas of the country. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
