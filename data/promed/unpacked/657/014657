Rat fever [leptospirosis] cases are rising. Between January and September this year [2020], 173 rat fever cases were reported. A total of 85 of them were from Udupi taluk, 54 from Kundapur taluk and 34 from Karkala taluk. Until the end of October [2020], 203 such cases had been detected.

In January [2020] 559 people were tested, and 24 showed symptoms of this fever. As many as 26 people were infected in February, 23 more in March, 5 in May, 11 in June, 32 in July and 25 in August. The highest number of cases was reported in September [2020], with a total of 34 cases. Among them, 17 were from Udupi taluk with 11 cases from Kundapur and 6 from Karkala. Fewer cases [have been reported this year] than in 2019, when 344 cases were diagnosed, and in 2018 [330].

This fever normally spreads through the urine and stools of the rats. [Rodents (mainly rats), as well as dogs, pigs, and cattle, shed _Leptospira interrogans_ in their urine, not feces. - Mod.ML] Usually, farmers who visit the fields for harvesting paddy crops get infected. During the 4 months of lockdown, cases were minimal.

The district reported 111 rat fever cases from January [2020] until now. A death also occurred due to rat fever in August [2020]. As people avoided going out because of the coronavirus pandemic, cases seem to have fallen sharply. Moreover, when the ASHA workers visited houses to create awareness about coronavirus, they also talked about dengue and rat fever. District surveillance officer, Dr Jagadish K, feels that this would have resulted in a steep fall in the cases.

Precautions
-----------
Water should be boiled before consumption. People should not take baths in standing water as excreta and urine of animals might have contaminated that water. Care should be taken to ensure that food items, fruits, vegetables, etc are not accessible to rats. All holes, cracks, etc in houses, godowns [a warehouse or other storage place], drains, fields, etc should be sealed to destroy the rats, and carcasses of rats should be properly disposed of. It is better if rubber boots are worn when visiting farms, cattle sheds, agricultural fields, etc. If someone works in slush or standing water, they should take a bath in hot water afterwards.

Dr Sudhir Chandra Sooda, Udupi district health officer, says that fever occurs when viruses [leptospirosis is caused by a bacterium, _Leptospira interrogans_, not a virus. - Mod.ML] from the discharges of rats enter the human body. Rat fever should be treated at its initial stage. Enough stock of medicines for rat fever is available in all the primary health centres, he says. Udupi district has not witnessed any death due to this disease, he said.

[Udupi district, with a population of almost 1.2 million residents, in the Karnataka state of India; Udupi, Kundapur and Karkala are 3 northern of the 7 taluks (an administrative division) of Udupi district. A map of Karnataka showing the location of Udupi district can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Location-map-of-Udupi-district_fig1_340130333.

"Rat fever", the term used in the news report above to describe the outbreak in Udupi district, presumably refers to leptospirosis, not rat bite fever. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates. The microorganism can be found in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine from chronically infected animals. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary tract infection with leptospira. In these animals, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospira enter the body through open sores or wounds in the skin, or through mucous membranes following exposure to contaminated water. Outbreaks frequently follow large rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Leptospirosis is also an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals -- for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made with confidence without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available. - Mod.ML
