Trichinellosis in Russia
------------------------
5 people the village Novaya Bryan, Buryatiya Republic have developed
trichinellosis after they ate dog meat. One of them, according to
physicians, is in severe condition. It was established that of the 13 young
people who ate the dog meat, 5 are confirmed to have trichinellosis, and
the rest have been hospitalized.

[Buryatiya is located on the shores of Lake Baikal. Over 80 percent of the
republic's territory is located in the mountainous region. The republic's
economy depends on important agricultural and commercial products including
wheat, vegetables, potatoes, timber, leather, and textiles. Fishing,
hunting, fur farming, mining, stock raising and food processing are also
important economic generators. - Mod.NR]
[It seems unlikely that people would deliberately eat dog meat, but the
meat could illegally have been used in food like sausages. Meat sold as if
from other species has been reported previously by ProMED in Poland and
Turkey, and the previous outbreak of trichinella in Siberia from meat from
a badger and bear suggest that meat from unusual sources may find its way
into the diet in Russia. - Mod.EP]
