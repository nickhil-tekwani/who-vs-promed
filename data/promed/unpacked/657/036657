Wildlife officials say elk have tested positive for brucellosis for the 3rd straight year in northern Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains. Officials with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department say 2 elk tested positive for the disease, as was the case in 2012 and 2013.

The Casper Star-Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1GR4f6v) that past cases have come from samples submitted by hunters in hunt area 40. This year [2014], 1 was in elk hunt area 40 and the other was close by on the south end of elk hunt area 39.

Brucellosis has not been documented in livestock in the areas. The disease can cause pregnant livestock to prematurely abort their young.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts by the US Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection since 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.
