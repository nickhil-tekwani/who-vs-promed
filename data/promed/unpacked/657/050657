A cattle outbreak has been confirmed as of 5 Nov 2010 in the Rural
Municipality of Armstrong [URL above shows location]. Further details are
awaited.

[This outbreak rings a bell. There was a tight cluster of 22 farms affected
in 2007 in the Interlake region of Manitoba involving the following rural
municipalities: Armstrong, Rockwood and St Andrews. This followed the
installation of power lines by Manitoba Hydro. See ProMED-mail posting
20070823.2758.

This outbreak is significantly later than we normally see outbreaks in
Canada, which suggests it might be associated with contaminated hay or
silage and not from grazing. Clarification is awaited from our Canadian
colleagues. - Mod.MHJ]
