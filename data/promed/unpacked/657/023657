First Report of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _lycopersici_ Race 3 on
Tomato
in Tennessee
----------------------------
S. C. Bost, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, University
of
Tennessee, 5201 Marchant Drive, Nashville 37211. Plant Dis. 85:802,
2001;
published on-line as D-2001-0427-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 5
Mar
2001.
In the summer of 2000, tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) plants
in several commercial fields in southeastern and eastern Tennessee
exhibited symptoms of Fusarium wilt. All cultivars on which symptoms
were observed are classified as resistant to races 1 and 2 of the
causal fungus, _Fusarium oxysporum_ Schlechtend.: Fr. f. sp.
_lycopersici_ (Sacc.) W.C. Snyder & H.N. Hansen. Race 3 has been
reported from several areas (1), but not from Tennessee, a major
producer of fresh market tomatoes [in the United States].
_F. oxysporum_ was consistently isolated from discolored vascular
tissue on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Pathogenicity and race
determination tests for 6 isolates representing 3 counties were
conducted by inoculating cultivars susceptible to races 1, 2, and 3
(Rutgers); resistant to race 1 (Bradley, Roma VF); resistant to races
1 and 2 (Conquest, Florida 47); or resistant to races 1, 2, and 3
(Floralina).
Inoculum suspensions were obtained from one-week-old cultures grown on
PDA. Seedlings were grown in commercial potting mix for 3 weeks. The
roots were rinsed and submerged for 30 s in inoculum suspensions (1 ×
10 7 conidia per ml). Seedlings were then transplanted into potting
mix in metal flats. ... Natural light conditions provided a 12h
photoperiod, and day and night temperatures averaged 29 and 17°C,
respectively. Within 4 weeks after inoculation, all isolates caused
symptoms of Fusarium wilt in all cultivars except Floralina,
indicating that the isolates were race 3. The pathogen was reisolated
from the discolored vascular tissue of diseased plants.
Among the cultivars most severely affected by all 6 isolates was
Conquest, which is resistant to _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_radicis-lycopersici_, the cause of Fusarium crown and root rot [of
tomato].

[According to R. P. Larkin & D. P. Fravel, USDA, ARS, Biocontrol of
Plant Diseases Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, use of resistant cultivars
provides partial control, but development of new races of the pathogen
confound disease management. Pre-plant soil fumigation with methyl
bromide (MBr) is an option, but use of MBr for disease control is
supposed to cease this year (2001). Considerable research is being
directed at biological control, using soil microorganisms, especially
those derived from plant roots, as antagonists.

various fungal and bacterial biocontrol organisms for control of
Fusarium wilt of tomato. Plant Disease 82:1022-1028. - Mod.DH]

wilt Race 3 of tomato in new areas in 2001 - Mod.JW]
