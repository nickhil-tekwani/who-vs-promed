Italy Announces 2nd Suspected Case of Mad Cow Disease
------------------------------------------------------
ROME: Compulsory tests have detected a second suspected case of mad cow
disease in Italy, Health Minister Umberto Veronesi announced Wednesday.
Veronesi told the Lower House agricultural committee that the animal
concerned came from a herd near Mantua in the northern region of Lombardy,
was very old, and had died in its stall. He said that initial tests on the
animal had been positive for mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), and further definitive tests would be carried out on
its brain tissue. He said the results of these tests would be made known in
a couple of days. If the tests confirm that the cow was infected, it would
be the second official BSE case in Italy since 1994.
On 16 Jan 2001, test results confirmed Italy's first BSE case. The cow was
6 years old and also came from a farm in Lombardy. A few days later, on 24
Jan 2001, it was announced that a second suspected case had been detected.
However, further tests on the 4-year-old cow raised near Verona proved
negative. This time, the minister sought to ease consumer alarm over mad
cow disease, which has sent beef sales plummeting a reported 90 percent in
some areas. "BSE is an absolutely minimal health problem for humans and
there is no cause for alarm," said Veronesi. He said that some 20 000 BSE
tests had been carried out in Italy since the beginning of January and only
one case had emerged, leading him to conclude that "Italy is a country
which is to a large extent immune from the disease."

Third Case of BSE Confirmed in Italy
--------------------------------------
ROME: Definitive tests on a 5-year-old cow's brain tissue Thursday
confirmed Italy's third official case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), the Italian health ministry said. The animal, which showed no sign
of disease when it was slaughtered, came from a farm in Verolanuova between
Brescia and Cremona, in northern Italy, not far from where the first mad
cow case was discovered on 16 Jan 2001.
Health Minister Umberto Veronesi said that, when set against the 30 000
tests carried out, 3 cases of BSE was no cause for alarm. "On the basis of
these figures, Italy is among those countries considered to have a low risk
of BSE," he said.
Another suspected case of BSE was found in the northeastern province of
Udine Wednesday. Definitive tests are now being carried out and a final
result is expected in the next few days.
In compliance with European Union regulations introduced on 1 Jan 2001, all
cows over 30 months old are tested for BSE before they enter the food
chain. Despite the emergence of positive tests, Veronesi has consistently
said that meat reaching Italian shops is safe for consumption. Despite his
assurances, butchers report sales of beef down by about 60 percent.

MADRID: The Spanish government confirmed 7 new cases of mad cow disease on
Wednesday, bringing to 24 the total number of cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) identified since November. Of the infected cows, 4
belonged to herds in Galicia, in northwestern Spain. The fifth cow died 22
Jan 2001 on the island of Minorca, part of the Balearic Islands, a
Mediterranean archipelago. The last 2 cases were detected in Friesian cows,
in the northwestern province of Palencia and the northern Asturias region.
All 7 cows were diagnosed at a specialized national laboratory in Zaragoza,
said Ana Maria Pastor, undersecretary in Spain's ministry of the
presidency, who is in charge of the country's campaign to fight BSE.
Spain has performed more than 25 000 tests for mad cow disease since
November 2000, when its first case was confirmed. The number of positive
tests has been slightly less than one per 1000, government officials said.
There are a total of some 6 million cattle in Spain, according to figures
compiled in 1998 by the agriculture ministry.

Of the 4 newly confirmed cases of BSE in Galicia, 2 were registered in
Coruna, in the localities of Zas and Touro, another in the municipality of
Villalba, and the fourth in San Amaro, Orense. All of the cows were
detected in the slaughter house and at the time of their sacrifice were
between 5 and 7 years of age. These 4 new positive cases raises the number
of cows affected with BSE in Galicia to 17. Galicia is the community with
the most cases registered thus far. The second location is Castilla and
Leon with 6 cases following confirmation of another case from Zaragoza on
Wednesday. In total, the number of cattle affected by the disease in the
country has increased to 29.
In spite of the observation that the number of cases continues to increase,
the Minister of Agriculture, Miguel Arias Canete has stated that it cannot
be called an epidemic.
