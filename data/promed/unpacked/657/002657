Katherine residents are right to fear the potentially lethal mud bug melioidosis, says Centre for Disease Control director Vicki Krause.

"Absolutely, it is in our environment and we cannot escape it, we have to know who is at risk and how to protect ourselves," Dr Krause said. "This is a serious disease and every year there are deaths."

In 2018, 2 residents of the Katherine region have so far contracted melioidosis, a mud borne disease which thrives in wet season conditions.

Up to 26 people in the NT have fallen victim to the infection since October 2017. Dr Krause said Top End residents and visitors need to protect themselves from the potentially deadly soil-borne disease, as cases have increased with heavy rains.

"The most common way to contract it is when you have cuts and sores then expose them to groundwater or soil," Dr Krause said. "But it can also be inhaled if it's stirred up by whipping winds. The most common way people are infected is when they are walking through flooded areas or working outside," she said. "If you are using a high pressured hose you should wear a mask because the soil can be aerosolized."

An average of 60 people contract the disease each year in the NT. Dr Krause said usually 3 or 4 of them are from Katherine. Cases have been hospitalized with some very seriously ill, requiring intensive care. The disease can lead to blood poisoning, and death for 10 and 15 per cent of Territory patients.

Melioidosis, a disease caused by the tropical bacteria known as Burkholderia pseudomallei, is commonly known as gardener's disease. The disease can cause a variety of symptoms and signs but the most common presentation is that of pneumonia which means a person develops unexplained fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other presentations include skin ulcers or sores that fail to heal, abscesses, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms and occasionally neurological problems such as headache and confusion.

People most as risk of developing melioidosis have an underlying condition that impairs the immune system. These conditions include:
- diabetes
- heavy alcohol intake
- cancer and the regimens to treat cancer
- advanced age
- kidney and lung disease

Top End residents and visitors should take the following precautions:
- Wear covered footwear when outdoors
- Wear gloves while working in the garden/soil-based environment
- Wash and cuts and sore thoroughly and cover them with waterproof dressings
-Wear face masks while using high pressure hoses around soil
- Stay indoors during heavy wind and rain
- Refrain from overuse of alcohol
- Seek medical attention early.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is a herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
