Hard to believe we're still worried about this so late in the year, but the Tennessee State Veterinarian is warning horse owners to protect their animals against mosquito-borne equine encephalitis.

Dr Charlie Hatcher says horses are also vulnerable to West Nile virus. Cases of both have been seen this year [2016] in West Tennessee.

What should you watch for? Hatcher says be on the lookout for "Lethargy...wobbling and circling, and in some severe cases a horse could get down and be unable to rise."

Hatcher advises working with your local vet to keep your horses protected and eliminate any standing water on your property.

A predicted hard frost this weekend 19-20 Nov 2016], the 1st of the season, could put an end to the mosquito threat for the year.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [14 Nov 2016] that Florida animal health officials have confirmed a new case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"On [10 Nov 2016], a new EEE case was confirmed in Marion County, Florida," an EDCC statement said. "The 15-year-old Paint mare was vaccinated in years prior but had not been vaccinated recently and had no recent travel history. Clinical signs began on [28 Oct 2016] and the mare is currently recovering."

This is Marion County's 2nd EEE case and Florida's 23rd case for 2016.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring two to three days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the two-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

The present extended summer weather has also extended the mosquito season far into the fall (autumn), beyond the dates when we would have normally expected the 1st frosts, especially in Tennessee.

It is not necessarily abnormal to see this in Florida this time of year.

Clearly these cases are a warning to all horse owners regarding vaccination. The EEE immunity wanes the fastest. It is recommended to revaccinate every 3 or at the longest 4 months. This is especially true in the southern states where mosquito season may be very prolonged, such as in Florida and other Gulf Coast States. - Mod.TG
