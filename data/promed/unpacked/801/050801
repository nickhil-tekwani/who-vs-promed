The Veterinary Institute has today [25 May 2016] informed the FSA [Norwegian Food Safety Authority] of the presence of prions, causing chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a moose from Selbu in Sør-Trøndelag [county]. The disease, known in cervids in North America, was demonstrated by the National Veterinary Institute for the 1st time in Europe in a Norwegian reindeer in April this year [2016]. The new case in a moose in Selbu proves there may be other cases of this disease in European deer.

The moose was observed in a run down condition and showed a lack of flight reaction. It was killed by the municipal wildlife department and necropsied at the National Veterinary Institute in Trondheim. The animal was a young, pregnant, and emaciated cow, said pathologist Magne Haugum who conducted the necropsy.

During the necropsy brain samples were taken as part of the prion survey conducted by the National Veterinary Institute in Oslo.

The animal was positive for CWD prion by 2 different tests, ELISA and Western blot, said Thorfinn Moldal and Øyvor Kolbjørnsen, the 2 scientists are responsible for investigations by the National Veterinary Institute.

CWD is a well-known disease in cervids in North America where it mainly affects mule deer, white tailed deer, and North American stag. The disease has also been detected in a small number North American elk. In Europe, the disease was detected for the 1st time in a young Norwegian reindeer doe in the Northern Mountains caribou range in April this year (2016).

The case of this cow from Selbu represents the 2nd proven case of CWD in cervids in Europe. There is nothing to suggest that CWD can be passed from deer to livestock or humans.

The Veterinary Institute will, in cooperation with the FSA and the Environment Directorate, provide more data about the prevalence of CWD in both caribou and moose in Norway. Investigations will also be conducted in deer populations. It is important that people who observe sick deer contact the municipal wildlife management, the FSA, or the Norwegian Nature Inspectorate for sampling for laboratory examination at the National Veterinary Institute.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI, 2016) has reported a further case of prion disease, this time detected in free ranging wild elk (_Alces alces_), in the Sør-Trøndelag region of Norway [see map at http://tinyurl.com/zc7t4n6]. The adult (pregnant) female (cow) showed signs of poor body condition and lack of response to stimuli. It was culled and samples tested by both ELISA and Western blot tests. Norway has put in place additional surveillance and will also implement a ban on the trade in live cervids. The 2 cases are approximately 450 km [about 230 mi] apart with no known interaction between their home ranges and herds.

Situation assessment
--------------------
The North American moose (_A. alces_) is also known as the elk in Europe. It is susceptible to CWD and cases have been found across the moose/elk populations in both the USA and Canada. _A. alces_ is different to the North American elk (_Cervus canadensis_), which is also susceptible to CWD.

In Europe, the elk is a solitary animal, coming together primarily in the mating season, although young stay with their mothers for several months until the next offspring is born. There is a wide level of variation in their movement behaviour with some undertaking very long range migrations, and others being more sedentary. These movements can be categorised as migration, dispersal, nomadism or residence. In Scandinavia, seasonal migration is more likely in northerly populations (regions north of 66 deg N) than those in the southern regions (regions between 56 deg N and 66 deg N) and mean distances decline from about 100 km [62 mi] to 5 km [3 mi]. Seasonal migration can also change with time, depending on the environmental changes, climate, or urbanisation. A recent study into the population genetics of _A. alces_ in Europe suggests there are genetically distinct populations, with the Scandinavian cluster showing low genetic diversity and separate to the other European populations (Niedziałkowska et al. 2016).

No alternations were made to the figure. Map of the study area: Distribution of the 16 demes and 6 moose groups indicated by the analysis of microsatellite DNA (Niedziałkowska et al. 2016). The genetic sub-structuring of the _A. alces_ population in Scandinavia is probably due to geographic barriers, such as the Scandes mountain range, which separates Sweden and Norway. This supports the understanding that there is a lower risk of direct disease transmission to other populations of cervids, even of the same species which are separated by geographic boundaries. However, if there has been widespread environmental contamination over time from a common source of prion, then the risk to other populations will be more difficult to assess.

Conclusion
----------
This 2nd case of presumed CWD in another European population of cervids is concerning and suggests one of several theories -- mixing between the elk and reindeer leading to disease spread from a single point of introduction in one population to the other; 2 separate incursions of disease into the 2 regions and populations or; widespread environmental contamination present for at least several months (considering the incubation period). Further surveillance to be carried out by the Norwegian Authorities will shed more light on the veracity of these theories.

The risk of incursion was previously considered to be very low, and when more information is available, we will re-assess. What is unknown at present is what the distribution of CWD is in deer in Scandinavia or other parts of Europe: whether it represents a wider problem in farmed reindeer, in other cervid species and other regions or if this is restricted to the wild cervids in Southern Norway.

We have recently published an updated qualitative risk assessment on the entry pathways for CWD to [Great Britain], focussing on North America. This follows reports of imported white tailed deer urine which may be used by hunters as lures in Europe and the assessment considers the potential for such products, whether processed or not, for carrying CWD infectious agents. Other potential pathways include contaminated footwear, hunting equipment, or pet food made from venison.

For more information please see our qualitative risk assessments available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/animal-diseases-international-monitoring or see http://www.bds.org.uk.

We will report again when more information is available.

[It was only a matter time before this disease slipped the bounds of cervids in the USA. One does have to wonder how it got into reindeer, but global trade of animals and products can move diseases. And now we have it in a moose. Likely, if they keep looking they will find it in other cervids there.

The question is: how did the disease get to Norway? Or is this a spontaneous case of chronic wasting disease? In cattle there is a spontaneous form, so it would stand to reason there is spontaneous version for the cervids.

We look forward to the investigation regarding this situation.

"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible neurological disease of deer and elk that produces small lesions in brains of infected animals. It is characterized by loss of body condition, behavioral abnormalities and death. CWD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), and is similar to mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie in sheep.

Infectious agents of CWD are neither bacteria nor viruses, but are hypothesized to be prions. Prions are infectious proteins without associated nucleic acids.

Although CWD is a contagious fatal disease among deer and elk, research suggests that humans, cattle, and other domestic livestock are resistant to natural transmission. While the possibility of human infection remains a concern, it is important to note there have been no verified cases of humans contracting CWD.

CWD can reduce the growth and size of wild deer and elk populations in areas where the prevalence is high, and is of increasing concern for wildlife managers across North America. The disease was long thought to be limited in the wild to a relatively small endemic area in northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming, and southwestern Nebraska, but has recently been found in several new areas across the North American continent. The disease also has been diagnosed in commercial game farms in several states and provinces." ...and now in Norway.
