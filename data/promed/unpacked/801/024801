1st report of _Pantoea stewartii_ in Argentina
----------------------------------------------
During the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 growing seasons, symptoms of bacterial leaf blight were observed in maize (_Zea mays_) crops in the province of Cordoba, Argentina. In this province, the disease incidence reached around 54 per cent. Leaf samples were collected from 10 symptomatic maize plants, grown in 15 fields covering a representative geographical area. Molecular (PCR) and pathogenicity tests confirmed the presence of _Pantoea stewartii_ (EPPO A2 List) in diseased maize plants.

This is the 1st time that _P. stewartii_ is reported from Argentina.

[Stewart's wilt of maize is caused by the bacterium _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. (syn. _Erwinia stewartii_). The pathogen is indigenous to the Americas but has been introduced to other parts of the world with maize seed. Symptoms vary on different host varieties but may include leaf stripes, wilting, necrosis of tassels, and spots on husks of cobs. Plants may be killed at the seedling stage, infection later in the growth cycle can lead to serious yield losses. Many grass hosts are susceptible and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

The bacterium is transmitted by and overwinters in the corn flea beetle (_Chaetocnema pulicaria_), but can also be seed transmitted at a low rate. The insect vector is mostly responsible for local spread, while infected seed is considered the main route of long distance spread and therefore a quarantine risk. Disease management may include insecticides to reduce vector populations, use of certified disease-free seed and use of resistant maize cultivars.
