Biosecurity Queensland has confirmed another deadly case of anthrax in southern Queensland, bringing the total number of deaths since March last year [2017] to at least 153. Tests conducted on 2 steers from a Dirranbandi property on [5 Jul 2018] confirmed the animals had died from the bacteria. The steers were from a neighbouring property to an earlier anthrax case this year [2018] and is the 4th deadly incident in the St George-Dirranbandi area in the past 2 years.

In March 2017, 120 head of cattle died from anthrax on a St George property following soil disturbance caused by grading. [Soil mechanical levelling. - Mod.MHJ] From October to January another 30 sporadic deaths occurred on a neighbouring property while in May, one beast died from the bacteria near Dirranbandi. Prior to the recent cases, the last anthrax incident in Queensland occurred in 2002.

Biosecurity Queensland Chief Veterinary Officer Allison Crook said the latest incident indicated anthrax spores may be present in and around the area and locally grazing livestock, particularly unvaccinated stock, were at risk. "Biosecurity Queensland worked with a producer and private veterinary practitioner to assist in the management of the case of anthrax," she said. "This included vaccinating cattle on the affected property, conducting tracing and identifying other premises or consignments at risk."

Graziers are encouraged to attend an anthrax webinar hosted by Biosecurity Queensland and FutureBeef on [14 Aug 2018] at 12.30 pm. Visit Biosecurity Queensland's Facebook page to register.

[This report adds little that we didn't know already but the Queensland Biosecurity folk have gone through their records to determine how many livestock have died from anthrax, 153, and not as thought originally from toxic pimelea plants. If there are historic livestock anthrax burial sites, they have discovered the hard way in Australia that leveling a field, to facilitate better irrigation and grazing for example, can result in spreading spores from those old graves onto the soil surface. To get around this risk the Russians found it was wise to grow forage crops for a couple of years to allow any spores to die before allowing grazing. - Mod.MHJ
