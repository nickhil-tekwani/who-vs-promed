Regarding the recent outbreak in Maryland, most cases of botulism in
the USA involve infants (see graph:

chronology of notable outbreaks in the USA has been abstracted from
Gideon [primary references available on request].
Notable outbreaks:
1947 - An outbreak of botulism in Alaska was related to consumption
of Beluga whale flipper. This was Alaska's 1st recorded botulism outbreak.
1971 - An outbreak in the New York region was associated with
commercially canned vichyssoise.
1973 - 7 cases (0 fatal) of type B botulism in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania were associated with canned peppers in oil.
1974 - 3 cases (2 fatal) of type B botulism among family members were
