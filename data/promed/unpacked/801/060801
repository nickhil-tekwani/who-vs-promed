["Bovine babesiosis is a tickborne, parasitic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in cattle. It is the most important arthropod-borne disease of cattle worldwide. The most prevalent species, _Babesia bovis_ and _B. bigemina_, are found throughout most tropical and subtropical regions. The economic losses from these 2 organisms can be considerable, particularly in developing countries.

"Babesiosis results from infection by protozoa in the genus _Babesia_ (family Babesiidae, order Piroplasmida). The 3 species found most often in cattle are _Babesia bovis_, _B. bigemina_ and _B. divergens_. Additional species that can infect cattle include _B. major_, _B. ovata_, _B. occultans_ and _B. jakimovi_.

"Bovine babesiosis can be found wherever the tick vectors exist, but it is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. _B. bovis_ and _B. bigemina_ are particularly important in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, parts of southern Europe, and Australia. Although _B. bovis_ is usually found in the same general geographic area as _B. bigemina_, slightly different groups of ticks spread these 2 species, and some differences in their distribution can be seen.

"_B. divergens_ is an important parasite in parts of Europe including the United Kingdom, Spain and northern Europe. Surveys have found evidence for this species throughout Europe, and it may also occur in North Africa. Its vector, _I. ricinus_, can survive from northern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. However, because this tick requires 80 per cent humidity, it can be found only in some microenvironments such as the base of vegetation in forests, rough hill scrub, and damp low-lying land. _B. major_ can be found in parts of Europe, north west Africa and Asia, as well as China. _B. ovata_ has been described in Japan, China and other parts of eastern Asia. _B. occultans_ has been reported in Africa, and _B. jakimovi_ occurs in Siberia.

"Although some species of _Babesia_ such as _B. microti_ can affect healthy people, cattle parasites seem to cause disease only in people who are immunocompromised. _B. divergens_ causes serious disease in humans who have had splenectomies,"
