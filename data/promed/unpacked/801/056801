A 14 year old female mule in Johnston county, North Carolina, has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). The disease was discovered during a routine blood test by the North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, in Raleigh, and confirmed by the USDA [United States Department of Agriculture]. This is the 1st new case of EIA documented in North Carolina since 2005.

"The Johnston County facility is under a quarantine order that restricts movement of equines until further testing is completed by the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services," said Michael Neault, DVM, director of livestock and animal health programs. "Because the disease is not curable, the affected mule has been euthanized. The remaining equines at the facility were tested and were negative for EIA. They will be observed and retested in 60 days, and we are monitoring neighboring facilities for the disease."

Equine infectious anemia is an incurable disease most commonly spread between equids -- such as horses, mules, and donkeys -- in close proximity to biting flies and ticks. Clinical signs of EIA include fever, weakness, weight loss, anemia, edema, and death; however, not all affected equids show clinical signs. All infected equids, including those that are asymptomatic, are carriers of the disease.

There are typically a small number of EIA cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the United States by regular testing before traveling across state lines, exhibition, and other events. A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA.

There is no approved vaccine for EIA in the United States. To help prevent infection, owners can:
- use sterile, disposable needles and syringes, one per horse, for all vaccines and medications;
- test all horses for EIA every year, and at the time they enter a new premises;
- keep stables and other facilities sanitary. Regularly clean stalls and properly dispose of manure away from horse stabling areas;
- implement approved insect controls, such as insecticides and good drainage of standing water, to minimize fly presence;
- only participate in events that require evidence of negative Coggins test for every equine entering the event to prevent disease introduction and spread;
- isolate new horses on a property until they are tested for EIA;
- never mix infected and healthy animals. Do not breed horses infected with EIA; and
- follow state laws covering EIA.

[How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little value, but why no vaccine?

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal."

Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.

Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine 20150915.3645562).
