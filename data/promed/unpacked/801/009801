Two separate cases of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection have been confirmed in Ireland by the Department of Agriculture.

The cases were found in aborted bovine foetuses, one submitted from Co. Cork and one from Co. Laois.

These are the 1st virus positive cases that the Department knows to have occurred in Ireland since the Spring of 2013.

A resurgence of SBV was anticipated because of recent reports of clinical cases in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK.

According to the Department, the main impact of SBV infection is congenital malformation of calves and lambs that are exposed to the virus at a particular stage of pregnancy.

Therefore it is usually a low impact infection except in those herds and flocks which use synchronised breeding methods and are then exposed to infection during that particular stage of pregnancy, it said.

The virus is transmitted by biting midges so there is unlikely to be any further spread of the virus over the next few months as biting midges are only active between April and December in Ireland.

While a vaccine is available it is only effective when used to prevent infection occurring during pregnancy (i.e. when midges are actively spreading the virus).

The Department is undertaking a serological survey of cattle to establish the extent of exposure to the virus across the country as the initial indications are that exposure is more likely to have occurred in southern and eastern counties than in the north and west as previously in 2012/2013.

To assist in these national surveillance efforts the Department is also encouraging veterinarians and farmers to submit suspected cases (foetuses or newborn calves and lambs exhibiting congenital abnormalities) to their nearest Regional Veterinary Laboratory for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis -- the Department will provide this service free of charge.

[Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an orthobunyavirus discovered in European livestock in late 2011 for the 1st time, causes a vectorborne disease in cattle and sheep. Its main effects are abortions, premature or stillbirth, and severe fetal malformation when cows and ewes are infected during pregnancy; see references.

Following reemergence of SBV in the Netherlands and Germany in late 2014, and its apparent absence in Europe during 2015, reemergence of this teratogenic culicoides-borne virus was reported from the Netherlands and Germany in October 2016. It seems that at the same time or shortly thereafter, SBV renewed its circulation in Wales and the west of England. Though several studies in Western Europe have dealt with SBV's overwintering, the main conclusion being its low impact if the target population has not regained susceptibility (loss of immunity gained during previous exposure), the dynamics of the overwintering mechanism are still in need of research.

SBV may cause some abortions; its main effect is upon embryos surviving infection during certain stages of their development. The damage, if caused, becomes obvious when such foeti conclude their gestation period.

According to accumulated information, it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans.
