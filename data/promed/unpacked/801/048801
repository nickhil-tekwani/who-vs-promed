BELGIUM BLAMES COW DEATHS ON PLASTER IN COW FEED
------------------------------------------------
Belgium authorities said Monday the most likely cause of a series of
unexplained cow deaths at dairy farms was an abnormally high level of
plaster in sugar beet pulp feed from 1 factory.
The story reports the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement plaster is
used in the normal manufacture of pressed feed from sugar beet pulp, but
was found in high concentrations in several batches of feed from the plant
at Moerbeke in northern Belgium. The statement added the management of the
factory, which belongs to privately-owned Belgian sugar company
Suikergroep, had advised farmers not to use pulp produced on 4 sets of
dates amounting to 31 days between 6 October and 10 December 1999.
No one at Suikergroep was, the story says, immediately available for comment.

BELGIUM SAYS BOTULISM CAUSED COW DEATHS AT ONE FARM
---------------------------------------------------
In a related story, Belgium Agriculture Minister Jaak Gabriels said on
Tuesday the death of 8 cows at a dairy farm at Zwalm in southern Belgium
were caused by botulism and did not appear linked to deaths at 2 other
farms, adding, "I can confirm this was an isolated problem. There has never
been any danger to public health because the farm was shut down immediately."
The story notes the Zwalm farm was closed last month after 8 cows died with
symptoms including bloody diarrhea, lung disorders and signs of paralysis.
Gabriels was cited as saying botulism could have been caused by faulty
fermentation of sugar beet pulp feed, though animal-based botulism strains
had yet to be ruled out.
