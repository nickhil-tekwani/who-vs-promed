State lifts last equine piroplasmosis (EP) quarantine
-----------------------------------------------------
Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles H
Bronson said Monday [23 Feb 2009] that the last facility to have had
horses infected with equine piroplasmosis [EP] is now off the state's
quarantine list.

The outbreak was first detected 13 Aug 2008, when an ill horse was
admitted to a veterinary hospital in south Florida and was diagnosed
with EP. Soon, 25 facilities were quarantined by the state. None of
the facilities were in the Ocala area. During the EP investigation,
201 horses were tested for the disease. In all, 20 horses on 7
locations were determined to have been infected.

"I believe a quick and thorough response to the outbreak by our
Division of Animal Industry helped to keep it relatively contained,"
Bronson said in a press release. "I am pleased and relieved that we
have been able to eradicate it in a short period of time."

Equine piroplasmosis is a blood-borne parasitic disease of horses.
The country was considered to be free of EP since 1988 until the
outbreak in Florida. The disease is primarily transmitted to horses
by ticks or contaminated needles.

[Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia
caballi_ or _B. equi_ (phylum Apicomplexa). The 2 organisms may
infect an animal concurrently. Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne
protozoal infection of horses.

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable
and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range
from acute fever, inappetence, and malaise, to anemia and jaundice,
sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The
disease may be fatal in up to 20 percent of previously unexposed
animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics
of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The parasites that cause equine piroplasmosis are endemic in many tropical and
subtropical regions including parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
Central and South America, the Caribbean and Europe. To a lesser
extent, they may be found in temperate areas. T. equi is thought to
have a wider distribution than B. caballi. Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, Japan and some other countries are free of these parasites.
Equine piroplasmosis was eradicated from the United States by the
1980s, and it is considered to be an exotic disease.

The incubation period for _B. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and
infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to
30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often
nonspecific. In rare peracute cases, animals may be found dead or
dying. More often, piroplasmosis presents as an acute infection, with
a fever, inappetence, malaise, labored breathing, congestion of the
mucus membranes, and small, dry feces. Anemia, jaundice,
hemoglobinuria, sweating, petechial hemorrhages on the conjunctiva, a
swollen abdomen, and posterior weakness or swaying may also be seen.
Subacute cases may have a fever (sometimes intermittent),
inappetence, malaise, weight loss, signs of mild colic, and mild
edema of the distal limbs. The mucus membranes can be pink, pale
pink, or yellow, and may have petechiae or ecchymoses. In chronic
cases, common symptoms include mild inappetence, poor exercise
tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen
(palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually
weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and
anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The
spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial
hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and
subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in
the lungs and signs of pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine
infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura
hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the
organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_
merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _B. equi_
merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross."
Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very
difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films
can sometimes be helpful.

Because _Babesia_ organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers,
serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests
include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can
distinguish between _B. equi_ and _B. cabali_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and
the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal
with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free
vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and _Babesia_ identified
either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to
a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the
spread of tick-borne infections. However, preventing the transfer of
blood from one animal to another is vital.
