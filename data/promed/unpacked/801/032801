47 children affected by a strange disease in Vargas
-------------
The cause of death of students at Chichiriviche de la Costa is not as
yet known. There are currently 12 children who remain hospitalized.

"It all began with a very high fever that came and went. We took him
to an outpatient clinic where they gave medications but the symptoms
returned. After several days he wanted to return to school, and the
next day he began a sharp pain in his abdomen. Then 15 days passed
and we took him to La Guaira it was late. After the taxi ride to
the Naval Hospital and the Hospitalito Catia la Mar, in search of a
pediatrician, he was finally admitted in the Periferico de Pariata.
There, the boy began to feel a strong pressure in his chest, and on
Friday night told me I can not breathe grandmother, and then he
closed his eye. So we lost him, but nobody can explain why."

This is what the grandmother of the 1st child that died, a 9 year-old
boy, in the town of Chichiriviche de la Costa, of a disease that the
epidemiologists of the region have not as yet succeeded in
identifying. Three days later a 7 year old boy died with similar symptoms.

The strange disease also affected another 45 children, students at
the Romulo Monasterios school. In addition, the same symptoms have
been reported by 2 teachers and 2 cooks working at the same campus.
All [of the cases] have been referred to hospitals in the region
which have laboratory and imaging services, to permit thorough
studies [testing] on each case. Three of the children, with ages
between 7 and 10 years old, have been admitted to the intensive care
unit at the Perex Carreno and Jose Maria Vargas de La Guaira
hospitals with guarded clinical prognoses.

Yenkis Higuera, physician at the rural outpatient clinic in
Chichiriviche de la Costa, explained that during the 1st week when he
noted the recurrence of the febrile symptoms, he reported this news
to the Epidemiology Directorate of the Region. The 2nd week there
were more cases, and in the 3rd week the situation of the 1st
patients worsened, and all of this was reported progressively to the
authorities. Finally, in the 4th week, the 1st death was
reported. And from then on, officials from all health agencies have
been pending [more information/diagnoses]

No autopsy was performed on the 1st boy that died [the 9-year old] to
verify which organ systems were involved. Put with the death of the
2nd child [the 7 year old], his parents permitted biopsies of the
liver, heart and vessels to determine the cause of death.

More samples were asked for. Representatives of the Vargas Ministry
of Health, present in the zone, said that they still do not have a
certain diagnosis on the type of virus or bacteria which has led to
the epidemiologic alert.

The Rafael Rangel National Institute of Hygiene asked the
epidemiology team of Vargas for more specimens. According to Jose
Querales, president of the Institute, part of the material received
[by the institute] is being processed, the other [part] was cent to
the Pathology Institute at the UCV [Central University of
Venezuela]. The expert did not want to advance hypotheses or the
[expected] date of results.

Chichiriviche Quarantine
-----------------------
The deaths of 2 children and the involvement of more than 50 people
in Chichiriviche de la Costa, in Vargas State, has the health
authorities keeping vigil of an epidemic they suspect may be Chagas disease.

A strange epidemic that is affecting the population of Costa
Chichiriviche de la Costa, in Vargas state, has claimed 2 dead and
unleashed a mystery about the origin of the disease.

While this town on the west coast of Vargas [state] always has death
knocking at the door, now the landscape has another: a strange
epidemic affecting 47 children and 3 adults provoking, with a
resultant 2 tragic deaths

The disease, which so far is inexplicable, was detected last [5 Mar
2009] when several children and adults in the state school
Monasterios Romulus started to feel a fever, malaise, body weakness
and constant vomiting.

But 22 days later-on [27 Mar 2009] the disease was accompanied by the
death of [a 9 year old male] and on [30 Mar 2009], the death of [a 7
year old male].

The admission of these children to the Periferico de Pariata [a
health facility] stunned the medical residents who were unable to
identify the causes of the illness. So the doctors referred the case
to the Regional Epidemiology Directorate in search of answers.

It was this Wednesday [1 Apr 2009] when a group of epidemiologists
from the Ministry of Health and Environmental Quality were brought by
helicopter to Chichiriviche de la Costa to collect samples to
determine the condition that, for now, is affecting 54 children and 4
adults in the area .

Although there is still no official statement on the results of the
investigation, Dr. Luis Montiel, an epidemiologist from MinSalud and
Ali Mato, from water and sanitation, promised that as soon as they
have information on the disease, they will disseminate this
information at the national level.

However, for the former Health Minister Rafael Orihuela, this aspect
of the controversy for several centuries has been resolved with the
diagnosis of bubonic plague [?referring to the implimentation of
quarantine of the affected individuals or geographic area surrounding
the cases].

"The respiratory forms are much more serious and there have been
recent epidemics in India. So the debate about the virus of Duncan
[?] is speculative. In this case, we are probably facing an outbreak
of acute Chagas' disease linked to eating solid foods or beverages
contaminated with _Trypanosoma cruzi_.

For the former minister and former researcher at the Institute of
Tropical Medicine and the UCV [Central University of Venezuela], in
Venezuela there is a zoonotic wild plague focus for the past 100
years, that is restricted to some areas of woodland on the boundaries
between the states of Miranda, Aragua and Vargas.

"Although the monitoring of this area is constant, perhaps at the
present there has been a decline [in monitoring]. So that the species
to monitor in order to probably contain an oubreak of urban plague in
the country is the _rattus norvegicus_.

Pending the response issued today [2 Apr 2009], the Regional
Epidemiology Directorate, the Rafael Rangel National Institute of
Hygiene and the Pathological Institute of the UCV, a quarantine of
the inhabitants of Chichiriviche de la Costa was apparently applied
because the epidemic has spread to the parish Catia la Mar and other
areas in Vargas state.

Duncan's Syndrome or Chagas disease?

The questions about the disease have caused various speculations.
Some preliminary reports from doctors in the area attributed to the
Duncan's syndrome, a disease that affects families whose parents were
related (siblings, cousins or other relationship). It is know that
this type is altered in the formation of the X chromosomes. [Duncan's
syndrome is an X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP). It is a
rare immunodeficiency disease that is characterized by a predilection
for fatal or near-fatal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -- induced
infectious mononucleosis in childhood, subsequent
hypogammaglobulinemia, and a markedly increased risk of lymphoma or
other lymphoproliferative diseases (from
<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/203780-overview>).

On having presented the syndrome and having been affected in turn by
a cytomegalovirus - one forms(strain) of Herpes virus (Human
herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5))-, one presents with symptoms like high fever,
stomach pain, constant vomiting among others.

However, other experts say that it could be an outbreak of the Black
Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th century, killing an estimated
25 million people, only in Europe, Africa and Asia. Nearly one third
of the continent's population.

This epidemic, which is believed was an outbreak of bubonic plague,
is a terrible disease that has spread in pandemic form several times
throughout history. Plague is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia
pestis_ which is spread by fleas with the help of the black rat
(_Rattus rattus_), which is known today as a field rat. Its symptoms
of pulmonary plague are also know and are characterized by fever,
headache and body weakness.

Or it could be Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, a tropical
parasitic disease usually chronic, caused by a protozoan flagellate:
_Trypanosoma cruzi_. It is characterized by high fever,
lymphadenopathy, enlarged liver and spleen and occasionally
myocarditis or meningoencephalitis with a serious prognosis.

Although some symptoms overlap with each other, they have not yet
determined which of them is what has gradually weakened the
inhabitants of Chichiriviche.

[The above reports seem to suggest there may well be another outbreak
of foodborne Chagas disease (trypanosomiasis) in Venezuela. The
symptom complex described in the 2nd newswire is consistent with
those seen with foodborne trypanosomiasis -- especially with the
mention in the 1st newswire that 2 of the cooks of the school were
among the list of affected cases. While there is some speculation
that the outbreak may be related to _yersinia pestis_ (plague), by
now (after several weeks of the outbreak), one might have expected
laboratory results confirming the presence of _yersinia pestis_ involvement.

The 1st reported outbreak of foodborne transmission of
trypanosomiasis was reported in Santa Catarina Brazil in 2005 (see
prior ProMED-mail postings listed below). This outbreak was
associated with ingestion of sugar cane juice that was found to be
contaminated with crushed triatomid, the vector of trypanosomiasis in
Brazil. Since reporting of outbreaks of foodborne transmitted
trypanosomiasis began, there have been a total of 6 documented
outbreaks associated with contaminated juices -- 4 in Brazil
(involving 4 states in the country), one in Venezuela, and one in
Colombia. The prior outbreak in Venezuela involved 128 cases at a
school in metropolitan Caracas, and was associated with contaminated
fruit juice.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this
outbreak along with results of ongoing investigations.

Chichiriviche is one of the beaches in Vargas state. The state used
to be one of the municipalities of the Federal District, several
kilometers from the capital of Caracas. For the interactive
