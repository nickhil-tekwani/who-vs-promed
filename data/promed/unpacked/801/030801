The sight of lumps on her cow's skin worries [M.N.], a livestock farmer and resident of Seretunin in Baringo Central [map at <tinyurl.com/bddf76na>].

What [M.N.] is anxious about is a viral disease commonly known as Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), which affects cattle.

"I lost my calf. At first I did not understand what was happening to the calf; it was only 6 months old. It had some nasal discharge and was hyper-salivating," [M.N.] told the Sunday Standard yesterday [Sat 4 Dec 2021].

On Friday [3 Dec 2021], Ngetich's 2 cows showed the same symptoms after the death of the calf, which prompted her to seek help from a local veterinarian who diagnosed the cows with LSD.

Farmers in the area are now on high alert due to the LSD outbreak, which has already claimed the lives of several livestock.

Lumpy skin disease is an infectious disease in cattle caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, also known as Neethling virus. The disease is characterised by fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes and multiple nodules on the skin and mucous membranes.

Currently, the disease has been reported in Baringo North and Central constituencies where some cattle have reportedly died.

Chief Livestock Officer Winnie Bore said that the disease is trans-boundary, which makes it difficult to control due to the nature of transmission. She urged farmers to invest in the treatment of livestock, instead of depending on government support. The livestock officer said the department had advised farmers that they would quarantine and vaccinate animals. She, however, noted the government would not offer comprehensive vaccination because of its ability to cross borders. "We do joint vaccination with other counties, for example, West Pokot, Samburu, Turkana and Laikipia. It is an exercise in futility if we do not cooperate," said Bore.

The officer said the department was faced with vaccine supply challenges. "We rely on the Kenya Veterinary Vaccine Production Institute which may take up to one year before they disburse the vaccine."

She added, "We are expecting a vaccine in 2 weeks, but of importance is that farmers make sure they vaccinate their animals as we improve on disease surveillance."

A bulletin published on the National Drought Management Authority's website in October [2021] showed the county had reported livestock diseases, including East Coast fever and foot and mouth disease, in Kampi Wakulima, Ngoswe and Kapkuikui. LSD was reported in Kabarnet, Kapropita Ward, Tartar, Sosion, Kituro and Sesia.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is endemic in Africa. First seen in Zambia in 1929, it spread into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa the same year, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957 LSD entered Kenya; by 1974 it had spread into Sudan and west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and the Cameroon, with reported mortality rates of 20% in affected cattle. The occurrence of LSD north of the Sahara desert and outside the African continent was confirmed for the first time in Egypt in 1988, followed, later, by spread within the Middle East. Between 2012 and 2021, LSD spread into south-east Europe, the Balkans, the Caucasus and further throughout Asia.

For decades, LSD was considered to be mainly transmitted mechanically by biting arthropods. Recently, non-vector-borne transmission has been studied in Russia. Contact transmission mitigates the factor of seasonality, which is linked to insect activity and widens the possibilities for spread regardless of the presence of biting insects (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198617/pdf/41598_2020_Article_64029.pdf).

It has become clear that no efficient or reliable control program for LSD currently exists, which does not involve the use of live attenuated vaccines. To prevent or reduce losses, Kenya's cattle, in particular dairy cattle and European breeds and their crosses, should be kept immunized/vaccinated in any county potentially exposed to infection, disregarding the vaccination coverage elsewhere.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
