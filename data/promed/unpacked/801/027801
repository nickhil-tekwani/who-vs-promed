For the 1st time in many years there has been an outbreak of measles in the Chelyabinsk Region. The focus of the outbreak, which has spread throughout the Urals, was the city of Tomsk. The 1st cases of measles occurred in the Roma population. The local authorities immediately instituted measures to prevent spread of this dangerous viral disease. Hospitals and children's clinics received supplementary measles vaccination, and unvaccinated individuals received one dose of vaccine initially.

The senior physician of the Chelyabinsk Region organised immunisation of all medical workers, teachers, and school employees under the age of 35. According to officials, 58 cases of measles had been confirmed so far. In Chelyabinsk city, 2 cases of nosocomial infection have occurred in medical staff attending sick children. According to an official statement: "At this moment no cases of measles had been notified in the Satka district and there is no immediate cause for alarm."

All medical staff up to the age of 35 years have been vaccinated. There are 15 108 people aged between 18 and 35 years of age in the population. A total of 14 524 of this age group have received 2 doses of measles vaccine, consequently 96.1 per cent of the population are considered to be protected. There is concern, however, that some parents are not permitting their children to be vaccinated; probably about 31 children are in this category.

[In the Chelyabinsk Region, as elsewhere, deficiencies in measles vaccination coverage are being attributed to the migrant Roma population. However, the numbers of measles cases are small in relation to the non-migrant populations of these regions.

The Chelyabinsk (Region) is a federal subject (an Oblast) of Russia in the Ural Mountains region, on the border of Europe and Asia. Its administrative center is the city of Chelyabinsk. Population: 3 476 217 (2010 Census). Maps showing the location of the Chelyabinsk Region can be accessed at http://russiatrek.org/chelyabinsk-oblast and http://healthmap.org/r/60ZE. - Mod.CP]

Measles outbreak recorded in Yamal for the 1st time in 20 years
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Interfax-Ural News Agency has reported that an outbreak of measles virus infection has occurred in the city of Gubkin (Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District), according to the Yamal Epidemiology Service. The Yamal Epidemiology Service announced that a family of unvaccinated individuals had arrived in the city from Dagestan and, according to a preliminary investigation, are thought to be the source of the outbreak.

So far 15 cases of measles, including both children and adults, have been diagnosed with the disease. It is considered likely that additional cases will be diagnosed in the immediate future.

The Yamal Epidemiology Service stated that there had been no measles cases in the district since 1990.

Measles has broken out in the city of Gubkinsky [Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District]. The disease was diagnosed in 17 patients who sought treatment for fever and the characteristic rash. The diagnoses were confirmed by the Novosibirsk Diagnostic Center. The majority of the confirmed cases are children. The infection occurred in preschool children attending 2 day-care centers. The situation was discussed at a special meeting of the city's Anti-Epidemic Commission.

Four of the cases were registered in a neighbouring community. Measles is an airborne infection. On occasion there have been several hundred patients under treatment in the Gubkinsky hospital. The staff and children attending 2 kindergartens run by the city hospital have been vaccinated already. On Friday [22 Nov 2013], it is planned to administer a further 500 does of vaccine. Overall the level of immunization against measles in Gubkinsky is satisfactory and approaching 97 per cent. A meeting has been convened to discuss additional purchases of vaccine and the possibility of increasing the number of beds in the hospital isolation ward, and to install improved containment facilities.

Laboratory confirmed cases of measles (England): Jul to Sep 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------
Data presented here are for the 3rd quarter of 2013 (July to September). Cases include those confirmed by oral fluid testing (IgM antibody tests and/or PCR) at the Virus Reference Department, Colindale, and national routine laboratory reports. Analyses are by date of onset. Regional breakdown figures relate to Government Office Regions rather than regional health authorities.

Only 103 cases of measles were confirmed in England with onset dates in the 3rd quarter of 2013 compared with 609 cases in the previous quarter. As previously reported, the region with the highest number of cases this quarter was South West (45 cases), although cases were confirmed in most regions of England. An additional 4 infections were confirmed by oral fluid testing of cases from Wales.

The majority (71/103, 69 per cent) of the English measles cases this quarter were in children and adolescents: 5 (5 per cent) under one year; 20 (19 per cent) aged 1 to 4 years; 18 (17 per cent) aged 5 to 9 year, 17 (17 per cent) aged 10 to 14 years; 11 (11 per cent) aged 15 to 18 years. The remaining 32 cases (31 per cent) were adults aged 19 to 56 years. Seven per cent (7/103 cases) of cases reported receiving 1 (4 cases) or 2 (3 cases) doses of a measles-containing vaccine.

Three cases reported a history of recent travel; one each to Pakistan and China, and one further case believed to have acquired measles through travel, possibly linked to contact within airports rather than any particular country visited.

Within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), 2 countries are experiencing large measles outbreaks; the Dutch authorities have reported 1540 measles cases since May 2013, although the actual number of cases is estimated to be much higher, and in Germany the number of reported measles cases this year [2013] is nearly 10 times higher than the total cases in 2012. In the year up to July 2013, only 11/30 EU/EEA countries have met the elimination target of less than one case of measles per million of population, and in the EU neighbouring countries, measles outbreaks are on-going in the Russian federation, Turkey and Georgia.

Confirmed measles cases in southern Alberta reach 32
----------------------------------------------------
Parents are being urged to review their children's immunization records, as more and more children are diagnosed with the unwelcome red dots. The medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services [AHS] in the Calgary area tells 660News, not one case of measles has been reported here since the outbreak began a month ago [October 2013]. Still, Dr Judy Macdonald is urging moms and dads to check on their children's vaccination records to make sure they did receive 2 doses of the vaccine before they started school. People who were born in 1970 or later are also urged to make sure they have been properly immunized.

Macdonald says according to government records it appears about 90 per cent of the population has been properly inoculated, which still leaves about 10 per cent not protected. And with winter fast approaching, AHS is also reminding people to take advantage of flu vaccination clinics, which are operating across the province.

[In ProMED-mail Measles update (46), part 5, it was reported that: "As of Wednesday morning [14 Nov 2013], there are 28 cases of measles confirmed in the province, and Alberta Health Services (AHS) is turning its attention to 2 new communities in hopes of containing the outbreak. Vaccination clinics have been set up in 2 Hills and Lacombe for children aged 6 months to 17 years old and for those aged 4-17 who have not had a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine.

"The chief medical officer of AHS told Global News that the outbreak is expected to spread from the South Zone communities of Coaldale and Fort Macleod to other low immunization communities. 'We know that in the south, there are a number of communities that have ties -- and they're low immunisation rates -- and they have ties with other areas of the province,' explained Dr Martin Lavoie. 'Depending on how low those rates are, how close the ties are, we're expecting a spread from the south. It's just a matter of time to spread from there to those other low immunization communities.'"

Curiously, the above press report announces that the number of measles cases in South Alberta has risen to 32, and simultaneously announces that: "The medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services in the Calgary area tells 660News, that not one case of measles has been reported here since the outbreak began a month ago." Clarification of the situation would be appreciated.
