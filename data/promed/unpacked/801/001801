This is to inform you that we now have confirmed cases of anthrax in 8
counties on 56 premises. The number of animals that have succumbed to
anthrax this summer is still unknown, but I would estimate it is over 200
head at this time. Species affected to date are: cattle, horses, bison,
farmed cervidae, sheep, and llamas.
Since conditions will likely continue to be conducive for the next few
weeks, we are strongly suggesting vaccination in the risk areas. The
vaccine so far has proven to be very safe and efficacious.
In the future, producers in areas known to have had cases of anthrax can
add this vaccine to their protocols on a routine basis.
This situation is not unique to ND, since Minnesota, South Dakota, Texas,
and Manitoba have also reported cases of anthrax this season.
Anthrax cases have historically been reported in ND. The number of cases
is higher than average years. Excessive rainfall early in the summer seems
to have spurred the rash of cases that we're experiencing in ND.

Yes, we have had a time of it thus far. SE North Dakota is hit hard -- on
more than 50 premises -- most of them along the James and Cheyenne River
drainages. This is an old hot spot but has never had a blow-up like this
that I can find.
With most of the susceptible population being vaccinated, I expect the
incidence to drop a bit. More recently it has appeared in northeast ND and
northwest MN. I expect it to be less severe in these areas since recent
outbreaks have caused many of those folks to vaccinate. We have had cattle,
bison, sheep, elk, horses, and deer killed.
Big picture -- I think the heavy June rains and severe flooding have caused
this epizootic on the eastern end of the state (Valley City to Fargo) from
Manitoba to South Dakota. The worst area is near a town called Lisbon south
of Valley City (32 different premises affected so far).

[I am very grateful to Dr Keller for her informed account of what is
happening in North Dakota; Dr Dyer's estimate is not dissimilar. It is a
fraught time there. I have been speaking with Dr. Keller frequently and had
requested this report which gives us all a sound idea of the situation.
One Russian blogger claimed: "Russian Intelligence Analysts are reporting
today that a vast area of the United States Midwestern Regions have been
flooded with Scientists, Military and Intelligence Organizations attempting
to stop a massive Anthrax Epidemic that to date has killed (estimated) over
15 000 animals" -- whom I am sorry to disappoint.
The locals are managing it all on their own and efficiently. But the
reality in North Dakota has been difficult for all concerned including the
ranchers, who have been burning the carcasses, which is never easy
especially if you have never done it before. The vets are constantly out
vaccinating clients' herds.
There is a major regional effort in hand to control this multi-state
epidemic. The problem in the southeast of ND is that the frequency of
anthrax had fallen off over the years and many ranchers had given up
vaccinating. Thus a large number of livestock were susceptible when it
broke out. Where it had been hiding is unknown, but with a significant wild
cervid population, it could have been ticking over in the background. -
