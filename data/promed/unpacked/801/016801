A total of 14 members of a children's club were taken to hospital on 9 Aug 2022 during a visit to a swimming pool in Sammu, Chiba Prefecture, in a suspected case of mass food poisoning. The local fire department received an emergency call from a children's club member at around 4 pm that day, saying, "There are more than 10 people here throwing up." According to the fire department, 14 children aged between 7 and 13 were transported to the hospital. None of them was in serious condition.

Chiba Prefectural Police's Sammu police station explained that about 50 children were on the children's club visit to Hasunuma Water Garden in the city. At least 19 members began to complain that they felt sick about an hour after they ate lunch at around noon. They had eaten rice balls that had been made that morning. The rice balls were apparently not chilled after being made, leading police to suspect food poisoning.

[With the association to unrefrigerated rice balls, _Bacillus cereus_ toxin illness is highly suspected, although the short incubation of an hour suggests _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterotoxin might be the culprit. The following is a discussion of _B. cereus_ foodborne disease.

_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks, there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness.

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus, moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usual mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JM, et al. Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med. 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604).

Abstract
--------
"_Bacillus cereus_ is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. From these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. The emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. Similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish _Bacillus thuringiensis_ and _Bacillus anthracis_ from _B. cereus_, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. The diarrhoeal syndrome of _B. cereus_ is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. Three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrhoeal disease: haemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K. Hbl and Nhe are homologous 3-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin A found in _Escherichia coli_. This review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by _B. cereus_. The disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation."
