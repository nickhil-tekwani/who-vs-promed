Traces of a disease found in fish, which has been described as "serious" and "highly contagious," has been discovered at a public lake in Blackwater, Camberley.

Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) officers found koi herpesvirus (KHV) in fish at The Lakeside, a small lake surrounded by residential streets just off the A30/London Road.

The outbreak could mean all fish in the lake must be culled, unless a 4-year monitoring programme is implemented.

According to Gov.UK's science blog, "KHV is a viral disease of common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and all its varieties, such as mirror, leather, ghost, koi etc.

"The disease occurs at higher water temperatures (over 16 C [60 F]), is highly contagious, and may cause up to 100% mortality. Infected fish shed the virus in faeces, urine, and mucus from the gills and skin. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact, and also via angling equipment and contaminated water."

It added that "there is no risk to public health."

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact, and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment.

As with other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressor triggers it. More information on KHD can be found in OIE's Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf. - Mod.PMB
