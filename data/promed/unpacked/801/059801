On Tuesday [1 Jul 2014], the Alachua County [Florida] Health Department issued a mosquito-borne illness advisory after lab tests showed Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus in a 2nd horse.

The horse was in the Newnan's Lake area and had to be euthanized, said Anthony Dennis, the department's director of Environmental Health.

On Monday [30 Jun 2014], Health Department officials urged residents to take increased precautions against mosquito bites and steps to limit mosquito breeding conditions after a horse in the southeastern county tested positive for EEE. That horse survived.

A 2nd equine case of EEE is a trigger for issuing an advisory, Dennis said.

"The message is exactly the same," he said. "Our surveillance system is showing disease transmission of triple E, so have a heightened awareness and take precautions."

In June [2014], 2 sentinel chickens in an area of the northeastern county also tested positive for EEE.

The department recommends residents drain standing water from garbage cans, house gutters, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots and other outdoor containers that make for prime mosquito breeding conditions. Old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans and broken appliances should be drained of standing water or, preferably, discarded.

To protect against bites, the department recommends that residents wear shoes, socks, long pants and long sleeves and use an insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535.

Most people infected with EEE will show no signs of illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe cases may involve sudden headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. It is possible that the illness may progress from there to disorientation, seizures or coma, according to the CDC.

[There is a very effective vaccine against Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) for horses. It should be given annually, and in high-risk areas, the Eastern and Gulf Coast areas, it should be given every 4-6 months for maximum protection. It is always sad when animal dies needlessly. Vaccinate your animals.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.
