The Zamfara State Government has confirmed the death of 3 students at the Government Arabic Boarding Secondary School, Maradun, following the outbreak of a mysterious disease.

The state Commissioner for Education, Mukhtar Lugga, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Gusau on [Wed 15 Feb 2017] that 2 other students were admitted at the General Hospital, Maradun.

According to him, the disease manifested last [Mon 13 Feb 2017] and the state government had mobilized a team of medical experts to control the situation.

"We established 2 emergency management centers, one in the school while the other one is at the Maradun General Hospital."

"We also established new hostels in the school to decongest the students to avoid further spread of the disease."

"We are waiting for the medical team to finish its work so as to know the cause of the outbreak, we cannot conclude now."

"But we are suspecting the outbreak to be gastroenteritis," he said.

[Any information on these cases would be appreciated. There is no discussion of symptoms but since gastroenteritis is suspected, the symptoms probably include watery diarrhea and vomiting, but may also have included stomach pain, cramping, fever, nausea, and headache. Because of diarrhea and vomiting, children can quickly become dehydrated.

Gastroenteritis can be caused by contact with someone who has the virus, contaminated food or water, unwashed hands after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper.

The most common cause of gastroenteritis is viral, the main types being rotavirus and norovirus. Rotavirus is the world's most common cause of diarrhea in infants and young children. Norovirus is the most common cause of serious gastroenteritis and also foodborne disease outbreaks in the U.S.

Although not as common, bacteria such as _E. coli_ and salmonella can also trigger gastroenteritis. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry. [webMD excerted, edited]. - Mod.LK
