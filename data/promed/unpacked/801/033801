Regarding the ProMED report of 25 Sep 2005 Eastern equine encephalitis,
cervids - USA (MI) 20050925.2825, there seems to be some misunderstanding and
lack of understanding of the natural cycle and history of Eastern equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV).
2 errors are in the report that a Michigan veterinarian stated that "The
disease typically is transmitted from mosquitoes to songbirds, which aren't
affected by it." First of all, it is the virus, not the disease, that is
transmitted; the virus may or may not cause disease in an infected
vertebrate. Second, and more importantly, just about any vertebrate may
succumb to infection with EEEV.
This very pathogenic virus does not cause fatal infection in every vertebrate
host (how many viruses do?) but it is highly pathogenic for birds, songbirds
(passerines, I assume) in particular. Many years ago Roy Chamberlain and Dan
Sudia, at CDC, infected birds of 86 species and at least some of each species
died.
Birds of certain species develop higher titer and longer-lasting EEEV viremias
than do birds of other species, so that when mosquitoes subsequently feed on
them, more mosquitoes become infected with the virus. Mosquito transmission
of EEEV can occur within 2-3 days of the mosquito becoming infected, and
younger birds are considered important amplifying hosts, because they develop
higher titer and longer-lasting viremias than do adults of the same species,
and are less defensive [against mosquitoes] than older birds.
Lack of routine surveillance for EEEV (and other arboviruses) in the hope that
(a) it will not occur (the ostrich approach) or (b) if it does occur it will
strike only unimportant hosts (such as someone else's horse, someone else's
relative, someone else's birds) is an irresponsible public health approach.
In addition, the report indicated that O'Brien said "Horses are sometimes
infected, but the levels of the virus in a horse are much lower than birds.
That's why few people get the disease from contact with horses." Few people?
Has there ever been a human who acquired EEEV infection from a horse? What
does "contact with a horse" mean anyway? Blood (how, other than an accidental
infection during diagnosis in a laboratory or during sample collection),
saliva (we know nothing about virus levels in saliva), feces (can't imagine),
aerosol, tears, etc.?
As for the instructions to "disinfect equipment and work surfaces with a
solution of one tablespoon of bleach to a gallon of water," I doubt this
concentration is anywhere near adequate.
That the Michigan state veterinarians were still wondering whether the
affected deer had chronic wasting disease or EEEV infection, even after the
university laboratory reported that they have confirmed eastern equine
encephalitis in 2 deer, leaves one wondering how the diagnoses were made; by
virus isolation (I hope the laboratory personnel were immunized) or detection
of viral RNA or antibody (if in a single serum sample, perhaps the Michigan
authorities should revisit the possibility of chronic wasting disease).
Nonetheless, if EEEV is circulating in Michigan, it would not be the first
time (see: McLean, R.G., G. Frier, G.L. Parham, D.B. Francy, T.P. Monath, E.G.
Campos, A. Therrien, J. Kerschner & C.H. Calisher. Investigations of the
vertebrate hosts of eastern equine encephalitis during an epizootic in
Michigan, 1980. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 34:1190-1202, 1985).
Here is the reference for the only published report of EEEV infection in deer:
Tate CM, Howerth EW, Stallknecht DE, Allison AB, Fischer JR & Mead DG (2005)
Eastern encephalitis in a free-ranging white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_). J Wildl Dis. 41:241-5.
