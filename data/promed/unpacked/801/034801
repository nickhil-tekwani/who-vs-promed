I might also add that interpretation of filovirus serosurveys has been
historically problematic....certainly more so the earlier ones (IFA)
[immunofluoresent assay] than
those conducted later with more sophisticated techniques and reagents (eg,
EIA). The utility of EIA [= ELISA = enzyme linked immuno assay] in
diagnosis of clinical disease seems pretty well established, but test
characteristics on a population scale are quite a different matter.
While it is an intriguing finding in the pygmies, I'd lace my acceptance
with caution.
