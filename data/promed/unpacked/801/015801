[JR] could see it coming. The rabbit breeder for 40 years in Cold Lake, Alberta, says she saw the writing on the wall before a deadly rabbit virus appeared last month [April 2021] in the southern part of the province. "We sort of knew this was coming a few years before it actually hit. So we stopped showing and we bought nothing from anybody, anywhere," said [JR], who works at Beladarus Rabbitry with her daughter.

Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian, Dr Keith Lehman, sent a communique last month [April 2021] to the Alberta Veterinary Medicine Association warning about an outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, or RHD, in pet rabbits in one southern Alberta household. "It does cause a pretty significant level of mortality in animals that do get exposed. It is quite a severe disease for rabbits," Lehman said in an interview Wednesday [5 May 2021]. "Fortunately there are no human health risks. It is very confined to rabbits but for rabbits, it is probably one of the worst ones out there."

What is concerning, he said, is it appears to be a variation of the original disease that impacted only domestic rabbits. "In 2010, we saw it was getting out and affecting the wild rabbit population as well. I'm not talking about the escaped pets that can procreate, but those who are truly native to our wildlife," said Lehman.

There were outbreaks in British Columbia [BC] in 2018 and 2019 and in Montana and Oregon earlier this year [2021]. The disease runs its course in one to 5 days and is usually fatal.

[AW] from Clockwork Rabbitry in Armstrong, BC said the news from Alberta is a concern. "All the rabbit breeders I have spoken to are all really nervous about it especially since this could be a different strain than what we dealt with before," she said. "The new one that just came up from the United States, we're waiting to get confirmation that it is the strain that was found in Alberta because that one has been wiping out wild populations." When the BC outbreak occurred, she said breeders were able to get a vaccine for their rabbits from the United States on an emergency basis and the crisis was averted.

[JR] said all it takes is for one infected animal to make it into a herd, and it's over. "It spreads like a flash fire." There's a booming rabbit industry in Canada. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada says there were over 2800 rabbit farms in 2016. Many of the rabbits go to the meat industry, some are harvested for fur and others become family pets.

[JR] said the hemorrhagic disease could decimate the industry. "In the right instance, if it got into some of these big areas where they're breeding for meat production and they brought in some new stock. It could literally wipe out a business," she said. "If it went through a 200-to-400-doe barn, it would wipe out every animal, every doe, every buck. And you can't use those carcasses for human production." She added that the disease is also a terrible way for the animals to die.

Dr Jamie Rothenburger, a veterinary pathologist and assistant professor at the University of Calgary's faculty of veterinary medicine, said the disease has to be taken seriously. It can be transmitted by something as simple as grooming or purchasing a pre-owned rabbit cage. "I think we're all getting more familiar with infectious diseases in these days of COVID. So the idea of a virus living on a vector isn't a surprise," Rothenburger said. "It's one of Canada's immediately notifiable diseases under the Health of Animals regulations. And so, if you suspect the disease as a veterinarian or a laboratory confirms it, the (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) has to be notified immediately."

Rothenburger said it's unclear how widespread the disease could be. She's leading a study in Calgary looking at health and disease in urban hares. "Those are the jackrabbits we see hopping around our neighbourhoods. And we are going to be testing them for this very disease in the coming months to find out if it is here and hasn't been detected yet."

[Thanks to Nicholas Haley for submitting this report. In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled into wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (< 2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB
