Respiratory illness hits remote Alaska island
---------------------------------------------
The Alaska State Health Department and US Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) are investigating an outbreak of a respiratory illness on
Prince of Wales Island.

Health department officials are reporting 26 suspected or confirmed
cases of the unknown illness in communities like Craig and Klawock.
Officials say 7 people have been hospitalized.

Symptoms of the illness include a severe dry cough and a fever above
101 [deg F / 38.3 deg C].

The health department says so far the state is not prohibiting travel
to and from the island or quarantining anyone, but is advising people
to practice good respiratory hygiene. "Basically you can go a long
way [towards preventing spread] with just washing your hands
meticulously and covering your cough, and using tissues and throwing
them away," medical epidemiologist Dr Beth Funk said. "Don't leave
them [used tissues] lying around, just sort of simple things like
that."

The health department is collecting samples and sending them to the
CDC, as well as testing samples in an Anchorage lab.

[It is extremely unusual for no provisional diagnosis to be given for
an outbreak in the USA, let alone for fever and cough at this time of
year in Alaska. I wonder why they don't suspect influenza A or some
such seasonal pathogen. How can there be confirmed cases when they
don't know what the cause is? Any further information will be
welcome.

PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND, USA: 2231 sq mi (5,778 sq km), off SE Alaska;
largest island of the Alexander Archipelago. The island is heavily
forested, but has little arable land, no source of freshwater, and no
available areas for ship docking. Many of the islanders left when the
pearl-shell industry, once profitable, declined after the 1950s -- see

library/encyclopedia/prince-of-wales-island-united-states.jsp>.

Craig's population has varied following trends in the commercial
fishing industry. As of the census of 2000, the population was 1397.
The population of Klawock was 854 at the 2000 census (Source:
