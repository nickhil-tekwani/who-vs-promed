The crude annual incidence rates for syphilis among United States service members rose 49.1 per cent over a health surveillance period from 2010 to 2014, according to a new analysis published in the September issue of the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC) [1].

During the surveillance period of [1 Jan 2010] through [31 Aug 2015], a total of 2976 cases of syphilis were diagnosed. The annual incidence rates increased from 30.9 cases per 100 000 person-years (p-yrs) in 2010 to 46.1 cases per 100 000 p-yrs in 2014. In the 1st 8 months of 2015, the rate was 47.4, the highest level during the surveillance period, the report said.

"The increasing incidence of syphilis in military members is of significant public health concern because this finding suggests that some service members have been engaging in unsafe sexual practices that increase the likelihood of acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections (including HIV)," according to the authors' conclusions.

Syphilis is a highly contagious, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Treponema pallidum_, and is transmitted primarily through sexual or other physically intimate contact; transmission requires direct contact with a syphilitic sore. In the US civilian population, rates of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis in males increased 91 per cent from 2005 to 2013.

Among all beneficiaries of the Military Health System, reported syphilis cases have increased since 2012. In July 2015, the number of reported syphilis cases in the preceding 12 months was higher than any similar 12 month period in the previous 5 years, according to the Department of Defense AFHSC Reportable Events Monthly Report.

In the new analysis, of the 2976 cases of syphilis diagnosed, 51 per cent (n=1523) were identified through a reportable medical event for syphilis, while another 45.6 per cent (n=1357) were identified via a diagnosis in an outpatient record. 60 cases (2.0 per cent) and 36 cases (1.2 per cent) were identified via records in the Theater Medical Data Store or by discharge diagnoses in inpatient records, respectively (Table 2).

42 per cent (n=1253) of cases were specifically identified as primary or secondary syphilis; crude incidence rates of primary and secondary syphilis cases increased every year since 2011. Syphilis cases staged as latent accounted for an additional 27.1 per cent (n=809) of cases; cases where the stage was unspecified comprised another 670 (22.5 per cent) cases. Crude rates of latent and unspecified syphilis peaked during 2013 and 2014, respectively, while late syphilis rates in
2015 were slightly lower than the rates in the 1st year of the surveillance period (Figure 1) (Table 2).

Men contributed the greatest proportion of syphilis cases (88.7 per cent) during the period, and incidence rates for males increased every year of the surveillance period. Female rates of syphilis were highest in 2014 at 34.0 cases per 100 000 p-yrs (table 2 in the reference below).

Overall, syphilis rates were highest in those service members aged 20-29 years; these age groups accounted for 61.6 per cent of the total number of cases ascertained. These age groups have also demonstrated consistent increases in incidence rates year after year during the surveillance period (table 2 in the reference below).

The overall incidence rate in black, non-Hispanic service members was twice that of Hispanics, who had the 2nd highest overall incidence rate of syphilis (table 2 in the reference below). Almost a quarter of syphilis cases (24.4 per cent; 727 cases) also were diagnosed as HIV seropositive; of these, 601 (20.2 per cent) were diagnosed [with HIV infection] before syphilis and the remainder (4.2 per cent) were diagnosed as HIV seropositive after syphilis diagnosis (table 3 in the reference below).

As the authors' conclusions noted, there have been multiple hypotheses for the resurgence of syphilis in the civilian population: among these are decreases in safer sex practices; increased use of the Internet as a means of meeting sexual partners; and the increase of harm reduction strategies such as oral sex, which can decrease the risk of HIV transmission but conversely increase the risk of contracting syphilis. Several of these sexual risk behaviors have been documented as being increased in Army service members who are HIV seroconverters.

"Developing and implementing syphilis prevention measures targeting service members at high risk of acquisition should continue to be promoted as well as continuation of aggressive sexual partner notification programs," the study's conclusions said.

[As pointed out in the editorial comment accompanying the article in Medical Surveillance Monthly Report (MSMR) the trends for primary and secondary syphilis in the Armed Forces mirror that in the civilian population (1). Incidence rates of primary and secondary syphilis have increased in both groups in the past several years. Incidence rates in men are much greater in men than women. Men contributed an increasing proportion of cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the general US population, accounting for 91.1 per cent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases in 2013 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). In 2013, for comparison, men aged 20-24 and 25-29 years had the highest incidence rates for primary and secondary syphilis in both the Armed Forces and general population; men aged 20-24 years and 25-29 years had incidence rates of 17.0 and 21.1, respectively, in the Armed Forces (Table 4a, reference 1) and 26.3 and 27.0, respectively, for the general US population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). Corresponding incidence rates for primary and secondary syphilis in women in the Armed Forces in these age groups were 2.6 and 0.9, respectively in 2013 (Table 4b, reference 1).

The largest increases in recent years in cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the general population in the US are occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2012, primary and secondary syphilis cases in the 35 areas that reported the sex of sex partners, the proportion of male primary and secondary syphilis cases attributed to MSM increased from 77.0 per cent (6366) in 2009 to 83.9 per cent (8701) in 2012. Increases in incidence occurred among MSM of all ages and races/ethnicities from all regions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points out that these findings underscore the need for continued syphilis prevention measures specifically targeted to MSM.

However, the article in Medical Surveillance Monthly Report (MSMR) does not mention sexual behavior among the men with syphilis in the Armed Forces (1). Nevertheless, a recent article points out that in soldiers newly-diagnosed with HIV in the US Armed Forces, a majority were male and commonly reported male-male sexual contact, civilian partners, online partner-seeking, and unprotected anal sex (2). The news article above reports that almost one-quarter of syphilis cases in the Armed Forces were HIV seropositive. Similar high rates of HIV and primary/secondary syphilis co-infection have been documented among MSM in the general population, ranging from 20 per cent to 70 per cent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-msm-syphilis.htm).
