2003/072 Additional information on Citrus tristeza closterovirus in Algeria
----------------------------------------
As reported in EPPO RS 2003/052, Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV - EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was found in 2 citrus multiplication plots at the
experimental stations of Beni Tamou and Chebli (Wilaya of Blida). Specific
eradication measures were applied on the 2 isolated foci.
The Algerian NPPO now considers that CTV has been eradicated. Official
surveys are still being implemented to verify absence of the CTV in affected
plots and their vicinity by using standardized test methods, before
phytosanitary measures can be completely lifted in the quarantine area.
