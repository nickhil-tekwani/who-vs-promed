Bacterial bligh infects walnut orchard
--------------------------------------
A walnut grower from the NSW Bega Valley says his fortunes have taken a dive after last year's floods. Wyndham producer Mark Rumble lost his whole crop last March [2011] when his property was flooded.

He says a wet spring has lead to an infestation of bacterial blight through the orchard, and he may not harvest this year. "When it's rainy it spreads from the top of the tree down and it's very destructive. Most of the nuts are on the ground. We've probably lost about 70 or 80 per cent."

[Bacterial blight (BB) of walnut (_Juglans_ species) is caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _juglandis_. It is the most serious disease of commercial walnut production reducing yield by up to 80 per cent and decreasing quality of harvested nuts. Symptoms may include necrosis and black spots on leaves, male (catkins) and female flowers, and green twigs. Nutlets infected early develop black lesions and drop prematurely. Later nut infection can discolour shell and kernel making the harvest unmarketable.

The bacteria invade the host tree through stomata and other natural opening. The presence of free water is necessary for bacterial entry. Consequently, the disease is favoured by rainfall and infection is usually negligible in the absence of rain.

The bacterium are host specific to _Juglans_ species. The exact mode of survival between seasons is still being investigated, but infected buds are considered the primary source of infection for a new crop. Disease management currently relies mostly on frequent applications of copper compounds, but timing at terminal bud breaking is critical to kill bacteria overwintering in buds. However, copper tolerant pathogen strains have been reported to exist in many commercial orchards. No commercial walnut cultivars appear to be resistant, but early varieties with flowering periods during spring rains are usually affected the worst.

Different pathovars of _X. a._ affect a range of hosts. For example pv. _pruni_ causes bacterial spot of stone fruit and pv. _corylina_ affects hazelnut, both serious diseases of the respective crops.
