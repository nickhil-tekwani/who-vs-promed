PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (02)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from any part of the
world are now included in these updates where appropriate, and other
forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics -- as of 7 Jan 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJD
referred to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 7 Jan 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163
Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166
These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, but the number of patients alive has decreased
by one.
These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline (although the incidence curve may be
developing a tail). The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, and 5 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2007
--------------------------------------------------
As of 31 Dec 2007 in the UK in the year 2007, there were 111
referrals, 47 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic CJD,
4 deaths from familial CJD, one from GSS, and 5 deaths from vCJD.

[Prion disease update 2008 (01) contained brief press reports of the
identification of a new form of vCJD in a young female patient,
homozygote V/V at codon 129 of the PrPSc gene. The Abstract of the
scientific paper describing this observation is reproduced below. -

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prion protein gene codon 129V/, and a
novel PrPSc type in a young British woman
-----------------------------------------
By Mead S, Joiner S, Desbruslais M, Beck JA, O'Donoghue M, Lantos P,
Wadsworth JD, Collinge J. MRC Prion Unit and Department of
Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College
London, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen
Square, London, UK.
Background
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is an acquired prion disease
causally related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy that has
occurred predominantly in young adults. All clinical cases studied
have been methionine homozygotes at codon 129 of the prion protein
gene (PRNP) with distinctive neuropathological findings and molecular
strain type (PrPSc type 4). Modeling studies in transgenic mice
suggest that other PRNP genotypes will also be susceptible to
infection with bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions but may
develop distinctive phenotypes.
Objective
To describe the histopathologic and molecular investigation in a
young British woman with atypical sporadic CJD and valine
homozygosity at PRNP codon 129.
Design
Case report, autopsy, and molecular analysis.
Setting
Specialist neurology referral center, together with the laboratory
services of the MRC [Medical Research Council] Prion Unit.
Subject
Single hospitalized patient.
Main Outcome Measures
Autopsy findings and molecular investigation results.
Results
Autopsy findings were atypical of sporadic CJD, with marked gray and
white matter degeneration and widespread prion protein (PrP)
deposition. Lymphoreticular tissue was not available for analysis.
Molecular analysis of PrPSc (the scrapie isoform of PrP) from
cerebellar tissue demonstrated a novel PrPSc type similar to that
seen in vCJD (PrPSc type 4). However, this could be distinguished
from the typical vCJD pattern by an altered protease cleavage site in
the presence of the metal ion chelator EDTA.
Conclusions
Further studies will be required to characterize the prion strain
seen in this patient and to investigate its etiologic relationship
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. This case illustrates the
importance of molecular analysis of prion disease, including the use
of EDTA to investigate the metal dependence of protease cleavage
patterns of PrPSc.

Prion strain discrimination in cell culture: The cell panel assay
-----------------------------------------------------------------
By Sukhvir P. Mahal*, Christopher A. Baker*, Cheryl A. Demczyk*,
Emery W. Smith*, Christian Julius, and Charles Weissmann. At the
Department of Infectology, Scripps Florida, 5353 Parkside Drive,
Jupiter, FL 33458; and Institute of Neuropathology, University
Hospital of Zurich, Schmelzbergstrasse 12, CH-8091 Zurich,
Switzerland.
Abstract:
Prions are thought to consist mainly or entirely of misfolded PrP, a
constitutively expressed host protein. Prions associated with the
same PrP sequence may occur in the form of different strains; the
strain phenotype is believed to be encoded by the conformation of the
PrP. Some cell lines can be persistently infected by prions and,
interestingly, show preference for certain strains. We report that a
cloned murine neuroblastoma cell population, N2a-PK1, is highly
heterogeneous in regard to its susceptibility to RML and 22L prions.
Remarkably, sibling subclones may show very different relative
susceptibilities to the 2 strains, indicating that the responses can
vary independently. We have assembled 4 cell lines, N2a-PK1, N2a-R33,
LD9 and CAD5, which show widely different responses to prion strains
RML, 22L, 301C, and Me7, into a panel that allows their
discrimination in vitro within 2 weeks using the standard scrapie
cell assay (SSCA).

Prion detection by an amyloid seeding assay
-------------------------------------------
By David W. Colby, Qiang Zhang, Shuyi Wang, Darlene Groth, Giuseppe
Legname, Detlev Riesner, and Stanley B. Prusiner. At the Institute
for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Departments of Neurology and
Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco,
CA 94143; and the Institut fur Physikalische Biologie, Heinrich-Heine
Universitat, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.
Abstract:
Polymerization of recombinant prion protein (recPrP), which was
produced in bacteria, into amyloid fibers was accompanied by the
acquisition of prion infectivity. We report here that partially
purified preparations of prions seed the polymerization of recPrP
into amyloid as detected by a fluorescence shift in the dye
Thioflavin T. Our amyloid seeding assay (ASA) detected PrPSc, the
sole component of the prion, in brain samples from humans with
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well as in rodents with
experimental prion disease. The ASA detected a variety of prion
strains passaged in both mice and hamsters. The sensitivity of the
ASA varied with strain type; for hamster Sc237 prions, the limit of
detection was approximately 1 fg. Some prion strains consist largely
of protease-sensitive PrPSc (sPrPSc), and these strains were readily
detected by ASA. Our studies show that the ASA provides an
alternative methodology for detecting both sPrPSc and
protease-resistant PrPSc that does not rely on protease digestion or
immunodetection.

A versatile prion replication assay in organotypic brain slices
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jeppe Falsig1, Christian Julius1, Ilan Margalith1, Petra Schwarz1,
Frank L Heppner1,2 & Adriano Aguzzi. At the Institute of
Neuropathology, University of Zurich, Schmelzbergstrasse 12, CH-8091
Zurich, Switzerland.
Abstract:
Methods enabling prion replication ex vivo are important for
advancing prion studies. However, few such technologies exist, and
many prion strains are not amenable to them. Here we describe a prion
organotypic slice culture assay (POSCA) that allows prion
amplification and titration ex vivo under conditions that closely
resemble intracerebral infection. 35 days after contact with prions,
mouse cerebellar slices had amplified the abnormal isoform of prion
protein, PrPSc, >105-fold. This is quantitatively similar to
amplification in vivo, but 5-fold faster. PrPSc accumulated
predominantly in the molecular layer, as in infected mice. The POSCA
detected replication of prion strains from disparate sources,
including bovines and ovines, with variable detection efficiency.
Pharmacogenetic ablation of microglia from POSCA slices led to a
15-fold increase in prion titers and PrPSc concentrations over those
in microglia-containing slices, as well as an increase in
susceptibility to infection. This suggests that the extensive
microglial activation accompanying prion diseases represents an
efficacious defensive reaction.
