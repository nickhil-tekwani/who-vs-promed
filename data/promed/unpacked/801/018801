AEDES ALBOPICTUS, VECTOR STATUS

[In response to ProMED post of 9 Oct 2003 refuting a report that _Aedes
albopictus_ had been found in the UK -- see ref. below.]
_Aedes albopictus_ is not a particularly "great health threat". It is
susceptible to experimental infection with a wide range of arboviruses, and
that combined with its feeding behavior, may make it a potential bridge
vector for a number of them. However, natural experiments have shown this
species to be an inefficient epidemic vector of all arboviruses, including
dengue.

[The susceptibilty of _Ae. albopictus_ varies genetically, and I agree it
is a relatively poor vector of epidemic strains of arboviruses, including
dengue, but it may be more important in transmitting "endemic" strains.
It should be noted that although this mosquito has not been found in the
UK, it has been recorded in countries such as Albania, France, Italy, &
Israel, which have more mosquito-borne arboviruses than the UK. - Mod.MS]
