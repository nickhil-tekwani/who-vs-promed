[Latest update on dengue in New Caledonia, based on the last report from
New Caledonia Health Department. The current situation may, in our view,
emphasise the rather new endemic pattern dengue seems to show in New
Caledonia, since the 1995/96 epidemic - TK & YS
This message follows the previous messages of 17 February "Dengue 2
intensifying in New Caledonia", 27 March "Dengue 2 epidemic in New
Caledonia: an update", 7 May 1998 "Dengue 2 epidemic in New Caledonia: an
update (2)", and 3 June 1998 "Dengue 2 epidemic in New Caledonia: an update
(3)".
Dengue situation is improving: the weekly number of reported new cases has
been going down after the peak of April 1998 -- but it is still higher than
the weekly figures recorded throughout 1997.
Two thousand four hundred forty three (2,443) cases were notified from the
first week of 1998 to 13 July 1998, nearly 15 times more than the number of
cases notified for the same period in 1997; 1,298 of 1,303 new cases for
which dengue was confirmed were caused by dengue 2 virus.
Dengue still is a problem in and around Noumea: the 46.5% of the reported
new cases of the 4 weeks prior to 13 July 1998 are from Noumea, and 15.2%
from Mont-Dore, near Noumea.
The weekly number of clinical new cases (including the confirmed ones) from
the week starting on 29/12/97 (week 1 of 1998) to the week starting on
06/07/98 (week 28 of 1998) is shown below:
****************************************************************

5 91
6 81

27 26
28 7
Note: the number of reported cases for the last weeks is incomplete.
****************************************************************
The Department of Heath is still applying perifocal vector control measures
including insecticide spraying and reduction of mosquito breeding sites.
The cool season, which started mid-May and is less favorable to the
mosquito population, probably plays a role in the decrease of the weekly
number of cases.
