Warning as sex disease reaches UK
-------------------------------------
A sexually transmitted infection that, before now, has mainly been seen in
the developing world is spreading in the UK and western Europe, experts
say. London is among a number of major cities that have reported outbreaks
of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).
The 24 cases confirmed in England have been in gay men, but both sexes can
contract LGV through unprotected sex. Its symptoms include genital ulcers
and swelling in the groin, but it can be treated using antimicrobial agents.
In recent months, outbreaks of LGV have been reported in the cities of
Rotterdam, Antwerp, Paris, Stockholm and Hamburg. And this week [1st week
of February 2005], 2 men in New York were diagnosed with the disease.
Neil Macdonald, from England's Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: "LGV
was previously hardly ever seen in the Western world. It is endemic in
certain areas of Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean. What we are
seeing now is something that is quite new and is affecting gay men."
He said that it was not clear how long LGV had been in western Europe and
that it might be the case that, now that people are checking for it, more
cases are being found. Since the HPA set up an enhanced surveillance system
for LGV in October 2004, there have been 24 confirmed cases in England. The
HPA has been able to trace 19 of the cases. All are gay men, and 17 are
also HIV positive.

[Cases of LGV are now being newly reported in several areas in both the USA
(California, Texas, Georgia and New York) and Europe (England, the
Netherlands, France, Sweden and Germany). These reports represent the
beginning of a large outbreak of LGV in the sexually active community that
thus far has been limited to men who have sex with men, but may very well
extend into the general sexually active community. - Mods.LL/MPP]
