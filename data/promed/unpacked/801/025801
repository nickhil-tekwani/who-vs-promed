Brucellosis epidemic hits cattle in Azerbaijan
-----------------------------------------
A mass brucellosis epidemic among cattle has been discovered in Neftcala
(southeastern Azerbaijan) and Xacmaz (northeastern Azerbaijan) Districts.
Commenting on this to MPA, Emin Sahbazov, deputy chief of the main
veterinary department of the Ministry of Agriculture, pointed out
brucellosis was no sensation, since this disease was normal in the former
Soviet republics.
This bacterium in meat and milk dies from thermal inactivation [during
Pasteurization. In terms of contracting the infection, unsalted cheese
poses the greatest danger. Brucellosis is a chronic disease; infected
cattle are sent to the slaughterhouse. At present, veterinary services
specialists are examining cattle for the bacterium.

[Brucellosis is caused by bacteria of the genus _Brucella_, and in animals
is characterized by abortion, retained placenta, and occasionally orchitis
and infection of the accessory reproductive glands in males. The disease is
present in many countries in the world, primarily affecting cattle,
buffalo, bison, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, elk, and sometimes horses. The
disease in human beings, sometimes known as undulant fever, is a serious
public health concern.
Raw milk or certain cheeses may transmit the disease to people. When
infected droplets of the fluids involved in an animal's birthing process
splash into the eyes, the mouth, or open cuts of people assisting those
animals, brucellosis may develop.
The organism infecting goats presents the most serious disease in people.
There are preventative vaccines available for cattle. - Mod.TG
[_Brucella_ species are also well recognized hazards for those working in
slaughterhouses and in microbiology laboratories. Workers in clinical
microbiology laboratories should be suspicious when working with very small
Gram-negative coccobacilli that stain faintly, especially if these are
oxidase-positive and hydrolyze urea. In such cases, the organisms should
only be worked with in a biological safety cabinet in order to prevent
aerosolization, even if this is only to subculture in order to send the
isolate to a reference laboratory.
The _Brucella_ species infecting humans are _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, _B.
abortus_ and, less commonly, _B. canis_. On the basis of nucleic acid
sequencing data it has been proposed that all organisms within the genus
_Brucella_ should be considered a single species. Of interest, organisms
have recently been isolated from marine mammals that are within the genus
_Brucella_. These are distinct from previously recognized species (Bricker
BJ, Ewalt DR, MacMillan AP, Foster G, Brew S. Molecular characterization of
_Brucella_ strains isolated from marine mammals. J Clin Microbiol. 2000
Mar;38(3):1258-62). At the case report level, one research worker working
with strains of _Brucella_ isolated from marine mammals developed clinical
illness and had a positive blood culture for a strain of _Brucella_ that
was indistinguishable from strains previously isolated from marine mammals.
This indicates the potential for pathogenicity in humans of strains from
marine mammals (Brew SD, Perrett LL, Stack JA, MacMillan AP, Staunton NJ.
Human exposure to _Brucella_ recovered from a sea mammal. Vet Rec. 1999 Apr
24;144(17):483). - Man. Ed. DS
