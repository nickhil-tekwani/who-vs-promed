At the end of January, more than 200 000 crop varieties from Asia, Africa,
Latin America, and the Middle East -- drawn from vast seed collections
maintained by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR) -- will be shipped to a remote island near the Arctic Circle, where
they will be stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV), a facility
capable of preserving their vitality for thousands of years.
The cornucopia of rice, wheat, beans, sorghum, sweet potatoes, lentils,
chick peas, and a host of other food, forage, and agroforestry plants is to
be safeguarded in the facility, which was created as a repository of last
resort for humanity's agricultural heritage. The seeds will be shipped to
the village of Longyearbyen on Norway's Svalbard archipelago, where the
vault has been constructed on a mountain deep inside the Arctic permafrost.
The vault was built by the Norwegian government as a service to the global
community, and a Rome-based international NGO [non-government
organisation], the Global Crop Diversity Trust, will fund its operation.
The vault will open on 26 Feb 2008.
This 1st instalment from the CGIAR collections will contain duplicates from
international agricultural research centers based in Benin, Colombia,
Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, and Syria.
Collectively, the CGIAR centers maintain 600 000 plant varieties in crop
genebanks, which are widely viewed as the foundation of global efforts to
conserve agricultural biodiversity. "Our ability to endow this facility
with such an impressive array of diversity is a powerful testament to the
incredible work of scientists at our centers, who have been so dedicated to
ensuring the survival of the world's most important crop species," said
Emile Frison, director general of Rome-based Bioversity International,
which coordinates CGIAR crop diversity initiatives.
"The CGIAR collections are the 'crown jewels' of international
agriculture," said Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop
Diversity Trust, which will cover the costs of preparing, packaging and
transporting CGIAR seeds to the Arctic. "They include the world's largest
and most diverse collections of rice, wheat, maize, and beans. Many
traditional landraces of these crops would have been lost had they not been
collected and stored in the genebanks."
For example, the wheat collection held just outside Mexico City by the
CGIAR-supported International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)
contains 150 000 unique samples of wheat and its relatives from more than
100 countries. It is the largest unified collection in the world for a
single crop. Overall, the maize collection represents nearly 90 per cent of
maize diversity in the Americas, where the crop originated. CIMMYT will
continue to send yearly shipments of regenerated seed until the entire
collection of maize and wheat has been backed up at Svalbard.
Storage of these and all the other seeds at Svalbard is intended to ensure
that they will be available for bolstering food security should a manmade
or natural disaster threaten agricultural systems, or even the genebanks
themselves, at any point in the future. "We need to understand that
genebanks are not seed museums but the repositories of vital, living
resources that are used almost every day in the never-ending battle against
major threats to food production," Bioversity International's Frison said.
"We're going to need this diversity to breed new varieties that can adapt
to climate change, new diseases and other rapidly emerging threats."
Why are genebanks important?
----------------------------
The CGIAR collections are famous in plant breeding circles as a treasure
trove for plant breeders searching for traits to help them combat
destructive crop diseases and pests, such as the black sigatoka fungus
[_Mycosphaerella fijiensis_], which is devastating banana production in
East Africa, and grain borer beetle, which is destroying maize in Kenya.
Just from January to August 2007, CGIAR centers distributed almost 100 000
samples. The materials mainly go to researchers and plant breeders seeking
genetic traits to create new crop varieties that offer such benefits as
higher yields, improved nutritional value, resistance to pests and
diseases, and the ability to survive changing climatic conditions, which
are expected to make floods and drought more frequent.
In addition, these collections have often been used to help restore
agricultural systems after conflicts and natural disasters. For example,
among the 135 000 food and forage seeds maintained at the CGIAR-supported
International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in
Aleppo, Syria, 3000 varieties are native to Afghanistan, and 1000 are from
Iraq. The seeds preserved have been used to help revitalize crop diversity
in these war-torn regions.
"Svalbard will be able to help replenish genebanks if they're hit," said
Cary Fowler. Iraq's genebank in the town of Abu Ghraib was ransacked by
looters in 2003. Fortunately, there was a safety duplicate at the CGIAR
center in Syria [ICARDA]. Typhoon Xangsane seriously damaged the genebank
of the Philippines national rice genebank in 2006. "Unfortunately, these
kinds of national genebank horror stories are fairly commonplace," said
Fowler. "The Svalbard Global Seed Vault makes the CGIAR's genebank
collections safer than ever."
After the Asian tsunami disaster of 2004, the CGIAR-supported International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) used its collections to provide farmers with
rice varieties suitable for growing in fields that had been inundated with
salt water. The genebank at the CGIAR-supported International Center for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Palmira, Colombia was instrumental in
providing bean varieties to farmers in Honduras and Nicaragua in the
aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
According to Geoff Hawtin, acting director general of CIAT and former
executive director of the Rome-based Global Crop Diversity Trust, "The
shipments going to Svalbard from the CGIAR genebanks are a vital measure
for further safeguarding the world's crop collections. With coming climatic
changes, higher food prices, and expanding markets for biofuels, our best
available options for progress, if not survival, will be in what we have
conserved and studied against all thinkable predictions."
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
<http://www.cgiar.org>
--------------------------------------------
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR),
established in 1971, is a strategic partnership of countries, international
and regional organizations and private foundations supporting the work of
15 international agricultural research centers. In collaboration with
national agricultural research systems, civil society and the private
sector, the CGIAR fosters sustainable agricultural growth through
high-quality science aimed at benefiting the poor through stronger food
security, better human nutrition and health, higher incomes and improved
management of natural resources.
The Global Crop Diversity Trust <http://www.croptrust.org>
--------------------------------
The mission of the Trust is to ensure the conservation and availability of
crop diversity for food security worldwide. Although crop diversity is
fundamental to fighting hunger and to the very future of agriculture,
funding is unreliable, and diversity is being lost. The Trust is the only
organization working worldwide to solve this problem.

[Pathogens are changing and adapting constantly. New mutant strains with
increased virulence emerge resulting in breakdown of genetic resistance in
crop hosts. Recent examples are the fungal pathogens of wheat stem rust
(_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_, strain Ug99) and potato late blight
(_Phytophthora infestans_, multiple new strains), which are causing
worldwide concern, as well as the virulent strain of _Cassava brown streak
virus_ threatening food security in Africa (for further information please
see previous ProMED-mail reports listed below).
While fungal or bacterial plant diseases may be susceptible to chemical
control in the short term, sustainable control of these, as well as control
of virus diseases in general, rely largely on the use of resistant crop
varieties. When genetic resistance of a crop is broken down by a new
pathogen strain, breeding of new crop varieties resistant to the new
strains depends on the availability of alternative resistance genes. In
many cases, modern crop cultivars have been bred to the immediate
requirements of today's agriculture, resulting in the large scale loss of
such alternative resistance mechanisms. However, a range of resistance
germplasm is often found in less specialised "old" cultivars or wild
relatives of the crop. Therefore, the preservation of these genetic
resources is absolutely vital for global agriculture being able to
counteract the constant evolution of plant pathogens.
The establishment of this long term seed depository serving as a back-up of
germplasm collections for both crop cultivars and wild crop relatives
contributes significantly to food security worldwide and is a credit to the
international community.
