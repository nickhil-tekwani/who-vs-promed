[1] Revised CDC Advice for Travellers
[2] Japan - Relationship of outbreak virus

[The human death toll remains unchanged at 18; 5 confirmed cases in
Thailand, all of whom have died; and 20 confirmed cases in Thailand, 18 of
whom have died. No confirmed case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection has been reported from any other country in the region - Mod.CP]

Revised Advice for Travelers: Precautions for Travel to Countries Reporting
Avian Influenza A (H5N1)
--------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department
of Health and Human Services has issued precautions for travel to countries
that are reporting outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) in humans and
animals. The purpose of these precautions is to provide information for
travelers on the status of avian influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks, including
where outbreaks are occurring, measures to take before travel, precautions
to follow while abroad, and what to do if illness occurs during or after
travel. Currently, CDC does not recommend that the general public avoid
travel to any of the countries affected by avian influenza A (H5N1).

To date, the Ministry of Health of Thailand reported 5 human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1); these patients have died. Vietnam has reported
hospitalized cases of serious respiratory illness, primarily among
children. Of the 15 human cases reported in Vietnam thus far, 11 have died.
Several of these patients were confirmed as having avian influenza A
(H5N1). The CDC website contains recent data on confirmed cases:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2004_02_03/en/>

Currently no definitive evidence has been found of human-to-human
transmission; no H5N1 infections have been documented among health-care
workers. While it is unusual for people to get influenza infections
directly from animals, such transmission has been documented several times
in recent years. The source of exposure in human cases of H5N1 influenza is
under investigation, although most human cases have been linked to direct
contact with diseased birds.

Outbreaks of H5N1 infection have been detected in the poultry populations
of Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Thailand, and Viet
Nam. The virus was also confirmed in a single peregrine falcon in Hong
Kong. For more information on these reports Visit the World Organization
for Animal Health website:
<http://www.oie.int>

The co-circulation of human and highly pathogenic animal influenza viruses
is of serious concern to the World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, and
other health authorities worldwide, since an exchange of genes between the
2 viruses might occur if individuals were co-infected with both human and
avian influenza viruses. This gene exchange could give rise to a new
influenza virus to which humans would have little or no immunity and which
could be transmitted from person to person.

CDC has issued the following recommendations for travel to countries
reporting human or animal cases of avian influenza A (H5N1):

Before you leave:

Assemble a travel health kit containing basic first aid and medical
supplies. Be sure to include a thermometer and alcohol-based hand rub for
hand hygiene. Educate yourself and others who may be traveling with you
about influenza. Information about influenza is provided on CDC's influenza
website: <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/>

Be sure you are up to date with all your shots, and see your health-care
provider at least 4 to 6 weeks before travel to get any additional shots or
information you may need. CDC health recommendations for international
travel are provided on CDC's Travelers Health website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/>

You may wish to check your health insurance plan or get additional
insurance that covers medical evacuation in the event of illness.
Information about medical evacuation services is provided on the U.S.
Department of State website: <http://www.travel.state.gov/medical.html>.
Identify in-country health-care resources in advance of your trip.

While you are in an area where avian influenza cases have been reported:

At this time, CDC recommends that travelers to countries experiencing
outbreaks of this disease in poultry should avoid areas with live poultry,
such as live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus
are known to be excreted in the droppings of infected birds. As with other
infectious illnesses, one of the most important and appropriate preventive
practices is careful and frequent hand hygiene. Cleaning your hands often,
using either soap and water or waterless alcohol-based hand sanitizers,
removes potentially infectious materials from your skin and helps prevent
disease transmission. Influenza viruses are destroyed by heat; therefore,
as a precaution, all foods from poultry, including eggs, should be
thoroughly cooked. If you develop respiratory symptoms or any illness that
requires prompt medical attention, a U.S. consular officer can assist in
locating appropriate medical services and informing family or friends.

See this website for more information about what to do if you become ill
while abroad: <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/illness-abroad.htm>

It is advisable that you defer further travel until you are free of
symptoms. Follow basic health habits outlined on this website to protect
against flu.

After your return:

Monitor your health for 10 days. If you become ill with fever or
respiratory symptoms during this 10-day period, consult a health-care
provider. Before your visit to a health-care setting, tell the provider
about your symptoms and recent travel so that he or she can be aware you
have traveled to an area reporting avian influenza. Information for health
care providers wishing to test for or report cases of influenza A (H5N1)
and SARS can be found at this website: <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/han020302.htm>

Japan: Current Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Linked to 1996 Guangdong Virus
--------------------------------------------------
Japanese scientists have stated that the current avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus is 97 percent identical to the deadly avian virus isolated in
Guangdong in 1996. The avian influenza A (H5N1) virus that has caused the
deaths of tens of thousands of chickens in Japan and Vietnam is closely
related to the one discovered at a goose farm in China's Guangdong Province
in 1996, Japanese researchers said on Thu 5 Feb 2004. The virus found in
China is designated Gd96 and gave rise to [the current] the H5N1 strain,
the researchers said. The [Guangdong] virus led to the outbreak of avian
influenza in Hong Kong in 1997, which caused the death of 6 people.

The avian influenza virus isolated recently in Yamaguchi Prefecture is also
an H5N1-type virus. The researchers believe it is highly likely that the
current outbreak originated in China. The National Institute of Animal
Health in Japan compared genes isolated from samples taken from infected
chickens in Yamaguchi with genes of other H5N1 viruses found in other
countries. The researchers found the [nucleotide] sequence of the
haemagglutinin (HA) gene, which determines the H type, was 97 percent
identical with the [nucleotide] sequence of the virus that caused the death
of a man in Hong Kong in February 2003. The U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found that the HA [component] of the virus found in
2003 in Hong Kong is closely related to the Gd96 virus.

The HA gene of the virus in Japan is 97 percent similar to the gene of the
virus now common in Viet Nam, the researchers said. The avian influenza
viruses in Japan and Viet Nam are not exactly the same, but their genes
[belong to] the Gd96 genetic lineage, they said. In Hong Kong, the Gd96
virus has been continually found in ducks and geese exported from China
since 1997.

[These are interesting data, but it is perhaps too early on the basis of a
few sequences of a single genome sub-unit to draw firm conclusions about
the origins and evolution of the current avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in
