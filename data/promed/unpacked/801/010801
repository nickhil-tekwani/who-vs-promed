A 7th person has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease linked to the University of Oregon [UO] outbreak, Oregon Public Health officials confirmed Friday [29 May 2015].

The 52-year-old father of a student [had] visited the campus between 2 and 3 May 2015, and since has been diagnosed with the bacterial disease. It's the 1st case of a non­student contracting the disease in the current UO-centered outbreak. Officials said the latest case is proof the illness lingers on campus and students should get vaccinated immediately.

Despite UO and Lane County health officials urging students for the past 4 months to get vaccinated, more than half have failed to do so. So far, more than 10 000 UO students have received the 1st dose of the meningitis [serogroup] B vaccine. About 12 000 are unvaccinated. The university held a large-scale clinic at Matthew Knight Arena earlier in May 2015. Another large-scale clinic is planned for the fall when students return to campus.

In the latest case, preventative antibiotic treatment was provided to the man's close contacts by the UO, health officials said. State and county public health ­officials are working closely with the UO to investigate, health officials said.

[Invasive meningococcal disease] is a potentially fatal, contagious bacterial infection. An 18-year-old member of the university's acrobatics and tumbling team, died of the disease 17 Feb 2015. In the other [5] UO cases, the students all have recovered.

Parents and other campus visitors are not at increased risk of exposure to meningococcal B disease by simply visiting the campus, officials said. However, visitors and students can help reduce the transmission risk by covering their mouth when they cough, washing and sanitizing their hands often, and not sharing drinks, utensils, cigarettes or other smoking equipment or personal cosmetics that touch the lips. Kissing poses a risk of transmittal, health officials said.

Students should get vaccinated against the disease right away, and be sure to complete the dose series, which is offered in 2- and 3-dose courses, according to health officials.

[The University of Oregon campus has had 6 cases of invasive serogroup B meningococcal disease in students between 13 Jan 2015 to 19 Mar 2015. The 6th student case lived off campus. The latest case associated with the University of Oregon, the 7th, occurred in a father of a student who visited the campus between 2 and 3 May 2015. Presumably he is infected with the same serogroup B outbreak strain, which means the visitor must have had contact with someone on campus who was a persistent asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier over a month after the last student case. One patient died, an 18-year-old freshman; and 5 of the 6 student cases, including the case who died, involved bloodstream infections.

The University of Oregon is located in the city of Eugene in Lane County, Oregon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon).
