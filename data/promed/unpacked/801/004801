States investigate salmonellosis outbreak
-----------------------------------------
Public health authorities in Washington and Oregon are investigating an
outbreak of salmonellosis that is related to handling chicks, the
Washington state Department of Health announced.
More than 10 people in the 2 states were infected with the bacteria after
handling chicks, the agency said. Salmonellosis can cause severe diarrhea,
fever, chills and abdominal discomfort.
In Washington, the state departments of health and agriculture are working
with hatcheries and feed stores to reduce the risk of exposure to infected
animals.
The Health Department urged people to wash their hands with soap and warm
water after handling animals. People should also refrain from nuzzling or
kissing pet chicks.
