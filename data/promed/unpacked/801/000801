Rabies deaths reviving worry over stray dogs
-------------------------------------
COTABATO CITY: Health officials here expressed concern anew over the proliferation of stray dogs after the deaths of 4 persons from rabies just in the 1st quarter of the year [2013]. Dr. Dovia Tabugo, head of North Cotabato's Integrated Provincial Health Office, on Friday [5 Apr 2013] said the 4 victims of rabies had been bitten by infected dogs. She could not say when the deaths occurred exactly, however.

Deaths traced to rabid dogs, however, are not new in the province, according to Tabugo. In 2010, 13 people died of rabies after they were bitten by infected dogs. Rabies killed eight people here in 2011 and nine last year. Quoting a report from the health office's surveillance unit, she said several cases of dog bites in the province occurred inside the homes of dog owners or within their residential compounds. She said as the campaign against stray dogs intensified in many NorthCotabato towns, the health office is also appealing to pet owners to have their dogs vaccinated at veterinary offices. Tabugo said pet owners have no reason not to have their dogs vaccinated because the service is free in government veterinary offices.

She urged residents to immediately seek attention if bitten by dogs. Tabugo said North Cotabato Provincial Hospital in Amas, Kidapawan City, has a special service division called "animal bite centre."

[The above newswire is confusing as the report originates from Cotabato City, but the information within the report refers to Cotabato province, referring individuals for PEP (post exposure prophylaxis) at the provincial Hospital in Kidapawan City which is the capital of Cotabato (aka North Cotabato) Province. The City of Cotabato is one of the cities of the Philippines located in Mindanao. Cotabato City is an exclave within the boundaries of Maguindanao province, but is independent of that province. Cotabato City is distinct from and should not be confused with the province of Cotabato. A map of Mindanao, showing the location of Cotabato City can be accessed at: http://www.mindanaomaps.com/Mindamaps/MindaRegions.pdf. A map of the Philippines showing provinces can be found at: http://www.worldofmaps.net/en/asia/map-philippines/regions-provinces-philippines.htm.

It is difficult to comprehend the reluctance of the local population to make use of the free canine vaccination service available in the City. While vaccination of domestic dogs will not eradicate canine rabies, it would do much to lower the risk of infection of the human population. Visitors to Mindanao should warned of the risk. - Mods.CP/MPP]
