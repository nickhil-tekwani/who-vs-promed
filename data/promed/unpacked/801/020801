[Reports from WHO/GPEI this month continue to have additional confirmed cases with onset during 2021, with no newly confirmed cases with onset in 2022. Nigeria continues to have ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 with a cumulative total of 393 cases involving numerous states in the country. While the numbers of reported cVDPV cases during 2021 are 62% of those reported during the same period in 2020, 597 cases is still a significant number of cases highlighting the pockets of susceptibles in many countries.

One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

On [24 Jan 2022], the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory in Helsinki confirmed poliovirus type 2 (VDPV-2) in a sample from a 2-year-old child from Ukraine. The sample from the patient is similar to those that were already identified during the fall in Rivne region.

A boy living with his family in Transcarpathia fell ill with polio. Symptoms of the disease appeared on [13 Dec 2021] during a hospital stay in Lviv for the treatment of another disease. On [24 Dec 2021], the child already had signs of flaccid lower paraparesis (a neurological syndrome affecting 2 limbs).

According to the mother, the child was not vaccinated due to parent refusal, and there was no contact with other children who had recently been vaccinated. The child lives alone with the family, with no siblings. The family lives in a house on their own, living conditions are satisfactory, water supply is decentralized.

On [28 Dec 2021], the selected samples were sent to the Center for Public Health for examination in the reference laboratory for HIV/AIDS, virological and especially dangerous pathogen diagnoses. A positive result was also confirmed at the WHO laboratory in Helsinki, Finland.

An epidemiological investigation into a possible source of infection is ongoing.

[It's a sad piece of epidemiologic information to learn a case of VDPV associated polio was preventable, if only the parents had permitted the child to be vaccinated. A similar reaction when a child is hospitalized for COVID-19 and the parents had refused to vaccinate the child. - Mod.MPP]

Unidentified gunmen have shot dead a police constable escorting a team of polio workers in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, police said on Wednesday [26 Jan 2022]. The policeman guarding the polio team was targeted by the unknown gunmen in the Jarma area of Kohat district. The constable died as a result of the shooting while the assailants managed to flee from the scene, police said. No group has taken responsibility for the attack yet.

The attack is the latest in a spate of such assaults on polio health workers in Pakistan. Unidentified gunmen shot dead a police constable guarding a team of polio workers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in September last year [2021].

A Pakistani policeman guarding a polio team in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was shot dead in December last year [2021], a day after 2 soldiers were attacked in a similar incident killing one of them.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 remaining countries in the world where polio is endemic after Nigeria was declared free of poliovirus in 2020. The Pakistan government has suspended the anti-polio drive in the past following the growing number of attacks on polio workers in different parts of the country.

Attempts to eradicate the crippling disease have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming that the polio drops cause infertility.

[B] One-year milestone

Pakistan marks one year polio-free in major milestone
-----------------------------------------------------
A year has passed with no new cases for the first time in Pakistan's history after the last infection of the wild poliovirus was recorded on [27 Jan 2021] -- a major milestone for the country's anti-polio drive.

To formally eradicate the disease, a nation must be polio-free for 3 consecutive years, but even 12 months is a long time in a country where vaccination teams are in the crosshairs of a simmering uprising. Since the Taliban takeover of neighbouring Afghanistan, the Pakistan version of the movement has become emboldened and its fighters frequently target polio teams.

"Life or death is in God's hands," health worker Sidra Hussain said this week, amid a patchwork of high-walled compounds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. "We have to come," she said defiantly. "We can't just turn back because it's difficult." Hussain, along with her partner, goes door-to-door on the outskirts of Mardan city, dripping doses of rose-coloured medicine into infants' mouths as part of the country's drive to eradicate the virus.

Security threat
---------------
Nigeria officially eradicated wild polio in 2020, leaving Pakistan and Afghanistan as the only countries where the disease, which causes crippling paralysis, is still endemic. Spread through faeces and saliva, the virus has historically thrived in the blurred borderlands between the South Asian nations, where state infrastructure is weak and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have carved out a home. Last year overall militant attacks by the group surged by 56% according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, reversing a 6-year downward trend.

Pakistan's newspapers regularly include stories of police slain as they guard polio teams. Just this week a constable was gunned down in Kohat, 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Mardan. Pakistani media has reported as many as 70 polio workers killed in militant attacks since 2012, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Still, a TTP spokesman said it "never attacked any polio workers", and that security forces were their target. "They will be targeted wherever they perform their duties," he said.

[The continued violence against polio related workers, including vaccinators and police protecting the vaccinators is very disturbing, and further hampers the eradication efforts. In the current media cycle, there are media reports declaring 1 year since the last AFP case caused by WPV1 in Pakistan, but they fail to mention the periodic isolation of the WPV1 from environmental samples -- further demonstrating the continued circulation of the WPV1 in the country -- the most recent reported in the 30 Dec 2021 Global Update from WHO/GPEI (see Poliomyelitis update (01): WPV1 (ES), cVDPV1+2 (AFP) 2021, COVID 20220103.8700644 for more details).
