Democratic Republic of the Congo: Measles cases top 100 000 in the 1st 8 months of 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the beginning of the year and through 28 Aug 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported 100 044 suspected measles cases, of which 4652 cases were confirmed.

A total of 63% of lab confirmed measles cases are less than 5 years old, and only 36% with a history of vaccination.

In addition, 1294 measles related deaths have been reported (1.3% case fatality rate).

A total of 148 health zones have confirmed measles outbreak at some point since the start of this year [2022].

... People can spread measles up to 4 days before and 4 days after they have a rash. Measles can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs), and even death.

[From 1 Jan to 1 May 2022, 47 514 suspected measles cases and 684 deaths (CFR 1.4%) were reported in 349 health zones in 26 provinces (<tinyurl.com/297u66pc>).

From these numbers, one can see how quickly measles cases have increased as the number of reported cases to date (14 Sep 2022) have more than doubled. Other neglected diseases have similarly increased such as hemorrhagic fever, polio, cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis, which is an increasingly serious health concern in the DR Congo. - Mod.LK]

Paraguay reports suspected measles case, sample to be sent to CDC [US]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Paraguay Ministry of Public Health reported recently on a suspected case of measles in a 5-year-old boy from the Department of Itapúa.

The sample is in the process of being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.

With the notification of the suspected case, the health team of the VII Sanitary Region - Itapúa, carried out actions including monitoring of vaccination coverage and search for other cases, among the closest contacts and around the affected person's home, and the coverage of the health team was extended in the neighborhood where the person lives.

So far, no further suspicious cases have been reported. Monitoring and contact tracing will continue for at least 30 days.

In Paraguay, no cases of measles have been recorded since 1998, however, there is an alert of the risk of an outbreak, due to the increase in cases worldwide. There are even cases in neighboring countries.

In 2015, Paraguay obtained a measles/rubella elimination certification. If the virus is reintroduced, the country could lose that certification.

["The director of Health Surveillance, Guillermo Sequera, said that if measles was confirmed, it could have happened because the little girl was immunized a few days ago. "A girl of one year and one month had symptoms very similar to measles. It was good the doctor detected and reported the event. From that we did a raking of where is the possible case that has infected the baby. The relatives had a travel history, but it was after the girl's symptoms began," he said.

"Measles was confirmed positive in a private laboratory in Paraguay; however, the Ministry of Health sent the samples 14 days ago to the United States to confirm if it is the attenuated virus of the vaccine. The results are still pending. Sequera reported that she was found positive for measles in the test carried out in the country.

"It is rare, but it usually happens because she had been vaccinated 7 days before against measles. It could be measles, but from the vaccine. It is a milder measles. To confirm it we sent to the United States 2 weeks ago for them to sequence and tell us if it is measles from the vaccine or wild measles." (https://outbreaknewstoday.com/paraguay-awaits-results-of-measles-test-sent-to-us-could-be-1st-case-since-1998/)

Assuming the suspected case is confirmed to be measles, it is important to try to determine where the child contracted the disease, especially since the virus has not been detected in Paraguay since 1998 despite cases occurring in neighboring countries. It is most likely this case represents post-vaccination mild measles as a result of virus replication. Sequence analysis by the CDC should answer this question.

Abstract
--------
Background: The Dutch national vaccination program provides vaccination for mumps, measles and rubella (MMR vaccine) for all children. After vaccination with live attenuated viruses, the virus replicates on a limited scale. Replication may lead to mild symptoms occurring 5-14 days after MMR-vaccination, including fever, conjunctivitis and rash. Symptoms are comparable to those of a wildtype measles infection.

Case description: A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with an impressive rash 13 days after MMR-vaccination. Diagnostic tests were positive for measles. This test result caused the mother to doubt further vaccination.

Conclusion: Within 14 days after MMR-vaccination, a child can present with symptoms very similar to a wildtype measles virus infection. The low incidence of wildtype measles infection strongly suggests that these symptoms will likely be a reaction to vaccination. Elaborate diagnostic procedures may cause the parents a lot of stress and therefore offering reassurance to parents may be more appropriate. - Mod.LK]

Zimbabwe measles outbreak: Death toll tops 700, vaccination drive immunizes 27% of target population
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to the measles outbreak concentrated in the eastern part of Zimbabwe, the health ministry reported an additional 6 suspected measles deaths from Masvingo, bringing the death toll to 704 since April 2022.

As of 6 Sep 2022, Zimbabwe has reported 6551 measles cases during this period, nearly half from Manicaland.

A vaccination drive that began on 29 Aug 2022 ended today. The target was 2.3 million children between the ages of 6 and 59 months.

About 26.9% of the target, or 623 810 were vaccinated.

Measles can be severe in all age groups and can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and death. Several groups are more likely to suffer from measles complications, including children younger than 5 years of age, adults older than 20 years of age, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection.

[Because of the increase in measles cases, a vaccination campaign began on 29 Aug 2022 targeting children between the ages of 6 and 59 months.

Tonderai Kasu, director of Health and Environmental Services for the Municipality of Chitungwiza, said most of the cases and the deaths in the current outbreak are among children who were not vaccinated.

"There have always been objectors to vaccination, but we have been working with the community leaders in Chitungwiza, so I am happy to report that we have managed to reach a lot of those children who traditionally would not have been vaccinated in the current campaign," he said.

In addition, Kasu said the outbreak has also been attributed to the disruption of routine vaccination activities by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"We went through a number of national lockdowns during the last 2 years because of the coronavirus pandemic, and what that did was it created a situation whereby the parents and the caregivers were not able to easily bring the children for vaccination," he said. ...

Clearly, COVID has played a role in the growing number of measles cases being reported in Zimbabwe, as have religious beliefs (Also see Measles update (17): Zimbabwe 20220911.8705530). - Mod.LK
