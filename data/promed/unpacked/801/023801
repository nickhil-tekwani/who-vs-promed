A reliable source reports a suspected case of yellow fever in the north of
Liberia, near the Sierra Leone border and at the other end of the country
from recently reported cases on the Cote d'Ivoire border.
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information. Vaccination is
being carried out in both areas.
