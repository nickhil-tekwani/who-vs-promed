The 1st case of avian flu in broiler chickens has been discovered in
a poultry farm in Wafra, says a reliable source at the Public
Authority for Agricultural Affairs and Fish Resources (PAAAFR).
Meanwhile, falcons illegally imported into Kuwait may have been the
cause of an outbreak of bird flu that has forced authorities to cull
about 2 million chickens, MPs charged on Tuesday [17 Apr 2007].
During a special debate, a number of lawmakers submitted official
documents showing that several falcon shipments for royals and
influential people were imported without the strict quarantine procedures.
The head of the government's agriculture authority, Jassem Al-Bader,
denied the allegations, insisting that all the imported falcons were
properly tested and found healthy. But he admitted that a total ban
on bird imports -- imposed in 2005 following the discovery of the 1st
bird flu case in Kuwait -- was eased in July 2006 to allow the import
of falcons. Bader said that the last falcon shipment allowed was in late 2006.
"Lifting the ban on falcons was a catastrophe. Why were they exempted
from the ban despite warnings by doctors?" countered MP Jamaan
Al-Harbash. MPs decided to ask the parliament's health committee to
study the situation and report back to the house. Kuwait reported the
outbreak on 25 Feb 2007 when it announced that 20 birds, including 18
falcons, had tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu.
In the meantime, the Public Authority for Agricultural Affairs and
Fish Resources (PAAAFR) has destroyed 180 000 eggs and 250 tons of
fodder from 5 poultry farms that tested positive for bird flu virus,
reports Al-Qabas daily.

[This raises the risk if it is shown that these eggs and poultry feed
were imported. The imported falcons are not without interest but are
a distraction. There is more to this than meets the eye, as the
report appears to claim that broiler feed was contaminated, but they
have also been testing eggs. Were the latter from domestic layer
flocks or from imported eggs, and, if the latter, from where, and why
were they suspected in the 1st place? And while the last sentence
indicates that feed was contaminated, without defining the nature of
that poultry feed, the headline says that broiler chickens were
infected. Clarification is needed. If contaminated poultry feeds are
being exported, a not unexpected suspicion, this raises the level of
global risk. - Mod.MHJ]
