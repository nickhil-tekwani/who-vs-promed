Hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome - USA (New Mexico)
-------------------------------------------------
A McKinley County man has been diagnosed with a hantavirus infection - the
10th person to contract the disease this year in New Mexico, officials
said. The unidentified 49-year-old man was listed in critical condition on
Thu 24 Aug 2000 at University Hospital in Albuquerque. Eight of the 10
hantavirus infections this year have been diagnosed as the often fatal
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, while 2 of them had lesser infections.
"Nine of the 10 total number of hantavirus infections this year have been
from McKinley County. This number of cases in one county is cause for
concern," said state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Ettestad.

these illnesses, in 8 of the 10 cases at least, but the report does not
confirm this. - Mod.CP

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (California)
------------------------------------------------
A Sacramento County physician has been hospitalized with hantavirus
[pulmonary syndrome, a rare and deadly disease contracted through exposure
to rodent droppings. The doctor's name and condition are being withheld by
the UC Davis Medical Center where she is being treated. Sacramento County
Health Officer Glennah Trochet praised the patient's physicians who made a
quick diagnosis. "They caught it in time to put her on ventilation and she
is still alive, which is quite remarkable," Trochet said. Trochet said the
case does not represent a public health threat because the disease is not
spread from person to person. "There is no risk to her patients or anyone
else she may have had contact with," Trochet said.
The case is Sacramento County's first since 1996 and comes 6 months after 2
other reports of hantavirus [infection surfaced in Yolo County. In April,
a 41-year-old man from Woodland died after contracting the disease while
transporting hay throughout the state. In the second Yolo County case, a
21-year-old UC Davis student fell ill after cleaning storage facilities in
the Four Corners area of New Mexico, an environment known to be [at high
risk for the [viral infection.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a disease that attacks the lungs and kills
39 percent of its victims, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. There is no known cure. California, with 32
reported cases since the disease was discovered in the United States in
1993, has the second highest number of cases in the United States after New
Mexico.
Vicki Kramer, chief of the Vector-Borne Disease Section at the state
Department of Health Services, said health officials will set rodent traps
in the vicinity of the Sacramento woman's home and in 2 other counties
where she has traveled recently in an attempt to find the source of her
illness. Kramer said none of the areas is known to be high risk for
hantavirus. The CDC warns that the greatest risk for hantavirus [infection
comes indoors in places such as cabins or barns in rural areas. CDC
suggests airing out unused cabins before occupying them; spraying nests,
droppings and other signs of rodents with a disinfectant or bleach solution
before cleaning infested buildings; and keeping food and garbage sealed to
avoid attracting rodents.
Symptoms of hantavirus can appear one to 6 weeks after exposure to the
[virus. Victims typically experience fever and aches followed by shortness
of breath and coughing. Once this phase begins, victims usually require
hospitalization and ventilation within 24 hours.
