INFECTIOUS SALMON ANAEMIA IN THE UNITED KINGDOM / GREAT BRITAIN
Follow-up report
See also: 10 July 1998, 22 May 1998
Follow-up report No. 2
Text of a fax received on 29 September 1998 from Dr J.M. Scudamore, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Surbiton:
End of previous report period: 6 July 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[27, 97, dated 10 July 1998).
End of this report period: 29 September 1998.
---------------------------------------------
New outbreaks:
Location No. of new outbreaks (marine salmon farms)
Loch Nevis 1
Loch Linnhe 2
St Magnus Bay 1
(Shetland Islands)
Total number of outbreaks identified since 1 January 1998: ten (10).
Additionally, there are 11 farms in the coastal area currently suspected of
being infected.
Diagnosis: the diagnosis of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) was based on
mortality patterns, visual signs, histopathology and viral identification.
A. Laboratories: advice and assistance on diagnosis continues to be received
from the OIE Reference Laboratory for ISA (National Veterinary Institute,
Oslo, Norway) and the EU Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases (Aarhus in
Denmark).
B. Diagnostic tests used: monoclonal antibodies and RT-PCR.
Epidemiology: the epizootic investigations are continuing in order to
identify possible sources of the ISA infection and to determine the extent
of any spread of the disease.
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: wild fish have been sampled in the
coastal area and the results have so far been negative.
B. Mode of spread: it has been determined that, with one exception, there is
a connection from each of the sites back to a single point source of
infection in Loch Nevis. These connections were established prior to the
controls being put in place indicating a long incubation time for the disease.
The single suspected site where a connection has not been established is
less than 4 km from an infected site.
Control measures during reporting period:
-----------------------------------------
- The official services have required compulsory slaughter and destruction
of all fish, eggs and gametes on the confirmed farms, as required by the EC
control measures directive (93/53/EEC).
- Fish of a size suitable for marketing for human consumption and not
showing any clinical signs of disease have been processed. All dead fish,
fish waste and offal have been disposed of in accordance with the EC animal
waste directive (90/667/EEC).
- All confirmed sites will be cleaned, disinfected and fallowed for not less
than six months.
- All suspect sites are subject to movement restrictions, disinfection has
been put in place at entrances and exits, and all sites are subject to
regular inspections by the official services. Where appropriate, early
harvest of marketable fish is being encouraged.
- All farms in the wider coastal area remain under official surveillance and
are subject to regular health inspections.
