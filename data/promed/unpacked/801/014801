Gambia's government is investigating whether the deaths of dozens of young children from kidney failure in recent months are linked to paracetamol syrup, the head of the country's health service said on Thursday [8 Sep 2022].

A spike in cases of acute kidney injury among children under the age of 5 was detected in late July [2022]. As cases mounted, doctors began to suspect medicines could be involved.

Gambia's director of health services, Mustapha Bittaye, told Reuters a number of patients began to fall ill with kidney problems 3 to 5 days after taking a paracetamol syrup sold locally. It was not yet clear if any particular brand of paracetamol, used by parents in many countries to treat fevers in children, was under investigation.

_E. coli_ bacteria was also a possible cause, Bittaye said.

The children suffered symptoms including an inability to pass urine, fever and vomiting quickly leading to kidney failure.

By early August [2022], 28 children had died, according to health ministry figures, with a fatality rate of nearly 90%. The number of fatalities is now much higher, said Bittaye. An official updated tally is expected in the coming days.

"Dozens of children have died in the last 3 months," Bittaye told Reuters by phone. "Autopsies suggest the possibility of paracetamol."

World Health Organisation (WHO) officials said the evidence points not to paracetamol but to an infectious origin such as polluted water, though there are many unanswered questions. "It is quite unusual because it is confined to only one age-group. Normally you see different age-groups affected. That is why we are trying to investigate everything," said Sharmila Lareef-Jah, a disease prevention specialist at the WHO in Gambia.

Samples of the drugs the children took have been sent to toxicology labs in Senegal and Ghana for testing. Results are expected early next week, Lareef-Jah said. [This will hopefully be helpful. A higher than normal/recommended concentration has occurred to me, which on a milligram of drug per pound or kilogram of body weight could be out of the norm if the concentration of the drug is higher than stated on the packaging. - Mod.TG]

In a statement last week, health authorities said this kind of illness often has more than one cause.

_E. coli_ bacteria could also be a possible factor, as heavy rains have caused flooding in Gambia, and across much of West Africa, in recent weeks. The unpaved streets of the capital Banjul and surrounding towns have been overwhelmed.

The use of open pit latrines and open drinking wells in urban centres can lead to the contamination of drinking water and contribute to a spread in waterborne illnesses like _E. coli_, health workers said.

Whatever the cause, health authorities have so far been unable to save the vast majority of patients. "Most countries don't have the facilities to be able to take care of children who have that stage of illness," said Lareef-Jah. "Even in the best centres the mortality rate is usually high."

[This is tragic! Sanitation of where excrement is deposited vs drinking water is a critical issue. This should be examined and corrected.

"Paracetamol/acetaminophen is one of the most popular and most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drugs around the world, available without a prescription, both in mono- and multi-component preparations. It is the drug of choice in patients that cannot be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as people with bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer disease, hemophilia, salicylate-sensitized people, children under 12 years of age, pregnant or breastfeeding women. It is recommended as a 1st-line treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. The mechanism of action is complex and includes the effects of both the peripheral (COX inhibition), and central (COX, serotonergic descending neuronal pathway, L-arginine/NO pathway, cannabinoid system) antinociception processes and 'redox' mechanism. Paracetamol is a well-tolerated drug and produces few side effects from the gastrointestinal tract; however, despite that, every year has seen a steadily increasing number of registered cases of paracetamol-induced liver intoxication all over the world. Given the growing problem of the safety of acetaminophen [has] questioned the validity of the sale of the drug without a prescription. This work, in conjunction with the latest reports on the mechanism of action of paracetamol, trying to point out that it is not a panacea devoid of side effects, and indeed, especially when is taken regularly and in large doses (greater than 4 g/day), there is a risk of serious side effects" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24779190/).

However, since the drug in question [paracetamol] primarily deals with liver failure issues [if excessive amounts of the drug are ingested], and authorities have said this is more kidney related, one has to question if the paracetamol syrup is the culprit or if the syrup has been contaminated with some other agent.

We express our sympathy to the affected families, and hope this situation can be quickly resolved without further loss of life. - Mod.TG]

[It is unclear what role, if any, _E. coli_ has in this tragic event. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is, of course, associated with a risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is linked to some mortality but no where close to the case fatality rate reported here and most of the deaths tend to be related to central nervous system complications. - Mod.LL
