Food poisoning hits thousands in Mozambique
Reports from Mozambique say that thousands of people have been admitted to
hospital in the northern province of Cabo Delgado in a suspected outbreak
of food poisoning.
More than a hundred people are reported to have died.
Mozambique radio said they were suffering from cholera. However, in on an
interview on Portuguese television, the Mozambiquan Prime Minister, said
that although some people were suffering from cholera the exact cause of
the outbreak was still being determined.
He said that tests on fish in the area had revealed the presence of
dangerous pesticides, including organo-phosphates and organo-chlorates.
