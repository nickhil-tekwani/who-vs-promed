[The report of a 2nd case of healthcare acquired MERS-CoV infection in a patient in Buraidah is further confirmation of a nosocomial outbreak occurring in Buraidah, Al Qaṣim region of Saudi Arabia. Of note, the most recent nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV reported from Saudi Arabia was in June 2016 (more than 6 months ago) in Riyadh. In March 2016 there was a major nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in Buraidah involving more than 20 cases (the information on case classification of 34 cases that were reported from Buraidah between 3 Mar 2016 and 1 Apr 2016, included 6 cases that were secondary healthcare acquired cases in healthcare workers, 11 cases that were secondary healthcare acquired cases in patients, 2 primary cases with history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, 4 primary cases with no history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, 10 cases with high risk exposure history under investigation and 1 secondary case in a household contact).

It would be interesting to see the final report on the epidemiologic investigation into the previous outbreak in Buraidah, especially the results of investigations into high risk exposures for those cases reported as still under investigation at the time of the initial confirmation report. We await further information on this current unfolding outbreak of nosocomial transmission in Buraidah.
