The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned Friday that
conditions are ripe for the spread of the bubonic plague in the state.
Officials urged people who live in rural areas to take precautions to
eliminate rodents that may be spreading the plague through their fleas.
In a Friday news release, John Pape, a department epidemiologist
specializing in animal-related diseases, said the mild winter and plentiful
food sources are at the root of the recent increase of reported plague
cases in Colorado.
"It appears that this may be a bad year in Colorado for plague because the
rodent population has grown rapidly in rural parts of the state." Pape said.
The plague, a rodent disease transmitted by fleas, is widespread in rural
areas of western United States. The plague's natural hosts include rock and
ground squirrels, prairie dogs, wood rats, and chipmunks. House cats are
the most common transmitters of the disease to humans because they often
roam and hunt in infected areas.
The warning was issued after the Centers for Disease Control in Fort
Collins confirmed that a 48-year-old woman from Williamsburg, in Fremont
County, is suffering from the plague. She was being treated Friday in
Colorado Springs after becoming ill earlier this week.
In late May, an elderly woman living in Red Feather Lakes, in Larimer
County, died after contracting the plague. Prior to May, the last death in
Colorado from plague was in August 1996.
Recently, four prairie dog carcasses in eastern Pueblo County and flea
pools collected from rodent burrows in Larimer and Montrose counties all
tested positive for plague.

A Fremont County woman continued her struggle to survive an unusual form of
plague Friday at Memorial Hospital, in the state's second human case of
plague this year.Epidemiologists at the state Health Department on Friday
warned those in rural areas to take precautions against flea-bearing
rodents or pets who sicken unexpectedly.
Like bubonic plague, this year's two cases of secondary pneumonic plague
apparently came from infected animals. Humans catch the disease when bitten
by the animals' fleas.
Unlike the more common bubonic plague, which strikes at a lymph node in the
groin, secondary pneumonic plague spreads from the blood to the lungs.
Pneumonic plague can be transmitted between people much like influenza, if
the bacteria is coughed by one individual and inhaled by another, said Dr.
Tom Hackenberg, a Colorado Springs infectious-disease specialist treating
the Florence woman. Human-to-human transmission has not occurred in this
country, however, since 1925, he said.
"Frequently, people catch this from a pet," Hackenberg said. "In this
situation, they had a cat that was sick and died, so that alerted us to
plague."
When admitted May 30, the 44 year-old woman was near death, feverish and
suffering severe abdominal pain. Her blood pressure was low, she was in
respiratory failure, and many of her organs were failing. By Friday, her
condition had improved dramatically, but her future remained uncertain, he
said.
"It's miraculous how she has turned around, but she is still very sick,"
Hackenberg said. "She is a very strong, very tough woman to have survived
this long."
Hospital officials said more than 60 people who came in contact with the
woman have been treated with antibiotics to prevent spread of the disease.
The patient remains in "respiratory" isolation. Hackenberg emphasized that
her condition has not increased the risk of plague in the community.
John Pape, a state epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related
diseases, said an older woman living in the Red Feather Lakes area of
Larimer County died late last month from secondary pneumonic plague.
Recent tests also have confirmed that four prairie dog carcasses found in
eastern Pueblo County were infected with plague, and plague was detected in
rodent burrows in Larimer and Montrose counties.
Since 1957, health figures show, 45 people have contracted plague in
Colorado, of whom 9 died. Before this year, the last Colorado death from
plague was in 1996.
At least 85 percent of the state's plague cases have been the more common
bubonic plague. Early symptoms include sudden onset of high fever and
chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting.
State health officials caution that if an outdoor, hunting cat develops a
high fever or throat abscess, the animal should immediately be taken to a
veterinarian.
People should avoid feeding rodents and report rodent deaths to their
health department. Hikers and campers should use insect spray and leave
their pets at home.

[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_ is a reportable disease. Physicians
should report it to the proper health authorities, probably the state
health department. Veterinarians are reminded it is a reportable disease
and should be reported to the state health departments. It is a preventable
disease in pets. People with pets should exercise pest control measures in
the home and yard and seek veterinary help to control/rid fleas from pets.
