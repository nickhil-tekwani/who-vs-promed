Situation of pepino mosaic potexvirus in Germany
------------------------------------------------
According to Article 4 of Commission Decision 2001/536/EC (Temporary
measures against the introduction and spread of Pepino mosaic virus),
Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV) (EPPO Alert List) was found in leaves and
fruit of tomato in a small glasshouse in Hamburg.

The origin of the infection is not known. It [cannot ... be excluded that
[PepMV .. was introduced [from a source other than the company [that
supplied [fruits for local marketing. Eradication measures [were ...taken.

This is the third record of an outbreak of [PepMV ... in tomato-growing
companies in Germany (1999 in Hessen, 2000 in Thuringen - see EPPO RS
2000/171). Eradication measures [were effective only in ... Hessen.

Consequently, [PepMV ... is known to occur in Germany at 2 locations,
under protected cultivation. The situation of [PepMV .. in Germany can be
described as follows: Present, only at 2 premises (in Thuringen and
Schleswig-Holstein) under protected cultivation. Transient: actionable,
under eradication.

[Pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) a.k.a. pepino dulce, melon pear, melon shrub
and pear melon is native to the temperate Andean regions of Colombia, Peru
and Chile. The plant is not known in the wild, and the details of it origin
are unknown. The fruit is grown commercially in New Zealand, Chile and
Western Australia. According to EPPO, PepMV was first detected in pepino in
Peru in 1980. It was introduced into the U.K and the Netherlands in 1999
and has subsequently spread to other European countries including France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and Sardinia. It has recently been reported in Canada
and U.S.A. The virus is easily spread by contact (e.g. virus-contaminated
equipment and tools) and by infected transplants shipped for tomato
production elsewhere. Severe crop loss can occur when young plants are
infected.
