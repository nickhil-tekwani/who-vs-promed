A lion has died from Covid-19 at an Indian zoo where 8 others also tested positive for the virus. The state-run zoo on the outskirts of the south Indian city of Chennai announced the 9-year-old Asiatic lion's death on [Fri 4 June 2021].

'A 9-year old lioness Neela succumbed to the disease on the evening of [3 Jun 2021],' the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, also known as Vandalur Zoo, said.

The outbreak was 1st observed when the lioness 'showed some nasal discharge'. The others appear to have been asymptomatic. The affected animals have been quarantined and given antibiotics. They are under observation by the zoo's veterinary team and an expert team from Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.

There have been various coronavirus cases reported in animals, including 2 white tiger cubs thought to have died from the virus in Pakistan.

Lions have also tested positive in Spain and 2 other Indian cities, including Hyderabad, where 8 lions tested positive last month [May 2021] at Nehru Zoological Park.

'All animal keepers and helpers for these animal houses are vaccinated against COVID-19. A separate set of animal keepers is engaged for each group of lions. PPE kits are mandatory for the animal keepers, veterinary doctors and field staff visiting the area,' the zoo said.

'Samples of tigers and other large mammals are being sent for testing,' the zoo's statement added. Officials added that a sample from the zoo's only pregnant lioness would not be sent for now as sedating her could weaken her immunity. A 2nd sample from the deceased lion has also been sent to rule out a false positive result.

On Sun 6 Jun 2021], Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin visited the zoo to assess the situation.

Expert teams explained the lions' care and measures taken to monitor them, according to local media.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed so far in 3 families of carnivores (Order CARNIVORA), canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar and snow leopard) and mustelids (ferrets and minks).

Lions and tigers experienced respiratory disease due to COVID-19 at the Bronx Zoo in April 2020, tigers with mild respiratory signs tested positive at Knoxville Zoo in October 2020, and lions in Barcelona Zoo in December 2020. In January 2021, 1 tiger and 2 lions tested positive at a zoo in Sweden.

Recently, the Hyderabad zoo reported that 8 lions tested positive. This new report is relevant as it is the 1st to link death with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a big cat. In January 2021, 2 tiger cubs that had died due to a severe lung infection were suspected of having COVID-19, but they were not tested by any means to confirm that they were SARS-CoV-2 positive. It would be important to conduct a thorough post mortem examination to establish if the lioness died as a result of COVID-19 or whether there were other conditions contributing to the fatality. - Mod.PMB
