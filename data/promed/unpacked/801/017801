FUSARIUM, MAIZE - FRANCE (NORMANDY): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I have been noticing more and more maize fields with an infection,
whole fields are just brown, with the plants standing, but they are
dry. The problem with this diseased maize is that it is drying off
prematurely. It is not spotted and the cobs do not look rotten. Here
the wheat harvest was well down due to the rain, and straw and hay
are in short supply. The maize here is about 2/3 used for silage for
winter feed for cattle, and 1/3 for sale in kernels. These dry plants
will not make proper silage.
We visited a couple of farms and spoke to the farmers. The outcome
is: there is a lot of it about; we have the same disease here in the
wheat; they should have sprayed against it in the spring; the local
name is 'fusariose', both in maize and wheat. The farmers attribute
the outbreaks to plant 'stress' caused by too much rain and then the
best part of 7 weeks with no rain.
The infection is caused by one of the 26 isolates of the
mycotoxin-producing _Fusarium_. This infects the roots and the
epidermis, etc., of the plant. (Reference: 'Impact of the exodermis
on infection of roots by _Fusarium culmorum_. Susan A Kamula, Carol A
Peterson, Colin I Mayfield. Dept of Biology, University of Waterloo,
ON. Canada.) I think there is a good chance we are looking at an
infection by _Fusarium culmorum_.
I would say it was much more widespread than in southern Normandy,
but I have not been out of the area.

[Thank you very much to Ms Baekeland for supplying this report.
Several species of the soil- and residue-borne fungal genus
_Fusarium_ are causing a number of head blight, stalk rot, seedling
root rot, and ear and stalk rot diseases in grain crops such as
maize, wheat, barley, rye, and oats. In parts of northern Europe, _F.
culmorum_ and _F. avenaceum_ are the prevalent pathogens. These fungi
persist and multiply on infected crop residues. During moist weather,
spores of the fungi are windblown or splashed onto the heads of
cereal crops. Stress conditions and lesions caused by other fungi or
insects are known to increase susceptibility of host plants to _Fusarium_.
_F. culmorum_ infection is thought to be monocyclic. Infection of
ears is optimal during the period of flowering when fungal spores may
land on the exposed anthers and enter the host. The resistance of
ears to infection will have increased significantly by the time
secondary inoculum is produced. Therefore, fungicide sprays applied
late in the crop cycle are unlikely to be of significant benefit.
_Fusarium_ species are capable of producing mycotoxins, which can
seriously affect livestock and humans. For any given host species,
only certain strains develop toxins. In cereals, mycotoxin
contamination is most commonly associated with _F. graminearum_, _F.
culmorum_, _F. avenaceum_, and _F. poae_. Zearalenone is a mycotoxin
produced by several fungi, including _F. culmorum_ in maize and
wheat. The issues associated with _Fusarium_ infections can be
reduced through the use of integrated crop management techniques such
as avoiding growing cereals after maize, deep plowing rather than
minimum tillage, choosing a variety with some resistance to the
pathogens and, where appropriate, the use of a suitable azole fungicide.
In the report above, the description of the cobs not showing any
signs of rot is somewhat confusing. Maize plants infected with _F.
culmorum_ would be expected to show some ear symptoms. However, when
the crop is nearing maturity and cobs have largely dried off, early
fungal damage may be less obvious. We would be grateful for any
further information on the situation.
