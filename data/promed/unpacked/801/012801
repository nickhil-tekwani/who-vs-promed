Six people collapsed and were taken to hospital -- 5 of them in a critical condition -- after apparently ingesting an unknown substance in the Cape Town suburb of Wetton on Monday [13 Jan 2020].

ER24 spokesperson Russell Meiring said the ambulance service was initially alerted to several people in desperate need of help.

"It is believed to have been some sort of poisoning incident. All those affected had ingested some sort of substance which is not yet known," he told TimesLIVE.

It is not known whether the victims were related or knew one another.

Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said: "City law enforcement officers on patrol in Wetton were alerted to an incident in which 3 males and a female had collapsed at a bus stop." He said the victims received medical attention.

As the paramedics were treating them, another person was reported lying on the pavement in nearby Walnut Road, and a 6th had collapsed on the corner of St Joseph's Road and Wetton Road.

"The patients were treated for their injuries and provided with several advanced life support interventions before they were transported to nearby hospitals for further care," said Meiring.

[Neither of these articles give us much information regarding what the substance was or how quickly these individuals collapsed, or whether there were other specifics.

We are not told whether the substance was inhaled or ingested. If they were given life-saving procedures, then perhaps their heartbeat was irregular or had stopped, or breathing had stopped, or perhaps the unknown substance resulted in the patients being unable to breath, or perhaps they were blue and gasping for breath.

We could speculate some more, but there are few clues here. We wish these individuals a speedy recovery. - Mod.TG

We would appreciate any additional information on these cases including the cause of poisoning if/when it is determined. - Mod.JH
