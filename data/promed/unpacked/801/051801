_Plasmodium knowlesi_ in humans: a comment
------------------------------------------
The recent paper of Kim-Sung Lee et al (PLoS Pathogens 7(4): e1002015
[available at
http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1002015;jsessionid=A28F4AC2C98E4458DEDF2E5C08A71DDB.ambra02])
comes as welcome epidemiological news helping to clarify that _P.
knowlesi infection_ in humans remains (at least for the time being) a
true zoonosis.

This counters the oft referenced notion published over 3 years ago
describing _P. knowlesi_ as the "5th" human malaria parasite (for
example, NJ White, Clin Inf Dis 2008: 46(2): 172-3 [available at
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/2/172.long]).

At the same time in a ProMED-mail comment posted on 7 Jan 2008
concerning a ProMED Digest dispatch ('Malaria, P. knowlesi, Human -
Malaysia (02): Sarawak' archive no 20080107.0083), the CID
pronouncement was viewed cautiously until further evidence emerged.

Rather, as suspected then, the infection seen in humans should be
regarded as a legitimate zoonosis until proven otherwise.

In that same comment piece, it was stated that in order to establish
the existence of a natural anthroponotic infection cycle (that is,
'human to human' via a mosquito vector, typically), the area of active
transmission must exclude the presence of simian reservoirs (syn- and
exo-anthropic infected macaques) to definitively conclude this
parasite as a 'true' and independent human _Plasmodium_ species.

Knowlesi malaria as a human disease adaptation is certainly well
within possibility, however the search for irrefutable evidence of
such transmission dynamics must continue.

[ProMED-mail thanks Michael Bangs for his valuable comment. We agree
that for the time being, _P. knowlesi_ remains a zoonotic infection
and the transmission dynamic between humans -- if any -- needs to be
further studied. - Mod. EP]
