Dog owners are being warned about rising cases of leptospirosis as Australia faces a nationwide vaccine shortage to fight the deadly disease. Cases of Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection transmitted via rat urine and faeces which is potentially fatal to humans, have been detected in NSW, Queensland and the Northern Territory (NT) in recent months.

Leptospirosis can kill pets in just 48 hours. It causes organ failure, swelling of the brain and haemorrhages.

Dog owners are being urged to contact their local veterinarian to see if they're in a leptospirosis 'hotspot' and to have their pets vaccinated. Owners should also check their pets for signs which include lethargy, vomiting, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and jaundiced or yellow gums.

The warning comes amid a shortage of the Protech C2i vaccine which protects dogs from the virus.

Daniel Watkins, Head of Animal Health, Boehringer Ingelheim Australia & New Zealand said the supply issues were due to "specific circumstances at our overseas manufacturing site, including staff capacity issues and distribution challenges. Our Veterinary Medical Services Team has been working closely with veterinarians to help them prioritise available doses for animals most at risk."

Mr Watkins said vaccine stock would be replenished around the middle of November [2022] and the focus was on raising awareness about the lethal disease.

"Raising awareness about leptospirosis with veterinarians and veterinary nurses is very important to us. We continue to provide professional education and support ongoing research into leptospirosis with the University of Sydney."

Puppies require 2 shots of the vaccine at 6 and 9 months while adult dogs need 2 doses spread over 2 to 4 weeks followed by a booster every year afterwards.

Leptospirosis start when bacteria is excreted through the urine of infected animals such as rats and is transmitted through contaminated water, food or mud.

Dr. Christine Griebsch, Senior Lecturer, Small Animal Medicine from University of Sydney said 'risk mitigation methods' were vital to prevent leptospirosis infections. "The bacteria causing leptospirosis are passed in the urine of infected animals, particularly from rodents, so limiting contact with urine or areas contaminated with urine is important. This includes limiting contact with, swimming in and drinking out of stagnant water and avoiding contact with possible reservoir hosts such as rodents and farm animals, which can be achieved by fencing and rodent control,' she said."

Leptospirosis fact sheet"
-----------------------
What is leptospirosis?
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease of humans and animals. It is caused by Leptospira bacteria found in infected animal urine and animal tissues.

Leptospirosis in humans
Humans can experience sudden onset of fever, headache, calf tenderness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, lethargy, arthralgia, eye pain, photophobia and rashes.

How to get diagnosed
Leptospirosis is sometimes misdiagnosed because symptoms/signs can be non-specific and overlap with many other causes of illnesses. A doctor can diagnose leptospiriosis through a blood test. Usually, 2 blood tests taken more than 2 weeks apart are required to make the diagnosis.

Treatment in humans
Leptospirosis is commonly treated with antibiotics such as doxycycline or penicillin.

Leptospirosis in dogs
Dogs will typically come into contact with the leptospira bacteria in infected water, soil, or mud, while swimming, passing through, or drinking contaminated water. Hunting and sporting dogs, dogs living near wooded areas, and dogs living on or near farms are at an increased risk of acquiring the bacteria. Also at increased risk are dogs having spent time in a kennel.

How to protect your dog from contracting leptospirosis
Don't let your dog drink from standing water or swim in bodies of water which may be contaminated.

There is a vaccine available which can help protect your dog from leptospirosis, although vets openly admit it doesn't always work

Talk to your veterinarian about whether it might be right for your pet.

[Getting your dog vaccinated is critically important, but the vaccine may not be effective if it does not match the circulating serovar. It does depend on which serovars are in the vaccine and which are the cause of the problem. "Prevention of leptospirosis via vaccination is complicated by the fact that _Leptospira interrogans_ has more than 200 subtypes causing illness in animals and people. The available vaccines protect against only a handful of the most common subtypes infecting dogs, which limits their protective value. Nevertheless, the available vaccines are effective and safe when used as directed, and many veterinarians recommend the vaccination for dogs at risk for exposure." http://www.vetstreet.com/care/leptospirosis-vaccine-for-dogs

"Leptospirosis is more common in areas with warm climates and high annual rainfall, but it can occur anywhere.

Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. (However, it is known cats can die from this disease, and currently, there is no vaccine for cats. - Mod.TG). Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States (and likely anywhere - Mod.TG) include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs. (Other exposure risks would be flood waters. Often in flooded areas, rodents, which frequently carry leptospirosis, are involved, and pets may not have clean sources of water in such disaster situations. - Mod.TG).

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness; some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend several other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of leptospira bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- if your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- wash your hands after handling your pet.

If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV or other conditions), consult your physician for advice." https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Leptospirosis.aspx

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact with abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm freshwater or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October).

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The Leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.
