[WNV infection in Romania is endemic in bird, horse, and human populations. This is evidenced by high seroprevalence rates in horses and sporadic reports of human cases on an annual basis. A total of 2 major WNV outbreaks were reported in 1996 and 2010.

The precise reasons for the intense and widespread WNV circulation in the Mediterranean during recent years are unclear and probably multi-factorial.

Control measures must be initiated to contain the outbreak and appropriate health communication to the general public. - Mod.UBA
