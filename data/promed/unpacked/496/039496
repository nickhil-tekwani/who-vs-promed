Exotic Newcastle disease (END) confirmed in a backyard flock in Nevada
----------------------------------------
END has been confirmed in a backyard flock in Las Vegas, NV. The state has
already instituted a quarantine of all of Clark County and portions of Nye
County. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the
state of Nevada have begun surveillance efforts of the backyard bird
population and have begun efforts to establish a task force in Nevada. The
affected backyard flock will be depopulated. There are no commercial flocks
in Nevada.
