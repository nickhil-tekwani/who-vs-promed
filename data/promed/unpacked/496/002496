British and German tourists bring measles to the island
-------------------------------------------------------
The Canary Islands are suffering the worst measles outbreak for the
past decade. The 25 confirmed cases that occurred in the last month
were diagnosed in Tenerife. This condition initially occurred in a 14
month old baby living in Santa Cruz. At this moment, the most likely
cause for this is the massive contact with people coming from the
United Kingdom, where an "anti-vaccine movement" is actively growing,
and it has also extended to Germany, albeit in a less extended
fashion.

Dr Amos Garcia-Rojas, head of epidemiology and prevention from the
Canarian Health Service (SCS, according to its Spanish initials)
explained that this reemergence is occurring in many places in Europe,
since in many "totally industrialized countries with perfect access to
healthcare services, persons are not getting vaccinated." The reason
for this, he added, is that some papers published in the early 90s
associating measles vaccination with the occurrence of autism and
other behavioral disorders. "Its has been clearly proven that this is
not true, but the idea still remains in people's minds, that this
vaccine may be dangerous, so they have decided not to expose their
children to vaccines", Dr Garcia-Rojas emphasized.

Dr Garcia-Rojas explained that since the Plan for Eradicating Measles
was implemented in the archipelago in 2000, there has never been such
a significant outbreak. "Since 1985, our vaccine coverage is higher
than 95 per cent," he pointed out, "for this reason the virus may not
circulate since there are no susceptible individuals."

So, Dr Garcia-Rojas observed that only "a group of 25 to 40 year old
persons who had not been vaccinated during their childhood and less
than 15 month old children, which is the age when the triple viral
[measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is administered, are susceptible for
developing the disease."

Therefore, if the virus is not circulating, since almost all persons
are protected, a case of measles may be a very rare occurrence. The
healthcare officer mentioned that during the past decade only 112
possible cases had been identified, and only 32 per cent of them were
confirmed. Certainly, during the last 4 years, no case of measles had
been confirmed in the Canary Islands. Also, Dr Garcia-Rojas recalls
that every time an outbreak occurred, it was always related with
foreign persons. As an example, he described the case of 3 German
tourists who were hospitalized in Tenerife in 2006 because they
developed the disease.

Nevertheless, the healthcare officer mentioned that there is no
reason for alarm. "The vaccine coverage we have is excellent; we have
to take into account that the index case is a child who had not yet
reached the age in which vaccination should be administered," he
assured. Also, he pointed out that many of the infected persons (in
this current outbreak) "belong to the 20 to 45 year old age group, all
of them non-vaccinated, but they are healthcare personnel,
consequently, these are people with a greater exposure to the virus."

Dr Garcia-Rojas is emphatic in this respect. "If the Tenerife
population were not as protected as they are thanks to the high
vaccine coverage, now we would not be talking about 25 cases, we would
be speaking about 2500 cases." Trying to show how contagious this
infection is, he commented that before vaccination programs were
implemented, 100 per cent of the population developed this condition.

Measles on rise in Frankfurt
----------------------------
The Municipal Health Department recommends teaching staff to receive
measles vaccination, because the disease affects not only children but
also young people and adults. In the worst cases, the disease can be
deadly.

In Frankfurt, as in other European cities, measles is affecting many
school children. Before the Easter vacation the Municipal Health
Department checked the vaccination certificates of more than 2000
students. Bellinger Oswald of the Municipal Health Department stated
that 200 students had failed to provide the requisite documentation
despite prior notification. Some students were sent on holiday early
because they were able to provide adequate documentation.

Measles, especially in adults, is not a benign disease. Middle ear
infections and lung infections are common, and occasionally meningitis
develops. All adults born after 1970 should review their vaccination
status. The Robert-Koch-Institute recommends that they should undergo
revaccination. For many years, children have been vaccinated with a
combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella. However, in the
past, 2 vaccinations have not always been given as it was assumed that
one dose would be sufficiently protective. According to the
Robert-Koch-Institute in Berlin this has proven not to be sufficient
and accordingly a 2nd vaccination is now provided routinely by the
Municipal Health Department.

Currently, 45 measles cases have been diagnosed in Frankfurt. 13 are
young adults, 11 of whom have been hospitalised. The Municipal Health
Department has now distributed a leaflet advising teachers and the
staff of pediatric practices to obtain a 2nd 'catch up' dose if
necessary.

Measles is highly infectious [contagious]. 95 per cent of the
population must be vaccinated to provide so-called 'herd immunity' in
order to prevent the spread of the disease. The current level of
immunity in Frankfurt and other cities is not known precisely. The
Municipal Health Department is aiming to achieve at least 95 per cent
acceptance overall, as in the 1st round of vaccination. The level of
acceptance of 2 doses of vaccine had already reached 90 per cent in
2008 compared with only 70 per cent in 2006.

French measles outbreak hits Switzerland
----------------------------------------
The number of cases of measles in Switzerland has risen to 337 so far
this year [2011]. The outbreak is already 4 times higher than for the
entire year of 2010, likely due to cases spreading from bordering
France, federal government officials say. Nearly half of the cases
were recorded in Geneva, with another 78 cases in the Canton of Vaud.

The Federal Department of Public Health said France is facing an
outbreak of measles mostly because of missed vaccinations. More than
three-quarters of the 6500 European measles cases have been reported
in France, according to the World Health Organization.

1st outbreak of measles in 8 years prompts revaccination of 1.5M
Chileans
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The alert was given because of the appearance of 3 cases of measles
in March [2011]: a father, 35, a mother, 34, and her daughter 10
months. They were joined by a woman from eastern Santiago and the
doctor who attended her. What was significant was the age range of
infections, men and women between 30 and 37, in addition to the
infant. All had one thing in common: they had left the country or come
into contact with a traveler.

After 8 years with no transmission of measles in the country, this
was of concern for specialists at the Ministry of Health, who found
the answer in historical studies of immunization. Records revealed
that the age group described had not been covered by the vaccination
campaigns of the last decades or had had a lower dose of vaccine, so
that their immunity has expired or was deficient. "For a period a
single dose was used, because medical knowledge said that a single
dose was sufficient. This is now known to be insufficient, because
medical knowledge has changed in 30 years," said Jorge Diaz,
undersecretary of public health. Diaz added that other reasons for the
low immunization coverage group were economic crises and supply
difficulties.

According to the Health Ministry, the vulnerable group comprises
nearly 1.5 million people. "It is not as straight forward as
vaccination of children, where infants and young children are
vaccinated at clinics and healthcare centres, because adults are not
regularly monitored," said Carlos Perez, a member of the Advisory
Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Strategies (Cavei).

In addition, the group to be immunized will incur costs of about CLP
2500 million [about USD 5.4 million], making it difficult to achieve
complete coverage in a single campaign. Consequently the campaign will
be organised in phases, starting with specific groups at higher risk
of infection.

The plan is to immunize in the 2nd half of this year [2011] 50 000
people who are at greatest risk of importing measles, such as frequent
travelers, people who work in border areas and international
terminals, and health care personnel in the vulnerable age group. This
is in accordance with a recommendation by the World Health
Organization, which indicates the desirability of vaccinating
travelers.

The mode of implementation of vaccination, meanwhile, is another
matter that must be resolved. One possibility is to implement a
recommendation for those who leave the country. Another is to have
immunization be obligatory. "That is something that will have to be
reviewed by experts because it may involve legal issues," said Diaz.

Infants under one year of age are another group that could be
immunised. This is because vaccination now covers only children older
than one year, on the premise that the immunity obtained from the
mother protects the child from getting this virus until about 18
months. Another factor is that the age range of risk of contracting
measles fluctuates between 30 and 37 years, which coincides with
childbearing families. "Infants have immunity that is transmitted
during pregnancy by transplacental transfer and also through breast
milk. These antibodies can last up to a year and a half, but infants
born to unimmunised parents are at risk," said Carlos Perez, a member
of the Advisory Committee on Vaccines and Immunization Strategies
(Cavei).

Up to last month [April 2011], 33 European countries had reported
outbreaks of measles, with more than 6000 cases. Other outbreaks have
occurred in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, now
joined by Chile, to a lesser extent.

US on track for most measles cases in a decade
----------------------------------------------
The United States seems to be on track to have more measles cases
than any year in more than a decade, with virtually all cases linked
to other countries, including Europe where there's a big outbreak.
Already there have been 89 cases reported so far. The US normally sees
only about 50 cases of measles in a year thanks to vaccinations.
Health officials are reluctant to make predictions, but acknowledge
the pace of reports is unusually hot.

"It's hard to say, but we're certainly getting a lot," said Dr Greg
Wallace, who leads the measles, mumps, rubella, and polio team at the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Europe, especially
France, has been hit hard by measles, with more than 6500 cases
reported in 33 nations. International health officials are blaming it
on the failure to vaccinate all children. Just about all US outbreaks
were sparked by people bringing it here from other countries. This
week, international health officials posted an alert urging travelers
everywhere to get the recommended two doses of vaccine before flying
overseas.

"The risk of getting infection is very high," said Dr Cuauhtemoc Ruiz
Matus, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health
Organization. Measles is highly contagious and up to 90 per cent of
[unvaccinated] people exposed to an infected person get sick, experts
say. The virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms,
infected droplets can linger for up to 2 hours after the sick person
leaves.

"Measles is really the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable
diseases. It has a knack for finding those who have not been
vaccinated," Wallace said. The disease's most common symptoms include
fever, runny nose, cough, eye inflammation, and rash all over the
body. It takes about 2 weeks for the rash to appear from the time of
1st infection, and people are contagious from 4 days before a rash
appears to 4 days after. A small fraction of people gets much sicker,
developing pneumonia or even encephalitis. For every 1000 children who
get measles in developed nations, 1 or 2 will die.

In the US, the worst year for measles in the last decade was 2008,
when 140 cases were reported. There have been no measles deaths this
year [2011], but health officials warn the disease can be dangerous.
Since 2003, there have been no measles-related deaths reported in the
United States, where children have been getting vaccinated against the
virus for almost 50 years. Before the vaccine, nearly all children got
measles by their 15th birthday and epidemics cycled through the nation
every 2 to 3 years -- generally peaking in the late winter or spring.
In those days, about 450 to 500 Americans died from measles each year,
on average. Vaccination campaigns reduced the toll dramatically, and
today, roughly 90 per cent of US kids are protected from measles,
according to studies of teenagers.

Measles outbreak on Mendocino County coast
------------------------------------------
2 cases of measles have been reported on the Mendocino County coast
since 10 Apr 2011, a pattern that public health officials are calling
an outbreak. There had not been a measles case in Mendocino County
case in about 7 years, said public health nurse Erika Nosera.

All 3 cases of the highly contagious viral infection involve adults.
They are linked to a 32 year old visitor from France, where more than
5000 cases have been reported this year [2011], according to the
Mendocino County Public Health and Human Services Agency. One [now 2 -
Mod.CP] person has died and 8 suffered neurological complications in
France, health officials said.

11 other measles cases have been reported statewide since 1 Jan 2011,
and there has been a spike of the disease nationwide, officials said.
At least one case has been reported in Sonoma County in April. Nearly
all the cases in the United States are associated with travelers to
and from Europe and Asia, officials said. From 1988 to 1990 and
outbreak linked to travel infected 16 400 Californians, killing 75,
Nosera said.

Measles can spread through the air when someone who is ill coughs or
sneezes. The virus can stay in the air for as long as 2 hours, she
said. Symptoms begin with a fever that lasts a couple of days,
followed by a cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a rash.
Complications can include diarrhea, ear infection, pneumonia, and
death.

Nosera recommends that people with measles symptoms phone their
doctor or hospital rather than enter a waiting room, where the
infection could spread to others. "Ask to be seen in the parking lot,"
she said. The best defense against measles is vaccination, Nosera
said.

County officials would not say where the 3 cases occurred, but said
they had reached out to everyone known to have come in contact with
the 3 -- 85 people in all.

2 more measles cases in Johnson County
--------------------------------------
The Johnson County Health Department on Monday [2 May 2011] confirmed
2 more measles cases among school-age children. The children, who
developed symptoms over the weekend [30 Apr-1 May 2011], had come in
contact with another Johnson County child who became ill in mid-April,
said Nancy Tausz of the department. That case was the county's 1st in
nearly 6 years.

The 1st child to become ill had not been vaccinated against measles.
In the new cases, the children had received the vaccine, but not soon
enough to prevent symptoms.

Tausz said the Health Department was getting in touch with people who
had come in contact with the new cases. Any unvaccinated children
among the contacts will have to be vaccinated to remain in school, she
said.

Anyone who may have visited a Peddler's Village restaurant last
Saturday night [30 Apr 2011] is being asked to keep an eye out for
symptoms of measles. The viral disease may have been carried to the
Cock 'N Bull restaurant, which was hosting a Murder Mystery Dinner
Theater, on Saturday, Bucks County health department director David
Damsker said.

The virus that causes measles is easily spread from person to person
by droplets from the infected person's mouth and nose, but Bucks
health officials think the risk was low in this case.

"The case at Cock 'N Bull was not coughing and sneezing, so we don't
think she spread it to anyone else," Damsker said Friday [6 May 2011].
"But nothing is 100 per cent in medicine and public health, so we
wanted to get the word out to anyone who might have been there at the
same time. But we think there's a good chance that no one else got
sick."

Early symptoms of the measles include fever, cough, and runny nose,
like so many other viral diseases. But the skin rash that appears 3 to
5 days after exposure is a clue that the illness is more than just a
cold.

Anyone who might have been at the Cock 'N Bull that night [30 Apr
2011] who develops these symptoms should call their doctor. "If you
were at the Cock 'N Bull last Saturday and you develop a fever and a
rash, let your doctor know right away," Damsker said. "Be sure to tell
them on the phone that you may have been exposed to a suspected case
of measles. That way, they can bring you in and make sure there is no
one else in the waiting room at the time and make sure their staff is
properly protected."

The county health department announced on Thursday [5 May 2011] that
3 people in Bucks have come down with measles. 2 are children in the
Council Rock School District and one is an adult, the county said. The
adult who visited the Cock & Bull Saturday night also had visited Parx
Casino in Bensalem that morning.

The state health department already has confirmed that the 2 people
have measles, Damsker said. Further confirmation from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention is a routine formality; those test
results are expected back next week, Damsker said.

Measles is uncommon in the United States today, thanks to a
vaccination campaign in the late 1950s that mostly eradicated it.
Today, about 9 out of 10 children receive the measles, mumps, rubella,
or MMR, vaccine, before their 3rd birthday. The few hundred or so
cases reported across the country each year, typically are brought in
by visitors from other countries, according to CDC.

There were 7 confirmed cases of measles in Bucks County in 2009,
Brandy Hunter-Davenport, spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department
of Health, said on Friday [6 May 2011]. Before these 3 cases, there
were already 7 confirmed measles cases this year [2011], including a
6-case outbreak in January, Hunter-Davenport said. The department had
just prepared and released a newsletter article on measles in
Pennsylvania when word came of the Bucks cases.

Though most people who contract the measles recover from the disease
just fine, it can cause serious complications and can, in rare cases,
kill. The increasing incidence of diseases such as measles, that had
once been considered vanquished, demonstrates the importance of
widespread vaccination, health officials say. "Diseases that are rare
in the US are still circulating around the world," Damsker said in a
statement Thursday [5 May 2011], "and are only a plane flight away."

As for the 3 people in this outbreak, it is believed that French
foreign exchange students transmitted the virus to them, county
officials said, noting that France is dealing with a widespread
measles outbreak. Students at Council Rock High School North and
Newtown Middle School who have not been vaccinated against measles
will be removed from school until after 17 May 2011, when experts
estimate the incubation period will have ended.

Pennsylvania officials warn about measles exposures
---------------------------------------------------
The identification of 3 probable measles cases with links to French
foreign exchange students who were ill prompted health officials in
Pennsylvania counties yesterday [5 May 2011] to issue alerts about
possible exposures in 2 counties and one of the state's school
districts.

The Bucks County Health Department (BCHD) said in a statement that
the French foreign exchange students had experienced measles symptoms
but returned home before testing could be conducted. Several European
countries have reported measles outbreaks over the past few months,
with the highest levels of activity and number of cases occurring in
France.

The 3 patients with suspected measles infections live in the Council
Rock School District, and the affected schools and students are being
notified, the BCHD said. All were at least partially vaccinated.
Children who have not been vaccinated will be removed from the schools
until the possible illness incubation period is over. In a letter to
parents yesterday [5 May 2011] the school district said there has been
a confirmed case of measles at Council Rock High School North and
Newton Middle School.

Other possible exposures could have occurred the morning of 30 Apr
2011 at a casino in Bensalem and the evening of 30 Apr 2011 at a
restaurant murder mystery dinner in Lahaska, the health department
said. It is asking people who were at the locations and are
susceptible to the virus to observe for measles symptoms between
yesterday [5 May 2011] and 17 May 2011. Dr David Damsker, director of
the BCDH, said in the statement that the measles threat illustrates
the importance of vaccination. "Diseases that are rare in the US are
still circulating around the world, and are only a plane flight away,"
he said. "This is another reminder to check with your physician and
make sure you and members of your family are up-to-date on their
vaccinations."

In a related development, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH)
said its investigation of the 3 probable measles cases has found that
possible exposures could have occurred on 19 Apr 2011 in Lancaster
County, according to a statement. The 4 locations include an outlet
center, a bakery, a craft store, and a toyshop.

Meanwhile in Utah, 22 students and 10 staff at a Payson elementary
school who are not fully immunized against measles were sent home
yesterday [5 May 2011] because they may have been exposed to a student
who had positive results in preliminary testing for measles, the Salt
Lake Tribune reported. They have been asked to stay home until 10 May
2011 [see below].

So far Utah health officials have confirmed 9 measles cases and
investigated 40 suspected cases, according to the Tribune report. The
Salt Lake Valley Health Department has been tracking 12 000 people,
most of whom are school students. The Utah's measles cases also have
links to European travel. The outbreak is the state's 1st since 2005
and the largest since 1996.

Utah County student doesn't have measles
----------------------------------------
Utah County can breathe easy -- an elementary student thought to have
measles doesn't. The Utah County Health Department announced Friday
afternoon [6 May 2011] it received confirmation from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention "that the suspect case in Payson tested
negative for measles."

"While this didn't turn out to be a case, it is still a good reminder
for us to check our immunizations and be up-to-date," Lance Madigan,
the health department spokesman, said in a news release. "For
children, they should have 2 MMR vaccinations. For adults, if you know
you had 2 vaccinations or were born before 1957, you are good. If you
don't know, it doesn't hurt to get the booster."

Madigan said the child instead tested positive for a parvovirus.
Health officials erred on the side of caution when an initial lab test
for a student at Park View Elementary in Payson came back positive for
the contagious virus. The child's 22 classmates who hadn't been fully
vaccinated were excluded from school starting Thursday through Tuesday
[5-17 May 2011] in case they developed measles.

But health officials were skeptical that the child had the virus,
since he or she hadn't been exposed to a person known to have the
disease. The initial lab test can show false positives.

While public schools require incoming students to receive 2 MMR
doses, parents can sign waivers to exempt their children for
religious, medical, or personal reasons. An exempted student in Salt
Lake County is believed to be the cause of Utah's latest measles
outbreak. An unvaccinated school-age student who traveled to Poland
contracted the measles abroad and brought it back to school.

So far, Salt Lake County has logged 9 confirmed measles cases and
investigated 40 suspected cases. Salt Lake County's outbreak, which
started last month [April 2011], will officially end May 9 if no other
confirmed cases pop up.
