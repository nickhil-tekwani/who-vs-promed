re: Brucellosis, ovine - Russia (Moscow ex Volgograd)
-----------------------------------------------------
Just perhaps, if those sheep, or the affected ones, or a majority or
significant number of the affected ones were rams, they may have been
observed swaggering about in a strange, cowboy-like fashion, and with very
good reason, too, poor creatures!

"Both sheep and goats may show signs of lameness, hygroma, and cough but
the predilection sites of B. melitensis are the uterus, udder and the
mammary lymph nodes in females and the testicles in males. Strangely
enough, interference with fertility caused by orchitis seems to be limited.
Infected sheep and goats may excrete Brucella in the milk for years but
sheep may also cease excretion during one or more lactation periods."
(Alton, 1985; Stableforth and Galloway, 1959).

[Tom Kelly's observation is appreciated; indeed, orchitis is a
manifestation of _B. melitensis_ infection in rams (and he-goats). It
remains to be informed which "strange behavior" was seen in the sheep on
the affected farm and whether the 100-strong consignment of sheep,
reportedly (illegally) transported from Volgograd to the Moscow region,
consisted of males.

In female sheep, reproductive signs, namely abortion (usually in late
pregnancy), weak newborns, stillbirth, or retained placentae are the main
(and in most cases only) clinical expressions of _B. melitensis_ infection;
acute mastitis with palpable nodules may also sometimes occur, with clotted
and watery secretion. Cases may remain subclinical.

In rather exceptional cases, general signs (lameness or stiffness, limping)
and respiratory signs (coughing) may be seen. - Mod.AS]
