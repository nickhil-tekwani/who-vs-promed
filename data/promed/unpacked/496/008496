One of New Zealand's largest chicken suppliers is losing up to USD 5.8 million a month after a poultry virus saw its Australian exports stopped.

In September 2019, Type 1 bursal disease virus (IBDV type 1) was confirmed on 2 Otago hen farms owned by Mainland, a discovery causing the Ministry for Primary Industries to stop certifying all New Zealand poultry products as IBDV-1 free.

As a result, MPI stopped issuing export certificates to countries which required IBDV-1 free certification, meaning Tegel can no longer send product to Australia, its biggest export market. And while Tegel, which operates 3 plants around the country including one in Taranaki, has no connection to the 2 South Island farms, with every day the ban continues, it loses large sums of money.

A Tegel spokesperson said that depending on how long the ban remained in place, the estimated loss would be between USD 60 to USD 70 million annually - USD 5 to 5.83 million a month.

"Australia has been a growth market for Tegel, so the impact on the company's revenue has been significant."

Tegel's annual report for the year ending April 2018 showed it made USD 615.4 million in revenue with its export market, including Australia, the Pacific Islands, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines contributing USD 89.6 million.

The spokesperson said Tegel was using both the domestic market and other unaffected export markets to manage the volumes of chicken meat previously destined for Australia, but the ban would impact its suppliers.

"We are working with our contract growers to reduce volumes across the country so it will have an impact on them and all of our supply chain. The longer the ban is in place, the longer our suppliers will have to manage with reduced volumes."

Poultry Industry Association New Zealand executive director Michael Brooks wouldn't comment about any potential impact on Tegel's suppliers. "If they've made comments it's impacting, then clearly it is," Brooks said. "The individual circumstances of the contracts, what is happening there, is a matter I don't have the information on and I wouldn't want to speculate."

Brooks said that since the virus was confirmed, every flock in the entire country had been tested, and it [PIA, NZ] was positive the disease had not spread.

"That will make a difference in terms of the discussion with Australia, but even then, it will be a complex process."

MPI has previously said it was working closely with Tegel, the wider industry, and Australian authorities to reopen the important export market as soon as possible, but there were no set timeframes, and it could take a significant amount of time.

However, Tegel remained confident that once MPI confirmed that it could re-certify products to Australia, the good relationships it [Tegel] had formed with customers over the years would be of benefit when the market reopened, its spokesperson said.

["Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is seen in young domestic chickens worldwide and is caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Signs can include depression, watery diarrhea, ruffled feathers, and dehydration. Morbidity is high and mortality is usually low, but some very virulent strains are capable of causing 60 percent or higher mortality. Macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the cloacal bursa and molecular identification of the viral genome are used to diagnosis the disease. Vaccination to induce maternal immunity in young chicks is initially used to control the disease. Vectored and live-attenuated vaccines can be used to induce active immunity in chicks as the maternal antibodies wane."

"Two serotypes of IBDV have been identified. The serotype 1 viruses cause disease in chickens and, within them, antigenic variation can exist between strains. Antigenic drift is largely responsible for this antigenic variation, but antigenic differences can also occur through genome homologous recombination. Serotype 2 strains of the virus infect chickens and turkeys but have not caused clinical disease or immunosuppression in these hosts. IBDVs have been identified in other avian species, including penguins, and antibodies to IBDV have been seen in several wild avian species. The contribution of IBDV to disease in these wild birds is unknown.

"Infectious bursal disease is highly contagious; results of infection depend on age and breed of chicken and virulence of the virus. Infections may be subclinical or clinical. Infections before 3 weeks of age are usually subclinical. Chickens are most susceptible to clinical disease at 3-6 weeks of age when immature B cells populate the bursa and maternal immunity has waned, but severe infections have occurred in Leghorn chickens up to 18 weeks of age."

"In clinical infections, onset of the disease occurs after an incubation of 3-4 days. Chickens may exhibit severe prostration, incoordination, watery diarrhea, soiled vent feathers, vent picking, and inflammation of the cloaca. Flock morbidity is typically 100 percnet, and mortality can range from 5 percent to greater than 60 percent depending on the strain of virus and breed of chicken. Mortality is typically higher in layer breeds compared with broiler chickens. Recovery occurs in less than 1 week, and broiler weight gain is delayed by 3-5 days. The presence of maternal antibody will modify the clinical course of the disease.

"Virulence of field strains of the virus varies considerably. Viruses ranging from naturally attenuated to very virulent (vv) have been observed. The vvIBDV strains that can cause high mortality (greater than 20 percent) were first detected in Europe. They spread throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, were detected in South and Central America in 1999, and in the USA in 2009."

"There is no treatment. Rigorous disinfection of contaminated farms after depopulation has achieved limited success. Live vaccines of chicken embryo or cell-culture origin and of varying low pathogenicity can be administered by eye drop, drinking water, or SC routes at 1-21 days of age. Replication of these vaccines and thus the immune response can be altered by maternal antibody, although the more virulent vaccine strains can override higher levels of maternal antibody. Vectored vaccines that express the IBDV VP2 protein in herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) can be used in ovo or at hatch. These HVT-IBD vaccines are not affected by maternal antibodies. Vaccines that use live-attenuated viruses bound to antibodies (immune-complex vaccines) are also available for in ovo or at hatch administration."
