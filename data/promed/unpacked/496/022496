After Pune's National Institute of Virology (NIV) confirmed the presence of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ -- a mosquito which spreads Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus], the Brihanmumbai [Greater Mumbai] Municipal Corporation [BMC] said it would study the report and then take preventive measures.

"This is the 1st reported case of JE in the city [Mumbai]. We are yet to receive the NIV report and only after we study it, we can decide further preventive actions," said Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of epidemiology cell, BMC.

After a 9-year-old Santacruz [Mumbai] girl tested positive for JE in September [2014], municipal health officials had claimed that the JE [virus]-spreading mosquito is not present in Mumbai.

According to National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP), this year [2014], 1316 cases and 242 deaths from JE [virus] infection were recorded in the country. Assam has reported the highest number of cases (756) and deaths (163) in the country, according to NVBDCP.

Doctors said the detection of the vector or carrier increases the possibility of transmission of the JE [virus] infection. "Though it is relatively uncommon infection, JE has a high morbidity and mortality.

Dr Neelu Desai, the paediatric neurologist who treated the Santacruz girl, said that she has been treating patients with JE symptoms. "It is just that we must have not tested all patients for the infection. The laboratory test is not vital in most cases as the patient only needs symptomatic treatment," she said.

Senior state health officials plan to ask BMC's insecticide department to regularly collect and test _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito and larvae. "It is better we prevent the possibility of an outbreak," said an official.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic in many parts of India, and cases occur there annually, especially in the north east part of the country. The case above is the 1st one that ProMED has posted for Maharashtra state this year (2014). There was an outbreak of encephalitis in Maharashtra state in 2011 and JEV was the suspected cause, but was not laboratory confirmed (see ProMED-mail archive no 20111106.3302). Presumably, the 1316 cases nationally reported above for this year (2014) were laboratory confirmed, and West Nile virus (WNV) cases were excluded. WNV, a close relative of JEV, also occurs in India. Without reliable laboratory diagnosis, the number of reported cases can be confusing, as many are reported in India as acute encephalitis syndrome cases and sometimes presumed to be due to JEV infections when, in fact, they are not.

It is not clear why the detection of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ in Mumbai, Maharashtra state is reported to be surprising. This mosquito species is widely distributed over south and south eastern Asia, including India (see http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/taxon_descr.aspx?ID=18465. Was its detection in Mumbai part of ongoing routine mosquito surveillance, or prompted in response to the case of Japanese encephalitis virus infection in the child?
