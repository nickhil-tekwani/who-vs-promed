The Secretary of State for Public Health (SESPA) in Pará state, Brazil, is reporting 8 confirmed Mayaro virus cases last year [2021].

In Pará, the period of greatest transmission of these diseases occurs during the winter. Mayaro virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, through the bites of _Haemagogus janthinomys_, which also transmits yellow fever.

Of the 8 cases of Mayaro fever confirmed last year [2021], 2 of them were registered in Benevides and 6 in Igarapé Miri.

Mayaro virus -- which can cause fever, joint aches, muscle pains, headache, eye pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea -- first was isolated from the blood of 5 symptomatic workers in Mayaro County, Trinidad, in 1954. Since then, it has caused sporadic outbreaks and small epidemics in several South and Central American countries.

Because the symptoms of Mayaro infection are similar to those caused by other arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya, its prevalence in areas where these other viruses circulate may be higher than reported.

[Mayaro virus (MAYV) is endemic in Brazil. It has been found to cause human disease in Pará state and in other areas in Brazil. The 1st report of Mayaro virus cases was in 1955, in an outbreak in Pará state, Brazil. In 2011, thousands of cases of Mayaro fever were reported in an outbreak that occurred in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

As Mod.JT noted in an early ProMED post (20110220.0557), MAYV, of the _Alphavirus_ genus, Togaviridae family, is endemic in tropical areas of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela). In 2016, a MAYV infection occurred in a child in Haiti. The transmission cycle is very similar to that of the yellow fever virus, utilizing primates as reservoirs and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors.

MAYV has been associated with a variety of mosquitoes that are possible vectors that can transmit it to humans. MAYV has been isolated from _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ captured in the field in Brazil. _Anopheles_ mosquitoes have been implicated as important virus vectors (see references below).

Several public health experts have expressed concern that MAYV could become a significant problem in the tropical Americas. - Mod.TY
