LEPTOSPIROSIS - GUYANA (COASTAL)(04)

Why is it that we never know which Leptospira species/serovars are involved
worldwide in outbreaks reported by ProMED-AHEAD? I think this knowledge
should be very useful to understand the epidemiology of each outbreak, and to
establish and detect which reservoir (maintenance) species might be involved.
This could help us to eventually take opportune prophylactic measures.

[ProMED generally serves as a conduit, so when the species/serovar of
leptospirosis is reported, we pass that along. It is likely that more
definition than simply "leptospirosis" is not made, and that many of the
cases are only clinically diagnosed. Hans Andresen correctly points out the
importance of identifying the serovar(s) concerned. - Mods.LL, JW]
