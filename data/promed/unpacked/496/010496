Several equine viruses with potential for human infection have been
reported in Argentina.

The following background information is abstracted from Gideon
http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2]

1. TOGAVIRIDAE
A. Eastern equine encephalitis virus: Seropositivity toward eastern
equine encephalitis virus was demonstrated in wild and domestic birds,
wild mammals, and horses during 1977 to 1980. The principal mosquito
vector is _Aedes (_Ochlerotatus_) taeniorhynchus_. Additional vectors
include _Culex nigripalpus_, _Cx. caudelli_, _Cx. spissipes_ and _Cx.
taeniopus_. Eastern equine encephalitis has been reported from Buenos
Aires.

Notable outbreaks:
1981 - An outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis was reported among
equines in Santiago del Estero Province.

B. Western equine encephalitis virus: An epizootic was reported during
1982 to 1983, with continued cases to 1986. _Ochlerotatus (_Aedes_)
albifasciatus_ is the presumed vector in Argentina. During the
epidemic of 1982 to 1983, WEE virus was also demonstrated in
_Anopheles albitarsis_, _Mansonia_ species and _Psorophora
pallescens_.

C. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus: Complement-fixing antibodies
toward Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have been demonstrated
among humans in Corrientes and Chaco (1983 publication). Related
agents, Pixuna and Rio Negro viruses, have been identified among
rodents in Tucuman Province.

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 51.6 per cent of persons on General Belgrano Island, Formosa
Province (NT, 1993 publication)
- 30-70 per cent of persons on General Belgrano Island, Formosa
Province (NT, 2003 publication)

2. RHABDOVIRIDAE
A. Calchaqui virus: Seropositivity of humans and horses toward
Calchaqui virus has been demonstrated in Santa Fe Province. Calchaqui
virus has also been identified in a local mosquito.

B. Rabies (an extensive note regarding rabies in Argentina is
available on request) [Rabies signs are distinctive enough that it is
unlikely that rabies was responsible for the deaths of the burros. -
Mod.TY]

C. Vesicular stomatitis virus infection has been reported among
animals in Argentina (2011 publication) [Vesicular stomatitis viruses
produce vesicular disease in susceptible hosts, including equine
animals, but not encephalitis, so these viruses are not involved in
the burro deaths. - Mod.TY]

3. BUNYAVIRIDAE
A. Cache Valley, Kairi and Bunyamwera [group] viruses: [Bunyawera
prototype virus is from Africa, but related viruses of that complex
are present in Argentina. - Mod.TY]

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 5.7 per cent of human sera in Cordoba are seropositive toward Cache
Valley virus and 5.92 per cent toward Kairi virus (2004 to 2005) [see
comment below].
- 13.3 per cent of horses in Santa Fe and Cordoba are seropositive
toward Kairi virus, and 40 per cent toward Cache Valley virus (1983 to
1984).
- 6.6 per cent of free-ranging birds in Cordoba City were
seropositive toward Bunyamwera virus in 2004, 13.8 per cent in 2005.

4. FLAVIRIDAE
A. West Nile fever virus: West Nile fever virus was detected for the
1st time in Argentina in 2006 - 2 horses in San Antonio de Areco and
one in San Isidro, Buenos Aires Province.
- Infection was documented in free-ranging birds during 2005 to
2006.
- The country's 1st cases of human infection were reported in 2006,
one case in the city of Marcos Juarez in Cordoba Province and 3
additional cases in Chaco province.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for the interesting information. Perhaps one
of the above viruses is responsible for the encephalitis deaths and
illnesses among the burros of the Parque Faunistico, San Juan
province, in Argentina (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111126.3458). As
Mod.TG pointed out in the previous report, it is possible that,
arthropod-borne, virus-infected mosquitoes brought one of these
viruses into the park and infected the burros. However, given the
failure to find mosquitoes or their larvae in the park, it seems
unlikely that long-distance flight by one or more of these infected
mosquitoes occurred, with them coming to the park and transmitting the
virus to all 8 of the affected burros at the same time.

Una virus has been isolated from horses in Argentina, and antibodies
to it. Aura, Magauri and Saint Louis encephalitis viruses (high
antibody prevalence but no clinical disease in Argentina) have been
found in equine animals.

Calchaqui virus and subtypes of Melao and Maguari viruses have been
isolated in Argentina and neutralizing antibodies found in horses and
humans. Maguari virus is a pathogen causing encephalitis in horses.

In Argentina, a bunyamwera group virus (CbaAr-426) was isolated from
_A. albifasciatus_ and _Ps. varinervis_, both mosquito species that
feed mainly from mammals. Kairi virus was isolated from febrile
horses.

One hopes that laboratory results will identify the etiologic agent
involved in the deaths and infections of the burros and provide some
information about the potential risk to human health as well. -
