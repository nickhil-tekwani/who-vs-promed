Panic has gripped this village [Gehri Bhagi], near Bathinda, with
more than 3000 birds having died due to an unidentified disease at a
poultry farm. Veterinarians of the Animal Husbandry Department have
launched an inspection of all poultry farms within a radius of 3 km
(2 mi) of the farm.

Department officials have ruled out the presence of avian influenza
virus in the dead birds, but they feel that the birds' death might be
due to some other deadly virus "because the birds did not react even
to the antibiotic medicines given to them," Dr Darshan Singh, deputy
director of the department told The Tribune today [8 Mar 2008].

The poultry birds started dying last week. When this correspondent
visited the farm, only 40 birds were left alive. These too were
visibly suffering from the disease.

"Samples have been collected from the poultry farm and sent to the
High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal. We don't think it's
the case of avian influenza because the virus affects humans as well
whereas the family of the poultry farm owner was unaffected by the
disease," Dr Darshan Singh said [This is not the argument of choice
to exclude HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1; no human
cases have been discovered in India so far in the 2008 affected
regions. - Mod.AS] Teams from the veterinary and animal husbandry
departments have been visiting the farm ever since they got to know
about the death of the birds.

Animal Husbandry Department officials have said the birds had nasal
discharge, eye discharge, sneezing, riffled feathers, and many more
other symptoms. All birds were one month old.

Poultry farm owner Jagsir Singh, who has suffered a loss to the tune
of around INR 2-3 lakh [USD 5000-7500] in the death of the birds,
said: "All this started almost a week ago. On the 1st day, 3 birds
died and I immediately contacted the microbiologist at the Veterinary
Polyclinic in Bathinda. But the birds did not respond to the
antibiotics given to them. On the 2nd day, 78 birds died while the
toll went up to 1000 on the 3rd day.

The next day 500 more birds died and by the end of this week, almost
all birds had died. We thought that the death of the birds was due to
some deadly virus because the they did not even get time to react to
the medicines given to them."

"All of my birds were fully vaccinated and all kinds of precautionary
measures were taken ever since I started this poultry farm in 1999.
From time to time, I have been taking guidance from the Animal
Husbandry Department, Punjab Agricultural University as well as other
veterinary doctors. Till date, mortality percentage at my farm was
just 4-5, which is considered normal," he added.
