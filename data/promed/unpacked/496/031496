The Territorial Administration of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service
for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] for [Krasnoyarsky Krai
(Krasnoyarsk territory) -- see comment at end] reports that a mass
mortality of wild birds was detected on Lake Tagarskoe of the
Minusinskiy Rayon [Minusinsk district] of [Krasnoyarsk] on 18 Sep
2010. By estimate over 1000 birds died. The reason for the deaths is
being determined now.

Samples of the pathological material have been taken from dead birds
and sent to KGBU "Regional veterinary laboratory" of [Krasnoyarsk] and
to FGI "ARRIAH" [Federal Centre for Animal Health, OIE Regional
Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and
Transcaucasia in Vladimir, Russia]. [Birds do not die from FMD
(foot-&-mouth disease). - Mod.JW]

The collected bird carcasses were destroyed by burning.

On 19 Sep 2010, restrictions were imposed by the Administration of the
Minusinsk District Decision on the movement of transport along the
roads close to the lake. Veterinary-police posts were set up on the
roads which lead to the lake and hunting on the lakes of the
Minusinskiy Rayon is prohibited.

The OAO "Shushenskaya Poultry Plant" is situated 35 km [22 mi] from
Lake Tagarskoe. Over 250 birds are kept there [this sounds more like
the modest size of a backyard flock; is there an error here?! -
Mod.AS]. The Territorial Administration of Rosselkhoznadzor for
[Krasnoyarsk] carried out inspections in order to check whether the
activities aimed at prevention of avian influenza virus introduction
are performed at the poultry plant. According to the information of
the Territorial Administration, OAO "Shushenskaya Poultry Plant" works
in a "closed-type" regime.

Groups for monitoring of diseases in wild and synanthropic
[ecologically associated with humans] birds near water basins have
been formed and equipped in the southern regions of [Krasnoyarsk].

The information on [the results of] laboratory tests will be provided later.

[Results of the laboratory investigation are awaited, with particular
reference to HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza). - Mod.AS]

[Since the location was a lake, they were presumably water birds. It
would be important to know what species were involved. - Mod.JW]

[The location is mistranslated as Krasnodar, in southern Russia, in
the English version. Krasnoyarsk territory, in central Siberia, can be
