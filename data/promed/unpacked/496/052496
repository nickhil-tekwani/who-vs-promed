Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: [On 20 Sep 2018], 400 000 whiteleg shrimps (_L. vannamei_) were stocked in a farm located in Taimali Township, Taitung County. [On 25 Nov 2018], increased morbidity (2.5%) and mortality (1.25%) rates were observed in 10 000 of the whiteleg shrimps. The Livestock Disease Control Center (LDCC) of Taitung County collected samples that were sent to the National Laboratory Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) [on 26 Nov 2018]. PCR result was positive for AHPND. Paired samples were collected by the LDCC of Taitung County and sent to the AHRI [on 18 Dec 2018] for confirmatory test. AHPND was confirmed by the AHRI [on 4 Mar 2019], based on the diagnostic criteria laid down in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animal. Since [22 Dec 2018], no abnormality has been found in the index farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: Killing for commercial use or own use; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory) / Whiteleg shrimp (_L. vannamei _) / Histopathological examination / 4 Mar 2019 / Positive
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory) / Whiteleg shrimp (_L. vannamei _) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 4 Mar 2019 / Positive

["Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), initially referred to as early mortality syndrome (EMS), is a shrimp disease caused by some pathogenic strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and likely some pathogenic strains of other _Vibrio_ species in the _Vibrio harveyi_ group. AHPND emerged as a new disease in 2009; it has resulted in severe mortality in farmed penaeid shrimp and significant economic losses in Southeast Asia and Mexico. AHPND most frequently occurs within the first 30 days after stocking a newly prepared shrimp pond. Infected shrimp show lethargy, slow growth, an empty stomach and midgut and a pale to white atrophied hepatopancreas.

"AHPND has been reported from farmed populations of _L. vannamei_ and _Penaeus monodon_.

"AHPND has caused severe mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp throughout Southeast Asia and Mexico. Countries reporting AHPND include China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Mexico." Source: https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/121558
