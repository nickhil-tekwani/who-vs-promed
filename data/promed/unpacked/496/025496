Chilean health authorities have declared a state of alert after the
detection of cholera bacteria in the central coastal area of the
country.
The Ministry stated that it has urged all health services to activate
cholera control measures. There have been no reports of illness, but
recommendations have been issued for hygiene precautions as well as
for special care in the preparation of foods, particularly vegetables
and seafood.
The reports indicate that cholera bacteria were detected between the
localities of Tejas Verdes and Llolleo, in the estuary of the Maipo
river, 62 miles west of Santiago.
Chile has not had cases of cholera over the past 5 years, after
controlling an outbreak that originated in neighboring Peru that
affected approximately 150 persons between 1991 and 1994.
