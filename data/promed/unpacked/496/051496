The Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) has noted a high number of dead hippopotamuses along the Okavango River near Mohembo.

A statement from the from DWNP says the carcases are floating in the river from Namibia into Botswana. "The cause of death is not known at the moment. The veterinarians are working hard to establish it," says the statement.

The public is therefore warned not to touch any carcass found along the river or anywhere else. "Eating meat of these animals will be very dangerous as Anthrax is suspected to be causing the mortalities. Any sightings are to be reported to the nearest DWNP office, police station or kgotla".

[Mohembo is on the Botswana/Namibian border, and the Okavango river comes straight from the Bwabwata NP; see:
http://www.citymaphq.com/botswana/botswana_general/mohembo.html

According to Wikipedia: "Before it enters Botswana, the river drops 4 metres in a series of rapids known as Popa Falls, visible when the river is low, as during the dry season." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okavango_River] So these carcasses may be poor condition. But either way, the warning to the locals not to butcher them is very wise. - Mod.MHJ
