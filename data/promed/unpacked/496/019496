5 people have died, while 350 others have tested positive for typhoid in Gweru, the 3rd largest city in Zimbabwe. Health and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa said residents who contracted the waterborne disease are being treated at various clinics across the city.

The disease was initially thought to be confined to 4 villages of the city, in the oldest, largest, and most-run down high-density suburb of Mkoba. However, Dr Parirenyatwa said it has spread to all parts of the city since detection on 23 Jul 2018.

Preliminary investigations suggest the outbreak was caused by the widespread consumption of contaminated water from council taps and boreholes. "It is clear that tap and borehole water in Gweru is not safe for drinking. We have patients who fell sick after drinking water from taps and boreholes. I am, therefore, overriding any other statement that has been issued before to declare that water in Gweru is unsafe for human consumption. From now on, the government will provide water treatment pills, and the municipal authorities should immediately use water tankers to provide residents with clean drinking water," Dr Parirenyatwa said.

According to the minister, some patients exhibited signs and symptoms that are inconsistent with typhoid. This could indicate the presence of some harmful chemicals in piped and underground water for domestic consumption.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Gweru (named Gwelo until 1982) is a city in central Zimbabwe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gweru). Located near the geographical center of the country, it is the capital of Midlands province. Originally the area was known to the indigenous Ndebele as "The Steep Place" because of the Gweru River's high banks. - Mod.LL
