Outbreak of Toxoplasmosis in Cuiaba, Brazil
-------------------------------------------
No new cases of toxoplasmosis were recorded as of Friday afternoon [30
Sep 2011] in Cuiaba. An outbreak, with 30 cases reported [in a 9 day
period], placed teams of health surveillance and combat endemic
diseases on alert. So far, 18 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests
and one discarded. The other cases are still being investigated.
Pregnant women are the people who most need to be careful.

According to the coordinator of the Epidemiological Surveillance of
the Municipal Health, Ivanete Fotunato, as people are learning to
recognize the symptoms of the disease, [new suspected cases] should
arise.

In most people, toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic. In those who develop
the disease, the main symptoms are fever, appearance of lumps in the
neck and neck, red patches on the body and swollen liver and spleen.

But, Fortunato warned, confirmation of toxoplasmosis infection can
only be made by medical professionals and thorough clinical
examination. The Assistant Secretary for Health of Cuiaba, Euze
Carvalho, reminded that toxoplasmosis is a benign disease with simple
evolution, which can be treated with antibiotics.

It [toxoplasmosis] usually leaves no sequel. The major concern is with
pregnant women, who can transmit the infection to the fetus and the
infected child runs the risk of being born with some type of
congenital malformation. This is the only form of transmission between
humans. Cats are natural hosts of the protozoan _Toxoplasma gondii_
and their feces are the main source of infection.

The disease can be avoided through good hygiene and avoiding contact
with materials (sand and earth) and places where cats tend to deposit
their droppings, such as parks, buildings and vacant lots. Moreover,
it is recommended to drink water from a reliable source, wash fruits
and vegetables and not consume raw or undercooked meats, especially
pork and lamb.

[Outbreaks of toxoplasmosis are rarely reported, however,
well-documented outbreaks of waterborne toxoplasmosis have been
described from Canada, India and Brazil (see below and de Moura L et
al. Waterborne toxoplasmosis, Brazil, from field to gene. Emerg Infect
Dis. 2006 Feb;12(2):326-9).

A study from Brazil has clearly shown that the use of surface water
for consumption is a risk factor for being _Toxoplasma_
IgG-seropositive (Bahia-Oliveira LM et al. Highly endemic, waterborne
toxoplasmosis in north Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis.
2003;9:55-62).

The statement that infection with _Toxoplasma gondii_ "usually leaves
no sequel" is not true. As discussed in the paper by de Moura et al.
the _T. gondii_ genotypes in Brazil are more pathogenic compared to
genotypes in Europe, and acquired toxoplasmosis will, therefore,
result in toxoplasma eye disease in a proportion of cases. Indeed, the
outbreak in Vancouver, Canada and in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Southern
India were both discovered because of a sudden high number of patients
with symptomatic, toxoplasma eye disease.

The municipal authorities need to look for contamination of the water
sources by _T. gondii_ oocysts as an obvious source of the outbreak.

Outbreaks due to contaminated meat have also been described (reviewed
in Taylor S (Ed.) Advances in Food and Nutrition Research, Academic
Press 2010). In general, food borne outbreaks do not affect as many
people as waterborne outbreaks, but only thorough epidemiological
investigation can determine the source of infection.
