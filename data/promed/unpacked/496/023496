https://www.wired.com/story/new-covid-19-antibody-study-results-are-in-are-they-right/


Last month [March 2020] residents of Santa Clara County, California, stuck at home and newly reacquainted with the Facebook scroll, may have noticed an unusual proposition pop up in their feed: a targeted ad from researchers at Stanford's medical school offering blood antibody tests for COVID-19. The curious who clicked through were offered a plan to arrive at a parking lot somewhere in the county, where a volunteer would give them a quick finger prick through their car window.

So-called serological tests work differently from COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which require a nose or throat swab and look for viral RNA. Instead, they check a person's blood for evidence of an immune response to the virus, which can be found even in people with no symptoms or those who have already recovered from the disease. Researchers have eagerly awaited those kinds of tests to gain insight into the true infection and fatality rates across age groups, and to help answer questions about things like asymptomatic spread and how long antibodies last -- a key part of understanding how COVID-19 immunity might work. In early April [2020], more than 3000 people took the Stanford researchers up on their offer.

The results, posted Friday [17 Apr 2020] by the Stanford researchers as a preprint (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1.full.pdf), haven't been peer-reviewed. But they have gotten a lot of attention. And they've quickly become emblematic of this age of rapid-fire scientific communications: Surprising results are widely shared before they are published in an academic journal, followed by an attempt at peer review by Twitter thread.

1st, the results: The Stanford researchers calculated that between 2.5 percent and 4.2 percent of the county's residents were infected as of early April [2020]. That sounds like a reasonably small number, but if true, it would mean COVID-19 is drastically more widespread than local swab testing suggests: 50- to 85-fold, the researchers calculated. The math that follows from there is even more significant. Assuming a higher infection rate consequently lowers the disease's estimated fatality rate, driving it from around 1 percent to just 0.12 to 0.2 percent. For the record, the death rate from the flu is about 0.1 percent.

"The comparison with the flu can be polarizing. I hope that's not the headline," Eran Bendavid, an infectious disease professor at Stanford and a coleader of the study, said at a press conference Friday [17 Apr 2020], where he stressed that the seriousness of the pandemic shouldn't be understated. Of course, for many -- especially those who think the pandemic is overblown -- that was the headline. The comparison even made it into a Wall Street Journal editorial published Friday [17 Apr 2020] by Andrew Bogan, a local biotech investor and one of the coauthors of the study (though he wasn't identified as such in the editorial). Had policy officials held a comparison with influenza in mind, "would they have risked tens of millions of jobs and livelihoods?" he wondered.

Then on Monday [20 Apr 2020], more fuel was added to the fire. A group at the University of Southern California, sharing a subset of authors with the Stanford group, as well as the same tests and similar methodology, released the conclusions of a serosurvey (http://createsend.com/t/j-296D9D8CE54262BB2540EF23F30FEDED ) of residents in Los Angeles County. The exact figures were different -- they calculated 28 to 55 times more cases than previously caught via swab testing -- but the gist of their conclusions was the same.

Skeptics have noted that the conclusions seem at odds with some basic math. In New York City, where more than 10 000 people, or about 0.1 percent of the population, have already died from COVID-19, this estimated fatality rate would mean nearly everyone in the city has already been infected. That's unlikely, since the number of new cases, and deaths, is still mounting, fast. Others pointed to the Stanford group's unusual use of Facebook recruitment, which may have drawn in people who were sick in February [2020] or March [2020] and couldn't get a swab test to confirm it -- the situation for a lot of people in Santa Clara County, an early COVID-19 hot zone where tests were initially scarce. That could have led to an oversampling of people who had antibodies to the virus. Others, noting that only 50 out of the 3330 people tested, or 1.5 percent, actually tested positive, quibbled with the methods used to weight the sample, which skewed heavily white and female. (The USC researchers say their sample is more representative, albeit smaller, and was chosen by gathering participants through a market research firm, not Facebook.)

All of that might be moot if the testing devices used in both surveys turn out to be flawed. The results come amid widespread concerns about the accuracy of blood antibody tests -- especially the rapid lateral flow tests like the ones used in this study. The Stanford preprint referred to a test from Premier Biotech, based in Minneapolis, but that company is only a distributor. The firm that makes the test, Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, was previously identified by NBC as among those recently banned from exporting COVID-19 tests because its product hasn't been vetted by China's equivalent of the FDA. A representative for Premier Biotech confirmed to WIRED that the same test was used by the Stanford and USC researchers. (On Monday [20 Apr 2020], a USC spokesperson emailed WIRED a statement from Neeraj Sood, the lead researcher, acknowledging the test's origins and noting they were exported legally, prior to the ban.)

At Stanford, the researchers performed their own validation of the tests and found only false negatives, not false positives. But, as a chorus of statisticians have noted (including one who concluded his analysis by demanding an apology from the researchers for wasting everyone's time), even a low false positive rate would wipe out the significance of their results. Representatives for Stanford declined to make the researchers available for follow-up questions, including whether they planned to retest the positive individuals.

Reached by email, Sood wrote that his USC team did not plan to confirm the positive results with additional blood tests, but had offered genetic swab tests to those who had tested positive and might have current infections. Speaking at the press conference Monday [20 Apr 2020], Sood acknowledged the results were "preliminary," but said they fell in line with his expectations about the scale of untested infections.

The Stanford researchers said at their press conference on Friday [17 Apr 2020] that they've accounted for the potential biases in who volunteered and that they stood by their validation methods. They also pointed out that outcomes might be different in Santa Clara County than in overwhelmed New York City. "It seems to me that when the hospitals are overrun, that can make this epidemic a lot worse," Bendavid said. The researchers do not intend to replicate the tests in Santa Clara, though they note others are conducting serosurveys in the Bay Area. In Los Angeles, they plan to do another round of tests in coming weeks.

That, at least, is one point everyone in this debate agrees on: More serosurveys are a good thing, and will ideally involve properly validated tests and representative populations. "We should be rolling out these tests to everybody," said Martin Hibberd, an infectious disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

While Hibberd called the methods used in the Santa Clara study "dubious," he also said the group's conclusions do likely point in the right direction -- that the fatality rate will come down as more undetected cases are uncovered. That is true of any disease outbreak. Other initial serosurvey results trickling in over recent weeks, from places like Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, as well as China, seem to back that up. While the rates of seroprevalence vary -- from 1 percent among Scottish blood donors tested in mid-March [2020] to 15 percent in one hard-hit German town -- they all generally point to lots of untested people. But it's still a matter of how many. "It's been guesswork really," Hibberd added. "Just to see the 1st bit of data is quite exciting."

Even assuming solid tests and methods, this 1st round of serosurvey results only gives us a snapshot of the disease's progress in each place. That means uncertainties abound, Hibberd noted. Antibodies take time to develop, and people also take time to recover -- or die -- from the disease. We're still at a relatively early stage of data collection when the actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 remains uncertain. New York, for example, recently revised its death toll upward to include "likely cases" of COVID-19.

A better use for these very early results is the simple one: a rough estimate of how much further we have to go in this pandemic. One hope among researchers is that we will get to a point of herd immunity when enough people have antibodies to slow or stop the disease's transmission. (That's still just a hope, given uncertainties about whether antibodies correspond to actual immunity.) But so far, all the serosurveys show results in the single digits, which means the virus remains dangerous to most of the population.

In the Netherlands, for example, the seroprevalence figure of 3 percent released Thursday [16 Apr 2020] by Sanquin, the national blood bank, wasn't exactly cause for celebration. "I hoped for a few percent more," Hans Zaaijer, a microbiologist at Sanquin who is leading the testing effort, wrote in an email to WIRED. He noted false positives are an issue with the test they used as well. (More accurate lab-based blood tests are currently being reserved for healthcare workers; Sanquin's study anonymously tests the blood of anyone who donates to the bank.) But for Zaaijer, the takeaway is clear: With only 3 percent of the population showing the antibody, many more people could still be infected by COVID-19, and herd immunity -- if it exists -- is a far-off vision. The plan in Holland is to keep on testing the blood bank supply once a month.

That kind of repetition will be important if we want to answer more complicated questions about the disease, according to Michael Busch, director of the Vitalant Research Institute, which is partnering with the National Institutes of Health to test antibody prevalence in blood donations in 6 cities across the US. Those tests will also happen monthly, which is useful not only for tracking the spread of the disease over time, but for validating results and ironing out potential biases. (Blood donation tests aim to be more representative than Facebook targeting, but they also skew toward healthy people who are eligible to give blood.)

Their method involves lab-based blood tests from Abbott and Ortho, which were validated in the past week by the FDA and are generally held to be more accurate than the finger prick tests. They will do additional validation on all results that come back positive. "That's what we do, always," he said. "We do repeat testing and confirmatory testing so we're absolutely sure it is a positive for antibodies." A separate study is also planned to track individuals with confirmed infections to see whether these people's antibody levels wane over time, and use that data to help calibrate the population-based results. And there are plans too to expand to more cities over time to get a better sense of the national picture.

In short, it's likely we'll have to wait a little longer before we have clear numbers about how many people have been exposed to this virus and how many have died from it. And when making important policy decisions that affect life and livelihood, that's a good thing, Busch said: "It's a big deal to do it right."

[The article above is a form of journalistic peer review on the 2 serosurveys discussed above.

The preliminary report of findings of the USC (University of Southern California) - LA (Los Angeles) county study can be found at http://createsend.com/t/j-296D9D8CE54262BB2540EF23F30FEDED. A key summation of the findings: "Based on results of the 1st round of testing, the research team estimates that approximately 4.1% of the county's adult population has antibodies to the virus. Adjusting this estimate for statistical margin of error implies about 2.8% to 5.6% of the county's adult population has antibody to the virus -- which translates to approximately 221 000 to 442 000 adults in the county who have had the infection. That estimate is 28 to 55 times higher than the 7994 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the county by the time of the study in early April [2020]. The number of COVID-19 related deaths in the county has now surpassed 600."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Background
"Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County.

"Methods
"On [3-4 Apr 2020], we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 3330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity. We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test manufacturer's data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both.

"Results
"The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI [confidence interval] 1.11-1.97%), and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81% (95CI 2.24-3.37%). Under the 3 scenarios for test performance characteristics, the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49% (95CI 1.80-3.17%) to 4.16% (2.58-5.70%). These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48 000 and 81 000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April [2020], 50- 85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases.

"Conclusions
"The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections."

Yes, there are still questions on the sensitivity and specificities of the antibody tests currently available. That being said, recent "captive population" PCR studies have shown very high asymptomatic infection rates (see COVID-19 update (110): global, asymptomatic infections ship and shelter, WHO 20200418.7238904) Approximately 60% of sailors on a ship had positive PCRs for the SARS-CoV-2 and were asymptomatic. 100% of PCR positive individuals at a homeless shelter were asymptomatic. While follow-up data to know how many, if any, went on to develop symptoms, raw data from China in recent days seem to suggest the conversion rate from asymptomatic to symptomatic is relatively low in their population.

These studies are paramount to understanding more about the epidemiology of this disease (COVID-19). - Mod.MPP

- During a virtual meeting (https://www.afro.who.int/news/african-regulatory-agencies-ethics-committees-expedite-covid-19-clinical-trial-reviews) convened by WHO, national regulatory authorities and national ethics committees across Africa agreed to combine their expertise to expedite clinical trial reviews and approvals.

- WHO continues to secure vital supply chains, set-up logistical hubs, and deliver critical supplies. For more see the 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: WHO Operations Support and Logistics update
-------------------------------------------------------------
- WHO leads UN collaboration to secure vital supplies for COVID-19 response
The COVID-19 Supply Chain System (CSCS), managed by the Supply Chain Task Force, is a collaborative effort across UN and non-UN actors. WHO leads the prioritisation and allocation of medical supplies and equipment, while the World Food Programme (WFP) acts as logistics lead to direct shipment and distribution of goods to governments or UN country offices.

The CSCS will identify, certify, source, allocate, direct, and deliver essential medical supplies and equipment to where they are needed most during this acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It will have 8 global hubs and will deploy 16 747s and medium-sized cargo aircraft, as well as passenger planes for monthly shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, lab equipment, oxygen, and medical and technical personnel.

- New humanitarian air hub in Ethiopia delivers WHO cargo of critical supplies to 32 countries across Africa
On [14 Apr 2020], the Government of Ethiopia and WFP opened a new hub at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from which COVID-19 supplies will be transported by air to destinations across Africa. The 'Addis Ababa Humanitarian Air Hub' is part of an overall UN initiative to scale up procurement and distribution of protective equipment and medical supplies for the COVID-19 response.

The 1st 'Solidarity Flight' left Addis Ababa on [14 Apr 2020] to deliver critical supplies to 32 countries in Africa to help contain the spread of COVID-19. The airlift represents the largest single shipment of medical supplies from WHO since the start of the pandemic. The WHO cargo was transported by the WFP and included one million facemasks and other personal protective equipment, along with thermometers and laboratory supplies to support case detection and testing activities. The cargo also included a large quantity of medical supplies donated by the Jack Ma Foundation.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is providing technical support and coordination for the distribution of the supplies.

- Securing commitments for millions of COVID-19 tests, masks, goggles, and other PPE
WHO has established 3 buyers consortia -- a PPE Consortium, a Diagnostics Consortium, and a Clinical Care Consortium -- to address global market shortages in critical supplies required for the global COVID-19 response. Each consortium is working to ensure that some critical supplies are reserved to meet the requests of countries most in need, especially low- to medium income countries with severely limited resources.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative has helped the Diagnostics Consortium negotiate with manufacturers to secure commitments for 10 million tests over the next 16 weeks.

Market demand for clinical care equipment is estimated to be 20 times the historical demand, with oxygen concentrators unlikely to be available before September at the earliest. WHO continues to work with private sector partners on procurement efforts to secure supplies of oxygen, consumables, and accessories for oxygen therapy.

WHO is also continuing to work to secure higher volumes of masks, gloves and other vital equipment to protect healthcare workers and vulnerable populations.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 34 869 new cases (42.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 2071 deaths (40.5% of the global newly reported deaths). 79.4% of the newly confirmed cases were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 5.9% and Canada at 4.2%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 28.5% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 20.5%, Peru at 16.8%, and Mexico at 10.6%.

The European region reported 38 143 new cases (46.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 2756 deaths (53.9% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 26.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region; the UK and Turkey each reported 12.3%, Spain 11.2%, Italy 5.9%, France 5.4%, and Germany 4.7%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5037 new cases (6.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 137 deaths (2.7% of the global newly reported deaths). Iran reported 1294 new cases representing 25.7% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 22.3%, Pakistan at 15.8%, Qatar 11.3%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.6%.

The African region reported 795 new cases (1.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 42 deaths (0.8% of the global newly reported deaths). There were 24 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, Cameroon reported 18.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Guinea at 18.2%, South Africa at 17.9%, Algeria at 11.2%, and Tanzania at 10.6%.

The Western Pacific region reported 2068 new cases (2.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 37 deaths (0.7% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 69.0% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 17.7% and the Philippines 9.7%. Given the high proportion of cases reported by Singapore, removing it from the denominator, Japan represents 57.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by the Philippines at 31.2%, and Malaysia at 5.5%.

The South East Asia region reported 2094 new cases (2.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 66 deaths (1.3% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 63.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 23.5% and Indonesia at 8.8%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 64.9% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 24.4%, Sri Lanka 4.4%, Thailand 3.8%, and the Maldives 2.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends, and has rebounded today with the European region increasing following the weekend. The America's region does not appear to have decreased, One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region. One wonders if the cases globally may have peaked near 6 Apr 2020. Time will tell.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 4 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
