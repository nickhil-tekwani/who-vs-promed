The use of traps in surveying wild animal populations concerns me greatly
where these are not effectively sterilised or even cleaned and disinfected
between uses. In my experience, the cleaning of traps with water and brushes
and perhaps soap or detergent is ineffective. Considering the time animals
spend in these once trapped, and that they often defaecate and urinate in
the traps, they are at great risk of harbouring a myriad different bacteria,
protozoa, fungi, helminths, and even ectoparasites. Moving these traps
between sites and populations poses a high potential for transferring
pathogens.
This has been hypothesised as a primary cause for reduced rates of capture
that are not attributable to trap-shyness noted, by some ecologists when
surveying populations over medium to long terms. The risks posed by novel
pathogens are much greater in endangered species that often exist in
isolated (hence immunologically naive), small (hence often inbred)
populations that are surveyed more frequently and intensively because of
their endangered status.
It would be of interest to many wildlife veterinarians and biologists to
determine how often traps, bags, and other survey equipment are sterilised
between uses.

We bait and set out our traps each time we go to our sites. We leave them
open for the 3-day trapping interval. If a trap is closed and has a rodent
in it, we pick up the entire trap, take it back to a central processing
area, and do the processing. We then replace this trap with a fresh trap.
Any trap that has had a rodent in it (even if we only find "evidence" of
its presence), is cleaned in a weak solution of Lysol.
We never reuse a dirty trap, for a bunch of reasons, including but not
limited to spread of pathogens.
