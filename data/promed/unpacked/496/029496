Five people were hospitalized with anthrax in the Bishkek infectious
diseases hospital, the press service of the republic's Interior
Ministry reported on Friday [10 Aug 2007]. All the patients lived in
a village in Bishkek's suburban Sokuluksky district, and "had
contacts with infected cattle during slaughtering."
Two dogs also died after eating a slaughtered cow. Police found that
the meat had been sold to the shop Yust at the Oshsky market, the
largest in Bishkek.
"Measures are being taken to identify the contacts during the sale of
the meat," a police report said. Veterinary services, assisted by
law-enforcement personnel, are disinfecting the places where the cow
was kept before it was slaughtered.

Two cases of anthrax have been reported in the Soluksky district of
the Chuysk region of Kyrgyzstan, according to the Republican Center
of Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections. On 7 Aug 2007, 2
inhabitants of the village of Gavrilovka, a married couple -- a
43-year-old man and a 51-year-old woman -- were admitted to the
Republican infectious hospital with suspicion of anthrax.
In connection with this case, experts of the Republican Center
Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Infections, Republican Clinical
Infectious Diseases Hospital together with the Department of
Veterinary Science have carried out the joint investigation. Experts
visited a focus of infection and established that people had
contracted the disease on 29 Jul 2007 through the slaughter of a sick
cow. The 1st symptoms of disease -- high temperature, ulcers on the
hands and forearms -- appeared on 5 Aug 2007. After that, they were
given medical aid and were hospitalized. Now anthrax in these
patients has been [laboratory] confirmed.
It has been discovered that the man had entertained his neighbors and
relatives with gifts of meat.
On suspicion of anthrax, 3 more inhabitants of the village of
Gavrilovka have been hospitalized in the infectious department of
Sokuluksky district regional hospital for diagnosis and the carrying
out of inspections.
Also, an urgent session of all interested organizations was held on 8
Aug 2007. A plan of measures for prevention of disease has been
authorized by the commission. Quarantine-restrictive measures
established in Gavrilovka are as follows: import and export of
animals and cattle-breeding production is forbidden; enforcement of
these restrictions in the local markets is being amplified. The
remaining meat was withdrawn in the center of an infection. Tests of
ground and water are ongoing.
Some of meat from the sick cow made its way to a shop in the Osh
market in Bishkek. At present, an investigation is underway there.
The shop has been closed. Another portion of the meat the man had
given to his mother. Physicians have now found and destroyed this
portion. All contact persons who were taking part in the slaughter
and butchering of the cow have received preventive treatment.
Preventive measures in all markets of Bishkek selling meat and
involved in animal production have been enforced.
