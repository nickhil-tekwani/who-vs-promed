Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 5 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples.
- Pakistan - 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample.
- Papua New Guinea - 3 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1).
- DRC - 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).
- Nigeria - 2 cases of cVDPV2.
- Somalia - 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples.

[Comments from the GPEI re: approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly-reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps which must be filled to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries [Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria] continue to intensify their eradication efforts, through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (i.e. due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc.), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritise technical assistance to those areas.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus - be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total numbers of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 19.
- 5 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week: 2 from Jalalabad district, 2 from Kandahar district, and 1 from Lashkargah district. Samples were collected between [3-25 Oct 2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 8.
- 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample has been reported from Bajour Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, collected on [25 Oct 2018].
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. 20 years ago, the entirely country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralysed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week, 1 from Jigawa state and 1 from Borno state with onset of paralysis on [13 and 17 Oct 2018] respectively.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. There are 7 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- 2 mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns aimed to reach 3.2 million children under 5 years of age in 4 provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi and Zinder). The 1st round took place from [24 through 27 Oct 2018] and the 2nd on [7 through 11 Nov 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2018]. The case was reported in the previously uninfected province, Sankuru-central DRC. The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 is now 19.
- Detailed investigations of this latest case are ongoing, but it appears to be related to the Mongala outbreak. It is associated with geographic spread of the Mongola outbreak. Planning is underway to respond to this new epidemiological development. DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018, demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental samples collected in Somalia from Banadir province on [20 Sep 2018] and [4 Oct 2018]. The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response, to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week: 1 from East Sepik province and 2 from Enga province with onset of paralysis ranging from [17 Aug 2018 to 30 Sep 2018].
- The total number of cases in the country in 2018 is now 25.
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nation-wide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- Efforts are ongoing to maintain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses.

[There have been 6 newly confirmed cases of cVDPV reported by 3 countries during the last week, with 2 of the 3 endemic countries reporting positive environmental samples with WPV1 isolated. Impression: wild polioviruses continue to circulate in 2 of the 3 endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses continue to circulate in 5 countries (Nigeria, DR Congo, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, Niger). This year (2018) appears to be a more challenged year with respect to total numbers of WPV1 associated cases and ever-increasing numbers of cVDPV cases.

Polio eradication: next steps and future challenges
Authors: Maria Zambon, Javier Martin

In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate polio. At that time, polio was endemic in 125 countries and paralysed around 1000 children per day. Since then, polio cases due to infection with wild poliovirus (WPV) have decreased by more than 99.9 percent from over 350 000 cases a year to 37 cases in 2016 and 22 in 2017 [1]. Of the 3 WPV serotypes, 1, 2 and 3, WPV2 has not been detected since 1999 and was declared eradicated in September 2015. This allowed a global switch from live trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) to live bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), eliminating the need for live type 2 poliovirus vaccine strains. At the same time, this switch has created a need for universal use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to ensure immune protection against type 2 poliovirus. Vigorously applied disease control programmes have clearly made huge contributions to the goal of eradication of poliomyelitis, and we are tantalizingly close to the complete elimination.

Clinical and virological surveillance using the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case definition, in tandem with comprehensive vaccination programmes using OPV have been extremely successful in high disease burden countries. WPV3 was last detected in November 2012 in Nigeria, and since this time WPV1 has been the sole circulating WPV type globally. WPV transmission has persisted in only 2 countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan, although in August 2016 it was also detected in Nigeria [1]. As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, a relentless focus on achieving complete vaccination coverage in the areas still using OPV, together with a global commitment to universal IPV coverage and diverse approaches to surveillance, are needed to achieve the final target.

Endgame strategy
The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan (2013-18) set the goal of a polio-free world by the end of 2018 [2]; this was recently extended until at least 2021 [3]. Achieving this challenging goal requires: (i) completion of WPV eradication to eliminate the risk of WPV transmission; (ii) cessation of the use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) after eradication completion to eliminate the risks of chronic immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV) cases and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) causing outbreaks due to person-to-person transmission in areas with poor vaccination coverage [4,5]; and (iii) implementation of poliovirus safe-handling and containment measures following the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan (GAPIII) to minimise poliovirus facility-associated risk after type-specific eradication of wild polioviruses and sequential cessation of oral polio vaccine use to minimise the risks of reintroduction of virus into the polio-free community [6]. The last pockets of WPV circulation are in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the physical challenges of landscape and isolated communities are compounded by a challenging socio-political environment that affects the timely delivery of vaccines [7]. The commitment of local health authorities is slowly but gradually leading to improvements in vaccine coverage [8]. Delivery of vaccine programmes has never been more essential.

Clinical surveillance
The assessment of polio elimination status in a country is based upon demonstration of routinely high uptake of vaccine in children and evidence of strong polio surveillance. One of the hallmarks of the smallpox elimination campaign in its final stages in the 1970s was relentless tracking and detailed investigations of possible cases, however difficult the circumstance or how improbable the clinical case. Smallpox had a distinct clinical presentation making it easier to recognise compared with polio, where the key indicator clinical syndrome for the elimination is acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). This occurs in less than 5 percent of poliovirus-infected individuals and is also the result of poorly understood aetiologies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Currently, many countries struggle to undertake AFP surveillance. Polio-associated AFP is a rare disease overall, and its declining incidence and lack of perceived importance has led to difficulties in use and verification of individual cases [3]. As discussed in this week's Eurosurveillance report of the Spanish experience of AFP surveillance over the past 20 years, in at least one-third to two thirds of cases, the supporting virological investigations may also be less than optimum [9]. The findings emphasise that the overall sensitivity of passive AFP case finding, as a tool for detection of polio circulation in the era of eradication, is insufficient and needs to be supplemented. Awareness raising within the clinical and paediatric communities, of the importance of timely notification of possible AFP cases and detailed and disciplined investigation, is necessary to overcome the presumption that polio has indeed disappeared and to dispel the notion that case follow-up effort is no longer required. Inadequate sampling for virological investigation is a risk to clinical surveillance programmes. The widest range of samples, including respiratory and faecal samples, should be analysed from each possible AFP case as part of a carefully coordinated approach to thoroughly investigate causality. Virological analysis of body fluids from AFP cases and other polio-compatible neurological illnesses is a crucial tool in verifying the lack of circulating polioviruses. The gradual shift in clinical practice towards investigating possible infectious episodes of acute onset neurological illness using PCR with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as the specimen of choice will further reduce the sensitivity of AFP surveillance. Using well-timed faecal samples for virological investigations, as recommended in the WHO Polio laboratory manual [10], provides a much higher chance to detect poliovirus infection.

Correct classification of poliovirus isolates as vaccine-like strains, VDPVs and WPVs, through a competent laboratory network, is essential to support rapid and thorough outbreak investigations and to help orchestrate the best public health response. Tried and tested classical laboratory methodologies involving selective cell culture systems for virus isolation followed by molecular typing methods are very sensitive for the detection of WPV and VDPV strains but, as yet, fully validated direct detection methods for poliovirus identification in stool extracts are not available. As mentioned above, WPV1 is still circulating in areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In addition, cVDPVs are still causing outbreaks in various countries of Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia) and in Papua New Guinea [1]. Until poliovirus transmission is interrupted, all countries remain at risk of importation of PV. Especially vulnerable are countries with inadequate public health and immunisation services and travel or trade links to endemic countries. With the eradication of WPV2, it is particularly important to focus on rapid response to cVDPV2 outbreaks and to ensure there is heightened biosecurity for WPV2 held in laboratory facilities.

Environmental surveillance
Work has been undertaken to develop alternative surveillance approaches to verify that there are no circulating polioviruses. This includes virus isolation and detailed molecular characterisation of enteroviruses recovered from severe, neurological illness cases [11], and environmental surveillance (ES) of waste water and sewage systems [12]. Unlike clinical (AFP) surveillance, ES can monitor large populations using smaller numbers of samples and detect the introduction of poliovirus even before the appearance of AFP cases, and can be a sensitive tool to pick up circulation of WPV or VDPV. The silent transmission of type 1 WPV in 2013 in Israel has demonstrated the value of active ES that can detect poliovirus excretion in the population in the absence of polio-related AFP cases [13]. While the application of advanced molecular genomics tools for the analysis of complex environmental samples will add sophistication and improve current analytical approaches [14], there are substantial logistical and financial constraints in implementing ES at scale in densely populated countries. Such approaches require detailed consideration of sampling strategies and cross sectoral collaborations involving parties outside the primary health system. Implementation of ES programmes in a rational way will support strengthened clinical surveillance programmes, though much more work is needed to refine sampling strategies and develop standardised sampling and laboratory analytical methods.

Biocontainment
As the focus of the global eradication programme shifts away from tracking the transmission of WPV towards detailed oversight of poliovirus-related laboratory and manufacturing activities at national level, there is now a need to give greater emphasis to the regulation of biocontainment. The report in 2017 of 2 accidental exposures to WPV-2 in a Dutch manufacturing plant [15] was a wake-up call on what might be the consequences of breaches in biocontainment or gaps in scenario planning and emphasised the need for particular vigilance in these facilities worldwide. The incident also highlighted the necessity of having detailed public-health risk-management plans ready for uncontrolled and unintended release events arising in laboratory environments. This aspect has been addressed in Europe by detailed simulation exercises led by WHO in autumn 2018 to test national plans and preparedness for such events. In addition, recent reports of tOPV use in India that led to the exposure of children to live type 2 vaccine strain after the tOPV to bOPV switch [16,17] showed that stringent regulatory oversight of vaccine manufacturing facilities is absolutely required. The risks associated with poliovirus vaccine production, including IPV, are now magnified in the absence of circulating viruses. These include the inadvertent release of large volumes of biological materials, potentially containing high titres of live poliovirus to the sewage system, as part of the IPV vaccine production process. When this happened on a previous occasion, it required a major public health response and complex investigations to assess the impact of possible large-scale environmental contamination [18].

Polio essential facilities
Under the WHO GAPIII [6], it is envisaged that the number of facilities holding and working with WPV will decrease markedly. Countries will be required to establish a national authority for containment (NAC) by the end of 2018, to register as polio essential facilities (PEFs) organisations handling poliovirus within their borders and to provide oversight of their activities. NACs will scrutinise critical testing functions that require the use of live poliovirus much more stringently. These will include vaccine manufacture and laboratory activities, such as measuring population immunity and immunogenicity testing and preparation of standards and controls for diagnostic assays. The risks associated with poliovirus vaccine production, including IPV, are now magnified in the absence of circulating viruses, as manufacturing facilities will be the single largest source of live poliovirus. Implementation deadlines for registration of PEFs and enhanced regulation of biocontainment appear challenging, but the necessity of increased regulatory oversight at this stage of the end game, while recognising the need to ensure global IPV availability, is uncontroversial, even without the examples above.

During the coming 12 to 18 months, the work of National Accreditation Committees should generate a greater understanding of the distinction between the activities that require a PEF and how to classify and handle poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials (IMs and PIMs) [19]. The committees will support GAPIII processes and serve to strengthen biological risk management in facilities delivering critical functions. Global research priorities for a virus that is being eradicated link directly to risk reduction associated with polio vaccine manufacture, where there is no alternative to the use of live virus. Some of the biocontainment risk associated with continuing use of OPV could be addressed through the use of safer, genetically stabilised, live-attenuated vaccine strains. Similarly, the use of hyperattenuated poliovirus strains such as (S19) for vaccine production, quality assurance programmes and immunogenicity testing would improve risk management during the IPV vaccine manufacturing process [20]. These and other related research activities will require the use of live poliovirus strains as gold standards for some years to come, with the expectation that ultimately the fruits of the labour will reduce the global biorisk of polio vaccine manufacture.

We have come a long way since the March of Dimes was launched almost 100 years ago in the United States as the 1st popular societal movement against polio. Today's achievements in polio eradication arise from the combined and collaborative efforts of many different international health agencies, private foundations and governments and individuals being vaccinated, each playing their part. Taking a backwards look is a reminder of the scale of the challenge and the immense human effort that has been required to get us to where we are now. With the end in sight, the final push towards complete polio eradication, to overcome the remaining challenges, requires a last heave and concerted effort from many different sectors to finally eliminate the scourge of polio-associated paralysis.

[I included the above editorial as a good discussion on the challenges facing the polio eradication goal. I for one see the challenges of elimination of cVDPV's as a key variable in the eradication equation and wonder what impact the use of the mOPV2 vaccine to interrupt transmission during outbreaks of cVDPV2 will have in areas with recurrent low vaccination coverages. I also wonder what impact the current outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) may have on the eradication efforts (especially morale) if it increases its geographic presence into areas where poliovirus (PV) transmission has only recently been interrupted, and the potential confusion that may arise on a bigger scale with increased PV-negative cases identified. Only time will tell. Mother Nature has continually demonstrated that when we think we see a route to eradication of a disease, she throws additional challenges to be overcome. - Mod.MPP]
