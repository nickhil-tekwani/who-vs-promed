The state Division of Public Health has reported 2 recent botulism outbreaks
in Interior Alaska villages, but it hasn't named the villages. Health
officials sent nurse practitioners to 2 separate Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
villages Mon, 22 Aug 2005. They went to help with 4 people who became ill
after eating fermented salmon, a traditional village meal.
In declining a request by KTUU-TV to name the affected villages, Dr. Richard
Mandsager, the director of public health, says botulism is not contagious and
poses little risk to the public. "The communities are small, so the risk of
stigmatizing either individual or providing information that could lead to
identifying individuals is very, very high, so we don't," he said.
Since 1995, the state has averaged 8 cases of botulism a year.

[A good description of Arctic marine animal-associated botulism can be found
at this URL: <http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/pubs/botulism/bot_03.htm>. The
epidemiology section is found below, with the citations removed:
For many years, outbreaks of illness associated with traditionally prepared
and preserved food have been described. Early explorers reported clusters of
deaths in villages and among groups of northern Natives which the explorers
attributed to "ptomaine" poisoning or trichinosis. However, descriptions of
many of these outbreaks resemble foodborne botulism. Later, ethnographers
described food preparation and storage practices which could support the
production of botulism toxin.
The first reported outbreaks of foodborne botulism in the Arctic occurred in
the early 1900s and over 200 outbreaks have been recorded since. In Canada,
the first reported outbreak was in 1919 and since then, over 100 outbreaks
involving over 230 individuals have occurred. The first reported outbreaks in
Greenland occurred in 1967 and 25 additional outbreaks have been reported
since. Rabeau recorded the first outbreak in Alaska in 1947 which involved
beluga whale flipper consumed in the village of Kotzebue. Outbreaks among
Siberian Eskimos in Russia are not well reported.
The overall case fatality rate in Arctic outbreaks is about 20 percent.
Because not all northern Native groups consume traditionally prepared foods,
it is difficult to determine true incidence rates of disease. However, using
total population as the denominator, Canadian Inuit and Alaska residents had
annual incidence rates of 30 cases/100 000 and 8.5 cases/100 000,
respectively. These rates compare to 0.43 cases/100 000 in Washington State,
the highest rate in the USA other than Alaska. Most foodborne botulism in the
Arctic is type E. There is an important difference between foodborne botulism
in Alaska compared to the rest of the USA. All cases in Alaska have been
associated with the preparation and storage of traditional Alaska Native
foods. This includes "fermented" foods, dried foods, and traditionally
prepared condiments such as seal oil. In other parts of the USA, foodborne
botulism is usually associated with improperly canned foods or with improperly
stored unrefrigerated foods.
Foods involved in northern Native botulism outbreaks are usually putrefied
(fermented). These foods are either intentionally subjected to putrefaction or
are unintentionally putrefied due to inadequate storage and preservation. In
either case, most outbreaks involve traditional foods such as sea mammals or
fish. Whale and seal are the most frequently involved sea mammals. Salmon,
including salmon eggs, is the most frequently involved fish. Land mammals
(beaver and caribou) account for a small proportion of outbreaks.
Dried foods, particularly dried fish, have also been implicated in foodborne
botulism outbreaks. Fish are dried either with or without a brine stage.
However, even if fish are put in brine prior to drying, the salt concentration
is rarely high enough to inhibit botulism toxin formation.
