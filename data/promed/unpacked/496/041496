Polio this week as of 29 May 2018
---------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- At last week's World Health Assembly (WHA), ministers of health and delegates reviewed progress being achieved through national emergency action plans in remaining endemic countries. Delegates noted that wild poliovirus transmission is now at the lowest ever levels in history.
- To prepare for a polio-free world, Member States adopted a landmark resolution on poliovirus containment, and endorsed the 5-year strategic action plan on polio transition, which outlines how essential polio functions such as surveillance, laboratory networks and core infrastructure can support the implementation of the Post-Certification Strategy (PCS) to sustain a polio-free world, and can be integrated into the immunization or health emergencies' programme, or mainstreamed into national health systems.
- Member States expressed overwhelming commitment to fully implement and finance all strategies to secure a lasting polio-free world in the very near term. Rotary International, speaking on behalf of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), offered an impassioned plea to the global community to eradicate a human disease for only the 2nd time in history, and ensure that no child will ever again be paralysed by any form of poliovirus anywhere.
- The Polio Eradication department in WHO is looking for interns for the summer and fall. Please see http://polioeradication.org/polio-eradication-department-internships/ for details, share with the universities that you attended and with other sources with which you may be familiar or promising young people of your acquaintance. Thank you and kind regards.

Weekly country updates as of 29 May 2018
----------------------------------------
Afghanistan
-----------

- 2 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Jalalabad, Nangarhar, collected on [26 Mar 2018] and [24 Apr 2018].
- During the May [2018] immunization campaign, vaccinators worked to reach over 9.6 million children with bivalent oral polio vaccine.

Pakistan
--------
[see section 2 below]
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been confirmed this week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 1.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) occurred in Dukki district, Balochistan province, with onset of paralysis on [8 Mar 2018].
- 4 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, all collected on 10 May [2018] in: Rawalpindi, Punjab (2 samples); Karachi Gadap, Sindh; and, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
- During the May [2018] immunization campaign, vaccinators worked to reach over 20 million children with bivalent oral polio vaccine.

Nigeria:
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno State, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) is confirmed in Jigawa state. Circulating VDPV2 has been isolated from environmental samples and one AFP case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018].
- Following notification of the initial cVDPV2 isolates from January and February [2018], the programme conducted enhanced vaccination activities using IPV in 13 high-risk wards (target population approximately 55 000 children).
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits, and community sampling. The programme has also carried out extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with Regional and country counterparts and partners to supporting the local public health authorities to conduct a field investigation and thorough risk assessment, and to discuss needs for immunization response.

Lake Chad Basin
---------------
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.

Central Africa
--------------
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Kikula district, Haut Katanga province, with onset on [19 Feb 2018].
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Horn of Africa
--------------

- There has been no isolation of either cVDPV3 or cVDPV2 from acute flaccid paralysis cases or their contacts in either Somalia or Kenya. Virus has been isolated from environmental samples only.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented, in line with internationally-agreed guidelines; 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

[It is noteworthy to mention on 29 May 2018, we posted a media report confirming a 2nd case of polio in Dukki district of Balochistan (see Poliomyelitis update (15): Pakistan (BA) RFI 20180529.5825949 for details, and see EpiCore responses below). Hence, I suspect that this case will be added to the GPEI data base shortly and will bring the global total of WPV1 reported cases for 2018 to 10. In this week's update, there is a newly confirmed case in Kandahar Afghanistan, and area that has had positive environmental samples.

The continued isolation of WPV1 from environmental samples in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a sign that the WPV1 is still circulating in the region. The pattern has been that when a "new" area is identified with positive environmental samples, within a few weeks, a case is identified. This also held true for the cVDPV2 identified in Nigeria. One can't help but wonder if there are still cases occurring that are being missed due to gaps in surveillance - especially in areas with ongoing civil strife and difficult access.

The newly confirmed case is an 18-month-old female child from Dukki district with date of onset of paralysis [15 Apr 2018]. The child had a history (verbal) of receiving many doses of OPV during vaccination campaigns but no doses as part of routine immunization. A stool specimen from a contact of this child was positive for WPV1, genetically related to the 1st case of WPV1 associated polio reported earlier this year.
