Beef farmer and wife caught TB from cattle
-------------------------------------------
A Newent beef farmer, and his wife, contracted tuberculosis from his
cattle, allegedly spread by badgers, an official report reveals today, 13
Jul 2004. Several other unconfirmed cases have also been reported, one by a
county MP, sparking fears about a worrying new escalation of the epidemic
in the county. The case is revealed in scientific evidence given to a
Parliamentary select committee, which met to look at new ways to tackle the
disease linked to badgers.
The infection of the unidentified farmer and his wife could mark a
disturbing escalation of the disease, which the Government's scientific
advisors have previously said carries a "negligible" risk to humans. While
about 50 cases of human TB caused by the strain in cattle are recorded
every year, the great majority are in older people who have consumed
unpasteurized milk in the past.
In the case in Gloucestershire, which remains the epicenter of the disease,
there was no milk involved, and the farmer was a beef farmer rather than a
dairy farmer, suggesting the disease was caught through direct contact from
the herd.
A spokesman for Defra (Department for Environmental Food and Rural Affairs)
said the report was referring to a case of 2 people from a farming family
at Newent, who, in 1999, received airborne infection from a beef herd.
"This is not a common occurrence. The previous case like this was in 1990,"
she said.
The report contains minutes of a meeting in May 2004, when the Defra select
committee was addressed by 3 scientific experts, including Alick Simmons,
head of Defra's Veterinary Endemic and Zoonoses Division.
Fielding a question, from Forest of Dean MP Diana Organ, on how many
farmers, stockmen, or vets had contracted TB in the last 3 years, Mr.
Simmons said: "There has been a recent report of a farmer in
Gloucestershire having contracted bovine TB from a beef herd, where there
was no milk for human consumption produced, so one could surmise
reasonably, I think, that there has been occupational risk there, but that
is really quite a rare occurrence.
"We believe that the risk mostly is through consumption of raw milk, but
one could not be confident that there are other routes which are not
creating a risk."
Professor Doug Young, Professor of Microbiology at Imperial College, who is
Defra's bovine TB vaccine adviser, warned that there could be an upsurge in
humans contracting the disease.
"Predominantly, those are people in the older age groups who contracted _M.
bovis_ infection prior to pasteurization and are now suffering from the
effects of that 50 or so years later."
The scientists' comments will cause alarm in Gloucestershire, which has the
largest proportion of cattle herds infected by bovine TB in the country.
Recent Defra figures revealed that 475 herds, out of 1773 in
Gloucestershire, were put under TB restrictions in 2003 because of an
outbreak of the disease at some time. The figure equates to 31 percent of
herds and was up from 25 percent in 2002. Although Gloucestershire has
experienced fewer outbreaks than counties such as Devon and Cornwall, the
percentage of herds experiencing infections is considerably higher, making
it England's TB capital.
Diana Organ, the Forest of Dean MP, who is a Defra committee member, said:
"There are 1 or 2 cases, and we have to be vigilant all the time. I raised
the question because, years ago, I had a teacher who thought he got TB on a
farm visit.
"This shows how important it is to take action as soon as the reactors
[cattle that are tuberculin-skin-test reactive - Mod.LL] appear. There is a
new test which should improve matters, although the farmers are a bit
reticent to adopt it at the moment."
David Drew, the Labor MP for Stroud, who is also on the committee, and
chairs a subcommittee on bovine TB, said: "There is always a risk that you
ignore this at your peril. I don't see this as an escalation, though. There
are always one or 2 cases every year."
Roland Blackwell, of Barton End Farm, in Nailsworth, has been calling for a
targeted cull of badgers since his cattle had been diagnosed as suffering
from TB in February 2004.
He said: "I wasn't aware of this case, but we all knew it could happen very
easily, and it comes as no surprise."
But, a Defra spokesman denied the Gloucestershire case marked an escalation
of the epidemic. She said bovine TB was a "different strain" of
tuberculosis, but, was also a serious lung disease.

[The clinical aspects of the 2 cases are not described. It is presumed that
both individuals had pulmonary infection with _M. bovis_ rather than just
being tuberculin convertors. _M. bovis_ is a member of the _M.
tuberculosis_ complex, and, therefore, will react with the commercially
available DNA probes used to identify _M. tuberculosis_. _M. bovis_ is
negative for nicotinamidase and pyrazinamidase, and, does not reduce
nitrate, whereas _M. tuberculosis_ is positive in the 2 tests and reduces
nitrate. Since it does not have pyrazinamidase, _M. bovis_ is resistant
for pyrazinamide.
Airborne transmission of _M. bovis_ does occur as mentioned in the posting.
This route was highlighted by a number of cases of infection in zookeepers
caring for a sick rhinoceros (Dalovisio JR, Stetter M, Mikota-Wells S.
Rhinoceros' rhinorrhea: Cause of an outbreak of infection due to
airborne_Mycobacterium bovis_ in zookeepers. Clin Infect Dis
1992;15:598-600. - Mod.LL]
[The outbreak of FMD in March 2001 and its aftermath seriously curtailed
the Veterinary Service tuberculosis programme. The result was a backlog of
TB tests in cattle, leading to worsening of a situation which was already
bad enough. The number of herds under TB restrictions on 31 Dec 2003 stood
at 3074, i.e. 3.2 percent of the national herd (out of a total of
approximately 96 000 herds).
In view of the deteriorating situation, the UK Government commissioned a
review of the evidence for a link between badgers and Bovine TB. The Review
Group concluded that there was convincing evidence that badgers were a
source of infection for cattle, but the extent to which they added to
problem in could not be calculated. Following a trial, conducted by the
Institute for Animal Health (IAH), it was concluded that reactive culling
of badgers is unlikely to contribute to the control of cattle TB or offer a
viable base for future policy. In a reversal of previous thinking the Group
considered that the prospects of a vaccine for cows was more promising as
there had been more progress in understanding the basic immunological
responses in cattle. The development of such a vaccine is currently subject
to research by the IAH. - Mod.AS]
