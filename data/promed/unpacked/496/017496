Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 7.23 / 3.74 /51.76 / 3.74
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive, Vectors

Epidemiological comments: Tsetse flies are not present in the country; it is thought that the transmission occurred through other hematophagous flies (horsefly or _Stomoxys_ sp.), which explains the limited spreading of the disease and epidemiological impact. The investigation carried out to identify the origin of those outbreaks revealed the existence of unofficial registers related to the possible detection of the agent in the provinces of Chaco and Formosa in the past. The presence of the agent in these areas could have been hidden by the existence of endemic diseases with indistinguishable symptomatology, such as babesiosis and anaplasmosis. We will attempt to clarify this point in order to integrate this information within next periodic reports.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; traceability; quarantine; control of vectors; vaccination permitted ( if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (Dimenazeno)

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Investigation and transfer center of Formosa (Local laboratory) / Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 22 May 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis is a disease complex caused by several species of protozoan parasites of the genus _Trypanosoma_, mainly transmitted cyclically by the genus _Glossina_ (tsetse flies), but also transmitted mechanically by several biting flies (tabanids, stomoxes, etc.). The disease can affect various species of mammals but, from an economic point of view, tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis, is particularly important in cattle. It is mainly caused by _Trypanosoma congolense_, _T. vivax_ and, to a lesser extent, _T. brucei brucei_.

"Clinical signs of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis may include intermittent fever, edema, abortion, decreased fertility and emaciation. Anemia usually develops in affected animals and is followed by loss of body condition, reduced productivity and often mortality. Post-mortem signs may include emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, excessive fluid in the body cavities, and petechial hemorrhages. In animals that died during the chronic phase of the disease, the lymphoid organs are usually no longer enlarged and severe myocarditis is a common finding. Neither clinical nor post-mortem signs of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis are pathognomonic. Therefore, diagnosis must rely on direct techniques that confirm the presence of trypanosomes either by microscopic visualization or by indirect serological techniques or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

"Clinically, trypanosomiasis can be confused with babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis, hemonchosis and even ehrlichiosis, rabies or plant intoxications. Differential diagnosis is oriented by clinical observations, evolution, epidemiological context, but it is essentially based on laboratory diagnosis."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2017, Chapter 2.4.17, Trypanosomiasis ( tsetse- transmitted) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.17_TRYPANOSOMOSIS.pdf.

"Trypanosomes can be found wherever the tsetse fly vector exists. Tsetse flies are endemic in Africa between latitude 15 deg N and 29 deg S, from the southern edge of the Sahara desert to Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique. Trypanosomes, particularly _T. vivax_, can spread beyond the "tsetse fly belt" by transmission through mechanical vectors. _T. vivax_ is also found in South and Central America and the Caribbean, areas free of the tsetse fly." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/trypanosomiasis_african.pdf. - Mod.CRD
