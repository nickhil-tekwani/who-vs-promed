Rajshahi farmers said, due to lingering cold and fog the growth of
potato plants is being hampered. In many fields, the potato plants,
mainly stem and roots, are rotting. A virulent disease commonly known
as late blight is also attacking the potato crops and destroying the
entire plant as well as the tubers. Most of the potato farmers are
using various types of pesticides and insecticides to control the late
blight disease, but those are not working well.

Farmers planted 2 kinds of potato seeds -- red and white -- but the
disease affected nearly 100 percent of plants sprouted from both
types. As a result, farmers were incurring huge losses. A seed company
official visited the fields and assured the farmers of compensation,
but said other districts are safe.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops.
Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different _P.
infestans_ strains has been observed. PLB is spread by plant material
(including potato seed tubers), wind, and water. Disease management
generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed tubers and crops, but
more virulent pathogen strains are emerging frequently.

Contaminated seed potatoes supplied by one company may be playing a
role in this recent outbreak, however, outbreaks of both late and
early (_Alternaria solani_) potato leaf blights were reported from
this area in previous years and the problem is likely to be more
complex and not confined to one district. Ineffectiveness of available
agrochemicals, also claimed in this story, may be contributing to the
difficulties, but a new pathogen strain with increased fungicide
resistances can also not be excluded.
