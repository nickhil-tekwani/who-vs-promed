The state is investigating 14 cases of salmonellosis on Oahu [Hawaii] that are believed linked to tainted limu from an Oahu seaweed farm. In a news release issued [on Mon 7 Nov 2016], the Department of Health said officials have ordered the farm to halt operations and advise its customers to remove its product from sale immediately. The problem seaweed came from Olokai Hawaii, a seaweed farm in Kahuku. The owner, Dr Wenhao Sun, said tainted water used in aquaponics may be to blame. "I was really surprised," he said. "I don't know how this could happen."

The state said the cases of salmonellosis were in children and adults. All of the cases developed diarrheal illness from mid- to late October 2016. 4 patients required hospitalization. Officials said while the source of the cases has not yet been confirmed, preliminary investigations identified consumption of poke with seaweed in the cases.

"Although our investigation is still ongoing, our preliminary investigation has implicated limu, also known as ogo or seaweed, produced at a particular farm on Oahu," said state epidemiologist Dr Sarah Park. "To protect the public's health, the department stepped in to make sure this product is no longer being put on the market pending further investigation. At the same time, we want the public to be aware of the situation so they may seek medical care if needed."

Dr Sun says in 10 years of operations, his farm has never experienced problems like this. "We will learn more and we will find the problem," he said. "Then we can move on so we will satisfy our customers and make sure all the food is safe."

"If you're going to consume limu, make sure that it is cooked appropriately," said Park. "Do not eat it raw at this point because unfortunately, we don't know the scope of the distribution, so we don't know which limu is okay and which limu is not."

Dr Sun said the sea asparagus grown on his farm is not contaminated and still safe to consume.

[Limu is the Hawaiian word for algae. There are about 100 Hawaiian names for kinds of limu, 60 of which can be matched with scientific names. Limu played an important part in the ancient Hawaiian diet. It was used to add flavor to an otherwise particularly bland diet of kalo (taro), 'uala (sweet potato), and 'ulu (breadfruit).
