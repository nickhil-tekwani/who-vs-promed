7 additional MERS cases, a total of 145
--------------------------
- The Ministry of Health and Welfare's MERS-CoV Task Force as of 14 Jun 2015, has confirmed 7 additional positive cases of MERS-CoV (cases were confirmed on 13 Jun 2015).

- 4 diagnosed cases have been in contact with case no.14, 3 of them are suspected to be infected at the Samsung Medical Center Emergency Room (27-29 May 2015), and 1 case is suspected to have accompanied one of the outpatients (27 May 2015).

- For the rest 3 diagnosed cases, one has been in contact with case no.16 (25-28 May 2015) the Dae Cheong Hospital; other has been in contact with case no.15 who resided on the same floor at the Hallym University Medical Center (27-28 May 2015), and the last case who accompanied the case no.76 during the ambulance transportation (4- 6 Jun 2015).

- Remaining 5 cases are related cases at Samsung Medical Center and are currently under epidemiological investigation.

- Therefore, until now, there has been a total of 145 confirmed-cases of MERS-CoV, 10 cases have recovered and have been discharged from the hospital, 14 cases of deaths and 121 cases are receiving treatment.

- On the other hand, for the 5 cases presented on 13 Jun 2015 (having been confirmed on 12 Jun 2015), all 5 cases were all confirmed to have stayed at the Samsung Medical Center emergency room with case no.14 (27-29 May 2015).

[With the reports of 7 additional cases, there have now been a total of 145 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in South Korea (counting the one case that was ultimately confirmed by China as he traveled there while ill). This includes 14 fatalities and 10 recoveries discharged from the hospitals.

Of the recently confirmed cases, 6 were 3rd generation cases having been in health facilities where 2nd generation cases were being treated and one was a 4th generation case, having accompanied a 3rd generation case to the hospital in an ambulance.

Information on the 5 cases reported on 13 Jun 2015 that were still under investigation at the time of the report, all 5 cases were 3rd generation cases having been in the emergency room at Samsung Hospital when case no.14 was there. Of note is that 71 (49.0 percent) of the confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were associated with contact with case no.14.

There have now been 3 4th generation cases reported.

[2] South Korea - WHO mission findings

WHO recommends continuation of strong disease control measures to bring MERS-CoV outbreak in Republic of Korea to an end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A joint mission by the World Health Organization and the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare to review the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) in the Republic of Korea has recommended that continuing strengthening of contact tracing, monitoring and quarantine as well as expanded laboratory testing will prevent further spread of the virus.

The mission concluded that while the outbreak that began last month [May 2015] has been large and complex, it is showing a similar epidemiological pattern to previous hospital-associated MERS CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which have been fully controlled by strong basic public health measures such as infection prevention and control.

"We know that there has been much anxiety about whether the virus in the Republic of Korea has increased its ability to transmit itself between humans," says Dr Keiji Fukuda, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Security who has co-led the mission with Dr Jong-Koo Lee, Director, Center for Global Medicine, Seoul National University. "However, based on available sequencing studies of this virus, it does not appear to have changed to make itself more transmissible."

The mission confirmed that the virus is currently clustered around health facilities and found no evidence that it was circulating in the community. "However, continued monitoring for this is critical," says Dr Fukuda.

The Assistant Director-General also warned that while the Korean authorities were already putting in place many of the recommendations the mission has made and that the number of new infections may be decreasing, the size and complexity of the outbreak means it will be a number of weeks before the true impact of the stronger disease control measures will be seen. "I want to strongly emphasize that we still need to wait and see before drawing firm conclusions," he stresses.

The mission, comprised of experts in epidemiology, risk communications, virology, clinical management, infection prevention and control, as well as public health specialists, identified several reasons why the virus, which arrived in the country with a single infected traveller, was able to go on to infect large numbers of people in a relatively short time. These included:

- The fact that the MERS CoV was unexpected and unfamiliar to most physicians in the Republic of Korea;

- Sub-optimal prevention and control measures in some hospitals, related in part to overcrowding in emergency rooms and patients in rooms with many beds;

- The possible impact of habits and customs such as so-called "doctor-shopping", where patients seek care at a number of medical facilities, as well as visits to hospitalized patients by many friends and family members.

The mission was unable to conclude whether environmental contamination, inadequate ventilation or other factors played a role in the transmission of the virus in the outbreak, but made a number of recommendations to improve health facilities in the country to reduce the possibility of the virus being spread by these means in the future.

The most important steps recommended by the mission to stop further cases of MERS CoV in the Republic of Korea included:

- Early and complete identification of all contacts;
- Quarantine or isolation and monitoring of all contacts and suspected cases;
- Full implementation of infection, prevention and control measures;
- Prevention of travel, especially internationally, of infected persons and contacts.

There have been 138 confirmed cases of MERS CoV (including 1 confirmed case in China) reported in the current outbreak so far, with 14 deaths. The virus was 1st identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and much is still unknown about the exact routes of transmission. WHO has welcomed the Republic of Korea's willingness to share its experience of the outbreak openly and to implement recommendations made by the mission.

[To quote myself from a prior ProMED-mail post, "Unfortunately it seemed to have been the perfect storm ... overcrowding of hospitals, 'hospital shopping' behavior seeking the right facility, too few appropriate isolation facilities, combined with lack of awareness among the population and the healthcare sector of the importance of a history of travel when diagnosing a febrile illness." ... "The realities are simply overcrowding, patients seeking attention at the known 'premium hospitals' where care is thought to be optimal, and suboptimal infection control procedures -- too few negative-pressure isolation rooms, too few single-bedded rooms, etc." - Mod.MPP]

[3] South Korea, media spin on commission's findings

Experts Fault South Korean Response to MERS Outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
The South Korean government's failure to share information quickly with the public and establish an efficient disease-control system contributed to worsening the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in the country, a joint panel of experts from the World Health Organization and South Korea said Saturday [13 Jun 2015].

The experts have spent the past week visiting hospitals and meeting with health authorities to assess the outbreak, which has killed 14 people, and make recommendations.

"One of the things South Korea failed to do was a transparent and rapid distribution of information, which is the most important thing to do," said Lee Jong-koo, the leader of the South Korean side of the joint mission, at a news conference Saturday [13 Jun 2015].

A "failure to establish proper governance" in controlling the outbreak in its early stages also contributed to "confusion" among the public, Mr. Lee said.

The disease, known as MERS, is known to have infected 138 people in South Korea since the 1st patient was identified on [20 May 2015]. The outbreak is the largest to date outside the Middle East, where the virus 1st emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has killed more than 400 people.

One of the tasks of the joint mission was to determine why so many people were infected in South Korea in a relatively short period of time. On Saturday [13 Jun 2015], Keiji Fukuda, chief World Health Organization official on the panel, pointed to several factors: South Korean doctors' unfamiliarity with MERS; the country's "overcrowded" emergency rooms; the practice of "doctor shopping" for care at many different clinics; and the fact that hospital rooms here tend to be bustling with visitors. Nearly all of the country's confirmed MERS patients were infected while seeking care or while visiting patients at hospitals. Hospital staff members were also infected.

Mr. Fukuda said the panel had found no evidence to indicate that MERS was spreading in the broader population. "However, continued monitoring for this possibility is critical throughout the entire outbreak," he said. "Now, because the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases should be anticipated."

Both Mr. Fukuda and Mr. Lee said that the rate of new infections was decreasing, as South Korean officials have improved their communications with the public and carried out stronger infection-control measures. 12 new MERS cases were reported Saturday [13 Jun 2015].

The government has come under heavy criticism for withholding critical information early in the outbreak, like the names and locations of hospitals where infections had occurred. It eventually released the hospitals' names, weeks after the 1st case was discovered. The outbreak has been a blow to President Park Geun-hye, whose approval rating has fallen in recent weeks.

Mr. Fukuda, who said transparency during an outbreak was "the basis of trust," urged South Korea to continue to enforce a strong quarantine and monitoring system. He also recommended that the country invest more in its public health system, particularly by hiring more epidemiologists and expanding its laboratories' capacities.

[It's ironic that the international community (outside of South Korea) has felt that the Koreans have been very transparent -- much more so than the countries reporting cases of MERS-CoV infection on the Arabian Peninsula, yet we've overlooked the apparent lack of transparency in not mentioning the names of the involved hospitals and how that may have contributed to delayed awareness on the part of healthcare personnel as well as patients and visitors. But, putting this into perspective, the US CDC, ECDC, WHO and most public health organizations have a culture of not mentioning the names of hospitals, health facilities, restaurants, hotels, etc., where there are outbreaks, especially early on before investigations have confirmed the locations are actually the source of the outbreak. Has a global problem with transparency issues been identified here? Or are we looking for someone to blame, and isn't it easier to blame a bureaucracy ... rather than the culture of the healthcare providers?

I still feel there is a global insular approach to patient diagnosis that is manifested by healthcare professionals not querying about travel history, and in turn, patients not mentioning a travel history, with a resultant blind eye to the realities that we live in a global village, and an outbreak on one side of the world can be transported to the other side of the world by an airplane in less than one day.

Should we not change the culture so that "febrile respiratory illnesses" presenting to the healthcare sector should be isolated from the general patient population to prevent nosocomial spread of the microbial agent? Rather than wait until there are many cases related to nosocomial transmission? - Mod.MPP]

[The outbreak in Hufoof continues. There are now 32 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Hufoof since 20 Apr 2015. It would be interesting and informative to see information on the chains of transmission in Hufoof to interpret what may be going on.
