1st report of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _corylina_ in Portugal
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organization] of Portugal recently informed EPPO of the 1st record of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _corylina_ (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. At the request of a farmer, an inspection was carried out by the official services in a hazelnut orchard (_Corylus avellana_ cv. Fertil de Coutard) located in [Aveiro district].

Symptoms of a bacterial infection were detected on approximately 25% of the trees (from a total of 208 trees), and a sample was tested. Laboratory analysis (molecular tests) confirmed the presence of _X. arboricola_ pv. _corylina_. The farmer was initially instructed not to move any plant material from the orchard concerned and to destroy on site all symptomatic plants. As soon as the confirmation was received from the laboratory, the destruction of the affected hazelnut orchard was ordered.

Other hazelnut varieties present on the farm were inspected but no symptoms were found. The site of the orchard will remain under surveillance, as well as hazelnut orchards located in its vicinity.

[Bacterial blight of hazelnut caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _corylina_ (Xac) is considered an emerging disease and the most important disease of the crop worldwide. It is specific to _Corylus_ species. Losses are due to reduction of fruit yield and quality, as well as to reduced vigour and life span of trees. Symptoms may include yellow/brown, water-soaked spots on leaves and immature fruits; leaf necrosis, with dead leaves remaining on branches; browning of leaf buds and failure to open; bark cankers that may girdle branches and result in dieback. Cankers girdling the main trunk will lead to death of the plant. Up to 100 percent of trees in a planting have been reported to be killed by the disease. Disease development is favoured by environmental and other stress on plants.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including contaminated cutting tools, insect activity), water, and with infected plant material. Seed transmission is suspected. Infection occurs through wounds or via invasion of buds. From infected buds, symptoms may take over 200 days to develop leading to latent infections which pose a high risk of spreading the pathogen. Disease management may include spraying with agrochemicals, reduction of available inoculum by orchard sanitation, as well as use of sterile tissue cultures or certified clean planting and grafting material for plant propagation.

Different pathovars in the species affect a range of hosts. For example, pathovar _juglandis_ is considered the most serious disease of commercial walnut plantings (ProMED-mail post 20120122.1018001) and pv. _pruni_ causes bacterial spot of stone fruit, a serious disease of these crops (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140910.2764747).
