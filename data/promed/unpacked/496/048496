Bird flu discovered in India
----------------------------
H5N1 bird flu virus has been discovered in poultry in 2 states in
India and in 5 governorates of Egypt, including the mega city of
Cairo, over the past 3 days. It has also been confirmed in wild birds
in France. The spread of H5N1 in Egypt and India, where many people
live in close contact with poultry, means a higher probability of
human cases, and with them, the possible emergence of a human
pandemic virus.
Tens of thousands of poultry have been dying near the town of Nawapur
in Maharashtra state in western India since January 2006 in an
outbreak initially dismissed as the chicken malady, Newcastle
disease. But over the weekend, India's Animal Diseases Laboratory at
Bhopal confirmed H5N1 in Nawapur and also near Surat, in neighboring
Gujarat.
In spring 2005, bird species that winter in India were found carrying
H5N1 at Qinghai Lake in China. Bird conservationists pointed to the
virus's apparent failure to turn up in India as an indication that it
is not carried long distances by migratory birds.
A similar argument was used when the virus appeared in Nigeria. That
country is a winter destination for birds that summer in Siberia.
There were Siberian outbreaks in summer 2005, and then recently in
Nigeria, but not, it appeared, in Egypt, where most migrants from
Siberia to Nigeria must pass. "How did it skip the whole Nile delta
and get to Nigeria?" asked William Karesh of the US's Wildlife
Conservation Society last week in the Washington Post newspaper. Now
it appears that H5N1 did not skip Egypt. "The cases in Egypt make it
even harder to say it wasn't spread by wild birds," says wildlife
virologist Bjorn Olsen of Umea University in Sweden. It is possible,
he adds, that the virus was not detected in India and Egypt until
now, because it entered the country in very few birds, but has
steadily multiplied, as infections multiply among birds in crowded
wintering colonies.
Meanwhile, says Olsen, the dead pochard duck with H5N1 found near
Lyon, France probably flew to warmer western Europe to escape cold
snaps in January 2006 in Russia or Romania, where the virus is
present in wild birds. It might also have entered with migrants from
Siberia last autumn. "Just because a bird was carrying H5N1 doesn't
mean it died of it," notes Julian Hughes of the UK's Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds. Young ducks, the most likely to pick up
new flu infections, often die of stress in late winter.
British authorities reacted to the French discovery by warning that
the virus is moving closer to the UK. "As the incidents of bird flu
on the continent get geographically closer, so the level of concern
increases," said a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair. But Olsen
says the virus is not moving north now, and is likely to be in the UK
already, as birds escaping from cold snaps in eastern Europe, and
migrant ducks including pochards from Siberia, head for both the UK
and France.
However, unlike nearly every other country in western Europe, the UK has not
ordered its free-range poultry under cover to protect it from infection, a
move opposed by the poultry industry [because the poultry will lose its
valuable free-range designation. - Mod.JW]. Officials say they will do so only
if the virus is discovered in the UK.

HK bird flu virus linked to South Korea 2004 strain
---------------------------------------------------
Virus samples taken from wild birds found dead in Hong Kong recently
were closely linked to a strain of the H5N1 virus that surfaced in
Japan and South Korea in 2004, but not the one spreading in Europe, a
top scientist said. This finding suggests that apart from the strain
circulating in Europe, there could be a reservoir of another strain
of the deadly H5N1 virus that is entrenched, probably in wild birds,
said microbiologist Malik Peiris of the University of Hong Kong.
Experts believe that the more distinct and lethal strains there are,
the greater would be the risk to humans.
8 wild birds and 2 stray chickens were found dead with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus over the past month [January 2006] in Hong Kong,
although poultry farms here have not been affected so far. Hong Kong
scientists analyzing virus isolates, or samples, from the dead birds
found that their genotype, or DNA makeup, belongs to a strain called
the V-genotype, which was found in dead birds in Japan and South
Korea in 2004, Peiris said in an interview late on Tuesday [21 Feb
2006]. "The viruses are in the process of being genetically analyzed;
they are similar ... It is the V-genotype; it was found in (bird)
outbreaks in Japan and Korea in 2004. They are not identical, but the
same genotype," he said. "The Japan outbreak is thought to have been
introduced by wild birds as well. So one of the things under
investigation is whether this is a genotype that is established in
wild birds ... one can't jump to conclusions, but this is one
possibility."
After inundating many parts of Asia since 2003, the virus has spread
rapidly across Europe, into Africa and now India, where people live
side-by-side with livestock and domestic fowl. While most of the more
than 90 people it has killed since 2003 contracted the virus directly
from birds, experts fear the virus will mutate and become easily
spread among people, triggering a pandemic that will kill millions of
people.
Peiris said the strain spreading in Europe was not linked to the
V-genotype, but rather to the strain found in dead migratory birds in
China's Qinghai Lake in the middle of 2005.
The World Health Organization, on its website, says viruses from
Qinghai Lake showed a distinctive mutation that led to greater death
rates in birds and mice during experiments. More than 6000 birds died
at Qinghai, and the WHO says the mutated strain involved there
"signaled an important change in the way the virus interacts with its
natural reservoir host."
Peiris said the strain in Hong Kong was not similar to the virus
found in Nigeria or Europe. "Those found in Turkey, Romania and
Siberia are all closely related to the one in Qinghai. But the Hong
Kong viruses are not closely related to the Qinghai one," he said.
The V-genotype is not known to have surfaced in countries in
Southeast Asia, Peiris added.
The WHO said research conducted in Southeast Asia has recently shown
that multiple distinct lineages of the H5N1 virus have become
established in poultry in different geographical regions, indicating
the virus in its different forms has become endemic in parts of Asia.
That research also detected highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in
apparently healthy migratory birds, further raising the risk of the
virus spreading and infecting more people.
Commenting on the danger that wild birds pose, Peiris said: "There is
very little risk of infection directly from wild birds to humans. The
risk is that wild birds can introduce the virus into poultry, then
the virus amplifies in the poultry, and of course, the human exposure
then becomes much greater." It was in Hong Kong that H5N1 made its
1st known jump to humans in 1997, killing 6 people. Since then, the
government has implemented strict measures to keep the virus out.

WHO: Changes in H5N1 virus may promote spread in birds
------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) says H5N1 avian influenza has
infected birds in 14 more countries since the beginning of this month
[February 2006], and recent genetic changes in the virus may have
something to do with its rapid spread in birds. The agency said
countries that have reported their 1st cases of H5N1 infection in
birds this month, in chronological order, are Iraq, Nigeria,
Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Iran, Austria,
Germany, Egypt, India, France, and Hungary. Authorities in Hungary
confirmed today [22 Feb 2006] that 3 dead swans were infected with
the virus.
In a separate statement yesterday [21 Feb 2006], the WHO said, "Some
recent evolutionary changes in the H5N1 virus appear to have made
control efforts more difficult and further international spread of
the virus in birds more likely." Among other things, the agency said
H5N1 viruses now may be able to infect some wild birds without
harming them, making it possible for migratory species to carry the
virus for long distances. In addition, H5N1 viruses have grown
tougher and more lethal to laboratory chickens.
The outbreak situations in the 14 countries have varied nearly as
widely as their geography.
Most of the affected European countries have good veterinary
surveillance and have found the virus only in a few wild birds, with
no evidence of spread to domestic birds, the WHO said. At the other
end of the spectrum, Iraq's bird outbreak was identified only after a
fatal human infection was found. In countries such as Azerbaijan and
Egypt, die-offs of domestic poultry heralded the spread of the virus.
Nigeria and India's [index] cases were found on commercial farms.
Other than Iraq, which has had 2 human cases, none of the newly
affected countries have reported any human cases. However, the WHO
said in another statement today [22 Feb 2006] that 15 patients with
possible signs of bird flu are under observation in hospitals in the
area where India's outbreak occurred. The patients are being tested
for the virus as well.
In reporting on the H5N1 virus's evolution, the WHO said viruses from
recent avian outbreaks have shown "remarkable similarity" to those
found in migratory birds that died at China's Qinghai Lake wildlife
sanctuary starting in April 2005. "Evidence is mounting that this
event, which resulted in the deaths of more than 6000 wild birds,
signaled an important change in the way the virus interacts with its
natural reservoir host," the agency said.
Before the Qinghai Lake die-off, the virus caused only a few
scattered deaths among migratory waterfowl, and the latter were not
known to carry the pathogen long distances, the agency said.
Viruses from Qinghai Lake had a distinctive point mutation that has
been linked experimentally with greater mortality in birds and mice,
the WHO said. Viruses from the recent outbreaks in Nigeria, Iraq, and
Turkey, as well as from earlier outbreaks in Russia, Kazakhstan, and
Mongolia, are "virtually identical to Qinghai Lake viruses." "It is
considered unusual for an avian influenza virus causing outbreaks in
birds to remain this genetically stable over so many months," the
statement continues. "This finding raises the possibility that the
virus, in its highly pathogenic form, has now adapted to at least
some species of migratory waterfowl and is coexisting with these
birds in evolutionary equilibrium, causing no apparent harm, and
traveling with these birds along their migratory routes. "If further
research verifies this hypothesis, reintroduction of the virus or
spread to new geographical areas can be anticipated when migratory
birds begin returning to their breeding areas."
The WHO stopped well short of assigning to migratory birds the major
blame for the virus's recent spread, a notion that has been
controversial. David Halvorson, DVM, a veterinarian in avian health
at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, said today [22 Feb 2006]
that H5N1 is probably being spread both by the movement of poultry
and by the movement of wild birds, but no one is absolutely certain.
"The fact is we don't really know why it's being found in so many
places so suddenly," he told CIDRAP News.
Halvorson suggested that trains may play a role in the spread of
H5N1, as they have in past outbreaks. In the United States in 1925,
"People were shipping poultry to New York live bird markets. Then,
dirty, contaminated crates were being shipped back." This contributed
to the spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak.
"I think that the trans-Asian railway system fits the temporal and
spatial pattern of virus distribution starting in July of last summer
[2005]," Halvorson commented. "For us in the Western Hemisphere, it
would be extremely unusual for water birds to be migrating thousands
of miles in July and August, a time when they are ordinarily taking
care of their young." Even today, it is normal to ship chickens by
rail in many places. Birds also can be found on buses and trucks
under circumstances that could contribute to spreading the virus,
Halvorson said.
Most of the bird cases found in Western Europe this month [February
2006] have been in wild swans, which has raised puzzling questions.
Halvorson listed some in an e-mail message: "Are swans an indicator
species? In other words, are they detecting (and dying from) AI
[avian influenza] in their environment? Or are they spreading it
around? Are they flying north or south? Are they both an indicator
species and also spreading it around?"
Jean Hars, a French veterinary epidemiologist quoted in an Agence
France-Presse (AFP) report yesterday [21 Feb 2006], said the mute
swan, the hardest-hit species in western Europe, is not migratory.
Hars said some whooper swans, a migratory species, on a German island
in the Baltic Sea were infected, but how they were exposed is a
mystery, because they stay in far northerly regions, where no H5N1
outbreaks have been reported.
In reporting on the evolution of the virus, the WHO said the recent
changes have not had any noticeable effect on the disease in humans.
"Human infections remain a rare event," the agency said. "The virus
does not spread easily from birds to humans or readily from person to
person. As reported here yesterday [21 Feb 2006], the agency said its
investigation of human cases in Turkey has yielded no evidence that
viral mutations have changed the epidemiology of the disease in
humans.
In today's [22 Feb 2006] statement, the WHO expressed concern about
the virus becoming established in backyard flocks, a known risk
factor for human H5N1 infections. Halvorson echoed the concern.
"Clearly, it's in wild birds, whether they're picking it up from
poultry or spreading it themselves," he said. "We have to separate
our poultry from wild birds. It's essential. Some places, it's going
to be easy. In some places, it will be virtually impossible."

Clearly, there are many routes involved, and a virus may be out of
sight, and until it has passed through and killed a threshold number
needed for observation, it will be invisible. Then it is
"everywhere!" The suggestion that the virus used the Trans-Asian
railway system makes eminent sense. - Mod.MHJ]

2 Taiwanese busted in duck tongue smuggling: 2005
-------------------------------------------------
2 Taiwanese men have been arrested for allegedly smuggling raw duck
tongues from China in the 1st such case amid lingering concerns over
bird flu, an official said yesterday [14 Apr *2005*]. Investigators in
central Taiwan nabbed the 2 men early Wednesday and confiscated
nearly 4 tons of tongues from about a million ducks, said the
official at the Bureau of Investigation. The tongues, with a retail
value of about NT 10 million (USD 317 000), were suspected to have
been shipped from China, the official said. They were destroyed
immediately, as China is considered vulnerable to bird flu, he said.
Cooked duck tongues are a delicacy among many locals and Hong Kong tourists.
Taiwan has slaughtered about 479 000 birds since H5N2, a less
virulent strain of the bird flu which has hit the Asian region, was
1st detected at a chicken farm in the central county of Changhua in
January last year [2004]. It later banned imports of tigers, lions,
wolves and other wild animals from most Southeast Asian countries as
the fatal bird flu outbreak claimed more lives in the region.

SITC in Connecticut (CT) has recently confirmed the importation of
frozen, boneless chicken feet from Thailand being sold as jellyfish.
The packages of prohibited boneless chicken feet have no labels or
markings and have been found in Connecticut and Massachusetts (MA).

SITC (CT) found 2700 lbs. [2.5 tons] of product in a cold storage
facility in boxes labeled jellyfish, product of Thailand. The
importer, Food King, Inc. located in West Haven, CT, admitted the
product was not manifested or declared on the importation documents.
It was brought into the country in a frozen container with various
types of seafood. 3 shipments of chicken feet totaling over 9000 lbs
have entered into the country since March 2004, all un-manifested on
the import documents and packed in boxes labeled jellyfish. The
Thailand distributor of record is Wales and Company, Universe
Limited, Bangkok, Thailand.
In markets, the product can be found with frozen squid and fish, not
with the poultry products. The importer is conducting a voluntary
recall of the chicken feet, removing the product from sale for
destruction from 68 stores located in CT, Georgia, Kentucky, MA,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island Tennessee, and
Wisconsin.
It is alleged that other importers are utilizing the same smuggling methods
(marking chicken feet as jellyfish) to illegally import the product. This
product was found in Florida in 2003 labeled Ka Kai (Thai for chicken feet).
In this case, the importer of record, International Inc., cannot be confirmed
to be tied into the CT distributor. If the product is found at the POE's
[ports of entry], mis-manifested, it is recommended that CBP seize the product
for destruction, issuing a violation. Importer and consignee information
should be forwarded to the local SITC office for market survey purposes.

[One can safely presume that the smuggling of poultry products out of
China and Thailand is a long established industry to wherever there
is a market for their products and an Asian resident population large
enough to want these old country delicacies. Then, all one needs is a
few chickens loose and scratching around out by the garbage behind
the kitchen or restaurant. It would be interesting to know, for
example, how often and in what quantity similar products are
intercepted along the Pacific Coast in North, Central or South
America, or in Rotterdam, Hamburg or Marseilles. - Mod.MHJ]
