After months of research, scientists have identified the pathogen at the heart of the starfish wasting disease that's been killing starfish by the millions along the Pacific shores of North America, according to research published Monday [17 Nov 2014].

They said it's a virus that's different from all other known viruses infecting marine organisms. They've dubbed it "sea star associated densovirus."

"When you look on a scale of hundreds and hundreds of animals, which we did, it's very clear that the virus is associated with symptomatic sea stars," said Ian Hewson, a microbiologist at Cornell University and lead author of the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Figuring out what brings on marine diseases is rare, especially among invertebrates. And identifying what virus is to blame is particularly difficult because a drop of seawater contains about 10 million viruses.

"Basically we've had to sort through to try to find the virus that is responsible for this disease," Hewson said.

To find the culprit virus, an international team of researchers from more than a dozen universities, aquariums, government agencies and other organizations worked together with the help of the National Science Foundation's coordination network for marine infectious disease.

Tissue samples of sick and healthy starfish were analyzed for all the possible pathogens associated with diseased starfish. The team then conducted DNA sequencing of the viruses and compared them to all of the other known viruses. Once they had identified a leading candidate, they tested it by injecting the densovirus into healthy starfish in an aquarium. Then, they watched to see whether the disease took hold. And sure enough it did.

"When we inoculated them, they died within about a week to 14 days," Hewson said, "whereas controls that had received viruses that had been destroyed by heat, did not become sick."

When researchers tried to figure out where the virus may have come from, they learned that West Coast starfish have been living with the virus for decades. They detected the densovirus in preserved starfish specimens from as far back as the 1940s.

"It's probably been sort of smoldering at a low level for a very long time," Hewson said.

What they do know, Hewson said, is that for about a decade before the 1st signs of sea star wasting syndrome were reported in the Pacific Northwest, starfish populations here were considered to be overabundant. And they think this might be a clue.

Because viruses often spread by physical contact, when host populations mushroom, there's greater opportunity for viruses to circulate. There's also a greater chance that a virus can mutate and become more lethal.

"Predators like this particular virus play a very important role in population control," Hewson said.

But densoviruses don't usually cause their hosts to die. What seems to be happening, Hewson explained, is that the sea star associated densovirus weakens a starfish's immune system. That makes the starfish more susceptible to bacterial infections, which ultimately lead to the gruesome deaths associated with the syndrome: lesions forming, arms falling off and stars melting into piles of mush.

Hewson said it may be possible to use antibiotics to help starfish fight off those bacterial infections.

"That's not a great strategy for the entire ocean or even small bays and inlets," Hewson says. "But it does give us some ability to keep them in captivity and potentially grow up resistant stocks in aquariums."

Scientists will also be watching to see what happens to the next generation of baby starfish that have sprung up in some areas along the Pacific Coast.

"We are interested in the potential for stars to develop resistance to this outbreak," says Drew Harvell, a marine epidemiologist at Cornell University and the University of Washington who has been coordinating the research. "The only way forward and to have sea stars in the future is for them to develop resistance and having new stars to propagate."

The research team also plans to continue investigating environmental factors such as warming water and ocean acidification that may have caused starfish to be more susceptible to the viral infection.

Mass mortalities of echinoids (sea stars) as a result of disease have been widely reported from all over the world. Wasting disease has been observed in sea stars in the west coast of USA periodically during warm-water years since it was 1st recognized in 1978 and was especially prevalent during the 1982-1984 El Nino. The episodes that have been occurring since 2013 have spread throughout the west coast of North America, from Baja California to Alaska. There is no association with El Nino.

As this densovirus appears to be part of the natural sea start parasite community, it is important to determine why it is causing mass mortalities. Is it acting as a natural mechanism of population control? (in which case conservation actions are not needed). Has it mutated to a more pathogenic form? (which runs counter our theoretical knowledge of the evolution of virulence). Has the physiological condition of sea stars deteriorated due to anthropogenic stressors and, therefore, they became more susceptible to the virus? If the latter were the case, applied research to inform conservation actions is urgently needed. A multi-scale interdisciplinary approach that aims to unveil the web of causation behind this disease is urgently needed.
