[In 2006, there was another outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in
this Anatolian region of Turkey bordering Greece. At that time, there
were 1113 susceptible birds, 19 cases, 19 deaths and the remaining
birds were slaughtered. This 2006 outbreak was at the opposite end of
the country from where the human deaths were occurring during this
time.

This outbreak falls into the pattern of localities separated from one
another by significant distances, which characterized the recent
outbreaks along the Black Sea reported and mapped in
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6700>.

A map that shows the town of Edirne, the location of the new outbreak,
is included in the OIE report referenced above or can be viewed at
