Indonesia: New Human Case Of Avian Influenza Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A teenager was confirmed yesterday [12 Aug 2006] as the latest bird
flu case in Indonesia, the country worst hit by avian influenza, with
44 human deaths recorded, health officials said. The 17-year-old
youth, who lives in an isolated area of West Java's Garut district,
has refused treatment at a hospital designated for bird flu cases,
said Runizar Rusin, an official with the Health Ministry's bird flu
center. The teenager is Indonesia's 59th [57th? - Mod.CP] confirmed
case based on local tests, which are usually accurate, and his
refusal typifies a lack of knowledge of the danger of the virus among
Indonesians in rural areas, Rusin said.
"His test results, which I obtained today [13 Aug 2006], show that he
is positive for H5N1 [avian influenza], but he is not hospitalized,
as, being a villager living in an isolated area, he thought that he's
just suffering from ordinary flu after visiting a local health
clinic," Rusin said. "But fortunately, the clinic took samples of his
blood and saliva and sent them for testing, and they came out
positive. Now our team in the field is trying to take him to a
hospital in West Java's main town of Bandung," he said. The teenager
had been in contact with dead chickens near his house before he
became ill, he said.
Rusin said samples from the teenager were confirmed by the Health
Ministry's research and development laboratory and the US Naval
Medical Research Unit laboratory in Jakarta. Samples from his
relatives and neighbors had also been taken for testing, and a
culling of poultry within a one-km radius of his house would be
carried out soon, Rusin said. His case comes after officials earlier
this week confirmed the deaths of 2 teenagers from the virus, taking
the number of human fatalities to 44 in Indonesia.
Most of the more than 130 people killed by the virus, including 6 in
Cambodia, have contracted the disease through close proximity to
infected birds. "Bird flu is still the hot issue for us. We are still
worrying that villagers in the affected area might have been selling
their chickens or ducks to others secretly," Nou Muth said. Several
hundred domestic ducks, which can carry the H5N1 virus without
necessarily showing symptoms, had been culled within 3-km radius of
the outbreak, agriculture official Yim Vanthan said.

This Gulf Times report states that this case is the 59th confirmed
human case of H5N1 avian influenza to have occurred in Indonesia.
However, the most recent update from WHO gives the number of
confirmed cases as 56 (with 44 deaths) as of Wed 9 Aug 2006, and we
have seen no reports of 57th and 58th cases. Provisionally, we are
regarding this case as the 57th case until the situation can be
clarified. - Mod.CP]
