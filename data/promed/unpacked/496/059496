A 33-student group in Taparto community school in Andes municipality, southwest Antioquia [department], had to be transported to the local hospital after a massive intoxication occurred.

According to the 1st reports from the administrative department for disaster prevention (DAPARD, according to its Spanish initials), the students may have been affected by fumigation of coffee crops in the vicinity of the school.

The local Health Direction in Antioquia sent personnel to the affected community in order to assess the condition of affected students and the presence of the Local Autonomous Corporation (Corantioquia) was requested in order to assess potential environmental and biological risks.

"Now patients are being taken care of, and we are considering transporting one affected girl to Medellin [the capital of Antioquia department]," said Mr. Cesar Hernandez, chief of the aforementioned entity.

[The article is sadly lacking in detail, and it is impossible to make educated guesses about what may have affected the students.

If the crops are close to the campus, it may be an insecticide, perhaps a carbamate or an organophosphate that was being sprayed for control of insects. But no clinical signs are described, nor is any type of treatment indicated.

We hope they all successfully recovered.
