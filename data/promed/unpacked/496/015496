In Chelyabinsk (Russia), 197 people have been infected with Opisthorchis, and
more than a quarter of them are children. The number of infected people has
been increasing since the beginning of 2003; already 47 children have been
diagnosed. According to the Information Agency "Ural-Press-Inform," all of
them ate fish from the carp family that were infected by _Opisthorchis
felineus_, [the Siberian liver] fluke.
More and more inhabitants of the Ural region are being diagnosed with [the
disease] opisthorchiasis. Local rivers and lakes in the Ural region are
infested with the dangerous parasite. According to Ludmila Pavlova, manager
of radioactive and ecologic safety in Chelyabinsk, infected fish do not look
any different from non-infected fish.
2 weeks after the flukes enter the human body, the parasites infect
the biliary tract. Symptoms of the infection include [normal] temperature,
general malaise, skin rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Treatment of
opisthorchiasis is long and expensive. Severe anemia and liver damage
incapacitate the infected person for 1-2 months.
It is easier to prevent Opisthorchis infection than to treat it. It is
recommended to eat only fish bought from shops with a system of sanitary and
veterinary controls. Opisthorchis worms die if the fish is boiled for 20
minutes or cooked in the oven for 40 minutes. Hot smoking kills flukes but
not cold smoking.

[The final hosts of _Opisthorchis felineus_ and _O. viverrini_ include human,
dogs, and cats, all of which get infected from eating raw or undercooked
fish. _O. felineus_ infection is known to occur in Russia. Eggs are excreted
in feces and hatch into miracidia [larvae] after being ingested by snails,
transform into free-living cercaria, which penetrate and encyst
(metacercaria) in susceptible fish species. When ingested by humans, cats, or
dogs the metacercaria excyst [hatch] and migrate to the intrahepatic bile
duct system, where they can live for years.
The long-term complications are biliary duct constrictions, cirrhosis, and
cholangiocarcinoma [cancer]. Treatment with praziquantel in a single dose is
usually effective and has been used in mass treatment campaigns. Treatment of
humans, cats, and dogs and proper cooking of fish are the most important
means of control. - Mod.EP]
