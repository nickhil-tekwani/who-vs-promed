A total of 4 neighborhoods in the Aegean province of Denizli were quarantined against the risk of anthrax on [Thu 16 Nov 2017].

Denizli's local head of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Ahmet Kocakaplan said livestock sales in the Emirhisar, Haydan, Omerli and Incecoy neighborhoods in Denizli's Civril district are banned for 21 days.

The anthrax concern was raised after the death of 2 cattle in the Emirhisar neighborhood. Teams arrived at the scene to take samples from dead cattle for laboratory examination. The examination showed the animals had been killed from anthrax and the 4 neighborhoods in Civril were put under quarantine.

Kocakaplan also said they would start the vaccination process against anthrax as soon as possible.

"Up to 2 bovine animals have died in the Emircik neighborhood. We suspected it had been due to anthrax. We sent the samples to the lab and the results determined it to be anthrax. The Emirhisar, Haydan, Omerli and Incecoy neighborhoods are under quarantine. Livestock sales are banned for at least 21 days," he said. Animal products had also been destroyed, stated Kocakaplan.

"If there is no trace of disease, the quarantine will be lifted after 21 days. Milk and cheese from the animals have been destroyed. We will start the vaccination process in the neighborhoods that are under quarantine," he added.

[Denizli is infrequently afflicted with anthrax in a country where this disease is widespread and enzootic. The last bovine outbreaks were in 2015 and 2006. But Turkey differs from the other European countries by this disease being essentially year round and outbreaks in the colder autumn months are common. If ever a country needed to consider initiating a serious surveillance and control programme for this disease, Turkey should be at the front of the line. Just taking bovine outbreaks there were 60 in 2016 and 54 in 2015, with higher numbers in previous years. Presently only 2 percent of the cattle are vaccinated.

To find Denizli, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denizli_Province. It is south western Turkey within sight of the Aegean; it is part of the Aegean Region. - Mod.MHJ
