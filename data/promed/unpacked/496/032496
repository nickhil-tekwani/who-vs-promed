[1] Review (MMWR)
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2014
Source: Global Control and Regional Elimination of Measles, 2000-2012 Weekly [abridged & edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6305a5.htm?s_cid=mm6305a5_e


In 2010, the World Health Assembly established 3 milestones toward global measles eradication to be reached by 2015: 1) increase routine coverage with the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) for children aged one year to 90 per cent or more nationally and 80 per cent or more in every district, 2) reduce and maintain annual measles incidence at under 5 cases per million, and 3) reduce measles mortality by 95 per cent from the 2000 estimate.

After the adoption by member states of the South East Asia Region (SEAR) of the goal of measles elimination by 2020, elimination goals have been set by member states of all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, and reaching measles elimination in 4 WHO regions by 2015 is an objective of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). This report updates the previous report for 2000-2011 (2) and describes progress toward global control and regional elimination of measles during 2000-2012.

During this period, increases in routine MCV coverage, plus supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) reaching 145 million children in 2012, led to a 77 per cent decrease worldwide in reported measles annual incidence, from 146 to 33 per million population, and a 78 per cent decline in estimated annual measles deaths, from 562 400 to 122 000. Compared with a scenario of no vaccination, an estimated 13.8 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination during 2000-2012. Achieving the 2015 targets and elimination goals will require countries and their partners to raise the visibility of measles elimination and make substantial and sustained additional investments in strengthening health systems.

Immunization activities
-------------------------
WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) use data from administrative records and surveys reported annually by member states to estimate MCV1 coverage among children aged one year. Since 2003, member states also have reported the number of districts with greater than or equal to 80 per cent MCV1 coverage. Estimated MCV1 coverage increased globally from 73 per cent to 84 per cent during 2000-2009, then remained at 84 per cent through 2012. The number of member states with greater than or equal to 90 per cent MCV1 coverage increased from 83 (43 per cent) in 2000 to 128 (66 per cent) in 2012. The number of member states with greater than or equal to 90 per cent MCV1 coverage nationally that also had greater than or equal to 80 per cent MCV1 coverage in all districts increased from 40 (38 per cent) of 104 in 2003 to 58 (45 per cent) of 128 in 2012. Of the estimated 21.2 million infants who did not receive MCV1 in 2012, about 13.5 million (64 per cent) were in 6 member states: India (6.4 million), Nigeria (3.8 million), Ethiopia (1.0 million), Indonesia (0.9 million), Pakistan (0.7 million), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million).

During 2000-2012, the number of member states providing the 2nd dose of measles vaccine (MCV2) through routine immunization services increased from 96 (50 per cent) to 145 (75 per cent). During 2012, about 145 million children received MCV during SIAs conducted in 33 member states. MCV coverage greater than or equal to 95 per cent after SIAs was reported by 18 (55 per cent) member states, and 12 (36 per cent) member states conducted coverage surveys to validate coverage. During measles SIAs, 20 (61 per cent) member states included one or more additional child health interventions; 18 (55 per cent) included oral poliovirus vaccination.

Disease incidence
---------------
Effective measles surveillance includes case-based surveillance with laboratory testing to confirm cases. During 2004-2012, the number of member states using case-based surveillance increased from 120 (62 per cent) to 187 (96 per cent). During 2000-2012, the number of member states with access to standardized quality-controlled testing through the WHO Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network increased from 71 (37 per cent) to 191 (98 per cent).

During 2000-2012, the number of measles cases reported worldwide each year decreased 73 per cent, from 853 480 to a historic low of 226 722, and measles incidence decreased 77 per cent, from 146 to 33 cases per million population per year. The decrease in 2012 occurred in all regions and followed 3 years of increasing numbers of cases. During 2000-2012, the Region of the Americas (AMR) maintained measles incidence at under 5 cases/million; in 2012, reported incidence in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) was 6 cases/million, a historic low. The percentage of reporting member states with under 5 cases/million increased from 55 per cent (104 of 188) in 2011 to 64 per cent (119 of 187) in 2012. During 2012, large measles outbreaks were reported by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (72 029 cases), India (18 668), Indonesia (15 489), Ukraine (12 746), Somalia (9983), Sudan (8523), Pakistan (8046), and Romania (7450). China reported 6183 cases, a historic low after a steady annual decrease from 3159 cases in 2010.

Genotyping results from isolates from persons with measles were reported from 49 (39 per cent) of the 125 member states reporting measles cases in 2012. Six measles genotypes were identified; the predominant genotypes were B3 in the African Region (AFR) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR); D4 in the European Region (EUR); H1, D8, and D9 in SEAR and WPR; with one G3 reported from one outbreak in WPR.

Mortality estimates
-------------------
In response to the lack of reliable data on the number of measles deaths from many member states, WHO has developed a model to estimate mortality using numbers and age distribution of reported cases, routine and SIA MCV coverage, and age-specific, country-specific case fatality ratios. The model was refined in 2013 to reflect the impact of different SIA target age ranges and the population targeted in subnational SIAs. These refinements, together with new 2012 measles vaccination coverage and case data for all member states, updated data for the period before 2012 for some member states, and updated population estimates, led to new mortality estimates for 2000-2012. During this period, estimated measles deaths decreased 78 per cent, from 562 400 to 122 000; all regions had substantial reductions in estimated measles mortality, ranging from 52 per cent in EMR to 88 per cent in AFR. Compared with a scenario of no vaccination against measles, an estimated 13.8 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination during 2000-2012.

Regional verification of measles elimination
-------------------------------------
By 2012, regional verification commissions were established in AMR, EUR, and WPR, and frameworks for documenting elimination were developed in AMR and EUR. While verifying elimination, member states in AMR uncovered weaknesses in surveillance and routine immunization programs, leading to a regional emergency plan of action to strengthen these programs.

MMWR editorial note
----------------------
During 2000-2012, increasing routine MCV coverage worldwide and regular SIAs in member states lacking high coverage with 2 doses of MCV contributed to a 77 per cent decrease in reported measles incidence and a 78 per cent reduction in estimated measles mortality, reaching historic lows. During this period, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 13.8 million deaths. Measles elimination continues to be maintained in AMR, and WPR is approaching measles elimination. However, based on current trends and performance, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) concluded that the 2015 global targets and regional elimination targets in EUR, EMR, and AFR will not be achieved on time.

AFR, EMR, and SEAR, the regions with the largest number of infants not receiving MCV1 through routine immunization services in 2012, had large measles outbreaks during 2012 and had 98 per cent of the estimated global measles mortality burden, highlighting the need to strengthen immunization systems. Globally, 2012 might represent a temporary low in the normal cycle of measles incidence. Preventing a resurgence will require progress in reaching greater than or equal to 95 percent of children with 2 MCV doses through routine immunization services and high-quality SIAs.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. 1st, MCV coverage estimates likely included errors resulting from inaccurate estimates of the size of target populations, inaccurate reporting of doses delivered, and inclusion of SIA doses given to children outside the target age group. 2nd, underestimation in surveillance data can occur because not all patients with measles seek care, and not all of those who seek care are reported. These errors in coverage and surveillance data in turn affect the accuracy of the measles mortality model results. Finally, some member states also maintain multiple reporting systems for measles and might, like India, report aggregate, unconfirmed cases rather than case-based data.

To achieve measles elimination, member states should aim to fully implement measles control and elimination strategies described in GVAP and the 2012-2020 Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan of the Measles and Rubella Initiative, which include achieving vaccination coverage greater than or equal to 95 per cent with 2 doses of MCV administered through routine immunization or SIAs and maintaining this coverage uniformly across all districts. For many member states now at under 90 per cent coverage nationally, reaching greater than or equal to 95 per cent coverage will require substantial and sustained additional investments of financial and human resources to strengthen health systems and achieve equitable access to immunization services. Further progress toward achieving the 2015 global measles control targets and regional measles elimination targets will also require member states and partners to increase the visibility of measles elimination activities and make the needed investments.

Summary
--------
During 2000-2011, global vaccination coverage with the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine increased from 72 per cent to 84 per cent, about 225 million children received a 2nd opportunity for measles immunization during measles supplemental immunization activities in 2011, and global reported measles cases decreased until 2008, then increased in 2010 and 2011. By 2011, about 45 per cent of countries had not met the incidence target of under 5 cases/million. As milestones toward eventual global measles eradication, the 2010 World Health Assembly endorsed a series of targets to be met by 2015.

In 2012, the estimated global coverage with the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine remained at the 2011 level of 84 per cent, but the number of countries providing a 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine through routine immunization services increased from 96 (50 per cent) in 2000 to 145 (75 per cent) in 2012, and 144 million children were vaccinated against measles during vaccination campaigns. In 2012, annual reported measles incidence was 33 reported cases/million population, a decline of 77 per cent from 146 cases/million in 2000, and estimated measles deaths decreased 78 per cent, from 562 400 to 122 000. An estimated 13.8 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination during 2000-2012.

Although measles incidence decreased during 2011-2012, WHO's African, Eastern Mediterranean, and European regions are not on track to achieving their elimination targets. To accelerate progress toward achieving these regional measles elimination targets, national governments and partners are urged to give these efforts high priority and adequate resources to achieve their commonly agreed upon goals, and in so doing reach the targets set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan.

[2] UK (ex Philippines)
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2014
Source: Public Health England, Health Protection Report [edited]
http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2014/news0514.htm#msls


An outbreak of measles has been reported in the Philippines in connection with which 10 cases have been reported in the UK (to date, since 1 Dec 2013) in people returning from the country.

Public Health England's Immunisation Department has advised health protection teams that they may receive an increased number of notifications of suspected measles cases in travellers from the Philippines, or alerts of contacts of measles cases on flights from the country. Current advice is that individuals with clinical features compatible with measles illness who have recently travelled to the Philippines should be treated as likely measles cases, and public health actions -- such as identifying vulnerable contacts -- commenced ahead of laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis.

Ages of the UK cases ranged from less than one year to 45 years. Five cases were in children under 2 years of age, 3 of whom were under 13 months of age and, therefore, not yet eligible for immunisation. The majority of the cases (8) had travelled to the Philippines to visit family and friends, and at least 4 cases were infectious on their flight back to the UK, raising the possibility of onward transmission and further cases occurring.

All the cases presented to frontline health care services with a rash illness, and in some instances patients were not isolated immediately, exposing health care workers and other vulnerable patients. Health protection teams were reminded that health care workers who have had a significant exposure to a measles case should be able to demonstrate satisfactory evidence of protection against measles to continue working, as per national guidance.

The Philippines outbreak has prompted a reminder from the PHE-commissioned National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) about the need for all travellers to ensure that they are up to date with all vaccines (including MMR) according to the current UK schedule, as travel is a factor in international spread of the infection.

[3] Syria
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2024
Source: Expatica [abbreviated & edited]
http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/measles-deaths-fall-to-record-low-but-rebound-in-syria_284662.html


The number of people dying from measles has fallen to a record low, driven down by mass vaccination campaigns, but outbreaks in crisis zones such as Syria remain a threat, the UN said on Thursday [6 Feb 2014]. "We have reached a record low in measles cases, with a 77 percent decline from 2000 to 2012, which has led to a record drop in the number of estimated deaths, by 78 per cent," said Robert Perry of WHO's immunisation department.

Measles, which is highly contagious and particularly deadly for children, claimed some 122 000 lives in 2012, WHO said. This is the most recent year for which global figures are available. Back in 2000, the toll was a stark 562 000. Over the same period of time, the annual number of cases has been driven down from more than 853 000 to close to 227 000.

"Despite these gains, the progress is still fragile," Perry told reporters. "In nations where the disease had been close to eradication, war has set back efforts. Syria had a very good programme, and very high coverage, with 2 doses of vaccine through routine coverage. It very rarely did specific measles campaigns, and was well on the way to measles elimination up until 2012," said Perry. Perry said that the number of measles cases recorded in Syria was 13 in 2012, but that the figure last year [2013] was thought to be over 700. "You really see that tracking to kids not having access to health services, including measles vaccination," he added.

With the 3-year civil war having driven millions of Syrians from their homes, the disease has reared its head in neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey. There have been similar concerns about a revival of polio in Syria. Measles hotbeds have persisted, notably in African countries facing a mix of shaky health systems and conflict; an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo infected 72 000 in 2012.

Rich countries have not been unaffected either, for different reasons. In Britain, the number of reported cases in 2012 was close to 2100. Perry said that that was the result of parents' wariness due to the alleged links between measles vaccines and autism. "That has since been found not to be true, but those fears still bounce around the blogosphere and Internet and have led to a drop of coverage in Britain, and now those children are the ones being affected," he said.

New mortality estimates from WHO show that annual measles deaths have reached historic lows, dropping 78 per cent from more than 562 000 in 2000 to 122 000 in 2012. During this time, an estimated 13.8 million deaths had been prevented by measles vaccination, and surveillance data showed that reported cases declined 77 per cent from 853 480 to 226 722.

The report, which was made available to the Ghana News Agency on Thursday [6 Feb 2014] by Fadela Chaib, WHO Communications Officer, noted that these gains are a result of global routine measles immunization coverage holding steady at 84 per cent and 145 countries having introduced a routine 2nd dose of measles vaccine to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks. It said in addition to routine immunization, countries vaccinated 145 million children during mass campaigns against measles in 2012 and reached more than one billion since 2000, with the support of the Measles and Rubella Initiative. It noted that despite the impressive gains made, progress towards measles elimination remains uneven with some populations still unprotected. It said measles continues to be a global threat, with 5 of 6 WHO regions still experiencing large outbreaks and with the Region of the Americas responding to many importations of measles cases.

The report said the African, Eastern Mediterranean and European regions are not likely to meet their measles elimination targets on time. It said the Region of the Americas has achieved measles elimination and continues to maintain this status while the Western Pacific region is approaching its target. It said routine measles vaccination coverage is an important progress indicator towards meeting Millennium Development Goal 4 because of its potential to reduce child mortality and widely recognized as a marker of access to children's health services. It said without improved immunization coverage both through routine services and mass campaigns, outbreaks will continue to occur, hampering efforts to meet global elimination targets and prevent additional deaths. It said the ability to contain outbreaks by improving routine coverage and, when necessary, implementing high quality vaccination campaigns requires countries to place a high priority on elimination goals and to invest heavily in health systems improvements.

According to the report, measles outbreaks in 2012 by WHO Africa region include Democratic Republic of Congo - 72 029, Burkina Faso - 7362, Nigeria - 6447, Angola - 4458, Ethiopia - 4347, Uganda - 2027, South Sudan - 1952, United Republic of Tanzania - 1668, Ghana - 1613, and Equatorial Guinea - 1190. It said worse cases were recorded in Somalia - 9983 and Sudan - 8523.

The Measles and Rubella Initiative, which was 1st launched in 2001, is a global partnership led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, United States CDC, UNICEF, and WHO. The Measles and Rubella Initiative is committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome, reducing measles deaths by 95 per cent by 2015, and achieving measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 regions by 2020.

More than 1000 measles cases, including one death, were reported in Guinea since the onset of the epidemic on Friday [31 Jan 2014] said the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene for the 33 prefecture.

The epidemic of measles was reported in 24 prefectures and 5 towns of Conakry, where security measures have been taken to identify the disease of children in order to minimize the distress. In the capital region, more than 2/3rds of the cases were recorded in the 5 towns of the governorate of Conakry.

Dr Sakoba Keita, responsible for the prevention and fight against the disease and the health minister, said a major campaign of vaccination will be launched next week in order to make the necessary vaccine available to protect children from 6 months to 10 years. A large batch of vaccine from Senegal is currently expected by the Guinean authorities, he said.

According to him, the disease spreads very rapidly in children, especially during the period from March to May, which is an appropriate time for combating the disease. The Red Cross is working hard to establish the necessary facilities for protection of vulnerable children.

http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/case+measles+reported+Calgary/9482060/story.html


Three of the 4 Calgarians diagnosed with measles this year [2014] were fully immunized for the illness, an "unusual" occurrence that has public health officials investigating the strain circulating.

But Dr Judy MacDonald, Calgary's medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services, said the rare occurrence shouldn't dissuade people from getting vaccinated or making sure their doses are up to date, since immunization still leads to a milder case of the disease when it strikes. "It's a possibility that these 3 happened to get measles even though they've been immunized. But they've had milder illness than they would have had if they hadn't been immunized. But it is unusual," she said.

The health authority provided new details on Friday [7 Feb 2014] about a 4th measles case in Calgary in what's shaping up to be a puzzling year regarding the highly infectious disease. The latest case involves an elementary-school aged child at Clear Water Academy who was immunized, hadn't travelled to areas experiencing wider outbreaks, and with no apparent links to the city's other cases. Public health officials are urging people who were at the school's Keller Hall during the school day on 28, 29 and 30 Jan 2014 to ensure that their immunization records are up to date and watch for signs of measles.

The initial 2 cases, considered unrelated, involved a 16 year old who had travelled to the Philippines, which is experiencing a measles outbreak, and an unimmunized 16 month old who'd also travelled to the country. A 3rd case involved an adult who was also immunized and had no travel history. None of the 4 cases sent the patients to hospital. According to MacDonald, public health officials plan to go through the 4 cases "with a fine-toothed comb to determine whether there might have been a link we're not actually aware of." MacDonald has sought further information from virologists and Alberta Health to take a closer look at the type of measles in the Philippines, but so far experts say there's nothing unusual about the virus.

Between 2000 and 2013, Calgary saw 20 measles cases. Of those, 18 were either not fully immunized or had unknown records. Measles leaves people contagious before they start to show symptoms. It starts out with a fever, and a rash 3 to 7 days later, but a person is considered infectious the day before the fever hits.

http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/RPI-confirms-one-measles-case-5198236.php


Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [RPI] officials say the spread of measles is unlikely after a student tested positive for the illness last week. The confirmed case was in a student who had a waiver allowing him or her to attend RPI without vaccinations for medical or religious reasons. But in an alert to the college community on Saturday [1 Feb 2014], RPI's medical director Dr Leslie Lawrence said most students, staff, and faculty would be immune, either from being vaccinated or from being born before 1957. The vaccine -- called MMR for measles, mumps, rubella -- is given once after a person's 1st birthday and then again between the ages of 4 and 6. Those who were born before 1957 had natural immunity after likely being exposed to the virus. The shot is required if one attends public and most private schools, unless a waiver is granted.

RPI last had a case of measles in 2011. The illness is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, cough and a rash all over the body. For every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the disease has largely been wiped out in the US, it can still be easily contracted in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa if one is not immunised. RPI has 14 other students who have vaccination waivers and alerted all of them to the case. The student who has measles is currently under medical care and appears to be stable, Lawrence said in the alert. "The student health center continues to monitor the situation and is in close communication with the state Department of Health. We are taking all appropriate actions and precautions to minimize the risk of exposure for any other members of our community," said RPI spokeswoman Allison Newman in a statement.

RPI officials said that if one is uncertain of their own immunization history, check with a primary care physician. Members of the college community can also call RPI's health center at 276-6287 with further questions. Measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000. But last year [2013], the illness saw its largest spike since then, with 189 cases reported. The 2013 outbreak was made up of 58 people who contracted measles within an orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn after an unvaccinated teen brought it back after traveling to London.

A young child has been diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease that can lead to serious side effects, the state Health Department said. It is the 2nd confirmed case of measles in the capital region within a week.

People who visited Albany Medical Center, where the child was admitted, may have been exposed to the illness on 31 Jan or 1 Feb 2014, the Health Department said. People who have not been immunized against measles may be at risk if they were in these locations at Albany Med Center: either the C or D buildings, from 7:45 am through 8 pm on 31 Jan 2014, or C7 unit between 8 pm on 31 Jan 2014 and midnight on 1 Feb 2014. People who believe they were exposed and are not immune to measles or not sure of their immunity should contact their doctor or the county health department. Most New Yorkers have been vaccinated against measles. Children typically receive the 2 doses needed by the time they are 6 years old.

The child who became ill had not been vaccinated, according to the state health department. Although measles is usually considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. Symptoms usually appear in 10 to 12 days but can occur as late as 18 days after exposure. Symptoms generally appear in 2 stages:

1) In the 1st stage, which lasts 2 to 4 days, the individual may have a runny nose, cough and a slight fever. Eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever gradually rises, often peaking as high as 105 F. Small, bluish-white spots surrounded by a reddish area may appear on the gums and inside the cheeks.
2) The 2nd stage, beginning on the 3rd to 7th day, consists of a red, blotchy rash lasting 5 to 6 days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads until it reaches the hands and feet.

The 1st case of measles, confirmed by the state Health Department on Tuesday [4 Feb 2014], affected a student last weekend at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy. Anyone who visited the RPI campus last week or Mohonasen High School in Rotterdam from 7 am to 2 pm on 26 Jan 2014 could have been exposed.

Three recent cases of measles in Orange County have health officials concerned. Three confirmed cases of measles in Orange County over the past 6 weeks prompted health officials to send an advisory to local physicians. In the 1st 2 cases, the afflicted had traveled to Asia, but the 3rd patient had not traveled out of the country, according to the letter sent to health care providers, dated Monday [3 Feb 2014]. The recent outbreak has alarmed officials because measles is highly contagious, and over the past 5 years, the county has seen at most only one case on average per year. "This recent increase in cases raises the potential for additional cases in the near future," according to the advisory sent by the Orange County Health Care Agency.

Symptoms usually start 10 to 12 days after exposure, but sometimes up to 3 weeks, and include 2 to 4 days later a rash, usually around the ears and hairline, that can spread to the face and arms and legs. In the 3 local cases, the patients went to area health care providers. More than 150 patients and their family and friends faced potential exposure and required their own evaluations, according to the advisory. Many had to undergo testing and receive vaccination, according to the HCA.

Measles is considered "extremely infectious" and can spread through direct contact or through the air, according to county health officials. Physicians were advised that any patients with measles symptoms should be isolated and given a surgical mask. Only health care workers who have immunity to the disease should care for the patients, according to the county.

MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] Medical's associate medical director Howard Heller has confirmed that an MIT graduate student was diagnosed with measles on 4 Feb 2014. The student lives in graduate student housing on campus and is believed to have contracted the illness during a recent trip to South America.

While measles is an extremely contagious and potentially serious illness, the threat to the MIT community is extremely low, Heller emphasizes. "This country has not seen a measles outbreak on a college campus in decades," he notes, "and MIT, like most universities, has a thoroughly vaccinated student population. In our community, those at greatest risk would be family members of MIT students from countries where measles immunization is not routine and infants who have not yet been vaccinated."

Measles, a viral, respiratory illness that is also called rubeola, typically begins with symptoms that mimic those of the common cold: mild to moderate fever, sore throat, cough, and runny nose. But within a few days, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth, followed by a reddish rash that starts at the hairline and spreads down the body. The body rash is often accompanied by high fever.

People are considered to be immune to measles if they have had 2 doses of the vaccine or were born in the United States before 1957. MIT Medical has vaccinations available for those who have not been adequately vaccinated in the past and can also test the immunity levels of individuals who are unsure about their vaccination history. To schedule measles vaccinations, members of the MIT community may call their primary care providers directly or MIT Medical's Health Screening department at 617-253-1777.

Another person has been diagnosed with measles after flying to Darwin from the Philippines. The Northern Territory Health Department says it is the 19th confirmed case of the highly contagious disease in the Top End [the extreme north region of the Northern Territory] over the past 3 weeks. It says the most recent case was infectious while on flight JQ-78 from Manila to Darwin, a late night flight on Fri 31 Jan 2014.

It says anyone on that flight who is not "measles immune" should be checked for the signs and symptoms of measles. Several other cases of measles have been reported in people who had recently return from Southeast Asian countries.

The Northern Territory Centre for Disease Control says the measles outbreak has now spread to Katherine, about 300 km south of Darwin, with 2 cases reported there. The centre's Dr Vicki Krause says Territorians should ensure they are immunised against the disease. "This is the largest number of cases of measles we have had for some years," she said. "It does make us somewhat concerned about the vaccine coverage in our general population. Most young people are actually fairly well covered, but parents should be checking their children's immunisation records."

Symptoms include fever, coughing and a runny nose followed by a red, blotchy rash several days later. Dr Krause says the effects of measles can be severe. "About a 3rd of cases with measles will have complications," she said.

Outbreaks of measles around the world are prompting calls for Kiwis [New Zealanders] to be vigilant about immunisation. Since late December 2013, at least 28 people who have recently been overseas, or been in contact with someone who had recently been, have caught the highly-infectious disease. Most of the cases have been linked to the Taupo and Turangi area, where an infected teenager returned from a Sydney hip-hop dance festival in early December 2013. The other cases are from people travelling from overseas, primarily the Philippines, or those who have been in contact with them.

Outbreaks have also been identified in Australia and Indonesia. "Checking on whether you have been immunised is especially important before you travel overseas," says associate health minister Jo Goodhew. Public health units are being commended for preventing a further spread of the illness in New Zealand by ensuring that those with the virus are quarantined at home. However, Mrs Goodhew says the country's history of poor immunisation coverage means that certain age groups, including teenagers and young adults, are particularly susceptible.

Anyone who suspects they may have measles is advised to call their GP, or Healthline on 0800 611 116 as soon as possible.
