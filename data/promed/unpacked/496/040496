[Dr Feshbach noted that the apparent ratio of TB of the respiratory tract
to total TB cases in the report is aberrant - Mod.JW
I believe that there was a typographical error in [the original
transmission. Instead of 65,576, the incidence of TB of the respiratory
tract should [probably be 75,576, this would yield the usual 93 plus
percentage (93.2%).
