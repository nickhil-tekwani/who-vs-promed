Farmers have been urged to up their vigilance after the bluetongue virus was detected at a farm in Kendal.

Movement restrictions are in place at the unidentified premises while the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) rules out spreading by local midges.

The disease was found in 32 cattle imported from an area in France where the disease is prevalent.

Two of the animals were found in Kendal, and experts are stressing the need for farmers in South Lakeland to vaccinate their stock against the midge-borne virus.

[It will be interesting to note which BTV serotype has been identified in the cows on the Kendal farm and the location in France from where the animals have been imported.

While most of France is infected by BTV-8, a recent introduction of BTV-4 has been identified in continental France. - Mod.AS
