Anthrax confirmed in 2nd cow at Wiltshire [county, England] farm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Animal Plant and Health Agency [APHA] say it "would not be unusual" for this to happen, and that "this development is not unexpected."

"All the appropriate precautions are being taken as with the 1st cow, and the rest of the group continue to be monitored closely. The risk of infection in close human contacts of the animal is very low and we continue to work with PHE [Public Health England] to monitor potential human contacts." -- APHA spokesperson

The 1st case was confirmed earlier in the week [week of 26 Oct 2015] following the death of a cow. Movement restrictions were imposed at the farm and the animal's carcass was incinerated.

The last anthrax outbreak in livestock in Great Britain was in 2006.

[This 2nd cow affected is a good lesson to check the temperatures of any cows in the affected group to identify any incubating cases. Before initiating vaccination, it is worth treating the group at risk with a long-acting antibiotic such as Liquamycin (or LA-200). Then wait for 7-10 days for the titre to drop before vaccinating with Sterne, which is a live vaccine.

In a coup d'escalier I realised my commentary on the previous posting had spoken enthusiastically about soil recovery of _Bacillus anthracis_ while in fact it can present a serious challenge. The optimum method for recovering _B. anthracis_ from soil is Antonio Fasanella's GABRI method, which I saw used in relation to clay soils we collected in 8 farm compounds in Bangladesh in 2010 from places where cattle had been slaughtered and butchered 3 months before, and that had since been walked over daily by cattle, goats, people, dogs, and chickens. See: Antonio Fasanella, et al. 2013. Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (G.A.B.R.I.) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination. BMC Microbiology 2013;13:167. doi:10.1186/1471-2180-13-167 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728113/. Try it. You will not be disappointed. - Mod.MHJ
