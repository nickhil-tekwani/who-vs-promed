The Junta de Andalusia this [Fri 21 Oct 2022], reported the detection of the first outbreak of West Nile Virus this year [2022] in the community. So far, it has affected 2 horses located in the Cadiz municipality of Tarifa. According to the administration, the outbreak was declared on [Mon 17 Oct 2022].

At around the same date last year [2021], the 9th and last outbreak was detected, which affected 10 horses. In 2020, there were 32 outbreaks in Andalusia, mainly in the municipalities of Sevilla, Cadiz, and Huelva.

On [26 Sep 2022], the first positive case of West Nile Virus was registered in a person in the [Andalusia] autonomous community. It was in an 89-year-old woman, a resident of the Cadiz municipality of Vejer de la Frontera. A day later, they announced the detection of the virus in wild birds in the same area.

[Tarifa is a Spanish municipality in the province of Cádiz, Andalusia autonomous community (map at https://tinyurl.com/4y9vjta8).

Birds are the primary vertebrate reservoir hosts for the West Nile virus. In endemic regions, the virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between culicine mosquitoes and birds. When environmental conditions favor high viral amplification, significant numbers of "bridge vector" mosquitoes (mosquitoes that feed on both birds and mammals) become infected in the late summer and can transmit the virus to humans, horses and other incidental hosts. In some birds, viremia can persist for more than 3 months, possibly contributing to the overwintering of the virus. Migratory birds are thought to be important in introducing WNV into new areas.

The majority of infected horses do not display clinical signs. WNV encephalitis occurs in a small percentage of infected horses, characterised by mild to severe ataxia. Additionally, horses may exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is an inconsistently recognised feature. Treatment is supportive and signs may resolve or progress to terminal recumbency. The mortality rate is approximately 1 in 3 clinically affected unvaccinated horses. Differential diagnoses in horses include other arboviral encephalidites (e.g. eastern, western or Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Japanese encephalitis, equine encephalosis), equine herpesvirus-1, Borna disease, and rabies.

Spain has been reporting the WOAH (previously OIE) on clinical cases of West Nile Fever in horses, in Andalusia, since 2010. Exacerbations were recorded in 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2020. Human cases have been sporadic until the summer of 2020, when 77 cases were reported, 8 fatal. https://doaj.org/article/c6eafa7a89eb408ead66076968286abc

Trapping mosquitoes and testing them for the presence of the virus is the method of choice for early detection of the seasonal influx of WNV. - Mod.AS]

[The first case of WNV-associated disease in humans in Spain was reported in 2004 [Infect Dis. 2007;39:70-93.]. Since then, and despite the endemic circulation of WNV in mosquitos, wildlife, and horses, transmission to humans remained low, with only two additional cases in 2010 [Emerg Infect Dis. 2011;17:2397] and 3 more in 2016 [Euro Surveill. 2021;26:19.].

In 2020 a large outbreak occurred in Spain with 77 cases of WNV disease in humans and 8 deaths, which predominantly affected the villages of Coria del Río and Puebla del Río (Seville). There were also isolated human cases in other villages in the provinces of Seville, Cádiz (both located in Andalusia), and Badajoz (Extremadura), along with reports of WNV circulation in horses from Andalusia, Extremadura, Catalonia, and Valencia.

Additionally, there have been recent reports of the Usutu virus (USUV) detection which highlight the increasing incidence of vector-borne diseases and the need for reinforcing surveillance for early detection of clinical human infections.

Integrated vector, animal, and human surveillance and control of mosquitoes can also help to prevent new WNV (and other flaviviruses) associated outbreaks. - Mod.UBA
