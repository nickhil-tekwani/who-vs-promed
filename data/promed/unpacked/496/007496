An outbreak of legionnaires' disease, which saw 2 deaths and 22 people
infected, has been officially declared over. An 85 year old man and a 49
year old woman of Rhymney, Caerphilly county, both died in cases linked to
the outbreak in the Heads of the Valleys area.

The investigating team has announced its findings ahead of a report. No new
cases of the disease have been identified since the last person fell ill on
10 Sep 2010. Dr Gwen Lowe, of Public Health Wales and chair of the outbreak
control team, said: "We have not seen any new cases of legionnaires'
disease linked to the outbreak area for more than a month and we have
extensively investigated all possible links between the 22 cases linked to
the outbreak area. Both our microbiological and epidemiological
investigations indicate that there are a number of potential sources for
these 22 cases. All plausible sources have been fully investigated and
precautionary action taken and advice given where indicated. This has
involved local authorities from all over south east Wales."

The outbreak control team, comprising Public Health Wales, the Health and
Safety Executive (HSE), and environmental health officers from 8 south
Wales local authorities, will be producing a report on the outbreak. The
outbreak area involved a corridor 12 km (7.5 miles) either side of the
Heads of the Valleys Road (A465) between Abergavenny and Llandarcy. People
were linked to the outbreak if they lived in, or visited, this area in the
2 weeks before they fell ill. All 22 cases required hospital treatment. 10
further people with the disease were investigated to see if they were
linked to the outbreak but were later discounted. 1 of these patients died
-- a 70 year old man and a 64 year old woman.

The HSE has inspected all registered cooling towers and evaporative
condensers in the Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and
Rhymney areas -- 28 in total. 4 industrial sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Rhymney
Valley, and Cynon Valley were closed but none were confirmed as the source.
They are all now back in operation.

HSE and council environmental health officers also visited more than 100
other workplaces. Public Health Wales said their investigations had
identified 2 distinct clusters -- 6 people with legionnaires' linked to a
small geographical area in Rhymney, and 6 people with legionnaires' spread
out across a wider area in the Cynon Valley.

Dr Lowe added: "Growing legionella bacteria is very difficult and has not
been possible in samples from many of the cases. Microbiological results
from the 7 human samples that have been grown show that every one is
genetically distinct, suggesting a different source of infection for each
of these 7 cases. We have not been able to obtain samples for most of the
cases in the 2 main clusters. This strengthens our suspicions that we are
dealing with several different unlinked clusters and cases and is why we
have not identified any outbreak strain of legionella for any cluster. For
the whole outbreak area, plausible sources have been systematically
inspected and where indicated, sampled. Cooling towers from industrial
processes are classically linked to the type of legionella outbreaks where
cases are closely clustered in time and place, as is the case with our 2
main clusters. However, the outbreak control team has considered, sampled,
and ruled out a number of other plausible sources for these clusters."

She added that it had been an extremely complex investigation and a
detailed report of the outbreak would be prepared and published in due course.

[The legionnaires' disease outbreak in South Wales that involved a total of
22 people is said to be over. Of the 22, _Legionella pneumophila_, the
cause of Legionnaires' disease, was grown from clinical specimens in only 7
patients. Genotyping _L. pneumophila_ of patient and environmental isolates
is done to help identify environmental sources giving rise to cases;
however, in this outbreak each clinical isolate was genetically distinct,
which suggests that there was no common source at least for these 7
patients. A full report of the epidemiological investigation is pending.

The news release above says the region involved in the South Wales Valleys
Legionnaires' disease outbreak is 12 km (7.5 miles) either side of the
Heads of the Valleys Road (A465) between the towns of Abergavenny and
Llandarcy (a town near Neath). The Heads of the Valleys Road (the A465) is
a major road in South Wales; it runs along the southern border of the
Brecon Beacons National Park and joins together the north ends (or "heads")
of the South Wales Valleys of Ebbw Vale, Tredegar, Rhymney, and Merthyr
Tydfil (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A465_road>). Maps of this area are
