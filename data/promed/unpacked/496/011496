Beleaguered Iowa and Minnesota reported 3 more avian flu outbreaks between them today, while Ohio and Michigan joined the list of states banning all bird shows and sales in an effort to squelch the virus. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today issued recommendations for responding to any human infections with the novel avian flu viruses. No such cases have been reported so far.

Iowa officials reported 2 probable avian flu outbreaks, with initial tests showing an H5 virus on a Clay County farm with an estimated 1.1 million pullets and a Hamilton County farm with an estimated 18 000 turkeys. Confirmatory test results from the US Department of Agriculture are awaited, said the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS). The agency said the outbreaks are the 2nd in each county. Yesterday, however, the agency listed another Hamilton County turkey outbreak as that county's 2nd.

Iowa has had 71 outbreaks (62 confirmed) in 17 counties, affecting about 28 million chickens and 1.2 million turkeys, according to IDALS data.

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (MDPS) today announced yet another turkey-farm outbreak in the state's hardest-hit county, Kandiyohi, raising the number of affected farms there to 39. The agency said an estimate of the size of the affected flock is pending. With the new outbreak, Minnesota's count of stricken farms increased to 104 in 23 counties, the DPS said. Birds on 96 of the farms have been euthanized, and carcass disposal is complete on 52 of them, the agency reported.

In other news, Ohio and Michigan -- neither of which has reported any avian flu outbreaks so far in 2015 -- both announced a ban on all bird shows and sales as part of their effort to keep avian flu out. In what it called an "aggressive move" to protect Ohio's USD 2.3 billion poultry industry, the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) today announced the cancellation of all live-bird exhibitions. The ban covers the Ohio State Fair, county fairs, and all other gatherings of birds for show or sale, including swap meets, the agency said. Ohio is the 2nd-largest egg producer in the country, with 28 million laying chickens, 12 million broilers, 8.5 million pullets, and 2 million turkeys, the ODA said. The state's egg, chicken, and turkey farms employ more than 14 600 workers.

Michigan announced a similarly broad ban yesterday. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the ban includes, but is not limited to, "shows, exhibitions, swap meets, petting zoos at fairs, game bird and waterfowl fair displays, and Miracle of Life exhibits. "While there are currently no known cases of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] in Michigan, commitment to protecting the health of all of the state's poultry flocks -- backyard and commercial farmers -- led us to making this difficult decision," said state veterinarian James Averill, in announcing the ban.

Ohio and Michigan joined several other states that have already banned bird shows as a precaution. Minnesota took action on 15 May 2015, Iowa on 21 May 2015, and Indiana on 27 May 2015.

CDC issued its recommendations for human health investigations and responses associated with avian flu outbreaks in the form of a Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory this afternoon. The guidance refers to the H5N2, H5N8, and H5N1 (not the Eurasian H5N1) viruses that have emerged in North America within the past several months. The vast majority of outbreaks have involved H5N2. "While these recently identified HPAI H5 viruses are not known to have caused disease in humans, their appearance in North American birds may increase the likelihood of human infection in the United States," the agency said. "CDC considers the risk to the general public from these newly identified US HPAI H5 viruses to be low; however, people with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments may be at greater risk of infection," it added. The agency advises that clinicians should consider the possibility of HPAI H5 virus infection in persons who have a respiratory illness and a relevant exposure history, including those who have had contact with potentially infected birds.

The statement adds that:
- state health departments should investigate potential human H5 virus infections and notify the agency within 24 hours when doing so;
- people should avoid contact with sick or dead birds, bird feces, and other potentially contaminated materials;
- people exposed to potentially infected birds should be monitored for 10 days.

The statement also includes recommendations for surveillance, testing, worker protection, infection control, and antiviral treatment.

[It should be noted that the avian influenza H5N2 has not been shown to infect humans. However, vigilance is recommended.

Likewise, it seems appropriate that other states are being proactive and cancelling bird shows. While that is hard for the exhibitor, it is likely the right thing to help curtail this virus and protect the states' poultry industry. - Mod.TG
