Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 5 / 2 / 40 / 5
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals, legal movement of animals, illegal movement of animals, animals in transit.
Epidemiological comments: cattle herds from Senegal in transhumance in Mauritania. A yearly vaccination is carried out in cattle throughout the country. An improvement in coverage against CBPP [contagious bovine pleuropneumonia] has been clearly observed from 600 000 heads/year in average to 1.4 million heads in average in 2010. In 2015, the number of animals vaccinated against CBPP has reached 1.86 million heads. The disease is classified as a priority disease under the Animal Disease Surveillance Network (REMEMA). 4 teams are currently on site in order to implement the control measures. These are cattle herds from Senegal in transhumance in Mauritania that have never been vaccinated against CBPP.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); disinfection/disinfestation; traceability; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: modified stamping out.

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is one of the diseases for which the OIE grants official recognition status (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/cbpp/).

In January 2014, Mauritania reported 2 outbreaks of CBPP in Kaedi (Gorgol region); see ProMED-mail post 20140202.2249097. The event was resolved in March 2014. Vaccination against the disease was implemented in response to the outbreak; however, no information on the type of vaccine and number of doses used was provided. See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019079_20151113_170344.pdf

The epidemiological comments section of the report mentions that "In 2015, the number of animals vaccinated against CBPP has reached 1.86 million heads. The disease is classified as a priority disease under the Animal Disease Surveillance Network (REMEMA)."

As noted in the report, the source of infection was the introduction of new live animals, legal and illegal movement of animals, and animals in transit from Senegal. From September 2014 to date, Senegal has reported 3 outbreaks of CBPP in the Kolda, Matam, and Saint Louis provinces. The last follow-up report was submitted on 25 Oct 2015. See report and map at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000018943_20151023_173235.pdf.

Humans are not known to be susceptible to CBPP, so there is no public health risk (http://tinyurl.com/km6t6w7).
