Outbreak of Leishmaniasis in Yemen
--------------------------------------
In the wake of an outbreak of a dangerous skin disease, the World Health
Organization has warned against travelling to 4 areas in Yemen. "With the
outbreak of cutaneous Leishmaniasis, which causes long-term scarring of the
skin, the World Health Organization [WHO] has imposed temporary
restrictions on all types of travel to 4 districts. These are Tarim,
Shibam, Qatam and Sayyun.
"No security clearance will be granted for the areas until WHO says the
situation has improved," a Sana'a-based UN official told Gulf News yesterday.
Leishmaniasis occurs in tropical and subtropical African, American and
Indian regions. The insect that spreads the disease is the sand fly.

[Yemen is endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and visceral
leishmanisis probably also occurs. CL in Yemen is caused by _L. tropica_
and is a zoonotic infection with small rodents as its reservoir. CL is
transmitted to man by the sandfly -- _Phlebotomus_. The present posting
does not indicate any reason for the present outbreak, whether it could be
a breakdown in vector control or a change in human/rodent contact. Further
information would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
