New case of BSE detected
------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) today announced that Canada's
national surveillance program has detected bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) in an Alberta beef cow just under 7 years of age. As part of its
surveillance program, the CFIA has control of the carcass. No part of the
animal has entered the human food or animal feed systems.
Public health remains protected through the removal of specified risk
material (SRM) from all animals slaughtered for human food. SRM are tissues
that, in infected animals, contain the BSE agent. This measure is
internationally recognized as the most effective public health measure
against BSE.
The CFIA is investigating what the animal may have been fed early in its
life and the source of the feed. The infected animal was born in March
1998, and the farm of origin has been confirmed. Based on preliminary
information, feed produced prior to the introduction of the 1997 feed ban
in Canada remains the most likely source of infection in this animal.
The infected animal was detected through the recently enhanced national
surveillance program. Additional cases may be found as testing of high-risk
cattle continues. In 2004, the Government of Canada tested over 22 000 animals.
Canada's science-based BSE safeguards to protect public and animal health
have been designed with the understanding that BSE is potentially present
in a small and declining number of animals. This includes animals born
before and shortly after the 1997 feed ban. The Government of Canada
continues to believe that the ruminant to ruminant feed ban introduced in
1997 has limited the spread of BSE and remains effective.
Initial testing on the animal was conducted by Alberta authorities. Results
were inconclusive and samples were then sent to the Canadian Science Centre
for Human and Animal Health in Winnipeg. The definitive diagnosis was made
today using the internationally recognized "gold standard" test for BSE.
Since the surveillance program was enhanced in January 2004, Canada has
tested more than 24 000 high-risk cattle. This targeted approach has
detected an additional 2 BSE positive cattle. These findings demonstrate
the shared commitment of cattle producers, industry and governments to
responsibly search for any remaining cases of BSE.
This current investigation is independent of the BSE investigation on the
case which was confirmed on 2 Jan 2005.
