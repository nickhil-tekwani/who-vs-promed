Cold empties Bolivian rivers of fish. Antarctic cold snap kills
millions of aquatic animals in the Amazon.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
With high Andean peaks and a humid tropical forest, Bolivia is a
country of ecological extremes. But during the Southern Hemisphere's
recent winter, unusually low temperatures in part of the country's
tropical region hit freshwater species hard, killing an estimated 6
million fish and thousands of alligators, turtles, and river
dolphins. Bolivia has a wealth of freshwater species, including the
Arrau turtle (_Podocnemis expansa_).

Scientists who have visited the affected rivers say the event is the
biggest ecological disaster Bolivia has known, and, as an example of
a sudden climatic change wreaking havoc on wildlife, it is
unprecedented in recorded history.

"There's just a huge number of dead fish," says Michel Jegu, a
researcher from the Institute for Developmental Research in
Marseilles, France, who is currently working at the Noel Kempff
Mercado Natural History Museum in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. "In the rivers
near Santa Cruz there's about 1000 dead fish for every 100 metres
[330 ft] of river."

With such extreme climatic events potentially becoming more common
due to climate change, scientists are hurrying to coordinate research
into the impact, and how quickly the ecosystem is likely to recover.

The extraordinary quantity of decomposing fish flesh has polluted the
waters of the Grande, Pirai, and Ichilo rivers [Santa Cruz
Department] to the extent that local authorities have had to provide
alternative sources of drinking water for towns along the rivers'
banks. Many fishermen have lost their main source of income, having
been banned from removing any more fish from populations that will
probably struggle to recover.

The blame lies, at least indirectly, with a mass of Antarctic air
that settled over the Southern Cone of South America for most of July
[2010]. The prolonged cold snap has also been linked to the deaths of
at least 550 penguins along the coasts of Brazil and thousands of
cattle in Paraguay and Brazil.

Water temperatures in Bolivian rivers that normally register about 15
deg C [59 deg F] during the day fell to as low as 4 deg C [39 deg F].

Hugo Mamani, head of forecasting at Senamhi, Bolivia's national
weather centre, confirms that the air temperature in the city of
Santa Cruz fell to 4 deg C [39 deg F] this July [2010], a low beaten
only by a record of 2.5 deg C [36.5 deg F] in 1955.

Dearth of surveys
-----------------
But exactly how the cold temperatures caused such devastation remains
a mystery. So far, there have been no rigorous surveys of the
ecological damage, only anecdotal observations.

Fons Smolders, a fisheries scientist at Radboud University in
Nijmegen, the Netherlands, is one expert who has visited the area and
is keen for the phenomenon to receive proper study because such freak
climatic events may become more common in the future.

Often, when cold weather causes fish deaths in lakes, the mortalities
are directly due to hypoxia, when oxygen levels are too low to supply
the animals' cells and tissues. This is because the colder surface
temperatures can reduce mixing in the water column.

Because the deaths occurred mainly in rivers, Smolders suspects that
they are linked to infection. "Some of the fish that I saw had white
spots that may indicate disease. The cold probably made them very
susceptible to all kinds of infections," he explains.

"When fish die, it's usually not a single stressor, but multiple
stressors interacting," agrees Steven Cooke, an aquatic ecologist at
Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who last year [2009] wrote a
review of cold shock in fish (1). "So, if cold shock or cooler
temperatures are being implicated in mortality, there's probably
something else going on as well."

Most of the research in the field of cold shock in fish has been
carried out on rivers in temperate climates, rather than tropical
ones. For example, fish in temperate rivers often die when a power
station pumping warm water into a river suddenly shuts down.

Jegu has another hypothesis. He thinks that the burning of farmland
around Santa Cruz, a regular part of the farming cycle locally, has
occurred at particularly high levels this year [2010]. That might
have been a contributing factor in the fish deaths, possibly because
the smoke added to river pollution.

"We hope to secure financing for these studies to find out why the
fish are dying," he says. With luck, and money, these will start in
October [2010].

[The only thing odd about this article is the cattle. While cattle
accustomed to warm temperatures can suffer shock of a sudden cold
front and freeze to death at temperatures that seem to not be that
cold, but for the unprepared animal are. However, this is the 1st
report received regarding cattle in either of these regions and our
network of reports would likely have seen news reports or there would
have warnings to feed the animals or a disease investigation
occurring. So we have to wonder if the issue of cattle is a bit
overblown. The amphibians and reptiles may well be suffering and
dying as prolonged temperatures and sudden cold temperatures are not
always the kindest to these creatures. - Mod.TG]
