The City of Broomfield reported its 1st case of the plague for the season on Friday [17 Mar 2017].

Broomfield Public Health and Environment officials reported that the plague activity was related to a prairie dog die off near the Great Western Reservoir Open Space.

The open space and homes in the surrounding area have been alerted, and signs listing ways to prevent infection have been posted in the community.

"Plague is commonly transmitted from infected fleas, and the public should take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure," said Broomfield public health director Jason Vahling. "It is important to avoid touching any sick or dead animals and to take safety measures to protect your family and pets."

Plague is easily treated in humans with antibiotics if recognized early. If infected, people will show a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, extreme fatigue, and painful swollen nodes, according to officials.

Health officials recommend the following measures to avoid becoming infected with the plague:
- Avoid contact with any sick or dead wild animals.
- Use insect repellant that contains DEET to prevent flea bites.
- Tuck pant cuffs into socks to prevent flea bites.
- Protect your pets by using preventive flea treatments.
- Keep your dogs under direct supervision and on a leash when outside.
- Contact your veterinarian if your pet becomes ill.
- Prevent rodent infestations around your house by clearing away debris and trash.
- Seek medical attention if you become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.

You are asked to report any unusual wild animal activity to Broomfield Animal Services at (303) 438-6400.

[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.

The organism _Yersinia pestis_, causes plague. Primarily in the western portion of the United States, plague is enzootic among rodents. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Cats, more than other animals, are prone the respiratory form of the disease and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities. - Mod.TG
