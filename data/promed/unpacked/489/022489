Health officials in Guyana have reported a leptospirosis outbreak among Guyana Manganese Inc. (GMI) workers on [Fri 5 Apr 2019].

According to authorities, 2 Chinese nationals have been treated and released, while another mining employee, who was also tested positive for leptospirosis, is in "critical but stable condition".

One individual died from complications associated with leptospirosis on [Wed 3 Apr 2019] night while undergoing treatment at the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation (GPHC).

Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr. Shamdeo Persaud said that "all precautionary measures are still in place at the Matthews Ridge tunnel site and immediate surroundings and essential medical supplies are in stock to treat employees of the mining firm and residents of the area.

Since last week's outbreak, the area has been deemed a 'Red Zone' by Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) authorities and "no one is allowed to enter the site," Dr. Persaud reminded on [Thu 4 Apr 2019].

Region One (Barima-Waini) health officials remain tight-lipped on the situation relating to the condition of the miners who are being assessed at Matthews Ridge, even as another Chinese miner fell ill and is being treated for a respiratory tract infection at the Pakera Hospital, in Matthews Ridge.

An official from the Manganese Company Inc told Guyana Times on [Fri 5 Apr 2019] that another miner was admitted to the hospital, however, the official could not allude to the severity of the miner's condition or whether he will be transferred to the city.

The Public Health Ministry in a statement said the miner's condition was "critical" but "stable." While the operations at that manganese company's worksite remain at a standstill, other operations of the company are progressing.

However, residents of Matthews Ridge have expressed concerns over the health risks involved and are furious that health officials are not disclosing information as to the seriousness of the situation. "Every time I see them nurse and ask about it, they keep telling me we can't talk we ain't want get in trouble," one resident told this newspaper on [Fri 5 Apr 2019]. Several residents who reached out to this newspaper on [Fri 5 Apr 2019] said that it is time the health authorities speak to people living in the area since they are very worried about the situation. Efforts to obtain a comment from the regional health authorities by Guyana Times proved futile.

This newspaper was told that the Matthews Ridge to Port Kaituma road has been closed to vehicles attached to the Manganese Company; however, the official from the company has denied this development. Regional officials however could not offer a confirmation on this new development on [Fri 5 Apr 2019].

Another Chinese miner died on [Wed 3 Apr 2019] at the Georgetown Public Hospital (GPHC), while several others who were brought out from the mining camp remain patients. Chief Medical Officer of the GPHC, Dr. Shamdeo Persaud, when contacted by this newspaper on [Fri 5 Apr 2019] said tests are still being conducted even as they await results from the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) about a possible diagnosis for the patients who did not test positive for leptospirosis. "When the results come back, whatever they are, we will disclose," he said. He could not say when the results will return.

On [Thu 4 Apr 2019], when Guyana Times visited the surgical bloc, it was observed that the miners were being kept in an isolated area that was cordoned off. A doctor was at the time administering checks on the patients; however, he was not allowed to offer any updates on the miners' condition.

Meanwhile, the Ministry's statement on [Thu 4 Apr 2019] confirmed the miners died from complications associated with leptospirosis while undergoing treatment at the GPHC. It also said 2 of those patients have since been discharged after successful treatment.

Dr. Shamdeo Persaud has iterated that all precautionary measures are still in place at the Matthews Ridge tunnel site and its immediate surroundings, adding that essential medical supplies are in stock to treat employees of the mining firm and residents of the area. Since last week's outbreak, the area has been deemed a 'Red Zone' by Public Health Ministry authorities, and "no one is allowed to enter the site," Dr. Persaud reminded on [Thu 4 Apr 2019].

The CMO has also stated that the hospital is continuing its evaluation of the miners, and additional tests are being done by CARPHA to obtain a diagnosis for some of the patients who were not tested positive for leptospirosis.

Reports are that post-mortem examinations conducted on the 2 miners - both 47-years old - on [Thu 4 Apr 2019] morning revealed that they died from haemorrhagic pneumonia as a result of leptospirosis. The more than one dozen affected miners exhibited symptoms of pain, fever, headache and respiratory distress.

Meanwhile, on [Thu 4 Apr 2019] afternoon, when approached by the media for a comment on the diagnosis of the other ill Chinese workers, subject Minister Volda Lawrence refused to comment on the issue.

The manganese mining company has been instructed to halt further exploration until the Public Health Ministry and a team from the Occupational Health and Safety Department of the Social Protection Ministry advice further on the matter.

[We were told in the initial ProMED-mail post (Undiagnosed resp. illness - Guyana: (Barima-Waini) manganese mine, fatal, RFI 20190401.6396933) that 8 individuals working at a manganese mining company in Guyana, owned by a subsidiary of Chinese company Bosai Minerals Group Guyana Company Limited, developed what was said to be an influenza-like illness with "respiratory discomfort, rash, and high-grade fever." One of the individuals died.

We are now told in the news reports above that there is 1 additional case with now a total of "more than one dozen affected miners [who] exhibited symptoms of pain, fever, headache and respiratory distress" and 1 additional death (presumably now a total of 2 deaths). Post-mortem examinations on the 2 dead miners "revealed that they died from haemorrhagic pneumonia as a result of leptospirosis."

It is difficult to ascertain the exact number who tested positive for leptospirosis: initially we were told of 2 patients who tested positive for leptospirosis, perhaps the 2 miners who died, without specifying what tests were done to make that determination, and the news report [1] above adds 1 additional patient who tested positive for leptospirosis. Additional tests are said to be done on those who did not test positive for leptospirosis.

Initially we were told that all infected persons were exposed to one common area, without evidence of person-to-person transmission (that is, presumably there are no secondary cases), but we were not told what that common area was. We are now told the common area is the "Matthews Ridge tunnel site."

Manganese mines are usually open pits (https://demerarawaves.com/2017/01/27/manganese-mining-in-north-west-district-to-create-hundreds-of-jobs-improved-infrastructure/), which are subject to flooding that could lead to exposure to leptospirosis if there is also rat infestation. However, tunnels could be infested with bats and their guano, which would place mine workers at risk for histoplasmosis, a fungal pulmonary infection that follows unprotected inhalation of large inocula of _Histoplasma capsulatum_ spores. The fungus lives in soil fertilized by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can remain potentially infectious for years. Microconidia spores become airborne when the contaminated soil is disturbed, for example, by digging in contaminated soil. Most infected individuals remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic illness is primarily caused by an intense exposure and the severity of disease is related to the number of spores inhaled.

ProMED-mail previously reported on a histoplasmosis outbreak in tunnel workers in the Dominican Republic (see See Also's below).

Symptoms of histoplasmosis usually include non-specific flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, muscle aches, dry cough, and chest discomfort); potentially fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur when larger inocula are inhaled (http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1047573 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7244706?dopt=Abstract). The pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease.

Histoplasmosis cannot be transmitted from person to person or from animals to people. The diagnosis can be made by culture of the organism from sputum or tissues, by serology, or by tests for antigen in urine and serum specimens. For treatment guidelines, see Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Histoplasmosis: 2007 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
