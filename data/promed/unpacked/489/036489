The unnatural death of an elephant, suspected of anthrax, at the
Periyar Tiger Reserve a couple of days ago has raised fears of an
epidemic outbreak. With Forest Veterinary officials suspecting
symptoms of anthrax in the animal, samples have been sent for detailed
tests. A final confirmation will be made only after the results of the
tests are out.

It was last week [week of 19 Sep 2011] that a female elephant was
found dead at Vallakkadavu range, opposite to Nellikkampetti in the
Thekkady range. The forest officials reached the spot and carried out
a detailed examination. Since anthrax was suspected, its body was
burnt without carrying out a postmortem examination.

"Samples were sent to the laboratory at Palode. In a couple of days
the results will be out. Since the elephant is suspected to have died
of anthrax, the body was not cut open," said veterinary officials.

Forest officials said that generally the anthrax [bacteria] will be
alive for over 30 years. "Even if it is anthrax, the [bacteria] must
have been alive in the soil for such a long time. We don't think there
is the possibility of an epidemic outbreak in the wake of this
incident," said officials.

[Anthrax in wild elephants in India has been known for many decades.
Fortunately it is infrequent. While elephants can graze they are
primarily browsers which means that elephant cases are usually
secondary to cases in other wildlife or livestock with the infection
transmitted by biting flies; one of the notable characteristics of
this disease in elephants is that the affected beasts can be at a
significant distance from each other. The Periyar authorities will
have to be on the alert for any elephants showing signs of a raised
temperature. The park officials are to be congratulated on burning
this affected animal. That is no mean feat.

Big cats, such as tigers, are susceptible to this disease and thus
tigers will be at risk if they have killed and eaten a sick prey
animal.
