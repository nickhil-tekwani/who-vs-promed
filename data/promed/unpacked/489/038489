2002/143 2001 surveys on _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_
and _Ralstonia solanacearum_ in Germany
The NPPO of Germany recently provided the following information about
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] and _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ [Rs] (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests) based on the results of
the 2001 surveys.
Cms: A survey for potato ring rot was carried out during the 2001
production period, on the basis of EU Council Directive 93/85/EEC. 16 985
samples were tested in the laboratory for ring rot. Samples were taken from
seed potatoes (11 321 samples), ware [table] potatoes (4578 samples), gene
banks, breeding material, and potatoes in trade.
Thorough analyses were carried out to trace back the origin and
relationship of infections: 11 seed potato samples were found to be ring
rot-infected as were 27 samples of ware potatoes. As in previous years,
control measures according to EU Council Directive 93/85/EEC were taken.
The ring rot situation in Germany has significantly improved in 2001 in all
respects (affected number of Federal States, places of production, lots and
cases) in comparison to previous years. This may be attributed to the
systematic application of eradication measures and better information.
The NPPO of Germany declares the pest status of Cms as: Present in some
areas at low prevalence, under eradication.
Rs: A survey on potato brown rot was carried out during the 2001 production
period, on the basis of EU Council Directive 98/57/EC. 16 859 samples were
tested for brown rot including seed potatoes (11 144 samples), ware
potatoes (4629 samples), and those from gene banks, breeding material and
potatoes in trade.
In 4 Federal States, 51 samples of _Solanum dulcamara_ and water from
rivers were tested for brown rot. No seed potatoes were infected by Rs but
infection was found in 4 samples of ware potatoes. In 3 samples,
trace-backs to the origin of infection were unsuccessful and in 1 case, the
source of infection was probably contaminated surface water used for
irrigation.
The NPPO of Germany declares the pest status of Rs as: Transient, single
cases; under eradication.

[Diseases caused by both of these pathogens are of major concern to
producers because infected tubers rot. Rs is distributed widely in warm,
temperate regions of the world. Cms occurs worldwide, especially in cool
climates. _S. dulcamara_ (nightshade) is a reservoir host and is often
found along ditches and streams. The bacterium is released from roots of
infected plants and then enters waterways, contaminating fields and
spreading the disease. Disease management relies on use of disease-free
seed, strict phytosanitary procedures, and disposal of potato waste,
especially from potato processing plants, preferably by incineration.
The report of improved ringrot disease management in Germany is welcome
news. Kudos to all concerned for their continuing efforts in bringing this
disease under control.
