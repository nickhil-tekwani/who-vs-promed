Austria finds H5N1 in chickens, ducks at sanctuary
--------------------------------------------------
Austrian authorities have found the H5N1 bird flu virus in 2 chickens
and 3 ducks in an animal sanctuary in the southern city of Graz, the
regional agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [22 Feb 2006].
While Austria's health ministry said the birds were not part of any
commercial stock, the birds are the 1st case of domestic poultry
carrying the H5N1 virus in the European Union, rather than in wild
birds such as swans.
The birds had been kept in the same cage as a swan brought to the
sanctuary from the area previously hit by the virus, violating
regulations imposed after the 1st occurrence of the virus in Austria,
a health ministry spokeswoman said.
The swan had died in the animal sanctuary "Noah's Ark" last week,
prompting the slaughter and testing of all 30 birds that had been
kept in the sanctuary.

[It would have been surprising if the domestic birds had not been infected
when kept together with a (clinically affected?) swan. Austria's official
notification mentioned dead, not sick swans (see article [1] in posting
20060220.0550).
Graz is situated in southeast Austria, facing the Slovenian and Hungarian
frontiers; both countries have already discovered their infected swans.

Germany today reported 22 new cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu. Till Backhaus, a German agriculture minister, said that he believed
that there was now a growing risk of H5N1 spreading to the country's
poultry farms.
The disease -- previously confined to the Baltic island of Ruegen --
has now been confirmed on the German mainland. A state of emergency
was declared in 2 districts of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to allow
the army to be deployed for disease control measures.
"We do not have this in hand," Herr Backhaus told the AFP news agency.
When the EU veterinary experts last met, on 12 Dec 2005, H5N1 had yet
to reach the Continent. Cases have since been confirmed within the EU
in Austria, Germany, Greece, [Hungary], Italy, Slovenia and France,
although all so far have been confined to migratory wild birds rather
than domestic poultry flocks.
Meanwhile, Slovakia became the 8th EU country to report bird flu
after finding the H5 strain in a wild hawk [species not specified]
and a smew, a type of duck [a small Old World merganser (_Mergus
albellus_), picture at
<http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~bird/bird/photo/jpeg/mikoaisa.jpg>],
near its borders with Austria and Hungary. The dead birds have been
sent to the EU's special laboratory at Weybridge in Surrey for
further analysis to see whether it is H5N1.
[The CRL's website, updated on 21 Feb 2006, does not indicate the receipt of a
sample from Slovakia; see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla/science/science-viral-ai-update.htm>.]
The Slovak authorities have set up a 3km exclusion zone and a 10km
surveillance zone around each of the sites, in accordance with EU
policy.
France, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg and
Sweden have already ordered farmers to bring their domestic poultry
indoors as a preventive measure to halt the spread of the disease.
In Britain, the Department for the Environment, Fisheries and Rural
Affairs (Defra) has said that bringing poultry indoors -- a move
which would stop farmers being able to sell the fowl as free-range
birds -- was not necessary until an outbreak was confirmed in the UK.
EU veterinary officials were today [21 Feb 2006] debating plans put
forward by France and the Netherlands to allow poultry to be given a
general flu vaccine. They need EU approval because of the trade
implications of vaccinating commercial poultry, as vaccination in
itself involves dosing birds with viral matter.
Some EU governments, including Britain, oppose vaccination because it could
mean the whole of Europe loses its "disease-free" status. They gave warning
that no vaccine is yet available directly to tackle the H5N1 strain and that
the more general vaccination holds no guarantees of curing the disease or
preventing its spread. "There is no bird flu in poultry in Britain, or in
poultry anywhere in the EU," said a British Government spokesman [he's already
out of date, see [1] Austria above - Mod.JW]. "But we are keeping vaccination
under urgent review, and we remain to be convinced that it is the right
solution."
A meeting of farm ministers in Brussels yesterday [20 Feb 2006] also
heard warnings that vaccination would be costly and logistically
difficult, since birds must be inoculated twice in a 3-week period.
A European Commission official confirmed there was no guarantee
vaccination would work and that the export status of a country which
had vaccinated its poultry would be in doubt.
He agreed that there was a gray area about the export status of a country
whose commercial poultry stock had been vaccinated, because, as in the case of
mad cow disease [sic; should read "Foot and mouth disease" -- there is no
vaccine for BSE], vaccination to counter the threat automatically costs a
country its official status as free of the disease.
"The vaccination request will be considered by the Standing Committee
on the Food Chain and Animal Health (today [21 Feb 2006]). But there
would always be a risk of the H5N1 strain of the virus going
undetected if it did enter a vaccinated poultry population," said the
Commission spokesman.
"In addition, the only vaccines available are those that can be
administered by injection, and certain categories of poultry might
need as many as 3 injections."
The meeting of veterinary officials is due to end at 5:30 p.m., and
conclusions will be published after that [see item 2].
Elsewhere in the world, health workers in western India today [21 Feb
2006] expanded a massive slaughter of chickens to contain reported
outbreaks of the H5N1 virus, while Malaysia began killing birds after
reporting its 1st case of the disease in more than a year.
Indonesia, meanwhile, was preparing to test thousands of chickens in
the capital, Jakarta, and Hong Kong's government said a dead magpie
found near an urban flower market was infected with the deadly strain.
5 regions of Nigeria are battling H5N1 in domestic poultry, and although the
country has yet to register its 1st human case of the disease, the World
Health Organization warned today [21 Feb 2006] that it could still easily
infect people. "There's really no time frame, because as long as the virus is
circulating, it could jump into humans," said Dick Thompson, a spokesman for
the UN health agency on infectious diseases.

Avian Influenza: France and Netherlands present vaccination plans for poultry
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
French and Dutch plans to carry out targeted preventive vaccination
campaigns on certain poultry as a precautionary measure against
highly pathogenic avian influenza have been presented to Member
States in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH) today [21 Feb 2006]. The presentations were followed by
positive discussions in the Committee on the technical and scientific
details of the plans, as these are the 1st such vaccination programs
against the H5N1 virus to be proposed in the EU. On the basis of
today's discussions, the Commission will now consider proposals to
approve the plans and to lay down specific conditions that must be
met in applying them. The discussions will continue in the Committee
tomorrow morning [22 Feb 2006].
The Dutch plan entails vaccinating hobby poultry and free-range
laying hens throughout the whole country. The vaccination will be
provided on a voluntary basis, as an alternative to the requirement
that these birds be kept indoors.
The French plan foresees the vaccination of ducks and geese in the
departments of Landes, Loire-Atlantique and Vendee, which are
considered to be areas at high risk of avian influenza. The intention
is to begin vaccination immediately and continue until 1 Apr 2006,
during which time around 900 000 birds are expected to be immunized.
Both Member States outlined the monitoring and control measures that
would be followed with regard to the vaccinated birds. These include
the use of sentinel birds (i.e. unvaccinated control birds) to
monitor for an avian influenza outbreak in the vaccinated flock,
regular testing of the vaccinated and sentinel birds, and the
continued application of bio-security provisions already in place.

Bird Flu Update: The quick, silent killer
-----------------------------------------
When his flock of 70 chickens started dying suddenly over a 10-day
period, retired soldier Sharip Ibrahim was mystified. Now he knows
they had been infected by the H5N1 virus.
Sharip, 66, who rears chickens to sell eggs at his home in Kampung
Pasir Wardieburn, Setapak, said today [22 Feb 2006]: "One day last
week, I went out in the morning, and when I returned home in the
afternoon I noticed some of the chickens were dead."
More chickens died over the following 2 days, and by this morning,
his entire flock of 70 chickens was gone.
"I buried the chickens at the back of my house. In the 40 years I
have been rearing chickens, nothing of this sort has ever happened,"
he said at his house. Sharip said he did not report the deaths to the
authorities, as he was not aware of the bird flu contagion. "It was
only when I saw the authorities going door-to-door collecting
chickens last night that I realized what had happened," he said.
Another villager, who wanted to be known only as Hashim, said his
flock of 12 chickens died within 2 days, a week after Chinese New
Year. "After I returned from my hometown after Chinese New Year, I
found my chickens dead in the coop," he said. Hashim, 69, said his
neighbor told him the chickens had died over 2 days.
Kampung Pasir Wardieburn village chief Mohammad Rizal said health
officials arrived at the village at 4 p.m. yesterday [21 Feb 2006] to
conduct a survey. "They went around asking people if they kept
chickens and if any of the birds had recently died suddenly," he
said. Mohammad said more officials descended on the village last
night to round up all the chickens in the village.
Officials and staff of the Veterinary Services Department, Kuala
Lumpur City Hall health department and Health Ministry culled 495
chickens, ducks and birds in a 5-hour operation that ended at 4 a.m.
today [22 Feb 2006].
The affected areas -- Taman Danau Kota, Pekan Danau Kota and Kampung
Belakang JPJ -- lie within a 1.5-km radius of the source of the
outbreak in Kampung Pasir Wardieburn, off Jalan Genting-Klang.
A check by the New Straits Times today [22 Feb 2006], however, found
several chickens roaming in Kampung Belakang JPJ and a squatter
village in Taman Danau Kota.
Several residents said the chickens were likely those that had
escaped the cull.
Abdul Salam Al Sahad, 65, of Taman Danau Kota said nobody was keeping
any chickens now. "I kept 10 pet birds which I had to surrender to
the health officials yesterday [21 Feb 2006]," he said.

Bird flu virus advances in Nigeria
----------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to spread in poultry
in Nigeria and could cause a regional disaster despite strong control
efforts taken by the Nigerian authorities, FAO said today [22 Feb
2006].
"There is ample evidence that the Nigerian bird flu situation is
difficult and worrisome," said Joseph Domenech, FAO's Chief
Veterinary Officer.
"The movement and trade of poultry have strongly contributed to the
further spread of the virus. The government has taken the right
measures, such as culling in outbreak areas and biosecurity controls,
but the authorities are facing immense difficulties to enforce
controls," Domenech said.
"Considering the possible widespread entrenchment of the disease in
poultry, FAO is advising the government to prepare for a targeted
vaccination campaign. Culling and the application of biosecurity
measures alone may not stop the spread of the virus," he added.
Vaccination campaigns will require the mobilization of several
thousand private and public Nigerian veterinarians and will need a
strong commitment from the national and regional authorities and the
support of the international donor community.
Such campaigns would require funds for vaccines, cars, vaccination
teams, training etc. Surveillance teams should be able to carefully
monitor the situation and intervene immediately when an outbreak
occurs.
"The close coordination of control activities and the need for a
central chain of command at the level of the federal Chief Veterinary
Officer and between the regional states are crucial," Domenech said.
FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in
collaboration with the Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources of
the African Union are assisting the government in assessing the
situation and defining the appropriate strategies to stop the spread
of the disease.
This includes building up strategic stocks of vaccines, syringes and
protective gear for people involved in control operations. In
addition, equipment such as generators for electricity supply,
computers and laboratory equipment are urgently needed. The country
has already established an avian influenza crisis center for the
rapid collection and dissemination of information.
"Compensating farmers for the loss of their animals is another
important tool to encourage early reporting of outbreaks and for
effective application of control measures. Without financial
incentives, people will probably continue to hide outbreaks and sell
infected poultry," Domenech said.
FAO reiterated that people should avoid any contact with obviously
diseased or dead birds, maintain personal hygiene (hand washing)
after handling poultry or poultry meat and should cook chicken meat
and eggs at or above 70 C throughout the product, so that absolutely
no meat remains raw and red. In outbreak areas, chicken and eggs
should not be eaten.
Massive communication campaigns are needed to support control efforts
in poultry and reduce the potential exposure of people to infected
poultry. FAO commended UNICEF for having initiated a communication
campaign.
FAO has allocated around USD one million to support surveillance and
control activities in Nigeria, Niger, Algeria, Mauritania, Egypt,
Tunisia, Chad, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Guinea
Bissau, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mali
and Cameroon. This will allow recruiting local consultants and
procuring items for surveillance and training. Personal protective
equipment has been procured for Nigeria and Niger.
Nigeria's poultry population is estimated at 140 million. Backyard
farmers account for 60 percent of all poultry producers, commercial
farmers for 25 percent and semi-commercial farmers for 15 percent.
One dose of chicken vaccine costs between USD 0.05 - 0.20.
