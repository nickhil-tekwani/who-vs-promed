A 2nd case of bubonic plague originating near Salida, Colorado was confirmed by the CDC late last week [week ending 6 Sep 2015]. The woman, a resident of Marquette, Michigan, contracted plague while visiting family in Salida during the Gentlemen of the Road Music Festival weekend, 22-23 Aug 2015.

After the music festival, she flew back to Michigan that Tuesday, 25 Aug 2015, and the next morning she awoke with a high fever, said her father. She spent 2 days with a 103-degree fever and then went to the hospital. While she was in the hospital, she displayed textbook plague symptoms, her father said. The CDC soon came for exhaustive questioning. The patient said her fever kept spiking until the doctors administered the antimicrobials recommended by the CDC.

The CDC confirmed plague in a biopsy of one of Plescher's lymph nodes late last week at the Michigan hospital.

There were a few days' lag in word getting back to Chaffee County [Colorado] Public Health because the diagnosis was from an out-of-state hospital, said Andrea Carlstrom, county health director.

The patient has been released from the hospital, but her recovery is slow. She said her fever has subsided and much of her swelling has gone down, but her lymph nodes are still "huge" and she still can't walk or even sit up. While in the area she hiked a portion of the Little Rainbow trail around CR 108. This is the 2nd case of plague contracted by a person, likely while hiking in the Methodist Mountain Trail System. "There seems to be a clear common denominator of the Little Rainbow area (in these cases)," said Carlstrom.

[This has been a "banner year" for _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA with 14 cases and 4 deaths. In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.

This may well be the 1st case of plague diagnosed in the state of Michigan and was certainly acquired in Colorado. This case seems parallel to the case in Georgia earlier in 2015 which was acquired in California. The city of Marquette is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. People living there are usually called "Yuppers" (pronounced U-pers).

The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the USA are fatal - Mod.LL

"There were a few days' lag in word getting back to Chaffee County [Colorado] Public Health because the diagnosis was from an out-of-state hospital"... In this day & age, haven`t hospitals heard of sending lab reports by phone, texting, fax or e-mail? - Mod.JW
