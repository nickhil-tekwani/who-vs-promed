In relation to the last interesting up date on the RHD case in Iowa [see
last ref. above, there is one point I'd like to clarify. According to the
antigenic data obtained with a large panel containing Mabs [monoclonal
antibodies specific for both the original RHDV and RHDVa, the Iowa
isolate is indistinguishable from the RHDVa subtype that was identified
almost simultaneously in Italy (Vir. Res. 1998, 58-115) and Germany
(Arch. Virol. 1999, 144-719).
RHDVa is consistently different from the original RHDV strain, mainly due
to a "sudden" replacement of 8 out of 25 amino acid in the sequence 346-370
of the capsid protein (VP60). This VP60 region includes one of the main
antigenic determinants of Caliciviruses. RHDVa is at least as highly
pathogenic as the original strain (the Iowa case is a further
demonstration).
Correctly vaccinated rabbits are protected (no clinical sign of disease)
from RHDVa challenge, but German colleagues found that on reducing the
vaccine dose, only rabbits challenged with the original strain were
protected, and not those challenged with RHDVa.
In her update, Barbara Bischoff wrote that the finding that the Iowa
isolate belongs to the RHDVa subtype supports the origin of Iowa case from
Italy or Germany. This conclusion could be correct but some considerations
must be added. According to our current epidemiological data, RHDVa is
present in several Italian regions, and in some of them this subtype
already represents 70-80% of all the RHD cases. In 1997 RHDVa accounted
for approximately 20% of the isolates in central Italy, while in north
Italy the first case was identified at the end of 1996.
Considering that in Germany the variant was identified in 1996 (no further
data are available), it is very likely that RHDVa has spread in other
European countries without them realizing it (or they have not reported
it). This could also be due to the difficulty of distinguishing RHDVa
from the original strain using basic reagents and methods. Moreover, no
data are available on RHDVa presence in non-European countries. To date
only Australia and New Zealand can be excluded from the countries in which
RHDVa could be present, considering that [their RHD epidemics, surely
caused by the original strain, started in 1995 and 1997 respectively.
In this regard and in order to facilitate rapid identification of RHDVa,
particularly in those countries where rabbit breeding is important, all
national/main laboratories involved in RHDV diagnosis may ask the OIE
Regional Laboratory for RHD in Brescia for technical support [address
below. There is full capability either to receive samples (i.e. RHDV
isolates collected for epidemiological reasons) or to provide reagents for
typing the isolates (a simple ELISA sandwich to test up to 60 RHDV
isolates, that will be supplied free, apart from shipping cost).
Thank you to ProMED-mail for its useful and interesting work
