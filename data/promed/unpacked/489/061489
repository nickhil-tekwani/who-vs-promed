[The following report was sent to ProMED-mail 19 July, with the request that
it be not posted until clearance was obtained from Communicable Disease
Intelligence (Australia) to which a more complete report has been submitted
for publication. That permission has been granted, so we now post this very
interesting report. Obviously, the governmental organizations and individuals
involved in these studies have done a fine job of planning and follow-up. --

In support of a large, combined Australian-United States military exercise at
Shoalwater Bay in southeastern Queensland this past March (TANDEM THRUST 97),
the U.S. Navy sent the Deployed Public Health Laboratory (DPHL) into the
field with the forces. The purpose of this was preventive medicine as well
as disease and vector surveillance. Among the numerous potential threats to
the health of the troops was Ross River virus (RRV), to which very few of the
U.S. personnel would have been previously exposed.
Personnel were educated in protective measures against mosquitoes before the
exercise. As troops were to be living in field conditions during the RRV
transmission season, some cases were expected, particularly in those
personnel remaining in the training area for six weeks, thereby increasing
exposure potential.
Of 19 suspected clinical cases, six were diagnosed serologically by the DPHL
using IgM [capture? - Mod] enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
techniques. Samples were forwarded to the Arbovirus Unit at the Institute of
Clinical Pathology & Medical Research (ICPMR), Westmead, for virus isolation
and confirmation of the serologic tests.
Four cases demonstrated four-fold or greater increase in neutralising
antibody titre; the other two cases demonstrated seroconversion by
neutralisation. RRV was isolated from the acute phase samples in these two
cases. These are the first reports of RRV isolation from humans in 1997.
Mosquitoes were collected in the area during the exercise and these were
forwarded to the Department of Medical Entomology, ICPMR for species
identification and arbovirus isolation. Almost 40,000 mosquitoes have been
processed; at least 40 species have been identified, with _Aedes vigilax_ and
_Culex annulirostris_ the most abundant. To date, RRV has been isolated from
pools of _Ae. vigilax_, _Ae. funereus_, _Ae. procax_ and _Cx. annulirostris_.
A large-scale post-deployment serosurvey is currently underway to establish
whether inapparent RRV infections occurred during the exercises. The final
results of these studies will be formally published elsewhere when available.

[This is a wonderfully direct approach to serodiagnosis; IgM antibody-capture
ELISA as the screening technique and neutralization for confirmation. Anyone
in the U.S. have information about imported RRV infections/cases? With the
large number of U.S. troops involved, surely there was at least one. -- Mod
