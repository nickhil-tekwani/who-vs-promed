Hermit Thrush Tests Positive for West Nile Virus in Vermont
----------------------------------------------------------
BURLINGTON: The Vermont Department of Health today received notice that a
Hermit Thrush found in Putney on 29 Sep 2000 tested positive for West Nile
virus. This is the first bird found in Vermont to test positive for West
Nile virus.
"Considering that positive birds have been confirmed in surrounding states,
it was only a matter of time before a bird in Vermont tested positive for
West Nile virus," said Peter Galbraith, state epidemiologist at the Vermont
Department of Health. Given the cool weather and lack of mosquito activity,
health officials are not recommending any spraying in the Putney area.
According to Galbraith, although mosquitoes can be seen in some parts of
Vermont through the fall, it is unlikely that there will be any human cases
of West Nile virus this year. "This confirmation of [the presence of West
Nile virus is consistent with the expectation that the virus will likely
become established in the region and that mosquito surveillance, mosquito
control and precautions to prevent mosquito bites will become routine,"
said Galbraith. Vermont residents have been extraordinary in their
cooperation with the Health Department in reporting dead birds from all
over the state. Over 555 dead birds have been reported and 213 have been
sent for testing. Prior to this most recent finding, 153 birds have tested
negative.
Testing dead birds is one part of the state's West Nile virus surveillance
program. In addition, the Department of Agriculture has been trapping and
testing mosquitoes for the virus. No mosquitoes have tested positive this
year. People get West Nile virus from the bite of an infected mosquito. So
far this year, the virus has been detected in mosquitoes and birds in
several states including New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland and Washington DC.

West Nile Virus-Positive Birds: First in Virginia and More in Maryland
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Virginia's Commissioner Of Health, E. Anne Peterson, announced that the
State's first infected crow was found several days ago near Farmville,
about 40 miles west of Richmond. The crow tested positive for the virus in
a State Health Lab in Norfolk on 4 Oct 2000, and the test result was
confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In addition a further 8 Maryland birds have tested positive for West Nile
virus, officials said yesterday, including more in Montgomery and Howard
counties. Taken together these announcements, mark a significant [extension
of the known range of the virus, north-easterly in case of the Vermont
finding and south-westerly in the case of the Maryland findings.
Officials said one of the Maryland birds, Montgomery County's third, was
found Tuesday in the 4800 block of Levada Terrace, outside Rockville, about
3 blocks from where one was found on Melinda Lane several days ago. Howard
County's second infected bird was found on 6 Oct 2000 in Meadowbridge
Memorial Park, at Routes 1 and 100, about 2 miles from where one was found
last month in Columbia. An infected crow was found Sunday in Charles
County, in the 10000 block of Lloyd Point Road, Newburg, more than 100
miles south of where the state's first infected bird turned up in Baltimore
County 3 weeks ago. The other infected crows were found in Baltimore,
according to the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has
been testing for the virus. It brings to 43 the number of virus-infected
birds found in Maryland and the District since the virus's first appearance
in the state this year on 13 Sep 2000. Just one infected crow was found in
Baltimore last year.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture said there might be no spraying
there at all if the weather does not warm up - increasing the possibility
that any locally infected mosquitoes might survive until next year.
Mosquitoes are inactive in temperatures below 55. And today's pre-dawn
hours were forecast to be colder than that. The forecast for tomorrow is
similar, officials said. "We've got an indefinite postponement until we
have improvement in the nighttime temperatures," said Don Vandrey,
spokesman for the Maryland Department of Agriculture.
Although plenty of infected birds have turned up locally in recent weeks,
there have been no local human cases, and no infected mosquitoes have been
found so far in Maryland [or Vermont. Experts have cautioned, though, that
infected mosquitoes are much harder to find than infected birds. The
concern is that if the virus has reached local mosquitoes, it could
successfully "overwinter" when they hibernate and reemerge here in the
spring, as it did this year in New York.
