Hundreds of fig growers in parts of Maharashtra are in trouble due to incessant rains. Most plantations that are at the harvesting stage have been badly affected.

A plant pathologist working at a local fig and guava research centre said the current weather conditions are favourable for rust disease, which can spread fast in plantations. According to another agriculture scientist, farmers and growers have been advised to apply pesticides to control the disease to some extent.

[Leaf rust of cultivated edible fig (_Ficus carica_) is caused by _Cerotelium fici_ (previously _Physopella fici_). Symptoms include yellow spots on upper leaf surfaces, followed by orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves where the fungus attacks through stomata. Leaf spots eventually turn necrotic, causing early leaf fall. Complete defoliation may occur within 2-3 weeks, leading to serious losses of fruit production. Fig rust generally becomes a problem as the fruit reaches maturity. The reduced plant vigour may predispose trees to infections by secondary pathogens or insect attacks and may lead to the death of the host.

Rust spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means, as well as with contaminated plant or other materials. Disease management relies mainly on fungicides or phytosanitation. No rust-resistant crop cultivars are available, but there are a number of commercial varieties with reduced sensitivity or partial resistance.

Fungal spores that are wind borne or can easily be carried on travellers' clothes, such as rust spores, pose a very high biosecurity risk.
