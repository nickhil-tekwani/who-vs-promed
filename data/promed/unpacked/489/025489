FERAL CAT CONTROL (2)
=====================
Many issues do exist regarding the maintenance of feral cat colonies,
including: zoonoses (rabies) and "owner" isolation as was mentioned.
However, what many of the "owners" of these cats (who are probably
animal lovers) do not realize is the significant impact on the wild
bird and animal population these cats impose. Education is key to
approaching this problem (for indeed it is a problem) to address
responsible community behavior.

[- Unfortunately, the cat "dumpers" will always be with us. Having
lived in Baton Rouge for some 18 years, it is interesting how every
May when the students go home, we always see a new stray cat or two
in our part of suburbia. I am told it is worse nearer the campus.
