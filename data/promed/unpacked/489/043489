Researchers find dangerous fungus in pumpkins
---------------------------------------------
Scientists from the National University [NU] discovered fungi that
cause serious disease in this vegetable. One of the organisms had not
been reported in the crop [before].

Pumpkin is one of the most important vegetables in Colombia with an
area of 3600 hectares [8900 acres] planted in 2007 producing 65 000
tons. But fungal problems appeared in the crop in recent years leading
to research at NU. Several fungal diseases were found, including a
previously unknown _Nigrospora_ species that causes lesions on the
leaves of pumpkin.

Serious pathogens were identified in the 3 areas evaluated including
species of _Alternaria_, _Curvularia_, _Fusarium_, _Oidium_,
_Penicillium_, _Nigrospora_ and mycelia sterilia [non-spore producing
fungi. - Mod.DHA] The greatest impact was due to _Fusarium_ species
responsible for a sudden wilt that can even cause death [of the
plant].

The scientists say the study records the pathogens of pumpkin [in
Colombia], and opens the way to developing fungicides and other means
of disease control.

[National crop pathogen surveys like the one described above provide
valuable information for agricultural management, increasing food
security and addressing international biosecurity issues. The data
also make important contributions towards the knowledge of individual
pathogens (including geographical 1st reports and new species), their
epidemiology and distribution.

Fungi in the genera mentioned above include pathogens causing a range
of leaf, fruit, and root diseases on cucurbits and/or other crops, as
well as benign epiphytes (see link below). It is not clear from the
report above whether all the fungal isolates recovered have been
associated with disease, or whether work to describe the _Nigrospora_
species claimed to be a new pathogen and the mycelia sterilia has been
completed.

For more information on a range of cucurbit fungal diseases see
