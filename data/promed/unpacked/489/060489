A total of 17 residents in areas RT 01 and RT 02 of the Loji
District, West Bogor, have been attacked by the plague chikungunya,
10 most recently.

According to Anwar, Chairman of RT 01, it was suspected that the
spreading of the illness was caused because of dirty Ciomas River
water. Up until now the local residents used the river water for
everyday needs [such as] bathing and washing.

The Head of Sector Pemberantasan of infectious diseases and the
Health of the Environment (P2KL) of Bogor City, Dr. Sri Pinantari
Hanum, acknowledged that he received the report of residents being
attacked by chikungunya [virus] just 2 days ago.

"As many as 17 residents in the Loji District have been attacked by
chikungunya [virus] with signs of fever, itchyness and joint and
muscle pain. Then we conducted fumigation when the 17 residents were
taken to the community health centre," he said.

[This report indicated that there is a chikungunya virus outbreak on
the west end of Java island. ProMED posted a recent suspected
chikungunya virus outbreak on the east end of that island (see
archive no. 20071121.3771). Although the symptoms in this report are
compatible with chikungunya virus infection, ProMED-mail requests
information indicating that laboratory tests were conducted to
establish that this outbreak was caused by that virus. Dengue virus
infection can cause clinical disease similar to that of chikungunya
virus infection.

If this outbreak is indeed due to chikungunya virus infection, its
direct relationship to dirty river water is unlikely. However,
significant siltation of the river could be an indication of recent
heavy rainfall that could result in increased numbers of water
catchments in which _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes would breed.
