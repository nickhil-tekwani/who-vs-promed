66 people sought medical care because of poisoning from 'shawarma' in
Kaliningrad. All purchased the shawarma from a vendor on "April 9" St
between 27 and 29 Jul 2009. In 27 cases, the diagnosis of
salmonellosis has been confirmed. Appropriate agencies initiated an
investigation.

[The outbreak is possible because of combination of violations, such
as not proper storage and processing of food, non-compliance with the
rules about street trade, and lack of testing among personnel despite
existing regulations. - Mod.NP]

Shawarma (the closest English translation to the Arabic) can be
thought of as the "Arabian Taco," because of its ubiquitous and
inexpensive nature. It is a Middle Eastern Arabic-style sandwich-like
wrap usually composed of shaved lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, beef, or
a halal (permissible to use or engage in, according to Islamic law)
mixture of meats. Shawarma is a popular dish and fast-food staple
across the Middle East and North Africa; it has also become popular worldwide.

The classic shawarma combination
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma>) is pita bread or taboon
(flatbread) bread, tomato and cucumber, and the shaved meat itself.
Typical additional toppings include tahini (sesame paste) and pickled
beets. In outward appearance, it vaguely resembles the gyros of
Greece or the Turkish doner kebab in the sense that all use
pita-wrapped meat, but the sauces are distinctly different. The word
shawarma comes from the Turkish word meaning turning, and has its
origins in Anatolia.

Shawarma is made by placing strips of meat or marinated chicken on a
stick; an onion or tomato is placed at the top of the stack to
provide flavoring. The meat is then roasted slowly on all sides as
the spit rotates in front of or over a flame for a period of several
hours. Shawarma is most commonly eaten as a fast food, made up into a
sandwich wrap with pita bread or rolled up in a sweet, fluffy
flatbread) together with vegetables and a dressing.

An earlier 2009 ProMED post described a Bulgarian outbreak of
salmonellosis linked to mayonnaise in the shawarma. The source of the
contamination in this outbreak or the serotype of _S. enterica_ are not stated.

Russia's smallest oblast (region) of Kaliningrad
(<http://geography.about.com/od/specificplacesofinterest/a/kaliningrad.htm>)
is an exclave located 200 miles (322 km) away from the border of
Russia proper. Kaliningrad was a spoil of World War II, allocated
from Germany to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference that
divided Europe between the allied powers in 1945. The oblast is a
wedge-shaped piece of land along the Baltic Sea between Poland and
Lithuania, approximately one-half the size of Belgium. The oblast's
primary and port city is also known as Kaliningrad, known as
Konigsberg prior to Soviet occupation.

The oblast and city can be seen on a map at the URL above and on the
