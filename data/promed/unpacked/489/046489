_Culex_ mosquitoes as possible vectors of West Nile virus in Tuscany, Italy
---------------------------------------------------
A publication in March this year (Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 2004,
18, 14-19) reports on an outbreak of equine encephalitis caused by West
Nile virus in race horses in the Tuscany region of Italy during the late
summer of 1998.
Molecular studies showed that the virus RNA had >99 percent nucleotide
identity with other WN virus strains isolated in Europe and with African
strains isolated from _Cx. univittatus_ in Kenya and _Cx. neavei_ in
Senegal. Presumeably migratory birds brought the virus from Africa to Italy.
No viruses were isolated from 665 mosquitoes processed, but as the authors
say this was not unexpected, since the mosquitoes were collected during
1999-2002, some time after the outbreak. However, the authors believe that
the most probable vectors were _Culex_ mosquitoes, most likely _Cx.
impudicus_ in the Fucecchio marshes, where it was the predominant
mosquito, and _Cx pipiens_, which was the most common species in the
Cerbale hills. The authors mention that both species are primarily avian
feeders, but nevertheless believe that _Cx. pipiens_ might act as a bridge
vector transmitting the virus from birds to horses, and "perhaps to humans".
Surprisingly there is no mention of the morphologically indistinguishable
_Cx. pipiens_ form _molestus_, a mosquito that feeds not on birds but
predominantly on mammals, including humans.
Attention is drawn to the interesting recent publication on the potential
role of both _Cx. pipiens_ s.s. and form _molestus_ and their hybrids in
viral spread of West Nile in the USA (Science Magazine, 303, 1535-1538, 5
March 2004).
