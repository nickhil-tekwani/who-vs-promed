The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 15 Apr 2019 the Idaho Department of Agriculture has confirmed a case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) [in Caribou county].

The 24-year-old pony mare began exhibiting clinical signs of disease on [5 Apr 2019], the EDCC said; she experienced appetite loss, depression, mild nasal discharge, mild ocular discharge, nystagmus (involuntary eyeball movement), recumbency (unable to stand). The mare was euthanized. Veterinarians confirmed she had EHM on [12 Apr 2019] the EDCC said.

The EDCC said 10 horses were exposed to the EHM-positive mare, and the farm on which they reside has been quarantined.

EHV 101
-------
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

Although the neurological form of this disease does not have a specific vaccine, vaccinating your animal with the current vaccine can help reduce the chances of your animal acquiring this disease and/or lessen the severity of the neurological form.

Biosecurity is so critical here. In fact, overly cautious should be the mantra of all individuals near this disease. You simply cannot be too careful in trying to avoid tracking this disease around. - Mod.TG]
