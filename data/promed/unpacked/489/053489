Anthrax has been detected in Krasnodar Territory. 5 persons in the
region are hospitalized with suspicion, and a diagnosis of "anthrax"
has been confirmed in 2 of them. 3 people are still under suspicion,
and their diagnosis will be specified on the 28 Sep 2010. Ill persons
are isolated; their condition is satisfactory; new signs of the
disease have not been detected. 32 people are placed in quarantine
under permanent medical supervision.

The anthrax casualties are farm workers and persons they were in
contact with. The disease was detected on one of the dairy farms of
the region in the Stanitsa of Uspenskaya. The farm was closed; 19 cows
were killed and the corpses burned. The farm is quarantined.

[Anthrax has been confirmed in the dairy herd (last week, see
20100924.3452) and now in the 2 people who were hospitalised. They
have been joined in hospital by 3 suspects, and 32 are now in medical
quarantine under medical supervision (2 more than before). I think
this means that they are just being watched by their doctor, as
anthrax is non-contagious.
