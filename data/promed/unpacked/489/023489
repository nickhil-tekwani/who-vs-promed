[Posting delayed pending further information, which has not, however,
been forthcoming - Mod.JW

This morning [Wed 9 Dec 1998 I called the Ministry of Health of
Kazakhstan. Even the Ministry is not aware of a single case of plague
in Kazakhstan, although they are making plans to make an official
announcement shortly.

[This is all very strange. The Kazakh government is going to make an
official announcement that they do not have plague? Then what is the
cause of the big outreak that Xinhua reported? Of course, in the
former Soviet Union, anthrax was called "Siberian plague." We
anxiously await further clarification - Mod.JW
