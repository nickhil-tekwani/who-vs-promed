vCJD statistics
---------------
The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 7 May 2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patient remains alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and none so far in 2012

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2012
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2012 so far [as of 7 May 2012], there have been 35 referrals, 23 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, none of GSS [Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease], one case of familial CJD, no cases of vCJD, and no cases of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2921 referrals, 1329 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 95 cases of familial CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 45 cases of GSS.

Health professions and risk of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 1965-1910
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary and conclusions:
------------------------
In 2009, a pathologist with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD) was reported to the Spanish registry. This case prompted a request for information on health-related occupation in sCJD cases from countries participating in the European Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Surveillance network (EuroCJD).

Responses from registries in 21 countries revealed that of 8321 registered cases, 65 physicians or dentists, 2 of whom were pathologists, and another 137 health care workers had been identified with sCJD. 5 countries reported 15 physicians and 68 other health professionals among 2968 controls or non-cases, suggesting no relative excess of sCJD among health care professionals. A literature review revealed: (i) 12 case or small case-series reports of 66 health professionals with sCJD, and (ii) 5 analytical studies on health-related occupation and sCJD, where statistically significant findings were solely observed for persons working at physicians' offices (odds ratio: 4.6 (95 CI: 1.2-17.6)).

We conclude that a wide spectrum of medical specialities and health professions are represented in sCJD cases and that the data analysed do not support any overall increased occupational risk for health professionals. Nevertheless, there may be a specific risk in some professions associated with direct contact with high human-infectivity tissue.

[3] CJD surveillance in Denmark

Description and analysis of 12 years of surveillance for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Denmark
--------------------------------
Summary and conclusions:
------------------------
Prospective surveillance of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was initiated in Denmark in 1997, following the observation of variant CJD [vCJD] in the United Kingdom. Demographic, clinical and diagnostic information was collected for each patient with clinical suspicion of CJD.

Here we describe the methods for surveillance and the observed outcomes between 1 Jan 1997 and 31 Dec 2008. A total of 83 patients were classified as sporadic CJD, 47 were definite diagnoses, 34 probable and 2 possible. This resulted in a mean incidence of 1.26 patients with probable and definite sporadic CJD per million inhabitants. Two sporadic CJD patients were found to have a genetic variant of unknown significance: (thr201Ser) and Glu200Asp). One patient was diagnosed with Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker [GSS] syndrome. No patients were classified as having variant, iatrogenic or familial CJD.

The Danish surveillance system, like those in other countries, has a multidisciplinary approach, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming but ensures the most complete set of information possible. With this approach we think that patients with variant CJD would have been detected had they occurred in Denmark. Certain aspects of CJD surveillance need further discussion at European level and beyond, in order to find a balance between efficiency of the systems and accuracy of surveillance data.

Detection of PPrPCWD in feces from Rocky Mountain elk
-----------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
---------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting captive and free-ranging cervids. Currently, tests for CWD in live animals involve relatively invasive procedures to collect lymphoid tissue biopsies and examine them for CWD-associated, protease-resistant cervid prion protein (PrPCWD) detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

We adapted an ultrasensitive prion detection system, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), to detect PrPCWD in Rocky Mountain elk (_Cervus elaphus nelson_) feces. Our PMCA reproducibly detected a 1.2 x 10 to the 7th dilution of PrPCWD (a 10 percent infected brain homogenate diluted 1.2 x 10 to the 6th-fold into 10 percent fecal homogenates), equivalent to approximately 100 pg of PrPCWD/g of feces. We developed a semiquantitative scoring system based on the first PMCA round at which PrPCWD was detected and fit a nonlinear regression curve to our serial dilutions to correlate PMCA scores with known PrPCWD concentrations.

We used this PMCA scoring system to detect PrPCWD and estimate its concentration in feces from free-ranging elk from Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. We compared our results to PrPCWD IHC of rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and obex from the same animals. The PMCA successfully detected PrPCWD in feces from elk that were positive by IHC, with estimated prion loads from 100 to 5000 pg PrPCWD/g of feces. These data show for the 1st time PrPCWD in feces from naturally exposed free-ranging elk and demonstrate the potential of PMCA as a new, noninvasive CWD diagnostic tool to complement IHC.

[The distinctive event in prion disease is the conversion of the native prion protein into the disease-associated misfolded protein. A novel technology has been developed to mimic the prion conversion process in vitro. This procedure, named protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), conceptually analogous to DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has important applications for research and diagnosis. The rational behind PMCA and some of the many potential applications of this novel technology are describe in detail as well as its application in automatic and serial modes that have been developed with a view to improving disease diagnosis.

[5] USA BSE case

US BSE cow was lame before culling
----------------------------------
A report yesterday from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) contained some new details about a California dairy cow that recently tested positive for an atypical form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the 1st US case detected since 2006. Earlier reports didn't say whether the cow had any signs of clinical disease or how old it was, but the OIE report says the cow was culled for lameness and that it was 10 years and 7 months old.

The cow was tested for BSE after it was slaughtered as part of routine surveillance for the disease. The carcass was set to be rendered but will now be destroyed. The report said the source of the disease is unknown and could have resulted from a random mutation. The cow was from Tulare County, located in California's Central Valley south of Fresno. The cow's age means it was born after the United States 1st banned use of cattle protein in feed for cattle and other ruminants in 1997, but before a broader ban went into effect in 2009 that bars certain cattle materials from all animal feed.

However, veterinary health experts said earlier this week that the very rare, atypical BSE the cow had isn't typically linked to consumption of contaminated feed. Health officials have said the California case poses no threat to the nation's food supply.

[6] APHIS US BSE case update
Date: Wed 2 May 2012

Update from APHIS Regarding a Detection of BSE in the US
---------------------------------------------------------
On 24 Apr 2012, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the nation's 4th case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in an animal that was sampled for the disease at a rendering facility in central California. This animal was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, so at no time presented a risk to the food supply, or to human health in the United States.

Through its continuing epidemiological investigation, APHIS -- in collaboration with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) -- has identified that one progeny born to the positive cow in the last 2 years was stillborn, and another has been located on a site in another state. That animal has been appraised, humanely euthanized, and sampled for BSE at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. Test results for that animal are negative for BSE. No birth cohort cattle have been located through the investigation.

A hold order has been placed on all cattle at a 2nd dairy (dairy 2) that is associated with the dairy of the initial positive cow (also called the index dairy). Both dairies remain under quarantine. Inventories of both the index dairy and dairy 2 have been completed by CDFA. Records are still being matched and validated to determine if any at-risk cattle may be present.

In addition, a calf ranch where the initial positive cow was raised 10 years ago is being investigated.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDFA continue the investigation of feed records at the index dairy, rendering facility and calf ranch. To date, 10 feed firms have been identified as suppliers for the index dairy during the time period of interest. At the rendering facility, feed investigators confirmed that all domestic distribution of meat and bone meal meets federal labeling requirements.

The USDA will continue to work closely with the CDFA and the FDA to provide additional information as it is available.

The United States has a longstanding system of 3 interlocking safeguards against BSE that protects public and animal health in the United States, the most important of which is the removal of specified risk materials -- or the parts of an animal that would contain BSE should an animal have the disease -- from all animals presented for slaughter in the United States. The 2nd safeguard is a strong feed ban that protects cattle from the disease. The 3rd safeguard -- which led to this detection -- is our ongoing BSE surveillance program that allows USDA to detect the disease if it exists at very low levels in the U.S. cattle population.
