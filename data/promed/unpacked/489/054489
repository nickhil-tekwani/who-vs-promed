Summary
-------
The 2001 foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] epidemic in Great Britain was
characterised by control using both traditional and novel methods,
some resulting from conclusions of mathematical models. 7 days before
the implementation of the novel controversial automatic pre-emptive
culling of all susceptible livestock on premises adjacent to infected
premises (the 'contiguous cull'), the spread of infection had already
been controlled by a combination of the traditional stamping out
policy with a national movement ban on livestock. A 2nd controversial
novel policy requiring the slaughter of sheep within 3 km [2 mi] of
premises on which disease had been confirmed (the 3-km cull) also
commenced after the peak of infection spread, was untargeted and took
several weeks to complete; serosurveillance of culled sheep detected
infection in only one flock, suggesting that cryptic infection of
sheep was not propagating the epidemic. Extensive post-epidemic
serological surveillance of sheep found only a small number of
seropositive animals in a very few flocks, suggesting that foot and
mouth disease may self-limit in extensive sheep populations. The
epidemic was finally brought to an end following the introduction of
enhanced agricultural movement restrictions and biosecurity measures.
A welfare culling scheme of unaffected animals was required to support
the prolonged national livestock movement ban. The models that
supported the contiguous culling policy were severely flawed, being
based on data from dissimilar epidemics; used inaccurate background
population data, and contained highly improbable biological
assumptions about the temporal and quantitative parameters of
infection and virus emission in infected herds and flocks.

[This is a must-read paper for those involved in FMD control and by
anyone considering using mathematical models in controlling any
disease outbreak. It is a breath of cool air in an over-heated arena
of epidemiology populated by clean-shod computer nerds without field
experience. Models have their valued place but they are at best
advisers, not guides.

Members are encouraged to check out this issue edited by Preben
Willeberg as it critically covers a wide range of mathematical models
in a variety of situations. - Mod.MHJ]
