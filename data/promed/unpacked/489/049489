A 40 year old man from Viet Nam's southern Bac Lieu province has been
hospitalized after showing bird flu symptoms, the local newspaper Young
People reported Tuesday [26 Jun 2007]. The man, under treatment at the
Tropical Disease Hospital in southern Ho Chi Minh City, has suffered from
severe respiratory problems over the past few days after eating a dead
duck. He works for wages for a local man who is raising 350 ducklings, some
of which having died recently.
The provincial Veterinary Bureau said 3 flocks of ducks in Bac Lieu's Hong
Dan district died in the last few days after exhibiting bird flu symptoms.
They were raised in the neighboring province of Soc Trang and were being
moved to Bac Lieu.
Specimens from the man and the dead ducks are being tested for bird flu
virus strain H5N1. Since late 2005, Viet Nam has confirmed 5 human cases of
bird flu infection, of whom 2 have died, 2 from the northern provinces of
Vinh Phuc and Thanh Hoa have been discharged from hospital, and one from
northern Thai Nguyen province is still under treatment at the Tropical
Disease Hospital in the capital of Hanoi.
All of the bird flu patients have either had direct contact with or eaten
dead fowl, Vietnamese deputy minister of health Trinh Quan Huan said
recently, noting that H5N1 has yet to mutate, and [the antiviral] Tamiflu
is still effective in treating bird flu patients.
Since early May 2007, bird flu outbreaks among fowl have been reported in
18 cities and provinces across Viet Nam, the Department of Animal Health
under the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said,
noting that 4 of the affected localities have detected no new outbreaks for
at least 3 weeks, meeting the criteria for announcing an end to the disease
in their territories.

A man from Bac Lieu province has been hospitalized with symptoms of bird
flu after cooking and eating a duck which had died allegedly of bird flu.
The 40 year old man, who is now in the Tropical Disease Hospital in Ho Chi
Minh City, has been suffering from severe respiratory problems in the last
few days. He works for a farmer who raises 350 ducklings, some of which
died recently.
The province's animal health authorities said 3 flocks of ducks in Bac
Lieu's Hong Dan district had died in the last few days with bird flu
symptoms. They had been raised in the neighboring Soc Trang province. The
man and the dead ducks are being tested for the H5N1 strain of bird flu.
Viet Nam's program of poultry vaccination and other measures was described
by international health experts as a model for keeping the H5N1 virus at
bay since 2005, but this year [2007], the disease has resurfaced nationwide
among ducks and chickens. Outbreaks hit poultry in 16 provinces and 2
cities this year. Four of them have reported no new outbreaks for over 3
weeks and are thus considered free of the disease.
The Ministry of Health said test results had confirmed 5 people had
contracted bird flu. Two of them died this month [June 2007], the country's
1st fatalities since late 2005. Two others, from Thanh Hoa and Vinh Phuc
provinces, recovered and were discharged. The 5th, who is from Thai Nguyen
province, is under treatment at Hanoi's National Institute for Clinical
Research on Tropical Diseases. [The most recent 2 and the 40 year old
patient described above have not been confirmed so far as bird flu cases by
WHO. - Mod.CP]
All 5 either had direct contact with or had eaten dead fowl, deputy
minister of health Trinh Quan Huan said on Monday [25 Jun 2007]. He
confirmed that the H5N1 strain had yet to mutate and the drug Tamiflu
(oseltamivir) was still effective in treating the disease.
The latest deaths raised Viet Nam's death toll since 2003 to 44 people out
of 98 reported cases.

[A map of the provinces of Viet Nam is available at

Since May 2007, 18 provinces and cities have been affected, in which 5
humans contracted the H5N1 strain of the disease and 2 died, taking the
total death toll since 2003 to 44. However, the most recent 2 cases and the
40 year old patient described above appear not to have been confirmed so
far as bird flu cases by WHO, which gives the case total as 93 and the
death toll as 42. - Mod.CP]
