Cryptosporidiosis widespread in New South Wales
-----------------------------------------------
New South Wales Health is urging anyone who has recently suffered a bout of
diarrhoea not to swim in public pools following a cryptosporidiosis
outbreak across the state. NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr
Jeremy McAnulty said the disease was spread by direct contact with people
who had diarrhoea or by swallowing contaminated water, most usually from
swimming pools.
About 180 cases of the intestinal infection were reported during April and
May 2005, with almost half the cases being children aged under 5, he said.
"From public health surveillance information and the clusters of patients
experiencing symptoms, the outbreak appears to be related to contaminated
swimming pools," Dr McAnulty said, recommending anyone with the illness not
swim until one week after recovery. No specific treatment was available for
the infection, from which it usually took 4 weeks to recover, he said. The
last big cryptosporidiosis outbreak in NSW was in 1998 when more than 1000
cases were confirmed and linked to contaminated swimming pools.

the cysts of the parasite are resistant to chlorine, which makes
disinfection of the pool difficult. - Mod.EP]
