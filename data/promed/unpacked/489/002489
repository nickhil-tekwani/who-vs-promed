The [Argentina] Ministry of Health has issued a warning about the proliferation of more cases of mumps than usual throughout the country.

Dr Julio Bafani, director of epidemiology for the Ministry of Health of Santa Fe [province], recommended that anyone who has any contact with sick persons "have their vaccination cards [status] checked" at the nearest health center. In declarations to the [radio] program "Todos en La Ocho," the provincial government official said that many of the provinces "are experiencing outbreaks of mumps, but these reports have been overshadowed by other more important news."

"From the epidemiology department we are in touch with all the area directors, and we know that there are more cases of mumps than usual in all provinces of the country, many of them in adolescents. Therefore, we insist that all [unvaccinated] persons who have had contact with someone with mumps take their vaccination card to the nearest health center and ask to be vaccinated," he said.

[Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus belonging to the genus _Rubulavirus_ in the family _Paramyxovirus_. It contains a linear, single-stranded molecule of negative-sense RNA 15 384 nucleotides long. It spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by:
- coughing, sneezing, or talking,
- sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.

Mumps likely spreads before the salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling begins.

In Argentina, 0 cases of mumps were reported to the WHO in 2014, 3772 in 2013, 4619 in 2012, 5481 in 2011, 5083 in 2010. These new cases in 2015 break the pattern of the downward trend in case numbers in this country (http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencemumps.html).

Mumps can be prevented with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 per cent (range: 66-95 per cent) effective at preventing mumps; one dose is 78 per cent (range: 49-92 per cent) effective.

The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the USA in 1967. By 2005, mumps rates declined by more than 99 per cent thanks to high 2-dose vaccination coverage among children.
