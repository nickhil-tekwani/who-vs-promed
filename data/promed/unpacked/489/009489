The Ottawa County Health Department has ordered Hope College to close
because of a suspected norovirus outbreak. As many as 140 of the 2500
students on campus have reported symptoms including nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. Crews will spend the weekend scrubbing down public areas. It has
forced the cancellation of athletic events, a parents weekend, and all
other gatherings. Police even plan to break up student parties to halt the
spread of the contagious disease.

The decision to close came after the number of affected students rose
sharply. President James Bultman says closing isn't easy, but it's prudent.
The plan is to reopen on Tuesday [11 Nov 2008] morning. Hope officials are
conferring with other schools who have had similar outbreaks, including
UCLA and Southern California, on how to handle the situation.

A Multnomah County school is closing so it can be scrubbed and sanitized
after more than 60 children went home with what is suspected to be a
stomach virus. North Powellhurst School is a kindergarten center for the
David Douglas School District. About 25 per cent of the school's
kindergarten [pupils] were absent Friday [7 Nov 2008] due to vomiting or
diarrhea or both. The Multnomah County Health Department suspects a stomach
virus is the cause. The school already was to be closed on Tuesday [11 Nov
2008] in observance of Veterans Day, but officials added Monday to provide
a 4 day window to both sanitize the school and allow students to recover.

[Although in both situations norovirus infection is suspected and has yet
to be confirmed by laboratory tests, the symptoms of sudden-onset
gastroenteritis in closed educational establishments are consistent with
the diagnosis of norovirus infection, sometimes known as winter vomiting
disease. Quarantining seems the most appropriate containment procedure in
these circumstances.
