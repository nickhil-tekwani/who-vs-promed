Mild bird flu identified in US breeding hens
--------------------------------------------
A Tennessee flock of 15 000 breeder hens has been culled after tests
revealed a mild strain of avian influenza. The birds, which were being
raised under contract for Tyson Foods, showed no signs of illness and there
was no threat to human health, said the company.

Tests revealed presence of H7N9 flu antibodies, not the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain identified in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The outbreak in
Tennessee is unrelated to the H1N1 influenza virus termed swine flu.

Tyson is to step up its surveillance procedures for avian flu in its
breeders' flocks.

[This is likely the strain of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) that
has been reported previously in Tennessee, only without the strain type
having been identified.

Let's hope that the poultry companies have good biosecurity. There seem to
be plenty of avian athletes in the area and it would be possible for
workers attending such an event to transport virus back to the poultry
houses where they work. - Mod.TG
