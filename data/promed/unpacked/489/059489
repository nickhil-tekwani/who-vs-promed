Wet days and cold nights which bring rats and mice indoors have caused an
outbreak of the usually fatal dog disease leptospirosis.
One clinic near Camden has had more than a dozen dogs die in recent weeks
from the disease, which can be passed to humans. Rossmore Veterinary
Hospital's Dr Ted Humphries is waiting on blood tests to confirm whether he
contracted the disease, which causes severe flu-like symptoms in humans,
though it is not fatal.
"Of all the diseases animals can get, it's one of the ones I'd least like
to catch," he said.
"It's a flu-like disease, except a little worse. You just seem to collapse
and go to bed." Dogs contract the disease - which has a residual presence
among rodent populations - from eating infected rats and mice or drinking
water contaminated with rodent urine.
New South Wales Health infectious diseases expert Dr Jeremy McAnulty warned
people handling infected dogs to take precautions. "It highlights the need
for people to always practice good hand washing and avoid contact with
animal excretions," he said.
NSW Agriculture veterinary pathologist Dr Rod Reece said dog owners should
control rodent populations and ensure surface water was removed from
kennels. Problem areas are the green belt, particularly on the
south-western fringe of Sydney. Dogs at risk, particularly those allowed to
range freely, should be vaccinated.
