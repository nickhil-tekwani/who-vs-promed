Pacific coral reefs are dying at an unprecedented rate, scientists have
found. Almost 600 square miles (1554 sq km) of reef have disappeared every
year since the late 1960s -- twice the rate of rainforest loss. Coral loss
has become a global phenomenon caused mainly by climate change, rising sea
temperatures, and man made nutrient pollution. The study's lead author,
John Bruno, said: "We have already lost half of the world's reef-building
corals."
The results of the study in the central and western Pacific are published
in the open access journal PLoS ONE. It provides the 1st regional-scale and
long term analysis of coral loss in the region where relatively little was
known about patterns of reef loss.
The Indo-Pacific contains 75 per cent of the world's coral reefs and has
the highest coral diversity in the world. High coral cover reefs in the
Indo-Pacific Ocean were common until a few decades ago, researchers found.
The study, which analysed a database of 6000 quantitative surveys performed
between 1968 and 2004 of more than 2600 Indo-Pacific coral reefs, revealed
that reefs are disappearing at a rate of one per cent a year, a decline
that began decades earlier than expected.
Historically, coral cover, a measure of reef health, hovered around 50 per
cent. Today, only about 2 per cent of reefs in the Indo-Pacific have coral
cover close to the historical baseline. The survey calculated coral cover,
a measure of the ocean floor area covered by living corals, which is
regarded as a key indicator of reef habitat quality and quantity, similar
to measuring an area covered by tree canopy as a gauge of tropical forest loss.
Bruno, associate professor of marine ecology and conservation in the
department of marine sciences in UNC (University of North Carolina) Chapel
Hill's College of Arts and Sciences, said the findings would be important
to policy makers and resource managers searching for ways to reverse coral
loss. "We can do a far better job of developing technologies and
implementing smart policies that will offset climate change," he said. "We
can also work on mitigating the effects of other stressors to corals
including nutrient pollution and destructive fishing practices."
Although reefs covered less than one per cent of the ocean globally they
played an integral role in coastal communities providing economic benefits
through fisheries and tourism. When corals died -- through disease, rising
temperatures and nutrient pollution -- the benefits quickly disappeared.
Elizabeth Selig, a graduate student in the College of Arts and Sciences'
curriculum in ecology, who also helped compile the study, said:
"Indo-Pacific reefs have played an important economic and cultural role in
the region for hundreds of years and their continued decline could mean the
loss of millions of dollars in fisheries and tourism."
The research was funded by a grant by the National Science Foundation and
the Environmental Protection Agency's Science to Achieve Results programme.
