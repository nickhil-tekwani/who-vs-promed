Russia (Perm): high incidence of tick bites and TBE
---------------------------------------------------
23 000 people have suffered tick bites in the Perm region of Russia.
According to the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Surveillance Center (SESC), 23 674
people were referred to the SESC laboratory to be investigated after tick
bites, among them 5853 children. For comparison, last year the total number
of people affected did not exceed 20 000.
This year, almost every tenth tick is infected. In total 494 people have
been admitted to hospital under suspicion of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)
and 283 people under suspicion of borreliosis [Lyme disease].

[Tick-borne encephalitis is caused by 2 closely related flaviviruses. The
eastern subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus causes Russian
spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes
persulcatus_. The western subtype causes Central European encephalitis and
is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The eastern subtype occurs
across Russia and northern Asia, whereas the western subtype occurs in foci
from Scandinavia in the north to Greece in the south. The eastern subtype
is associated with more severe disease and, in some outbreaks, mortality up
to 25 per cent has occurred. The majority of infections are a consequence
of tick bites, but rarely infection has occurred by consumption of infected
cow's or goat's milk. Inactivated vaccines are available for protection
against both subtypes. - Mod.CP]
