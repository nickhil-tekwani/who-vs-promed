As I knew that Dr Ntsakala, surgeon of the public hospital of Pointe Noire,
has treated a case, I got information from him. He reports 4 recent cases
diagnosed as MUD in his ward.
Case 1:
17 year old girl, living in Kimongo (near Dolisie, Niari District).
Hospitalized in December 2000. Onset in October 2000, starting with a
painless nodule of the elbow. Then swelling of the limb, and ulceration
spreading rapidly. Important muscular lesions on the posterior side of the
limb from the shoulder to the hand. Bacteriological test not done.
Treatment : Streptomycin, Dexambutol, INH, Rifampicin started in January
2001. Cleanliness surgery.
Progressive healing according Dr Ntsakala. Still hospitalized.
That patient reports 4 similar cases in her close relatives living in the
same village, 2 cases 2 months earlier, and 2 cases in the same period. All
this cases healed spontaneously in a few weeks.
Case 2:
24 year old woman, living in Dolisie, NIARI District. Hospitalized in
December 2000. Onset in October 2000, starting with a painless nodule of
the leg, then swelling of the whole limb and spreading ulceration.
Bacteriological test not done. Important muscular lesions of the
anterior-external side of the leg, from knee to ankle.
Treatment : Streptomycin, Dexambutol, INH, Rifampicin started in January
2001. Cleanliness surgery.
Progressive healing according Dr Ntsakala. Still hospitalized.
Case 3
Woman hospitalized in November [2000. Bacteriological and pathologic
samples have been sent in France. According Dr Ntsakala, an "atypical
mycobacterium" has been isolated. Unfortunately, the patient went back in
her village and is not reachable. She kept with her the medical file, the
bacteriological results and details of the laboratory in Paris. Very few
records are available in the hospital, and there is little chance of us
tracking her down.
Treatments : classic antibiotics and NSAI [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs.
She decided to go back in her village.
Case 4
Hospitalized in November 2001. Ulceration of the leg. Back in her village
before diagnosis and treatment.
My remarks:
- The home area of patients is in Niari, but not very far from Kakamoueka (
less than 100 km).
- The region of Kakamoueka is well known for its intensive activity of
panning for gold. Exploitation is open cast, and the soil is "washed" in
water from the many rivers in the area.
- I will try to reach Dr Ebata in Brazzaville in order to confirm, or
correct, the data above.

In Malaysia, I had the privilege of looking after 14 cases of Buruli ulcer,
all of which came from an Orang Asli (aboriginal race) village of Kelubi in
Perak. The lesions and natural history of my patients, jointly managed with
Dr John Petit, consultant dermatologist, were similar to those reported in
Buruli and Queensland.
Resection of the pre-ulcerating nodule was curative. The sites of these
nodules suggest trauma as an important factor, with the soil and grass
(lalang) being possible reservoir.
Local therapy with cleaning and toilet under the deeply undermining ulcers
(typical of mycobacterium lesions) was essential. Also, because _M.
ulcerans_ proliferates best in subnormal body temperature, the hot box
therapy was used for limbs such as elbow and forearm.
We did not find it highly contagious. These are only empirical observations.

[The message from Dr. Corbin provides insight into the amount and type of
diagnostic information that provided the background for the article posted
as the first message of this thread. There does not appear to have been a
bacteriological diagnosis for some or all of the cases, but a follow-up
message from Dr. Corbin is invited if he is able to glean any further
information. It appears that the infections reported may have been
diagnosed as _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ based largely upon clinical
observations, but the observations reported are not entirely consistent
with the expected presentation. We would welcome further information if it
becomes available.
The second part of this posting provides an additional indication that
those with experience treating such infections have reason to doubt that
what was described represents a mycobacteriosis. - Mod.ES
