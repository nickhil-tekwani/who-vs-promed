Bluetongue, Greece
------------------
Information received on (and dated) 7 Dec 2012 from Mr Spiros Doudounakis, Director, Animal Health Directorate, Directorate General of Veterinary Services/Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Rural Development and Food, Athens, Greece

Summary
Report type: follow-up report No. 10
Report date: 7 Dec 2012
Date submitted to OIE: 7 Dec 2012
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Bluetongue virus
Serotype: 4
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

[For the details on each of the 12 outbreaks covered in this follow-up report, of which 8 occurred in sheep flocks and 4 in mixed sheep & goat flocks, 4 on the island of Samos and 8 on Rodos [Rhodes], subscribers are referred to the full report at the source URL above. These 12 outbreaks reportedly started between 13 Sep 2012 and 5 Nov 2012. -Mod.AS]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 12
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep & goats [mixed holdings] / 930 / 93 / 93 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 1018 / 163 / 105 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep & goats / 10 percent / 10 percent / 100 percent / 10 percent
Sheep / 16.01 percent / 10.31 percent / 64.42 percent / 10.31 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

[The follow-up report above (summarised) again underlines the high pathogenicity of the causative agent, BTV-4, for the exposed sheep population. The relative low morbidity in the mixed (sheep and goat) flocks with the surprisingly extreme 100 percent apparent mortality, should be explained by the assumption that only mortalities (in sheep) were recorded/reported from these flocks. It may be assumed that mild or non-fatal clinical cases have not been noticed/reported. Goats, similar to cattle, are generally known to undergo only sub-clinical BTV infection.

The high 'apparent mortality rate' figures, exceeding 60 percent, in the sheep flocks may have similarly been affected by the possible non-reporting of non-fatal or mild clinical cases in the sheep. This does not necessarily diminish the apparent high pathogenicity of the virus.

This epizootic in the Aegean islands of Greece is a reminder of the seriousness of bluetongue and its potential devastating effect in unvaccinated sheep of susceptible breeds. Since September 2012, 68 outbreaks have been reported, new outbreaks still appearing during the 2nd half of November 2012. On top of mortality, the long convalescence period of recovering sheep, their suffering, the medical treatment and feeding costs, and the effect upon their future production are to be taken into account.

It will be surprising if no circulation of the same virus has been taking place during the same period within Turkey's adjacent mainland.

BTV-4 has reportedly been recently circulating also in Israel, and has probably (serotyping report pending) been behind outbreaks in the West Bank (Palestinian Authority), from where it was officially reported to the OIE.

It will be interesting to obtain genotyping results of the BTV-4 strains currently circulating in the Eastern Mediterranean region. - Mod.AS
