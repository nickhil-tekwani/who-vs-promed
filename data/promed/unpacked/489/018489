WHO report charts disturbing changes in avian influenza virus
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization urged countries to make full haste with
pandemic influenza preparations on Wed 18 May 2005, as it released a report
outlining disturbing changes to the H5N1 virus circulating in Asia. The
report raises concerns that molecular and disease pattern evidence may
indicate the virus is becoming more adept at infecting people. It also
reveals some strains of the H5N1 virus may be developing resistance to
oseltamivir, the drug wealthy nations are flocking to stockpile as fears of
a pandemic mount.
An influenza expert who helped draft the report said it's meant to convey
the message that the level of anxiety regarding the virus has risen. I
think it's fair to say that the report signifies a definite step up in
concern," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a flu specialist from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control who is being seconded to WHO's global influenza program.
The report concedes the authors had limited scientific evidence on which to
determine whether H5N1 is becoming an even graver risk to mankind. "We're
basically worried that that's what is happening, but we're also saying that
there's not quite enough information available, not quite enough data and
cases and patterns to really solidly say that is the case," Fukuda said
from Atlanta. Fukuda was part of a recent 3-person WHO mission to Viet Nam,
where the alarming changes are being observed in the northern part of the
country. His team reported last week to a meeting of international experts
in Manila; the report was drawn up from their deliberations.
A leading U.S. epidemiologist said the report contains no single smoking
gun to suggest H5N1 is becoming a pandemic strain, but the combined
evidence paints a compelling picture that cannot be ignored. "I think it
tells us that everything about H5N1 is headed in the direction that none of
us would like to see it go," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the
Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy [CIDRAP] at the
University of Minnesota. "Do I say that that's going to mean there's an
impending pandemic? I don't know that. Does it tell me that ... there's a
growing concern about it? Absolutely."
The report of a case in which the virus was partially resistant to
oseltamivir will give public health officials around the world pause.
Oseltamivir (sold as Tamiflu) is one of only 2 antiviral drugs known to
work against H5N1 and is the 1st choice for pandemic planners, because it
is easier to use [can be taken by mouth] than the alternative, zanamivir,
which is not licensed in Canada. Dr. Frederick Hayden, an antiviral expert
at the University of Virginia, insisted it wasn't necessarily disturbing to
find limited resistance to the drug, because it has also been documented in
a small percentage of infections with human flu strains. Still, the finding
raises the specter of a resistant strain of the virus becoming dominant and
spreading among people, creating a situation in which the world has
virtually no therapeutic weapons to combat pandemic flu in the months
before a vaccine could be produced. Hayden noted that human flu strains
resistant to oseltamivir are generally less fit and don't transmit as well.
But Dr. Earl Brown, an influenza virologist at the University of Ottawa,
said oseltamivir is too new a drug for anyone to assume that pattern will
persist across all subtypes of influenza. "The indications from the lab
data are that the virus is sort of a wimpier virus when it's resistant to
the drug," he said. "So if that's always the case, that's good. But I
think, given limited experience with the drug, you can't be too categorical
at this point."
Fukuda said the authors of the report felt the situation demands close
observation. "It's definitely a warning sign that we need to monitor
resistance to oseltamivir," he said. "Clearly, that's what we have to do."
The report also outlined the disturbing changes in infection patterns in
northern Viet Nam, where this spring, there have been more clusters of
cases, clusters that lasted for longer periods of time, and a greater age
range among human cases. The changing patterns suggest the virus has
altered. Among the possibilities is that the genetic mutations have allowed
the virus to be transmitted more easily to people in the 1st place, or
among them after a 1st case occurs. At the same time, molecular analysis of
the virus shows genetic changes near what's known as the "receptor binding
site," the point where the invading virus attaches to the cell walls of a host.
Influenza viruses comprised entirely of avian influenza genes don't tend to
bind well to human receptor binding sites. But these changes may indicate
the virus is evolving to be a better fit. Still, given how little is known
about influenza, no one can predict with certainty the implications of
these changes.
"The information is pretty sketchy," said Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific
director of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which
sent a team of 3 scientists to Hanoi on Wednesday [18 May 2005]. "And till
we know quite a bit more, it's hard to know whether these things are real
or not." The team, led by Dr. Yan Li, chief of the influenza laboratory,
will help scientists at Viet Nam's National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology analyze blood samples from contacts of H5N1 cases to determine
whether additional undetected infections have occurred. "It will help a lot
in, I think, clarifying the extent of infection," Plummer said.

[Apart from information on the appearance of resistance to the
anti-neuraminidase drug -- oseltamivir --, this report adds little to
previous comments on the WHO Consultation Document
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/H5N1%20Intercountry%20Assess
ment%20final.pdf>,
which summarized the outcome of the WHO Meeting in Manila in early May
2005. The risk of a major pandemic of influenza remains unquantifiable.
There have been more apparent clusters of human avian influenza virus
infection in the north of Viet Nam than in the south of Vet Nam or
elsewhere, but in virtually all situations, there has been exposure to or
consumption of diseased chickens. There is still no firm evidence that the
H5N1 virus transmits directly from human-to-human, although this
possibility cannot be excluded. Although the avian influenza viruses
isolated from humans appear to be more heterogenous in terms of the
nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene (which encodes the virus
protein that binds to the virus receptor on the surface of host cells), it
should not be concluded that the virus may be changing to a form capable of
human-to-human transmission. There is no directionality in virus variation
unless there is an external selective force favoring a particular change.
It is possible that a virus capable of transmission between humans may
evolve by chance, but there is no reason to suppose that such a virus
evolving by mutation alone would be exceptionally virulent, rather the
reverse. In the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003,
many poultry workers developed mild infections (conjunctivitis) with very
limited spread to household contacts, but no pandemic ensued. The greatest
risk remains the generation of a novel human pathogen by reassortment of
genes between the H5N1 avian virus and human influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
