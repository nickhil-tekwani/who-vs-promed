Resistance breaking strain of Tomato spotted wilt virus (Tospovirus;
_Bunyaviridae_) on resistant pepper cultivars in Almeria (Spain).

Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) is endemic in the Almeria
region of Spain, where the local agro-climatic conditions allow
_Frankliniella occidentalis_, the main TSWV vector species,
continuous generations throughout the year. So far the only efficient
method to control TSWV in pepper crops has relied on the Tsw
resistance gene. During autumn 2003, some of the pepper varieties
previously shown to be resistant to TSWV displayed symptoms commonly
associated with TSWV infection.
A serological test carried out in the field with lateral flow devices
prepared in our institute was positive for TSWV. Sap from infected
plants was mechanically inoculated to _Capsicum chinensis_ [Cc]
resistant accession #152225, and no necrotic spots were observed on
the inoculated leaves, whereas systemic symptoms were observed 4 days
post-inoculation on newly emerged un-inoculated leaves. ELISA
(Roggero et al., 2002) confirmed the systemic infection of Cc with
TSWV. Type strains Br01 and p105 (Roggero et al., 2002) were also
inoculated to Cc and produced typical necrotic spots on the
inoculated leaf, while newly emerging leaves were symptomless and
tested negative for TSWV.
ELISA tests were negative for Impatiens necrotic spot virus and
Tomato chlorotic spot virus, the other tospoviruses able to
systemically infect Cc (Roggero et al., 2002). After 3 passages by
mechanical inoculation through single local lesions on _Nicotiana
tabacum_, the virus was still able to systemically infect Cc. RT-PCR
was carried out on upper un-inoculated leaves in order to amplify
regions of the S segment of the TSWV genome (Qiu et al., 1998).
An 800-bp PCR product corresponding to the nucleocapsid gene was
amplified, cloned, and sequenced (GenBank accession No. AY598831).
Comparison of the nucleocapsid amino acid sequence with homologue
sequences of TSWV isolates in GenBank showed highest identity (>99
percent) to an isolate from Almeria described in 1995 (Accession No.
X94550).
TSWV resistance-breaking strains have previously been reported from
Italy in _Capsicum_ spp. carrying the Tsw gene (Roggero et al., 2002)
and from Spain in tomato species carrying the Sw5 gene (Aramburu &
Marti, 2003).
To our knowledge this is the 1st report of TSWV strains breaking the
resistance provided by the Tsw gene introgressed in _Capsicum_ spp.
under field conditions in Spain.

[Tospoviruses, mainly Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), constitute a
severe threat to _Capsicum_ cultivation worldwide. TSWV is regarded
as one of the 10 most economically destructive plant pathogens.
Resistance to TSWV but not to other tospoviruses, based on a
hypersensitive reaction, has been found only in accessions of Cc
'PI152225' and 'PI159236'. The resistance, carried by the dominant
gene Tsw, is broken at high temperatures and depends on plant age,
with young plants being more susceptible. The Tsw gene has been
introduced into several commercial sweet and hot pepper cultivars
with good agronomic performance. Resistance-breaking strains of TSWV
systemically infecting resistant plants have been found under
experimental conditions and in the field.
