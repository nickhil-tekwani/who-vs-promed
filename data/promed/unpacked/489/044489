Malnutrition, anthrax dominate in Orissa's tribal areas
-------------------------------------------------------
Apart from tribals' health care practices, absence of any
supplementary diet, unhygienic living conditions, chronic diseases
and apathetic attitude of officials concerned are also responsible
for malnutrition among children.

Orissa has a large concentration of tribal population in the country,
next to Maharastra and Madhya Pradesh. The undivided Koraput district
of Orissa is a district rich tribal culture from the 62 tribes. About
95 percent of tribals stay in remote rural villages here. Mostly,
they are poor, illiterate, landless, malnourished and poverty
stricken with a bearing on the lives of the elderly people. Koraput
often hogs limelight for many wrong reasons.

Due to severe malnutrition among the tribals, physiological old age
comes to them much earlier. Instead of chronological ageing, they
become old as per their physiological signs. A male and female adult
tribal normally becomes old at the age of 43 and 37 respectively and
their life expectancy is usually below 56 years. They rely more on
occult than the modern medical care, trusting their traditional
primitive physicians. As they stay far away from government medical
facilities, they often die before any detection of a disease is made.

The deadly anthrax has threatened the existence of Koraput tribals.
Dr Murali Dhar Majhi says, "Out of the 30 districts in Orissa, 18
have been identified as endemic to anthrax. The disease which mainly
affects farm animals, is spread by spores. The fast spreading disease
affects mostly wild and domestic lower vertebrates like cattle, goats
and other herbivores but can also infect humans. Three types of
anthrax, cutaneous, respiratory and intestinal, are affecting the
Koraput tribals. The rod-shaped microbe called _Bacillus anthracis_
is responsible for this spore-forming disease. The cutaneous form of
anthrax is usually found in interior areas of the Koraput. Anthrax
infection of the intestinal tract is also taking precious lives in
Koraput. The pulmonary anthrax is extremely deadly but it is rare
here. On the other hand, cutaneous anthrax accounts for 95 percent of
anthrax cases in the locality. Because of blind beliefs, the disease
is left untreated and progresses to a dangerous bloodstream
infection, which becomes fatal," he added.

Recently, animals, including cows and goats died of anthrax in large
number in Narayanpatna, Lamtaput, Nandapur, Semiliguda, Laxmipur and
Dasamantpur blocks of Koraput. The disease was 1st traced at Sarapali
village under Bandhugaon block of the district in 1992. As per local
NGO Sanskar report, 30 persons have died and more than 50 persons
have been diagnosed as anthrax affected from 2008 May to June, 2009

[Orissa is a constant in the OIE reports from India and the reasons
are now obvious ... malnutrition in the human population resulting in
the consumption of sick and dying animals; reactive livestock
vaccination when it is done and not a structured proactive programme;
and if the humans are malnourished the livestock will also be
malnourished and therefore will not respond adequately when and if
vaccinated; and result in the prolonged 14 month epidemic seen in 2008-9.

Orissa can be located in eastern India in the following map:
