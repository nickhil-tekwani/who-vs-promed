The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB) of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health [Hong Kong] confirmed today [29 Apr 2014) a case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) affecting a 75-year-old man.

The patient, with underlying illnesses, was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) on [3 Apr 2014] for hypoglycemia. He was discharged from QEH on [13 Apr 2014]. He was admitted to Wong Tai Sin Hospital on [19 Apr 2014] for rehabilitation and is currently in stable condition. His rectal swab grew NDM-1 and OXA carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae as confirmed by the PHLSB.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. This case has been classified as colonisation and is linked to a cluster of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in QEH, amounting to 6 cases (including this patient). One of these 6 cases, a 65-year-old man, had a history of admission to a healthcare facility in India. A urine specimen taken from this patient on [25 Mar 2014] tested positive for OXA carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The patient subsequently died on [27 Mar 22014]. Another 3 patients in this cluster, 3 men aged 79, 87, and 78 [years], were confirmed to have NDM-1 and OXA carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonisation on [9, 17, and 25 Apr 2014] respectively. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.

This is the 41st detected case of NDM carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Hong Kong.

NDM is an enzyme which can inactivate carbapenems and other beta-lactams such as penicillins. Bacteria harbouring this NDM gene are commonly resistant to multiple antimicrobials, limiting therapeutic options and rendering severe clinical infections difficult to treat. Most bacteria with the NDM enzyme remain susceptible to 2 types of antibiotics, colistin and tigecycline, although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported.

Infections vary from being asymptomatic to potentially life-threatening or fatal. The level of risk depends on which part of the body is affected by the infection, and the general health of the patient. NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae was first reported in a Swedish patient of Indian origin who travelled to New Delhi, India, in 2008. The 1st fatal case was identified in 2010 in a patient who received medical treatment in Pakistan before being repatriated to Belgium. NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae has now been reported in many countries and regions including Australia, Austria, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Sweden, Singapore, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. Most patients had prior hospital contact in the Indian subcontinent.

A CHP spokesman said that proper use of antibiotics and personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene, are important for the prevention of emergence and cross-transmission of NDM strains.

[The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Enterobacteriaceae, drug resistant - USA (02): (CA) CRE 20130410.1636420:

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as, NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide. Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. KPCs were first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence the name) and were subsequently found in _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of Gram negative bacteria that includes _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Yersinia pestis_, _Klebsiella_, _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_, and _Citrobacter_, some of which live in the intestines of humans and other animals without causing illness, but can also cause infects that range in severity from mild to devastating. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of healthcare personnel, and environmental surfaces (for example bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within healthcare facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

CRE are easy to transfer from patient to patient in healthcare settings. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of these organisms and any other multidrug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and CRE patients (that is, segregating CRE-colonized or CRE-infected patients and the healthcare personnel who care for them from those without CRE and the healthcare personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w)." - Mod.ML
