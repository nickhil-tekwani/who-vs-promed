Situations Agency of Kazakhstan a total of 20 people has been admitted to
hospital with this diagnosis during the past 24 hours.
The city of Abay has population of less than 20 000 and epidemiological

[According to the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health
(<http://www.karaganda.kz/news.php/>) the cause of the outbreak is sewage
contamination of drinking water. The Ministry of Health statistics indicate
that there are now 148 people identified as infected, of whom 103 are
children and adolescents. More than 110 people have been treated in
the infectious disease department of the Abay hospital - Mod.NR.
Abay is a small city located about 200 kilometres to the south-east of the
capital Astana. It is likely that the causative agent of this outbreak of
hepatitis is an enteric virus, either hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E
virus. Hepatitis A virus is the more likely candidate due to its greater
prevalence in the region. - Mod.CP]
