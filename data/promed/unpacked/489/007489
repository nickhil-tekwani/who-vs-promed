Norwegian authorities haven't been able to detect the cause behind an unexplained disease that is estimated to have killed dozens of dogs in the country in recent days, officials said Saturday [7 Sep 2019]. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority said that it had been informed of another 6 cases of dogs falling ill, with 2 already dead, all with the same symptoms of vomiting and bloody diarrhea.

The disease seems "very serious for a dog. But we don't know yet whether this is contagious or just a series of individual cases," agency spokesman Ole-Herman Tronerud told public broadcaster NRK.

The majority of cases have been reported in and around the capital, Oslo, but also in the cities of Bergen and Trondheim, and the northern Nordland municipality.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute said Friday [6 Sep 2019] that it had detected 2 unspecified bacteria in autopsies but was unable to clarify whether that was the cause of the outbreak.

"To have healthy and great Norwegian dogs die so quickly is naturally serious. It's a very special situation I haven't been involved in before," the institute's emergency and safety director, Jorun Jarp, said Friday [6 Sep 2019].

In neighboring Sweden, the National Veterinary Institute said it had been swamped with questions from dog owners concerned over the spread of the disease across the border. The institute said it currently had no information "to show that it is an infectious outbreak or that it would pose a risk to dogs in Sweden."

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is giving several advice tips to dog owners, following the outbreak of a new serious dog disease. Section manager Ann Margaret Grondahl of the Food Safety Authority says they have information that, so far, 7 dogs may have died from the disease.

There is no common systematic overview of all the cases, but it is believed at least 20 dogs have lost their lives so far. Sickness cases are reported across much of Eastern Norway, but "we cannot exclude the disease from spreading to other regions," says veterinarian and communications manager Sasja Rygg of the veterinary chain Anicura.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority says they have little information yet but know a serious condition has been discovered in several dogs, especially in the Oslo area. The disease picture shows bloody diarrhea and some bloody vomiting. It is a short course of disease, as it goes very quickly from the 1st signs occurring until the dog becomes seriously ill.

Because so many dogs are affected, the Food Safety Authority assumes the disease is due to either a bacterium or a virus. It is also [assumed to be a bacterium or virus] because of the disease picture seen, with a violent reaction in the gut. But the surveys have not given a clear answer as to the cause.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is now working closely with the Veterinary Institute, the small animal clinic at the Veterinary College, and other animal hospitals in checking the dogs that have fallen ill. Through these surveys, they hope to find a common denominator, such as if the dogs have eaten the same feed or been in the same park.

According to Grondahl, [the Food Safety Authority] is working quite intensively to find out what could be the source of infection. She says they hope to be able to get an answer to the cause of the illness during the day or tomorrow [Sat 7 Sep 2019].

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is now offering advice to dog owners:

- Restrict close contact with other dogs.
- Do not let the dog greet other dogs on tour.
- Avoid the dog sniffing a lot in the ditch where other dogs have been.
- Contact your veterinarian quickly if you notice any of the above signs in your dog.
- Follow the vaccine recommendations of the veterinarian. For example, the parvovirus can cause severe intestinal inflammation.
- Large gatherings such as exhibitions and dressage courses should be avoided or conducted in a way that limits contact between dogs.

The general condition [of the dog] is rapid deterioration.

AniCura animal clinics and animal hospitals in Oslo have so far received 7 of the dogs that died of the disease. "In addition, we have heard from colleagues and the public about another dozen dogs having died after having the same signs," says communication manager and veterinarian Sasja Rygg of AniCura.

She is also concerned about not creating hysteria among dog owners and points out it is not uncommon for dogs to have a bad stomach. But it's a whole different matter when they get as sick as this. Those who have been admitted have 1st gotten bloody diarrhea, which has worsened very quickly. The general condition has gone down rapidly, and some have also had bloody vomiting. Dog owners who notice these signs in their dogs should bring their dog to a veterinarian for treatment.

There are currently no indications the disease can be transmitted between dog and human. It is still too early to say whether there is a connection between the illnesses. Dogs of all breeds and ages have been affected, so it does not seem to affect a particular type of dog at a particular age.

Rygg says she has had contact with colleagues elsewhere than in Oslo, who report similar signs. If this is contagious, it will not be stopped by borders, she says, adding, "This is serious. I have never experienced similar in my time as a veterinarian and even keep my dog at home because I don't want anything to happen to him."

[Certain strains of parvovirus can be very virulent and cause havoc with dogs and owners. This is a horrible and frightening condition.

It will be good to get more information for this situation, such as determining when the index case was. Where was it? What did the 1st case have in common with the 2nd case? Were the affected dogs eating the same lot, same brand of food? Was it purchased from the same location?

Have these animals been to the same groomer? Or the same show? Or outing location? Did the animals swim 1st? Have the animals been boarded lately? Do they walk in the same park, or on the same trail? Although the article indicates all breeds are affected, there is no indication if one breed is represented more than any other breed, possibly indicating a breed sensitivity.

What about the owners? What do they have in common? Could this be a reverse zoonotic disease the owners have passed to their pets?

Have these animals been tested for parvovirus? Have any survived? What was the treatment?

These articles tell us how bad things are, and we all hurt for the owners and their pets, but the investigation, likely in its infancy, has left us with many gaps and questions. Hopefully more information will be available soon.

At this point we don't know if it is bacterial or viral, or even something like cyanobacteria from swimming in a contaminated water body. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) is a name for the hemorrhagic gastric irritation these animals are experiencing. HGE is a bit of a generic term, but descriptive of what is happening in the intestinal region. It may be due to an ingredient in dog food that has been chemically contaminated, or the chemical was changed at the food plant and the chemical is causing the problem.

Hopefully, feces and blood are being tested, with cultures underway to help determine if it is bacterial or viral. - Mod.TG
