[3] Iran: 43 cases, 8 deaths
Date: Sun 23 Feb 2020

https://financialtribune.com/articles/national/102305/iran-confirms-43-coronavirus-cases-8-dead


Iran has confirmed 43 cases of people infected with the new coronavirus, with 8 reported dead by Sunday [23 Feb 2020] noon, health officials said. The Health Ministry has identified 15 new cases of the COVID-19 virus and 3 more deaths, raising the total number of the infected to 43, and bringing the death toll to 8, the head of the ministry's Media Center announced.

According to data released by Kianoush Jahanpour, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Iran is Qom, speculated to have been spread by a businessman with regular travels to China. Up to now, all those who have contracted the disease live in central and northern parts of Iran, IRNA reported.

With Iran reporting the highest number of deaths outside mainland China, neighboring countries have started to take precautionary measures to halt the spread of the disease. Kuwait has suspended travels to and from Iran and it has barred ships coming from Iran to enter the country. Iraq has also banned flights from Iran. Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan have closed borders with Iran as a safety measure, fearing the spike in the number of deaths from the new coronavirus. Following Turkey's announcement that it has started to screen all travelers arriving from Iran, officials from Iran's Health Ministry said all travelers to Turkey are to be tested and issued a health certificate 24 hours before their flights leave for the neighboring country.

Preventive Measures
President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the health minister to set up a committee and mobilize resources to coordinate efforts to stem the coronavirus spread. Health Minister Saeed Namaki is set to attend a parliamentary session on Monday [24 Feb 2020] to update the lawmakers on the epidemic. Lawmakers have advised the public to refrain from traveling in the New Year holidays that start on [20 Mar 2020]. Namaki said although they will sanitize buses, trains and airplanes, it is best for the public not to make unnecessary trips. Means of public transportation are also being disinfected on a regular basis.

The minister has also asked ICT ministry to send frequent educative text messages to the public on preventive measures. The Culture Ministry has canceled all cultural events, including concerts and closed down cinemas across the country until the end of the week. All sports events have been canceled for 10 days starting Monday [24 Feb 2020]. Following a mandate issued by the Health Ministry and the Science Ministry to close some universities until the weekend, the University of Tehran ordered the evacuation of dormitories on Sunday [23 Feb 2020]. Schools have been shut down for several days in a number of provinces.

The Health Ministry has asked officials to bar restaurants and cafes from serving hookah, which is usually shared among several people. Free masks are to be distributed among the people, with the priority given to cities that have reported coronavirus cases.

The total number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus has exceeded 77 000, with over 2300 deaths worldwide. Almost all deaths have taken place in mainland China, the epicenter of the disease, followed by Iran and South Korea, reporting 8 and 6 deaths, respectively. The East Asian country has confirmed over 600 cases of the new coronavirus while Tehran has only reported 43.

[The number of cases in Iran is growing with 15 newly confirmed cases and 3 newly reported deaths bringing the total number of cases to 43, including 8 fatalities. One suspects as testing expands and more milder clinical presentations are found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive, the reported case fatality rate will be lower. The epidemiologic picture is still unfolding.

Qom is located to the southwest of Tehran in central Iran, and Guila is to the northwest of both Qom and Tehran and is located on the Caspian Sea.

If results confirmed, it would mean that 5 Hong Kong people evacuated from the ship had contracted the new coronavirus. Four more Hongkongers who flew home from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan preliminarily tested positive for the deadly coronavirus on Sunday [23 Feb 2020], medical sources said, as the number of confirmed infections in the city rose to 74. It was not immediately clear which chartered flight the 4 passengers had arrived home on as the government had arranged 3 trips from Tokyo since Thursday [20 Feb 2020]. In all, 193 Hong Kong passengers were evacuated from the cruise ship, sparking concerns more could be infected.

A 2nd Israeli passenger travelling on board the Diamond Princess cruise vessel that was recently quarantined in Japan is confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, Israel's Health Ministry said Sunday [23 Feb 2020]. The patient is now in an isolated ward, the ministry said, stressing this was not a transmission on Israeli soil.

Earlier, the 11 Israeli passengers of the cruise ship who had previously tested negative for coronavirus arrived in Israel on a 14-seat jet to be quarantined for 2 weeks in the Sheba Medical Center. Before that, they spent another 2 weeks on the cruise vessel moored in the Japanese port of Yokohama, near Tokyo, under quarantine; there were 3 more Israelis [on the Diamond Princess, who were hospitalized in [Japan].

A Japanese man in his 80s who was on the cruise ship Diamond Princess has died from pneumonia, the health ministry said Sunday [23 Feb 2020], bringing the number of deaths among people who boarded the coronavirus-hit vessel to 3. However, the ministry refrained from clarifying whether the man tested positive for the virus or whether he was a passenger or a crew member, citing a lack of consent from his family. The man had pre-existing conditions, the ministry said.

In Japan, 2 Japanese passengers -- an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman -- died from COVID-19, the official name of the pneumonia caused by the new virus, on Thursday [20 Feb 2020]. Their deaths followed the 1st COVID-19 death in the country, of a woman in her 80s, a week earlier. She was unrelated to the cruise ship.

Italian authorities, grappling with the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus outside Asia, took drastic action on Sunday [23 Feb 2020] to contain its spread, sending shockwaves to neighboring Austria and Switzerland. Since 2 clusters were identified this week in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, around 150 people have caught the virus, including 3 who died from the COVID-19 disease caused by it. "We have to adopt drastic measures," Veneto's Regional President Luca Zaia told reporters, indicating that he would cancel all public events, including Venice's famous carnival. As he spoke, people were still reveling on St Mark's Square. Zaia indicated that the ban would be enforced at the end of the day's carnival program, originally due to last until Tuesday [25 Feb 2020].

The Veneto president also closed all museums and schools, markets and fairs in a region that counts 5 million inhabitants and is one of Italy's industrial engines. "It's the last thing the president of a region would like to sign, but there are no alternatives," Zaia said.

Similar anti-contagion measures were taken in Lombardy, home to 10 million people and comprising Milan, Italy's business and fashion capital. Bars, clubs and cinemas were shut, but not restaurants. Milan's La Scala, one of the world's leading opera houses, suspended performances, and a Giorgio Armani event for the city's fashion week was livestreamed from an empty theatre. Universities were closed in several parts of northern Italy.

The Civil Protection Agency gave the total number of infected as 152, including the 3 dead and 3 older cases in Rome. Beyond 110 cases in Lombardy and 21 in Veneto, 6 infections were confirmed in Piedmont and 9 in Emilia-Romagna, regions that respectively border Lombardy to the west and south. Borrelli said 25 people were in critical state, under intensive care.

On Saturday [22 Feb 2020] night, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had ruled out reintroducing border controls with European neighbors, in suspension of the EU's Schengen rules. However, neighboring Austria suspended rail traffic on a key route from Italy for hours on Sunday [23 Feb 2020] because of 2 German women with fever who were riding a train from Venice to Germany via Austria.

While Austrian authorities scrambled to stop the country's possible 1st coronavirus import, hundreds of passengers were stranded on the Brenner mountain pass that separates Italy and Austria's Tyrol province. After the women tested negative for the virus, the passengers were allowed to travel on shortly before midnight.

Rail traffic between Italy and Germany was expected to return to normal on Monday [24 Feb 2020] morning, Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways said. In Austria's Carinthia province, Governor Peter Kaiser told the population to avoid travelling to Italy's virus-affected regions for the time being. In Switzerland, the canton of Ticino announced that its hospitals would isolate and test all patients with COVID-19-type symptoms, even if they have no known links with China or with other infected patients. Ticino borders Lombardy. Some 68 000 people commute from Italy to Ticino for work every day.

Italian Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri told the SkyTG24 news channel that outbreak numbers were likely to rise further. "I expect more cases," he said. "It's clear that we will have more." Authorities were still searching for so-called a "patient zero," meaning the person or persons who brought the China-originated virus to northern Italy has yet to be found.

In response to the crisis, the government decided Saturday [22 Feb 2020] night to block access to around a dozen towns at the center of the outbreak, forcibly confining tens of thousands of people. "It's like a wartime situation," a man from Casalpusterlengo, one of the affected Lombardy towns, was quoted as saying by the ANSA news agency. "Shops are closed; only supermarkets are open for a few hours; they let us in in batches, but they have run out of meat, and they don't know when they will get more," he said.

The government also called off all Sunday [23 Feb 2020] sports events in Lombardy and Veneto, including 3 Series A football games. According to a Sunday bulletin from the World Health Organization (WHO), no other non-Asian country has reported more COVID-19 cases than Italy. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it would assess the risk posed by the new clusters in Italy to other EU countries.

[According to the above media report, there have now been a total of 152 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy including 3 deaths. Another media report mentioned that the new fatality was "an elderly woman with cancer" who died in a hospital in Cremona, Lombardy (https://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/italy-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-3/1742705).

Lombardy is in the north central of the country, with Veneto on its western border in the northwest of the country. A good map of Italy showing provinces is available at http://ontheworldmap.com/italy/italy-provinces-map.html. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China is now 19 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Italy, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Lebanon and Canada). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has most likely been occurring on the ship.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 1769 including 17 deaths, with reports coming from 28 countries.

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
