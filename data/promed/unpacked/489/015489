From: "Colegate, Steven" <Steven.Colegate@dah.csiro.au>

Among other plant causes of cleft palate (in pigs, sheep, cattle and goats)
are included ingestion of piperidine and quinolizidine alkaloid-containing
plants such as the genera Conium (Umbelliferae), Nicotiana (Solanaceae) and
Lupinus(Leguminosae). Cleft palate and multiple congenital contractures,
such as arthrogryposis, can occur if the plants are ingested at critical
periods of gestation, resulting in reduced foetal movement and teratogenic
consequences.
Have any deformities been observed other than the cleft palate?
