Public summary of Committee Meeting - 30 July 1998
The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) met at the offices
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Tolworth on 30 July
1998.
The Committee conducted its regular review of research findings and
epidemiological information on BSE and nvCJD. The number of cases of BSE
continues to decline in line with predictions about the decay of the
epidemic. The Committee noted that the total number of nvCJD cases in the
UK is 27.
SEAC had previously noted that BSE could be transmitted experimentally by
mouth to sheep and, in July 1996 and May 1997, had provided advice to
Government on precautions which should be taken to protect public health.
The Committee considered the theoretical possibility that BSE could exist
in the UK sheep flock noting that no evidence of BSE in sheep in commercial
UK flocks had so far been found.
The Committee noted that, on the basis of the limited experimental evidence
available, the clinical disease caused by inoculating sheep with BSE
appeared to be very similar to the natural disease of sheep called scrapie.
As in scrapie, infectivity was found in the spleen of sheep experimentally
infected with BSE, although no infectivity has been found in the spleen of
BSE infected cattle. To distinguish the BSE strain from scrapie strains
requires lengthy and expensive post mortem testing of sheep tissue. Such
work must continue because, as previously explained (July 1996), finding
the BSE strain in the national flock might have important implications for
public health.
The Committee noted that valuable preliminary information was emerging from
the studies which they had previously recommended. They concluded that
additional work was required to determine the extent of scrapie in UK sheep
and the strains involved and decided to set up a sub-group to develop
further recommendations on this. The Committee agreed that, at present,
there was no need to recommend further action to protect public or animal
health.

The implications of sheep being infected with BSE are potentially
devastating for sheep farmers, since the only way to deal with BSE in sheep
might be to slaughter entire flocks, not just those animals that are
visibly ill.
"To distinguish the BSE strain from scrapie strains requires lengthy and
expensive post-mortem testing of sheep tissue. Such work must continue
because ... finding the BSE strain in the national flock might have
important implications for public health."
Jeff Almond, Professor of Microbiology at Reading University and a member
of the committee, said that little comfort could be drawn from the failure
to find any BSE-like strains of scrapie, because so few sheep had been
examined.
If BSE were found in sheep, dealing with the problem would not be easy, he
said. "Unlike in cows, where infectivity seems to be largely restricted to
brains and spinal cord, in sheep it is more widespread. You can take out
the spleen and major lymph nodes quite easily, but the small lymph nodes
are throughout the stuff we eat, in leg joints and shoulder joints and
those sorts of places. So if you have BSE in a sheep, frankly, I think you
would want to throw away the whole carcass."
Scrapie in sheep has been a notifiable disease only since 1993. The
compulsory slaughter of scrapie-infected sheep, coupled with compensation
of Â£25.34 per animal, was introduced only three weeks ago. The heads and
spleens of sheep of any age, and the spinal cords of sheep over one year
old, are banned for human consumption, as is meat recovered from the
vertebral column of any sheep.
A further difficulty for the scientists is that BSE is thought to have come
from scrapie in the first place, via meat-and-bone meal rations containing
the remains of cattle and sheep. Such feed was given to cattle and sheep
until at least July 1988. "If we were to find BSE in sheep at a low level,
is it because it is cow BSE that has gone back into sheep ... or is it the
strain of scrapie that originally gave rise to the BSE epidemic and has
been in sheep for hundreds of years?" Professor Almond asked.
"If it is the latter, it does not matter, but if it is the former, you have
got a problem on your hands. The trouble is that we probably would not be
able to tell which of the two it was."
