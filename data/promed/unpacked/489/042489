Readers may be interested in a pair of articles and an editorial in the
current (February 18, 1999) issue of the New England Journal of Medicine
covering the emergence of vancomycin resistance in _Staphylococcus aureus_.
Emergence of Vancomycin Resistance in _Staphylococcus aureus_. Smith, TL et
al. page 493.
Brief Report: The Development of Vancomycin Resistance in a Patient with
Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ Infection Sieradzki, K et al
page 517
Editorial: New Resistance in _Staphylococcus aureus_ Waldvogel, FA page 556
Among the important points in the papers:
1. The resistant organism is developing from previously identified
methicillin resistant strains common in tertiary health centers.
2. Resistance develops in the setting of prolonged therapy with vancomycin.
(Hardly a surprise.)
3. The resistance, which appears due to sequestration of the antibiotic in
an expanded cell wall, appears to be due to mutation and not to transfer of
genetic material from other organisms.
4. Conventional precautions did prevent the spread of the resistant
organism within the institutions where it occurred.
5. The resistance to vancomycin seems to be associated with a slightly
increased susceptibility to some beta-lactam antibiotics.
6. All authors stressed the importance of rigorously enforced isolation
procedures and antibiotic utilization surveillance.
