Clarification: Host Preference of _Culex pipiens_
-------------------------------------------------
The fifth paragraph of the ProMED-mail post entitled " West Nile
virus update 2003 - Canada (02) 20030428.1046" reads as follows:
"It's just an opinion, but I think if they were looking [for West
Nile virus-infected crows] in some of these areas, they would be
finding them," Dr. Artsob said. Dr. Michael Drebot, Health Canada's
Head of Viral Zoonosis, said one way the West Nile virus can survive
the winter is in _Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes, which prey on birds but
not humans, and which hibernate as adults on the walls of dank places
like sewers and drainage ditches. "As daylight hours increase and
temperatures rise during the spring, these mosquitoes emerge from the
sewers and look for a blood meal," he said. This species does not
prey on humans, but humans are put at risk when other mosquito
species prey on infected birds and then on humans. "We still think it
takes quite a while for the virus to build up in nature, and get into
other species of mosquitoes that feed on humans," Dr. Artsob said."
In fact _Culex pipiens_ does feed on humans, even though these
mosquitoes are traditionally thought of as feeding on birds.
According to some entomologists, there are urbanized strains of
_Culex pipiens_ that readily feed on humans and other mammals. Given
the urban distribution of human West Nile virus infections, at least
at the outset of reported human infections in North America, and the
over-wintering of gravid _Culex pipiens_ females in storm sewers and
similar structures that are common to urban areas, the species can't
be dismissed as a possible vector for human infections.

[The writer is correct. The statement "This species does not prey on
humans" is not true. But it does prefer bird blood, which makes it a
less efficient vector to humans than other species. As for
over-wintering, I collected live specimens in January 1973
hibernating in the abandoned concrete WWII gun emplacements at
Montauk, Long Island, NY. - Mod.JW]
