An investigation is underway regarding a person at Purdue University with a confirmed case of [a] hantavirus infection, according to the Tippecanoe County Health Department.

The case involved an individual who became ill after handling potentially infected mice that were captured in the wild as part of a research project, the health department reports. The person, who has since been discharged from the hospital, had blood work done at the CDC that tested positive for [a] hanatavirus infection. The individual is expected to fully recover.

The County Health Department said a small number of other people who worked in the lab and may have been exposed to the mice have been identified. They have been contacted and are being monitored for symptoms, officials said.

The research study has since been terminated. Officials said no one else is believed to be at risk.

Officials with the Health Department said the hantavirus can be carried by rodents such as deer mice and white-footed mice, commonly found in fields and wooded areas. Although it's rare, people can become infected with hantavirus through exposure to feces, urine or saliva of mice. However, the health department said the hantavirus cannot be passed from person to person and is not transmitted by fleas, ticks, mosquitoes or other insects.

Symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and trouble breathing [in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HPS].

At this time, health officials said there is no vaccine or specific treatment for hantavirus so early recognition of symptoms and appropriate healthcare are critical.

County Health officials said the best way to prevent infection is to avoid contact with wild mice and their droppings. For more information about reducing exposure to rodents, visit the CDC's website.

The Tippecanoe County Health Department reported it is working closely with Purdue University, the Indiana State Department of Health, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to thoroughly investigate this case and help ensure the health and safety of our community.

[The hantavirus involved in this case is not stated. There are 3 hantaviruses in the north-central and northeastern USA that can cause HPS and could be responsible for this case. They and their rodent hosts are Sin Nombre virus (North American deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_), Monongahela virus (North American deer mouse) and New York virus (white-footed deer mouse, _Peromyscus leucopus_). Published studies suggest that the risk of a hantavirus infection in field biologists who handle these rodents is extremely small, even in the absence of use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Use of PPE further reduces this very small risk. Given proper training and PPE use, field studies could proceed with a reasonable degree of safety for the biologists. Abstracts for 2 studies follow.

"Low risk for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has been reported among biologists engaged in fieldwork with rodents. The overall probability of acquiring HPS when working with rodents appears to be one in 1412 (0.00071). Nonetheless, a causal link between HPS and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) use is suggested by some investigators. However, supporting data are incomplete and consequently misleading. A recent HPS case was assumed to be acquired during rodent-handling activities, although substantial peridomestic exposure was evident. Regulatory groups interpret inadequate data as evidence of the need for rigorous PPE, which can hamper field research and instructional efforts. PPE recommendations should be reviewed and revised to match the risk associated with different types of fieldwork with small mammals."

"In one study, serum samples from 757 persons who had worked with rodents in North America and handled neotomine or sigmodontine rodents were tested for antibodies against Sin Nombre virus, Whitewater Arroyo virus, Guanarito virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Antibodies against Sin Nombre virus were found in 4 persons, against Whitewater Arroyo virus or Guanarito virus in 2 persons, and against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in none. These results suggest that risk for infection with hantaviruses or arenaviruses usually is low in persons whose occupations entail close physical contact with neotomine or sigmodontine rodents in North America."
