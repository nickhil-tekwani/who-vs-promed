A comment on the measles vaccine-related deaths in Tamil Nadu
-------------------------------------------------------------
That the problem was limited to one day (23 Apr 2008) at one centre
(or perhaps 2 centres -- but still one day) and to only 6 children of
whom 4 died, points to the extreme limitation of the problem in time
and space. The critical question as to how many vials were involved
has not been clarified. It appears that one vial in the 1st centre
and probably another vial in another centre were the "contaminated" ones.

Anaphylaxis does not fit with either epidemiology or symptomatology
and time sequences. Measles vaccine has been notorious for toxic
shock syndrome (TSS) due to injection of preformed _Staphylococcus
aureus_ exotoxin(s). This is not widely known since TSS is usually
due to infection first and toxicity later on. Here in the vaccine
situation, a bolus is injected.

My 1st encounter with this problem was in 1978, when several children
fell ill and one died. Investigation showed one vial was the source
of the problem. The leftover liquid was a heavy suspension of _S. aureus_.

Measles vaccine is often supplied as multidose vials. Being live
virus, no preservative is included. The rule is to discard any
vaccine vial 4 hours after reconstitution of the freeze-dried powder;
_S. aureus_ clouds are known in places where people crowd and the
microbe is a common nasal resident. If a viable organism is
introduced and the vaccine is kept several hours, especially at
icebox and outside temperatures intermittently, the organism grows in the vial.

In this case, tragedy struck after vaccination in the morning -- it
is entirely possible that the vial with a few doses left, was kept
overnight and used in the morning. I do not know if another vial
under similar circumstances occurred in the afternoon in another
centre. That problem was in the afternoon and perhaps 2 children were
affected and one died. Day temperatures began to get high that week.
If that was a factor it is worth considering.

The term TSS has been applied to this adverse event. Several cases
had been reported since 1978 in India and I recall, in Viet Nam also.

Apparently over 20 000 vials of this vaccine batch had been in use in
various places without incident -- hence a batch problem does not sound right.

Another drug could not have been injected or used as diluent since
this happened in an "extension" clinic where the vaccine and diluent
were carried in a cold box. Moreover the nurse said that the diluent
supplied was of a manufacturer different from that of the vaccine
itself; but it was measles vaccine diluent all right.

Unless the very vial(s) involved were collected/impounded and tested,
we may never know the truth. In a few days the batch number will be
known but not the specific vial.

I say all these since I have a suspicion that my earlier note did not
contain details; experts unfamiliar with this kind of TSS may laugh
it off since TSS is a problem after tampon use, and after specific
infections with _S. aureus_ or streptococci. Preformed _S. aureus_
toxin is well known as a cause of food poisoning. Injected toxin is
an unusual phenomenon in low-income countries in which workers save
left over vaccine with good intentions, but occasional disasters like
this can happen.

[Professor T Jacob John has provided an intriguing analysis of the
measles vaccine-related deaths in Tamil Nadu. We await the final
conclusions of the investigation now in progress, and hope that the
TSS explanation will be given careful consideration. - Mod.CP]
