Public Health-Seattle and King County announced on Fri 17 Aug 2018 that it is investigating an outbreak of salmonellosis -- caused by salmonella bacteria -- associated with Burien Fresh Smoothies. The business has been closed pending "a thorough cleaning and disinfection of their establishment, adoption of safe food handling practices to minimize cross contamination risks, and after any remaining processed ready-to-eat food products are discarded."

"At this time, the source of the illness has not been identified," the agency said.

Authorities say that since 15 Aug 2018, 7 people from 3 separate meal parties reported becoming ill after consuming food and beverage from Burien Fresh Smoothies between 6-8 Aug 2018. Two of the ill people were hospitalized and have since recovered.

There is no indication that any employees of the restaurant have had any symptoms consistent with salmonellosis.

As part of the Public Health investigation, Environmental Health investigators visited the restaurant on Wed 15 Aug 2018. Investigators found that the restaurant was serving cooked pork prepared at the restaurant owner's home, which is not an approved food safety practice. The restaurant was directed to immediately stop serving pork-based food items and to remove them from their menu.

However, on 16 Aug 2018, we identified a 4th ill person diagnosed with salmonellosis after eating at Burien Fresh Smoothies on 7 Aug 2018. This person did not eat any pork-based food items. On 16 Aug 2018, the Environmental Health investigators revisited the establishment and suspended its permit. On 17 Aug 2018, an additional 3 ill people were identified (one person with lab-confirmed salmonellosis and 2 people with symptoms consistent with salmonellosis).

Additionally, Environmental Health investigators are working closely with Burien Fresh Smoothies owners to educate them about using only approved food sources. The restaurant will be allowed to sell pork-based foods once the food safety team determines that the owners have secured an alternative approved source.

Five of the 7 people who got sick tested positive for _Salmonella_ Braenderup by a healthcare provider. We are still waiting for genetic fingerprint results. Food samples were collected from the establishment for laboratory testing; results are pending.

[A smoothie (occasionally spelled smoothee or smoothy) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothie) is a thick, cold beverage made from pureed raw fruit and sometimes vegetables. Smoothies are often blended with other ingredients such as water, crushed ice, fruit juice, sweeteners (e.g. honey, sugar, stevia, syrup), dairy products (e.g. milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese, whey powder), plant milk, nuts, nut butter, seeds, tea, chocolate, herbal supplements, or nutritional supplements. A smoothie containing dairy products is similar to a milkshake, though the latter typically contains less fruit and often contains ice cream or frozen yogurt.
