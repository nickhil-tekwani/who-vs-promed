[The circumstances of this ovine outbreak could not be more similar to the previous March 2020 outbreak in Shamkir [19 Mar 2020 Anthrax - Azerbaijan: (SM) sheep, OIE 20200319.7112920 [except it was 2 months earlier and on the northern border with Georgia, and this outbreak is May and on the southern border. Both involved unvaccinated young stock.

In May 2020, the stock have access to good grazing, so exposure to contaminated livestock feed is unlikely. And lambs are too small to be seen by tabanid flies. But like all young stock, they are curious. Probably, it found something it should not have. I think we might assume that the investigating officers know more than has been shared. - Mod.MHJ
