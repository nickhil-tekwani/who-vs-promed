Doctors in mainland France have detected a mosquitoborne disease among
people returning from the Indian Ocean region, where the virus is spreading
rapidly, a senior health official said on Saturday.
France's health minister has blamed "Chikungunya" fever, for which there is
no known cure or vaccine, for directly or indirectly killing 77 people on
the French island of [the] Reunion off the south east coast of Africa.
French health officials say 157 000 people have now been infected by the
disease on Reunion, about one in 5 of the population.
"We have people returning from Reunion who have symptoms of chikungunya and
their diagnoses have been confirmed," Francois Bricaire, head of the
infectious diseases service at Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, told
Europe 1 radio. "It's not surprising, quite simply because of the contacts
between the island of Reunion and mainland France." He said about 30 cases
had been found by his service and it was likely that other medical services
had detected cases. The disease can only spread via mosquitoes and Bricaire
did not say whether the people with symptoms were confined or allowed home.
Health minister Xavier Bertrand told Europe 1 that the mosquito which
carries the virus could be present in south eastern France but gave no
details. The illness, which has also been found in the nearby Indian Ocean
islands of the Seychelles and Mauritius [and Mayotte. - Mod.RY], is marked
by high fever and severe rashes. Most people recover but it is extremely
painful.
The number of people infected in Mauritius has risen to 962 from 341 the
previous week, the Mauritius government said.
French prime minister Dominique de Villepin is due to travel to Reunion on
Sunday. He faces growing criticism over the failure to prevent the disease
spreading and said this week that the entire island should be cleared of
mosquitoes.
The spread of chikungunya is likely to increase health concerns in France
following confirmation of the presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu at a farm in the east of the country where thousands of turkeys died.
First recognised in East Africa in 1952, chikungunya leaves the immune
system weak, [providing] opportunities for other diseases to set in. The
name comes from the Swahili for stooped walk, referring to the posture of
those afflicted.
Reunion is a popular tourist destination for European travellers. The
Reunion Committee on Tourism has reported tour cancellations but has not
provided figures for costs incurred.
