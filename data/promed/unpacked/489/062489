Russia has confirmed its 1st polio case in 13 years in an infant
visiting from Tajikistan, but there is no immediate threat of a wider
outbreak, the country's main public health body said Friday [14 May
2010]. The 9-month-old girl was diagnosed with the disease after
arriving in the Siberian region of Irkutsk from the Central Asian
state, where at least 12 people have died from a polio outbreak, said
Rospotrebnadzor spokeswoman Lyubov Voropayeva.

"All the necessary epidemiological measures have been taken. There is
not currently any threat the disease will spread," Voropayeva said.

Tests in a Moscow hospital found that a 2nd girl from Tajikistan,
also 9 months old, was carrying the polio virus but had not developed
the disease, Voropayeva said. The last case of polio was confirmed in
Russia in 1997.

Polio, which spreads in areas with poor sanitation, attacks the
nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours of
infection. Children under the age of 3 are most vulnerable. The
disease was practically eliminated as a public health problem in
industrialized countries in the 1960s, but remains endemic in 7
countries, including India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, according to the
World Health Organization (WHO).

At least 12 people have died of polio since January [2010] in
Tajikistan, WHO figures show. "It is a huge outbreak," WHO
spokeswoman Sona Bari told Reuters in Geneva. She said at least 83
cases of polio had been registered in Tajikistan. Apart from Russia,
no other ex-Soviet country has reported infections from the outbreak, she said.

UNICEF, the UN children's fund, Friday [14 May 2010] said it was
starting a 2nd round of polio vaccination in Tajikistan, aiming to
reach 1.1 million children under the age of 6 and was planning
additional vaccinations in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.

The WHO, a UN agency, will present its strategy for eradicating polio
by 2013 at its annual ministerial meeting of 193 member states in
Geneva next week [17-21 May 2010].

The 2nd case of poliomyelitis in 2 days was registered in Russia,
this time in the capital. In both cases, the virus was imported.
Today [13 May 2010] doctors have confirmed the diagnosis for a
9-month-old daughter of immigrants who came to Moscow from Tajikistan
in search for work. On [12 May 2010], the same diagnosis was
confirmed for a 9-month-old girl in Irkutsk, Siberia -- also a
daughter of recently arrived Tajik workers.

According to Russia's chief medical officer of health, Gennady
Onishchenko, now there is no danger for the lives of both children,
who have been given proper and timely medical help. However, there is
a risk that imported cases of poliomyelitis will affect the
epidemiological situation in the country.

"There is no need to worry, because we have taken all the necessary
measures to prevent an epidemic," Onishchenko underlined.

In order to fight the threat, Russian authorities have organized
additional vaccination of children in both countries and boosted
borderline quarantine control for passengers coming from Tajikistan
by all means of transport. All Tajik citizens currently in Russia
will be subjected to medical examination and vaccination.

The authorities have also introduced a temporary ban on Tajik
children under 6 entering the country until the end of the mass
immunization, which took off on [1 May 2010]. The measure does not
apply to Russian children temporarily residing in Tajikistan.
Moreover, Russian citizens are strongly recommended to leave the
country. Now more than 1000 Russian children -- mainly from officers'
families -- remain in the infected area.

On [5 May 2010], Russia banned the import of Tajik nuts and dried
fruits, which can contain the wild type of virus. The products
already in sale will be confiscated.

For their part, Tajik authorities prohibited children under 6 from
leaving the country. Only those immunized will be able to board
long-distance trains.

All in all, there have been 300 officially recognized cases of
poliomyelitis in Tajikistan. A total of 13 people have died. 90
percent of those infected are children under the age of 5.

Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infectious disease spread from person
to person. Around 90 percent of polio infections cause no symptoms at
all. However, in about 1 percent of cases the virus enters the
central nervous system, infecting and destroying motor neurons,
leading to muscle weakness and acute flaccid paralysis [the range of
paralytic vs non paralytic infections varies from 1 per 1000
infections to 1 per 200 infections - Mod.MPP].

There have been no cases of poliomyelitis in Russia for more than 14 years.

[The above newswire reports of 2 separate imported cases of polio
from Tajikistan admitted to hospitals in Russia for treatment serves
as a further reminder that we live in a global village and microbial
agents travel widely and rapidly. According to data available on the
WHO website, the Russian Federation reported that 98 percent of the
population less than one year of age had received 3 or more doses of
polio vaccine in 2008 (see Table on Russian Federation reported
immunization coverage available at
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragebycountry.cfm?C=RUS>).


Hence, unless the wild poliovirus (WPV) enters a geographic pocket of
unvaccinated individuals, the statement that the risk of a polio
outbreak in the Russian Federation is very low, is theoretically an
accurate statement. A qualification to this statement would be if
there had been as yet unrecognized problems in vaccine potency of the
vaccines distributed for routine vaccination activities. Of note,
according to data available on the WHO website, Tajikistan reported
that 87 percent of the population less than one year of age had
received 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in 2008 (see table on
Tajistan reported immuniation coverages
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/timeseries/tscoveragebycountry.cfm?C=TJK>.

The 2nd newswire above has information on a series of somewhat
Draconian measures that have questionable value in the interruption
of WPV transmission. First, a ban on importation of Tajik nuts and
dried fruits because they can "can contain the wild type of virus".
This moderator has not seen any publications in the scientific
literature that would support a claim that polio is transmitted
through contaminated dried fruits and nuts.

Second, banning the entry of Tajik children less than 6 years of age
until the vaccination campaigns have been completed, but permitting
the entry of Russian children less than 6 years of age coming from
Tajikistan during this period. This moderator has not seen any
publications in the scientific literature that would support a claim
that polio has a predilection for infecting one nationality more than
another nationality in the former Soviet bloc of countries.

One suspects that in the immediate "panic" phase of identification of
WPV infected individuals from Tajikistan in Russia, where there have
not been WPV infections identified in 14 years, the media is having a
"feeding frenzy" and perhaps putting words into Russian officials'
mouths leading to published declarations of measures that have
questionable impact.

Of note, according to the polio eradication website statistics, as of
Tue 11 May 2010, Tajikistan has confirmed 56 cases of polio since the
beginning of 2010 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>), the highest number
of cases reported from any country this year to date.

For a map of the Russian Federation showing Irkutsk, Siberia in
relation to other Asian countries, see
<http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/ciamaps/ru.htm> and
<http://healthmap.org/r/01hF>. Irkutsk is near to the border with
Mongolia. While the article above does not mention the method of
transportation of these imported WPV infected individuals -- overland
vs by plane -- there is the suggestion from the 2nd article that the
means of transport may well have been by train. It would be of
interest to know what the overland route was to see which geographic
areas might have been at risk of WPV introduction along the way. - Mod.MPP]
