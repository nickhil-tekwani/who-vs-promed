Tanzania: 4 hospitalized in North for suspected RVF infection
-----------------------------------------------
Four people have been hospitalized in a north Tanzanian hospital for
fear of having contracted Rift Valley fever (RVF), according to
reports on Sat 10 Feb 2007. The local English newspaper Daily News
quoted Arusha Regional Medical Officer Naftari King'ori as confirming
that the 4 people had been admitted into the Mount Meru Hospital,
where the country's 1st 2 victims of the disease died on 31 Jan 2007.
Tanzanian Prime Minister Edward Lowassa called on local government
officials to coordinate efforts to contain the spread of the disease.
He told lawmakers on Friday [9 Feb 2007] in Dodoma that the
government had already ordered vaccines and would soon start
vaccinating livestock in the country, which has a cattle population
of 18.5 million. Tanzania has already banned livestock movement to
and from neighboring Kenya and started scrutinizing all livestock
meant for human consumption after the disease had killed 2 local
residents and a Kenyan visiting northern Tanzania.
In 1998, Rift Valley fever broke out in Arusha following a similar
outbreak in Kenya, and the disease killed at least 10 people between
January and March of that year. Rift Valley fever is a viral disease
that affects mainly animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats.
But it can also affect humans. The disease is most common during
years of heavy rainfalls.

[If confirmed positive, these cases will represent a significant
incursion of Rift Valley fever into the human population of Tanzania.
So far, little information has been released regarding the extent of
penetration of the disease into livestock in the Arusha region, which
is adjacent to the outbreak in eastern Kenya.
