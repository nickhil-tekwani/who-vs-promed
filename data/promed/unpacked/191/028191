As of 26 Mar 2008, the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud de la Nacion
/ MSAL) of Argentina has confirmed 5 cases of jungle yellow fever (JYF) in
the country, including 1 death. All cases are from Misiones Province (3
from department of Guarana, 1 from San Pedro, and 1 from El Dorado).

Concerning immunization activities, 1 415 895 doses of yellow fever vaccine
have already been distributed in the country, 470 000 of them in the
province of Misiones. This brings immunization coverage in the departments
at highest risk of transmission close to 100 per cent.

Active syndromic surveillance is ongoing for residents and other persons
coming from risk transmission areas who present sudden fever with myalgia
and headache or fever with jaundice.

Epizootic surveillance has been implemented in rural areas of departments
with risk of transmission. National, provincial, and municipal vector
control teams are taking adequate measures, especially against _Aedes
aegypti_, the urban vector of the disease [virus].

[Argentina's vigorous and rapid response to the JYF has doubtless played a
role in prevention of the virus becoming transmitted in an urban setting.
One hopes that the massive vaccination in this "hot spot" has provided
sufficient herd immunity, and that no further YF cases will occur.

In epidemiological week (EW) 11 [09-15 Mar 2008], the Regional Directorate
of Health (DIRESA) reported a probable case of sylvatic YF in Peru, in a 24
year old unvaccinated woman who became ill this week. [She is] from the
Picota district and province in the San Martin department [state or
province equivalent]. Between EW weeks 01 and 11, 2 confirmed [YF] cases, 4
probable cases and 3 deaths have been recorded.

The 2 confirmed cases died, the 1st a 22 year old vaccinated woman who
became ill during EW 03/2008 came from the Aguaruna "Nueva Esperanza"
community in the Nueva District in the Amazonas Department. The 2nd case
was a man of 29 years who became ill during EW 06/2008 from the Picota
department of San Martin.

[One wonders why the vaccinated woman subsequently became infected with YF
virus and died. That raises the speculation that the vaccine that she
received had become inactivated, or her immunization history was incorrect.
