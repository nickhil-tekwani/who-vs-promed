Britain is facing a shortage of fresh salmon, which is driving up prices and could force it off restaurant menus.

Supplies of salmon from Scotland have been hit by an epidemic of sea lice on fish farms around the west coast.

At the same time, supplies from Norway have fallen back because of the over-harvesting of the fish.

Growth rates of salmon have also been affected by unusually cold weather.

Further afield, global supplies from Chile have fallen dramatically because fish farms have been hit by toxic algae blooms. As a result, some 123 000 tonnes of salmon have been lost so far this year [2016].

The food company Beacon, which works in partnership with seafood suppliers to purchase on behalf of more than 2000 restaurant businesses across the UK, said salmon prices have jumped 16 per cent since February [2016].

It is warning that a shortage could run through the year into Christmas [December 2016] and that restaurants may need to change their menus. One option would be to switch to sea trout.

The problems suggest prices for Scottish smoked salmon through the rest of the year and over the festive period could rise sharply.

Earlier this month [June 2016], Scotland's salmon farming industry was criticised by conservationists for failing to have effective measures to prevent and control sea lice.

These parasites not only damage the fish reared on the farms but also the wild population that use the same waters.

Senior food buyer at Beacon, Emma Warrington, said: 'The market is volatile at the moment with demand continuing to outstrip supply so our advice would be to start to look at alternative products for your Christmas menu planning, or factor in potential price increases for salmon products.

'We are encouraging our chefs to think carefully about planning both their immediate menus and as well as festive season specials to be less reliant on salmon.

'As well as planning their purchasing and menu creation carefully over the next 6 months, chefs should also be considering the alternatives to salmon.

'Sea trout is a great, lower cost alternative, also known as ocean trout or salmon trout, with a texture midway between salmon and farmed trout.'

However, Scott Landsburgh, chief executive of Scottish salmon producers' organisation, said he doesn't 'recognise any substance in many of these claims'.

He added: 'If Beacon are trying to push their new Christmas menus they should talk to salmon farming companies about supply of Scottish salmon for this year.

'As for some of these old claims, they are just that, old and outdated. In modern Scottish fish farming the standards of fish health and welfare are extremely high and the industry is investing heavily in new technologies to ensure that the successes in salmon farming continue to develop.'

[Sea lice are small copepods of the family Caligidae (crustaceans) which live on fish. They are external parasites that feed on the mucus, epidermal tissue and blood of host marine fish.

Sea lice cause physical and enzymatic damage at their sites of attachment and feeding which results in abrasion-like lesions that vary in their nature and severity depending upon a number of factors, one of which is the sea louse species involved (there are around 560 sea louse species).
