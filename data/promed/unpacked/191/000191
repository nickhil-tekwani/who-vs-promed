From 1997 to 2001, substandard water quality resulted in serious typhoid
outbreaks in Dushanbe, Khatlon and Soghd Oblasts. "The incidence of acute
enteric infections, typhoid fever, malaria and diphtheria -- all related to
the consumption of poor water -- remains high in Tajikistan," Igor Bosc,
UNDP deputy resident representative said.
Bosc told IRIN in Dushanbe. "With over 2000 samples taken in each oblast,
the proportion of samples exceeding regulation levels of contamination
varied from 20.6 percent for chemical contaminants in Soghd to a worrying
54.7 percent for bacteriological contaminants in Khatlon," he said.
As recently as Thu, 12 Aug 2004, 50 people reportedly contracted typhoid in
western Tajikistan, while 70 others were hospitalized with suspected cases
of the disease in what could be the largest outbreak to hit the area in 6
years. The typhoid outbreak in Rudaki district, 20 km south of Dushanbe,
was probably caused by a lack of clean drinking water, the Associated Press
quoted Mirzo Umirzokov, chief doctor at the district hospital, as saying.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 60 percent
of all diseases in the former Soviet republic were water-related, a fact
echoed by local health officials. Dr Nur Abdulhamidov, chief doctor at the
Sairob village hospital, recalls how his own community experienced a
serious outbreak of typhoid, diarrhea and skin diseases after part of the
village's water supply system broke down in 2003. Compounding the problem
further, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA) in Dushanbe reports that the high occurrence of water-borne
diseases is one of the main contributing factors leading to high rates of
infant mortality, along with malnutrition, particularly more pronounced in
rural areas.
"The heavy dependence on agriculture in Tajikistan and the resulting
exposure to chemicals involved in cotton farming and other agricultural
wastes all impact negatively on the nation's health," Bosc highlighted.
And though the heart of the problem remains the lack of access to potable
water, the importance of hygiene education and sanitation promotion cannot
be underestimated.
"Access to safe water needs to be improved, however, it requires more time
and financial resources to fix the infrastructure problems," Yukie Mokuo,
head of office for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), told IRIN
in Dushanbe, noting the problem of schools. Upwards of 49 percent of all
Tajik schools do not have access to safe drinking water, the UN estimates.

Typhoid outbreak reported in Rudaki
--------------------------------------
In Rudaki (formerly Leninsky) District, 120 people have been hospitalized
on suspicion of having contracted typhoid, Head Physician of the district
hospital in Rudaki District, Mirzotemur Umirzoqov, told Asia-Plus. Deputy
head Physician of the Republican Center for Sanitary and Epidemiological
Supervision, Isokhon Gurezov, who heads the staff for preventing typhoid
epidemic, has confirmed this information.
Umirzoqov told the Asia-Plus correspondent that since the central hospital
in the district had not been able to receive such a large number of
patients, they had had to open a temporary hospital in one of the buildings
of a boarding school for handicapped children. According to him, some 50
people have been taken to the temporary hospital. But according to the
registrar, 127 people having been diagnosed with typhoid are receiving
medical treatment.
On 10 Aug 2004 alone, 33 other people were taken to the temporary hospital
on suspicion of having contracted the disease.
According to Isokhon Gurezov, the outbreak was apparently caused by
drinking tap water. Gurezov says that the 15-16 Jul 2004 torrential rains
and mudflows polluted the district's water supply.
