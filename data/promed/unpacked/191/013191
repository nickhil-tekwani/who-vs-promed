[In the past 24 hours there have been 3 newly confirmed cases and 2 newly reported fatalities bringing the total number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by South Korea to 172 including 27 deaths (reported case fatality rate 15.7 percent).The number of recovered patients is now at 50 (29.1 percent). Of the 3 newly confirmed cases, one was a 4th generation case, one a 3rd generation case and the 3rd is still under investigation. Newly reported cases have contact dates in late May (27-29) and the 1st week in June (5-6), more than 14 days ago. Of the 172 reported cases, 31 (18 percent) are 2nd generation cases, 122 (70.9 percent) are 3rd generation cases, 15 (8.7 percent) are 4th generation cases and 1 (0.6 percent) is a 5th generation case.

Another sign that the outbreak is coming under control is the decreasing numbers of individuals in quarantine -- a sign that there are significantly fewer contacts of confirmed cases under quarantine/monitoring.

[It's always nice to have a "no new cases" post with respect to the situation of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. The current tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 remains at 1038 cases, including 459 deaths, with a reported case fatality rate of 44.2 percent.

[3] Thailand ex Oman - media report
Date: 21 Jun 2015
Source: Times of Oman [edited]
http://timesofoman.com/article/59712/Health/MERS-patient-saw-doctors-in-Oman-before-boarding-Oman-Airs-flight-to-Thailand


An Omani businessman infected with the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus visited a hospital in Oman more than 10 days before he boarded a flight to Thailand, a senior official of the Ministry of Health has revealed.

Passengers on board Oman Air's [20 Jun 2015] flight WY815 have already been advised to seek medical attention as a precautionary measure, and officials are now monitoring airline staff plus household contacts after a Thai hospital confirmed the Omani patient was suffering from the MERS coronavirus.

As the timeline of his movements unfolds, it has emerged that the patient was admitted to a hospital in Oman on [4 Jun 2015] for heart problems, according to a senior official of the Ministry of Health. The patient, who was suffering from heart disease, then left the hospital on [7 Jun 2015].

"He again went to one of the health centres on [14 Jun 2015] after he developed acute respiratory symptoms and was referred to another hospital. But he didn't go there and went to Thailand," Dr. Idris Saleh Al Obaidani, director of the Communicable Diseases Surveillance & Control Department, told Al Shabiba, the sister publication of the Times of Oman. On [15 Jun 2015], he took a flight with his 3 family members and arrived in Bangkok.

Neither the patient nor his family members reported fever upon arrival in Thailand. He was admitted to a hospital on [15 Jun 2015] and tested positive for MERS-CoV on [18 Jun 2015].

Immediately, the patient and his 3 family members were transferred to another health care facility where they were put in isolation. "Currently, the patient is in stable condition," according to the World Health Organisation.

Officials at the Bamrasnaradura Diseases Institute in Thailand, where the patient is undergoing treatment, said that the condition of the victim has improved, and he could eat mild food himself, and the condition of his 3 relatives is also getting better with no fever and cough.

"For the 175 people in the risk group, all have good health, and are all located," it said.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health said that a number of actions are being undertaken following the discovery of the case.

"The public health response teams are following the household contacts of the case as well as the airline staff who might have been exposed to the case," it said.

The ministry official said that, altogether, 6 cases have been reported in the country in the past [Oman]; the 1st case was reported in October 2013. "Out of these, 3 have died, while the others have been discharged," the official said.

The Ministry is in touch with the health authorities in Thailand in compliance with the international health regulations. "As of now, there has been no further spread of the infection," it said. It also assured people of Oman that there is no reason for increased concern over the MERS coronavirus infections in the Sultanate.

"People should take precautions while dealing with animals, especially camels, and they should implement personal hygiene practices such as covering mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing at all times to prevent the spread of infectious microorganisms," it added.

[So, was it during the hospital visit from 4-7 Jun 2015 that the individual was exposed to the MERS-CoV? Based on prior observations on the epidemiology of the disease, as a disease that loves healthcare environments to aid in transmission, there's a reasonable possibility/probability that the transmission of the virus occurred during that hospitalization. See comment following the next media report in [4]. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Oman, no outbreak in country - media report
Date: 21 Jun 2015

The Omani Ministry of Health affirmed that there was no outbreak of the MERS disease in the country following the case of a 75-year-old Omani national who tested positive for MERS while visiting Thailand for medical treatment last week.

The ministry visited the man's family members in Oman to test them for the virus. It confirmed that all the members were in good health and that there was no concern of the disease spreading in the country.

The man continues to be under observation in a Thai hospital for at least 2 more weeks. His 2 sons, who accompanied him on the trip, have also been quarantined at a different hospital.

The ministry, meanwhile, urged caution in dealing with animals, especially camels.

It also advised people who suffer from respiratory infections to follow proper and sanitary ways to sneeze and cough by covering their mouths and keeping a distance from others.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has spread at a rapid pace in South Korea since the 1st case was diagnosed on [20 May 2015], infecting 166 people in the largest outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.

The 75-year-old is the 7th reported Omani infected by MERS since the disease surfaced in Oman for the 1st time in October 2013.

[So the question remains, where did this individual have his exposure to the MERS-CoV? Was it when he went to the hospital in Oman for other health reasons? Was it in the community, and his visit to the hospital in Oman was for early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection? Has there been a chart review in the hospital where he was in Oman to see whether there were other respiratory illness patients both at the time of his hospitalization and following it? As I mentioned in yesterday's [20 Jun 2015] update, according to the WHO update on the case in Thailand, it appears as though this individual was hospitalized in Oman through 10 Jun 2015 (see above for exact dates), and arrived in Thailand on 15 Jun 2015. So the question is whether his presenting symptoms when admitted to the hospital in Oman were "cardiac" or were they consistent with early MERS-CoV? (While this was written before the media report in [3] was published, the question still remains a valid question). Was he infected while in the hospital, or did he perhaps infect others in the hospital?

If any of our subscribers have more information on these investigations, we would be very grateful to receive it. Remembering that studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in camels from Oman, and this individual denied a history of exposure to camels according to earlier press releases from Thailand, he more than likely was exposed to an individual with MERS-CoV infection.
