The NSW [New South Wales] Livestock Health and Pest Authority (LHPA) is alerting producers to be on the lookout for signs of three day sickness [bovine ephemeral fever] after the disease was recently confirmed in cattle in the St Albans and North Richmond areas in the north west of the Sydney Basin.

Cases were also seen in beef cattle at the Sydney Royal Easter Show in late March [2013]. Laboratory testing has confirmed the disease on a property at Berry (Illawarra Coast) last week [week of 1 Apr 2013], representing a major extension in the distribution of the disease.

Cumberland LHPA Senior District Veterinarian Keith Hart said that the current outbreak has been expected. "Veterinary colleagues in north coastal NSW have been reporting cases of 3-day sickness since December last year [2012]. There was a confirmation at Maitland in late February [2013], and cases were reported in the Mangrove Mountain and Wyong area in the last 2 weeks, so it was only a matter of time before the disease spilled over into the Sydney Basin," he said.

Three day sickness is spread by biting insects, usually mosquitoes, and the number of current reports indicates that there are a large number of vector insects carrying the virus as a result of good rainfall during summer. Dr Hart advises that cattle should be checked regularly for signs of the disease, which include lethargy, lameness, and drooling. Three day sickness can also temporarily reduce fertility in bulls so it's important that it be checked for and diagnosed as soon as possible.

"Sick animals should be provided with water and shade. If recumbent bulls are found or if you have other valuable animals that could be affected, consult your private veterinarian," said Dr Hart.

"It's far too late to attempt vaccination, but cattle owners could consider using one of the insect repellent pour-ons to give some protection to vulnerable classes of cattle such as bulls, pregnant cows, and lactating dairy cattle.

"Insect transmission of three day sickness can be expected until early winter, so treatment may need to be repeated 3 to 4 weeks later". The Cumberland LHPA will be monitoring to see how far south the virus spreads on the Illawarra coast before winter. In the past, three day sickness spread has been confined to areas north of the Shoalhaven River. "This year [2013] could be an exception, so cattle owners located south of the river should also be on the lookout for signs of three day sickness in their cattle".

[Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is a viral disease of cattle and buffalo. Typically, affected animals are only sick for a few days, hence the alternative name, three day sickness.

There is a sudden onset of fever -- as high as 41 deg C (105.8 deg F) compared with the normal temperature of about 38 deg C (100.4 deg F). The temperature returns to normal within 36 hours. The 1st sign in milking cows is a sudden and severe drop in milk production. Cows in advanced pregnancy may abort. This is probably because of the fever, rather than a specific effect of the virus.

Animals stop eating and drinking and become depressed. They usually drool saliva, develop a stringy nasal discharge, and may have watery eyes.

Affected animals may shiver and often become very stiff with a shifting lameness, and are reluctant to move. Lameness may not become apparent until the 2nd day of illness. The joints may appear swollen and sometimes there is swelling around the jaw. Some animals -- particularly the heavier ones -- just lie down and refuse to move.

By day 3 the affected animal is usually standing again and will begin to eat. However, lameness and weakness may last for another 2 or 3 days.

In the vast majority of cases the disease runs a short course, followed by rapid and complete recovery. However, the disease can vary in severity. Some animals may show only slight signs for about 24 hours, while a small number may stay down for many weeks. The disease is usually milder in calves under 12 months of age.

Milk production usually drops by at least 50 percent in sick cows. In dairy herds it is the highest producing animals that are usually the most severely affected. Yield should return nearly to normal after about 3 weeks, but cows affected late in lactation often dry off. Mastitis sometimes develops, with a marked rise in the somatic cell count.

Bulls and fat cows tend to show more severe signs than other cattle. Such animals lose condition rapidly and are slow to regain their body weight. A proportion of bulls will suffer temporary infertility lasting from 3 to 6 months because of the high fever. Permanent infertility is uncommon but can occur.

A small proportion of animals that go down may suffer a permanent paralysis due to damage to the spinal cord -- either as a direct effect of the virus, or due to injuries if they fall awkwardly.

Although most of the herd can be affected, deaths from ephemeral fever are uncommon and rarely involve more than 1 percent of the herd. Death is usually the result of misadventure or being down for a long period.

How is BEF spread?
A virus known as a rhabdovirus causes BEF. It is also referred to as an arbovirus because biting insects spread it. The most likely insects to transmit the disease in NSW are mosquitoes, such as _Culex annulirostris_. Biting midges may also play a role in disease spread, and there may be other vectors that have not been identified.

The distribution of these insects varies with climatic conditions, and this in turn will influence the pattern of disease spread and time of occurrence.

BEF usually occurs between January and April, with the greatest number of cases in March. However, cases can occur from December through to early June. Cases in the winter or spring months, even in coastal districts, are rare.

Diagnosis
When an outbreak occurs in unvaccinated cattle not previously exposed to the virus, a diagnosis of BEF can often be made based on clinical signs and the brevity of illness.

However, when most animals are immune and occasional cases occur, laboratory confirmation of the cause of illness may be required. Usually this is done by taking 2 blood samples -- one during the very early stages of the illness, and another 3 weeks later. If BEF is responsible, BEF antibody levels will be much higher in the 2nd test than in the first.

Treatment
Medical treatment is often unnecessary for non-lactating stock. However, bulls and high producing cows in early to peak production should be treated promptly. Animals that have gone down should be provided with adequate shelter, water and food, as cattle left exposed in hot weather are much more likely to die.

They should be rolled over several times a day to help avoid loss of circulation to the underside limbs, which will result in permanent muscle damage. The heavier the animal is, the more critical it is to get it back on its feet as quickly as possible. Bulls, high producing dairy cows and other valuable stock that become recumbent should be treated as soon as they are found. Any animals that go down should be given a calcium injection as soon as possible. This will help them to rise.

The use of anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended for any animals that become recumbent, and would be useful for any clinically affected animals. This treatment is only available through veterinary prescription. Long withholding periods may apply to some anti-inflammatory drugs, so read the label carefully.

BEF can impair the swallowing reflex, so affected animals should not be drenched or force fed. This may result in the inhalation of food or water, which can cause pneumonia.

Once cattle have been infected with the disease, most are resistant to infection for many years or for life. However, some animals lose immunity after a few years, especially older animals.

Severe disease can occur in animals of any age that are introduced to districts where the disease is frequently observed from areas where the disease is uncommon.

Prevention
Both live and inactivated vaccines against BEF are available.
