Influenza update - 306 (based on data up to 24 Dec 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity continued to increase in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere while in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere activity was at inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses accounted for the majority of influenza detections although influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant in some countries.

- In North America, overall influenza activity continued to increase in the region, with detections of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
- In Europe, influenza activity increased above baseline levels in most countries in Northern and Southwestern Europe with sharp increases in respiratory illness indicators in some countries. Activity remained low in countries in Eastern Europe. Influenza B virus detections remained frequent and the subtype of the influenza A viruses detected varied depending on the country and the surveillance system (outpatient or inpatient systems).
- In Western Asia, increasing influenza activity was reported in Israel and Jordan with predominantly influenza B and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections, respectively.
- In Central Asia, low to no influenza activity was reported.
- In East Asia, influenza activity continued to increase in recent weeks. In both Northern and Southern China, ILI and influenza activity continued to increase, with influenza B Yamagata-lineage viruses predominantly detected followed by influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Increasing detections of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses were reported in the Republic of Korea.
- In South East Asia, low levels of influenza activity were reported.
- In Southern Asia, increased influenza activity was reported in Iran with detection of all seasonal subtypes.
- In Northern Africa, influenza activity was predominantly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections. Activity increased in Egypt and Morocco; and Tunisia reported sharp increases in activity.
- In Western Africa, influenza activity continued at lower levels compared to previous weeks. Detections of predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported from Burkina Faso, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo. In Middle Africa, Cameroon reported activity with influenza A and B viruses and the Democratic Republic of Congo reported detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. In Eastern Africa, sporadic influenza detections were reported in Madagascar, Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, low to no influenza activity was reported.
- In the tropical countries of South America, low to no influenza activity was reported.
- In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity decreased overall to inter-seasonal levels.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 105 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 11 December 2017 to 24 December 2017 (data as of 2018-01-07 15:48:27 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 179 990 specimens during that time period. Up to 40 431 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 26 351 (65.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 14 080 (34.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 3357 (30.7 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 7582 (69.3 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 5620 (86.3 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 891 (13.7 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Beijing and neighboring regions are taking measures to contain the winter flu outbreak, as various viruses put pressure on medical resources.

Flu infections this winter are 71 percent above the average for the same period in the previous 3 years, with child cases rising sharply.

Influenza virus B, as well as H1N1 and H3N2, subtypes of influenza virus A, are among the most widespread, said Wang Quanyi, with the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

He said the lack of significant precipitation since late October and large temperature differences between day and night have contributed to the spread in Beijing.

The city has encouraged children and the elderly to be vaccinated and to date, 1.3 million of them have been, 90 000 more than the whole of last winter.

Health authorities released a list of 147 hospitals with pediatric services, with a total daily reception capacity of 20 000 child outpatients, so that parents know where to take their sick children, instead of swarming into already crowded top hospitals.
The outbreak has greatly increased workload of pediatricians, many of whom have become sick themselves. In Haihe Hospital, Tianjin Municipality, all the 3 doctors asked for sick leave, leading to suspension of pediatric clinics from [Mon 8 Jan 2018]. The services were not resumed until [Thu 11 Jan 2018], when 2 pediatricians from elsewhere were seconded to the hospital.

Neighboring Hebei Province has a shortage of flu medicine such as oseltamivir phosphate, as residents have stocked up after hearing of "special effects."

"I finally paid a pharmacy double to buy the medicine, as the hospital and several other pharmacies had already run out," said a man in the provincial capital of Shijiazhuang who bought oseltamivir phosphate for his pregnant wife on prescription.

Provincial health authorities are pursing new stocks of medicines.

Zhou Chunhua, a pharmacist with Hebei Medical University, said there was no need to overreact, as most patients recover in 7 days through their own immune systems.

Wang with the Beijing disease prevention and control center said the flu outbreak in Beijing had reached its peak and would ease in the next 2 weeks.

Flu cases in the last week of 2017 increased by 20.7 percent from the previous week in Beijing, and dropped by 5.76 percent in the 1st week of 2018.

"Considering schools and kindergartens will soon have their winter vacation and Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, the spread situation will be further eased," he said.

Reported cases of influenza have officially reached epidemic levels in parts of Spain.

According to official data, there were 61 cases reported in Jaen province in Andalucia per 100 000 inhabitants from December 18 to 24 [2017], exceeding the baseline which is 55 cases per 100 000.

And at the national level, the average number of cases has increased to 70 per 100 000 inhabitants.

The trend is expected to increase, reaching 400 cases of influenza per 100 000 inhabitants in the 3rd and 4th week of January 2018.

The onset of the epidemic has taken place on similar dates to last year [2016].

With the flu season fully upon us, imagine making common items, such as cotton cloth, plastic bottles, and wound dressings, killers of the H1N1 flu virus or MRSA. This is now a reality with far reaching implications. Researchers at Pace University, Queens College, and Long Island University have been awarded U.S. patent number 9 832 998 B2 for a portfolio of compounds that, when applied to polymer surfaces, renders them antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial/antimicrobial.

"We have developed a compound that when bonded to a variety of surfaces, kills the H1N1 virus, MRSA, and other pathogens, fungi, and bacteria that come into contact with those surfaces, helping to stop the spread of diseases and infections," said Chemistry Professor JaimeLee Rizzo, PhD, Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, Pace University. She and her fellow researchers, Professor Robert Engel, PhD, Queens College, and Professor Karin Melkonian-Fincher, PhD, of Long Island University, have worked on developing this as part of a portfolio of compounds since 2010.

The patent covers a group of groundbreaking antimicrobial technologies. These compounds have many practical applications across a variety of industries and sectors, such as healthcare, food, agriculture, construction, and the military. The range of surfaces that the compound can be bonded to includes many polymer materials, and could be used on wound dressings, facemasks, gowns, linens and countertops found in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and physician's offices; household items, such as sponges, cutting boards, and counters; water and air filtration systems; military uniforms; and plastic bottles used not only in the beverage industry, but the health and beauty sectors as well.

For the greater good. "With this patent, we will continue to develop compounds that will kill new flu virus strains as they emerge, which will offer enormous benefits to the health and well-being of society," added Rizzo.

The triumvirate of researchers is working on bringing the compounds to the market in 2018.

A checklist for pandemic influenza risk and impact management: building capacity for pandemic response
2018 update
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
This checklist is a tool to help national authorities to develop or update national pandemic influenza preparedness plans for managing the risk and impact of an influenza pandemic under the guiding principles of the 2017 WHO pandemic influenza preparedness framework - "Pandemic Influenza Risk Management". It updates and replaces the 2005 WHO checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.

Key considerations and updates include:
- Lessons learned from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic;
- Updated WHO guidance on topics related to pandemic influenza and public health emergency planning;
- IHR (2005) core capacity requirements and other relevant developments in health security: pandemic influenza preparedness planning activities are mapped to the indicators in the IHR (2005) core capacity monitoring framework and IHR Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool to draw direct links between pandemic preparedness and IHR core capacity requirements, integrating the essential capacities needed to manage the risk and impact of pandemic influenza with the core capacities required to manage broader health security threats;
- Pandemic influenza risk and severity assessments are added and their importance in pandemic influenza risk and impact management is emphasized;
- The principles of Emergency Risk Management for Health (ERMH) from the "Pandemic Influenza Risk Management" framework are integrated into pandemic influenza preparedness planning through an emphasis on multisectoral and multidisciplinary approaches; and
- Key resources of guidance documents that support corresponding areas in pandemic influenza preparedness and response are provided in each section of the checklist.

[Influenza pandemics occur when a new (novel) influenza virus emerges against which people have little or no immunity, and spreads around the world. Influenza viruses that have caused pandemics in the past have typically originated from animal influenza viruses that have mutated to new forms able to infect humans. To prevent or delay potential influenza pandemics, close coordination between animal and human health sectors is needed, to detect and control these novel viruses in animal populations before they are able to infect human populations.

This document is a tool to help national authorities to develop or revise national pandemic influenza preparedness and response plans, in conjunction with the 2017 WHO pandemic influenza preparedness framework, Pandemic influenza risk management. It updates and replaces the 2005 WHO checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.

This document has been developed to take into account:
- health system core capacity requirements under the IHR (2005), which came into force in 2007;
- lessons learned from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic;
- updated WHO guidance on topics related to pandemic influenza and public health emergency planning;
- risk and severity assessment; and
- other relevant developments in global health security.
