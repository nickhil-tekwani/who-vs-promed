More cyclone victims in Myanmar have been found infected with
tuberculosis (TB) in the aftermath of the storm disaster that struck
the country early last May [2008], the local weekly 7-Day News
reported Wednesday [2 Jul 2008], quoting the TB Program of the
Medical Association.

A total of 21 834 storm victims have been found carrying TB
[bacterium] 2 months after the disaster, following field trips to the
storm-hit areas by over 500 experts with the medical association, the
report said. Diseases such as TB, malaria, dengue fever and diarrhea
easily hit people, especially when they live in populated relief
camps.

TB generally occurred in Myanmar, with 100 000 people found infected
annually, according to medical experts. TB is among the 3 major
communicable diseases of national concern in Myanmar. The other 2 are
HIV/AIDS and malaria. The health authorities have called for efforts
to combat the 3 diseases.

Meanwhile, international medical teams have joined in healthcare
services for cyclone victims soon after the disaster. Various
domestic healthcare associations, international non-governmental
organizations, private clinics and Myanmar traditional medicine
practitioners have also made field trips to storm-hit areas and
carried out treatment for survivors.

State media reported earlier no outbreak of other contagious and
epidemic diseases in the storm-hit areas, saying that a total of 206
039 storm patients had received medical treatment during a month
after the cyclone hit the country.

Deadly tropical cyclone Nargis, which occurred over the Bay of
Bengal, hit 5 divisions and states -- Ayeyawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Mon
and Kayin -- on 2 and 3 May 2008, of which Ayeyawaddy and Yangon
[suffered] the heaviest casualties and massive infrastructural
damage. The storm has killed 84 537 people, leaving 53 836 missing
and 19 359 injured, according to the latest official death toll.

[A prior ProMED post mentioned rumors that the number of cases of
malaria and cholera in Myanmar increased following cyclone Nargis.
Now the above news release says that over 20 000 storm victims have
tuberculosis 2 months after the disaster. Presumably, the diagnosis
of tuberculosis in these cyclone victims was based on positive
acid-fast stained sputum smears. However, no denominator data are
given to enable comparison with pre-cyclone prevalence data from the
affected zones. ProMED-mail would be very appreciative if we could
receive accurate current information/estimations of tuberculosis in
Myanmar from knowledgeable sources.

Myanmar is known to have among the highest TB rates worldwide, with
97 000 new cases detected each year, and 133 000 registered TB
patients in 2007, with a population of over 50 million people. An
estimated 7-10 percent of TB patients are co-infected with HIV, and
60-80 percent of AIDS patients have TB. Multi-drug resistant TB
(MDR-TB) rose from 1.5 percent in 1995 to 4 percent among new
patients and 15.5 percent among previously treated patients. Data
have been extracted from
