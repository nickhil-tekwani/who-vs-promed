[In ProMED-mail's post "Bluetongue - Europe (15): BTV-8, Germany
(NRW, RP)" of 13 Jul 2007, the following request for information was
included:
"It will be interesting to obtain data on the breed of the affected
sheep and about the species of culicoides vector involved in the
renewed transmission of the virus in Germany". The following
reference, pertaining to the culicoides vector issue, was kindly
submitted by Prof Christian Griot. - Mod.AS]

obsoletus_-transmitted Bluetongue virus epidemic in Central Europe.

Abstract
--------
In August 2006, bluetongue virus disease (BTD) was detected for the
1st time in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Northern France.
Serological tests as well as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) proved the occurrence of bluetongue virus (BTV) in
diseased sheep and cattle, and the virus was identified as serotype
8. Therefore, the search for possible vectors was immediately
initiated in the outbreak region in Germany. Traps with automatically
regulated ultraviolet light lamps were placed at 2 different farms
with sero-positive cattle, and insect monitoring was done from August
2006 until January 2007. The caught arthropods were weekly
determined, and it could be observed that midges of the dipteran
family _Ceratopogonidae_ occurred in large numbers, sometimes
representing up to 40 percent of all individuals.
The microscopical analysis of the wing morphology showed that the
species (complex) _Culicoides obsoletus_ was most abundant covering
about 97 percent of the analysed midges. On 2nd place ranged _C.
pulicaris_, while _C. nubeculosus_ and _C. festivipennis_ were found
only as single individuals. Fed and unfed females were separated,
sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue disease
(Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Isle of Riems, Germany) and
investigated with a BTV-8-specific real-time RT-PCR. It could be
demonstrated that at both farms both fed and unfed _C. obsoletus_
were tested positive for BTV-8 genomes, while none of the other
species scored positive. This finding strongly supports that the
BTD-epidemic, which reached in the meantime wide regions of North
Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and of the neighbouring countries with
several hundreds of affected farms, is initiated by virus
transmission during the blood meal of midges of the _C. obsoletus_
complex.
Since they were still captured on 21 Dec 2006, close to cattle with
clinical signs, it must be feared that BTV-8 is now established in
Central Europe, where it had been absent until now.

[It seems very likely that the recently renewed transmission of the
virus in Germany has been by the same vector identified in 2006,
namely the _C. obsoletus_ complex.
It is noteworthy that an observation from the Netherlands refers to
the possible involvement of another culicoides species, _C. dewulfi_,
in the propagation of BTV-8, in addition to the _C. obsoletus_ complex
(see ProMED-mail 20061024.3042).
It will be interesting to obtain additional information on the
presence and respective roles of the _C. obsoletus_ complex and of _C.
dewulfi_ in Germany, the Netherlands, and the other affected countries
in northern Europe.
Detailed, completed information on the vectors and their ecology will
enable assessment of the seasonality, the host preference, and the
potential further geographic distribution of bluetongue virus in
northern Europe and eventually the outlining of prevention and control
policies. It may also provide needed data on the potential spread of
other orbiviruses, should they be introduced. - Mod.AS]
