Congo Rep. and Gabon: Study Links Ebola Outbreaks to Animal Carcasses;
Awareness and wildlife health monitoring are key to preventing future
fatalities
------------------------------------------
All recent Ebola virus outbreaks in humans in forests between Gabon
and the Republic of Congo were the result of handling infected wild
animal carcasses, according to a study by the Wildlife Conservation
Society (WCS) and its regional partners, described in the February
edition of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see: Wild Animal
Mortality Monitoring and Human Ebola Outbreaks, Gabon and Republic of
Congo, 2001 and;2003, by Pierre Rouquet and 10 others, in Emerging
Infectious Diseases, vol. 11, No. 2, February 2005
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no02/pdfs/04-0533.pdf>. - Mod.CP].
The study found that many animal carcasses tested for Ebola virus
between 2001 and 2003 produced positive results, and found direct
links between the deadly disease in animal populations and humans.
"This research proves that hunting and consumption of great apes
represent a serious health risk for people in Central Africa, and a
risk that can be avoided," said Dr. William Karesh, field
veterinarian for the Wildlife Conservation Society and a co-author on
the paper.
The paper provides definitive proof for the assumption that Ebola
virus moves from wildlife populations to humans through the
consumption or handling of carcasses or bushmeat. Specifically, the
researchers found that Ebola infections in wild animals such as
gorillas, chimpanzees, and occasionally duikers (a diminutive
antelope species) move across the human-wildlife divide through
hunters taking either sick animals or carcasses for meat. Hunters can
then spread the disease to families and hospital workers, creating
the conditions for an epidemic in the process.
Between August 2001 and June 2003, researchers noted that wildlife
outbreaks occurred prior to 5 human outbreaks in the same relative
locations. During this same period, 98 animal carcasses were
discovered in the region straddling northeast Gabon and the northwest
Republic of Congo. Of these carcasses, 21 gorilla, chimp, and duiker
carcasses were tested for the Ebola virus, with 14 samples being
found positive. In 11 cases, instances of human infection were
directly linked to gorilla, chimpanzee, and duiker carcasses.
To prevent future outbreaks from becoming health crises, health
officials and wildlife researchers must continue to work together in
monitoring the region's wildlife for signs of Ebola virus infection.
Shortly after August 2001, participating agencies founded the Animal
Mortality Monitoring Network in collaboration with Gabonese and
Congolese Ministries of Forestry and Environment to predict and
prevent outbreaks. On 2 occasions since then, the network alerted
health authorities about potential human outbreaks weeks before they
occurred.

[These findings establish convincingly that the handling of carcasses
of certain species of wild animals and the consumption of bushmeat
are the major routes of transmission of Ebola virus infection to the
human population in the forests of Gabon and the Republic of Congo.
However, these results do not shed light on the species that are the
ultimate source of the virus, nor can it be assumed that animal
carcasses and bushmeat are the source of human infection elsewhere in
Africa. - Mod.CP]
