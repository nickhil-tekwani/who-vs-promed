Government says it has taken measures to contain Rift Valley fever
-----------------------------------------------
The government has verified that so far 95 people have died of the deadly
Rift Valley fever, which broke out late last year [2006].
It has at the same time said that it has spent 350 million shillings [USD 5
029 000] in its efforts to contain the disease, which has already spread to
7 districts in the country.
According to the ministry of health, another 21 districts are at risk, but
measures have been put in place to contain the disease.
Director of medical services Dr James Nyikal says the majority of those
affected by the disease are men aged between 20 and 40 years and that there
is a decline in reported cases.

Rift Valley fever threatens Ethiopia
------------------------------------
Following reports of suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases from Kenya,
preventive measures have been established in Ethiopia. A committee
comprised of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD),
Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), Veterinary Laboratory Department, FAO,
USAID and WHO established on 27 Dec 2006 is preparing appropriate
prevention and response. The committee is led by MoARD.
In late December 2006, MoARD conducted a rapid assessment in regions
bordering Kenya, and the report is being finalized. Preliminary results,
however, indicate no cases to date in Ethiopia, even from high risk areas
such as the Moyale zone. WHO and FAO, in collaboration with the government
and international partners, are closely monitoring the situation.
Meanwhile, an assessment mission comprised of FMoH, the Water Resource
Ministry, UNICEF and WHO, has been deployed to the Somali Region from 15 to
21 Jan 2007. RVF, an acute fever-causing viral disease that affects
domestic animals and humans, is most commonly associated with mosquitoborne
epidemics during years of unusually heavy rainfall.

FAO increases surveillance for Rift Valley fever in Kenya
-----------------------------------------------
In Kenya, local media report the death toll from Rift Valley fever in north
eastern Kenya has reached 90, with nearly 250 cases in all. Mosquitoes
spread the disease, which primarily affects animals. The worst hit areas
are reported to be the Garissa, Wajir, Ijara, and Tana River Districts.
Dr Vincent Martin, veterinarian for the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, has just returned to Rome from Kenya. From FAO headquarters,
he spoke to VOA English/Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about the Rift
Valley fever outbreak. "In Kenya, the situation has been quite worrying,
because we are facing a Rift Valley fever epidemic, which is quite similar
to the one that broke out in Kenya 9 years ago. So when I was there, I met
the different key stakeholders and partners who are trying to control the
outbreak situation," he said.
It's unclear how many livestock have been infected. Martin said: "It's very
difficult to get figures on the number of animals affected, basically,
because of the situation on the ground. The fact that all the areas, which
were affected, were flooded, it was very difficult to access these places.
And therefore, the reports on suspected animals or abortions or deaths had
difficulty getting back to the provincial level or the headquarters. And
therefore, that's the main reason why we don't have precise figures."
The FAO is trying to strengthen surveillance by mobilizing teams to
investigate reports of Rift Valley fever in various areas. It's also
offering technical advice and training on how to identify the disease in
its early stages.
Martin said while he didn't see any animals being vaccinated, he believes
thousands of doses from South Africa and the United States have arrived in
rural areas.

[The vaccine obtained from South Africa is probably commercial
live-attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine. This vaccine will confer protecting
antibody levels within a relatively short period but is known to be
abortogenic. Should pregnant animals be vaccinated, subsequent abortions
might cause reluctance to vaccinate or to cooperate with the vaccinators
among herders. The safer, inactivated vaccine requires booster vaccinations
and is more laborious and expensive. This is the vaccine of choice in
non-endemic situations (RVF-free countries/regions) and prior to the
commencement of outbreaks in endemic regions.
It will be interesting to note which vaccine has been supplied from the US.
Is it the MV P12 vaccine, produced from a mutagen-derived strain of (human)
RVF virus? Details would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Officials: we are alert over Rift Valley fever [Tanzania]
-----------------------------------------------
Health and livestock authorities in northern Tanzania are keeping close
watch at the Tanzania-Kenya border following a fresh outbreak of the deadly
Rift Valley fever in Kenya's North-Eastern Province after a lull of almost
9 years.
Officials at the Northern Zone Veterinary Investigation Centre (VIC) have
enhanced their monitoring efforts and are maintaining tight restrictions
around the northern border.
The VIC acting chief, Dr Adam Mbise, confirmed in a telephone interview
that round-the-clock surveillance was on as directed by the director of
veterinary services in the Livestock Development ministry.
We are maintaining tight surveillance on our northern border and are
closely monitoring developments linked to a new outbreak of the deadly RVF
in Kenya, said another senior expert with VIC, Dr Adam Pima.
No case of RVF has been reported in Tanzania, but experts have warned
people around the border against eating any kind of meat that has not been
passed by a certified veterinary officer. Dr Pima has further recommended
that people desist from drinking raw milk that he said could be behind the
outbreak. People are also supposed to sleep under nets at night, because it
is possible for the fever to be transmitted from livestock to humans by
mosquitoes, he added.
Experts fear that if the disease spreads to Tanzania, it could put the
lives of a staggering 35 million people and a cattle population of 18.5
million at serious risk. The new outbreak of RVF has killed nearly 80
people in Kenya over the past 4 weeks, according to health officials in
Nairobi early last week. The vaccination of at least a million livestock in
the regions hit by the fever is said to be going on.
Some 200 people have contracted the disease since the 1st case was reported
late last month [December 2006], and it has continued to spread across
several districts in Kenya.
Omar Ahmed, the medical services chief in the worst-hit North Eastern
Province, was quoted as saying a death toll of 70 has been registered in
Garissa, Ijara, Tana River, and Wajir districts. Another 5 deaths have been
reported in Kilifi District along the Indian Ocean coast.
More people were understood to have been admitted to hospitals with the
viral disease, which is usually transmitted from livestock to humans by
mosquitoes, mainly during and after flooding. However, preliminary
epidemiological reports suggest that the drinking of raw milk from infected
animals could be the main route of infection in this outbreak.
RVF, which was 1st detected way back in the 1930s in South Africa, affects
both livestock and humans. Experts believe that the mosquitoborne pathogen
had crossed the Sahara into Egypt by 1977, and by 1999, it had traversed
the Red Sea into Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
Patients who contract the virus usually experience fever, weakness, joint
pain, dizziness and extreme weight loss. One of the earliest reported
outbreaks occurred in 1950-1951 in Kenya.

[5] Kenya - response to disease forecasts

re: Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa: Somalia, Kenya
-----------------------------------------------
In my message [see 20070112.0164], I lamented the lack of national and
international preparedness for the RVF emergency.
That is still the case, but to be fair, I must mention the fact that the
coordinated actions taken by the veterinary and medical authorities of the
Kenyan Ministries of Health and Livestock and Fisheries Development are
impressive and might well have served to reduce the incidence of human
cases. With very limited funding available and an inadequate resource base,
it is laudable that they have managed to put a coherent response in place.
It seems that at least some lessons were learned from the last RVF pandemic.

[6] Kenya - background
Date: Mon 15 Jan 2007
From: Susan Baekland <grolleyog@wanadoo.fr>

[The following information has been received from Dr Susan Baekland, a
veterinarian who formerly worked in Kenya. Her firsthand observations might
help in assessing the difficulties the authorities encounter in controlling
RVF in the affected regions. - Mod.AS]
The problem with that area, which I used to know very well indeed, is that
the Tana river has overflowed, and there have been massive rains. The
Somali and some Rendille tribesmen herd cattle, fat tailed sheep, and
goats. These animals are enclosed in a circular enclosure made of thorn
tree branches at night. They are not inside, and the herdsmen, unless they
are in one place for quite a while, will sleep in the open alongside a
fire. The Rendille make a shelter of semicircular branches covered with
hides. These residences are taken down and carried on camels when they
move. These people are going to drink the milk of their stock and probably
kill and eat a sick animal before it dies. It is a real problem.
The herds and herdsmen are scattered over huge areas looking for grazing,
often a long way off any sort of vehicular access. They can be spotted from
the air. But it all costs money, and if one is going to vaccinate
livestock, then somehow these herdsmen who are largely illiterate and very
scattered have to be informed. The only real way to contact these people is
by radio or word of mouth by a fellow tribesman, well informed and on a
camel. You can use vehicles, but they get held up all the time by the bush
and rocks, etc. But then they will suspect it is a government tax trap. It
all takes time; whether the nomads will bring their stock in for
vaccination is another matter.

[The preparedness steps in Eastern Africa, particularly in the Horn of
Africa, might be of an academic nature if susceptible animals in the
RVF-prone areas remain unvaccinated. In spite of the immense difficulties
described by Susan Baekland and others, timely mass vaccinations are
crucial for the prevention of disease in animals and exposure of humans.
For description of the areas where vaccinations should be performed, see
FAO's document "Possible RVF activity in the Horn of Africa," November
2006, which includes maps; available online at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//217874/EW_hornafrica_nov06_rvf.pdf>.
