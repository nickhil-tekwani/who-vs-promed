Medical tests have cleared a man initially suspected of being infected with Ebola in Sweden. The man, who had recently traveled to Central Africa, made global headlines Friday [4 Jan 2019] and sent Swedish authorities into high alert after arriving at a local emergency department that morning with symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever, including vomiting blood.

That emergency department -- at a hospital in Enkoping, which is about 80 km [50 miles] northwest of Stockholm -- was promptly shuttered, and the hospital began crisis responses. Authorities transferred the man to Uppsala University Hospital, where doctors treated him in isolation in the hospital's infection unit.

Test results released at approximately 2 pm EST (8 pm CET) indicated that he did not, however, have Ebola virus disease. Results were also negative for diseases that can produce similar symptoms, including yellow fever, dengue fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever, authorities announced. Testing is ongoing to identify the cause of his illness.

The unidentified man had returned 3 weeks ago from a trip to Central Africa, according to Mikael Kohler, the chief medical officer at Region Uppsala, which oversees several hospitals in the area. Kohler told local media that the man had visited Burundi, which shares a border with Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Ebola in endemic. Although the DRC is currently experiencing an outbreak, Kohler noted that the patient was not known to have traveled to any places with active Ebola cases. He also emphasized that Ebola was always only a possibility, not necessarily a likely cause.

The tenacious Ebola outbreak not far from Burundi's border in the DRC began in August [2018] and has health experts on edge over the possibility of its spread. Containment efforts have been crippled by instability in the region, and the deadly disease has scattered across the country's highly populated North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which are near the borders with South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, as well as Burundi.

Last month [December 2018], the outbreak reached Butembo, a city with an estimated population of around one million residents near the border of Uganda. And this week, the DRC's Ministry of Health reported a total of 608 cases, including confirmed and probable cases, and 368 deaths in the outbreak.

Those figures make the outbreak the 2nd largest ever recorded since health experts 1st identified Ebola virus in the DRC in 1976. (The top outbreak was the 2014 West African outbreak, which involved more than 28 000 cases and caused 11 000 deaths.)

With the volatility in the DRC, the World Health Organization in September [2018] assessed the risk of national and regional spread of this outbreak to be "very high." But the organization assessed the risk of global spread to be low.

Still, with little handle on the DRC outbreak, authorities and the public are demonstrably nervous about the greater potential for spread. Twitter was abuzz with fears of a pandemic. Authorities in Sweden, meanwhile, had already isolated other patients and medical staff who may have had contact with the patient. (Ebola is only transmitted from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen. It is not transmitted through the air and is not likely to become airborne.)

Amid the panic over the potential international case, Kohler noted that the ill man was beginning to feel better and that his condition has "become calmer and more stable."

[The diagnostic focus is on virus diseases. Although several (Ebola, yellow fever, dengue fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever) have been ruled out by laboratory tests, at least 3 viruses remain on the suspect list: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever viruses, and Seoul hantavirus remain a possibility. The basis on which virus infection is based is not stated, nor whether leptospirosis was eliminated. With the onset of his illness and report for medical attention 3 weeks after he left Burundi, this suggests a long incubation period, making one wonder if he acquired his infection after leaving Africa. An undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever in Uganda turned out to be malaria. - Mod.TY
