INFECTION CONTROL - MICHIGAN, USA
=================================
Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 22:07:09 -0400
From: DANAFZIGER@aol.com

I am one Infection Control person that subscribes to the list.
I trained in Infection Control with Richard Wenzel and Loreen Herwaldt in
Iowa City before assuming my current position at Henry Ford Hospital where I
am the hospital epidemiologist and an infectious disease clinician. I
thought the list might be helpful in providing occaisional early warnings re
outbreaks, but I continue to tune in because I find the detective work
surrounding emerging diseases to be fascinating.
Detroit has long been noted
for its problems with MRSA and this continues. SE Michigan currently is
plagued with roughly 40% vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ if I recall Dr. Bill
Hall of the state health department's figures correctly. We see a smattering
of highly resistant acinetobacter, xanthomonas, serratia and an ever-
increasing number of highly penicillin resistant pneumococci (currently
6-7%).
Thanks for all your hard work on ProMED-mail. [Glad you like us - Mod.JW]
