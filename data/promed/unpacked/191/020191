The popularity of eco-tourism is to blame for a big rise in people
contracting tropical diseases, a London professor warned today [25
Nov 2009]. Peter Chiodini, of University College London Hospital,
said Britons who spend thousands of pounds to stay in lodges on
remote jungle trips are failing to protect themselves against deadly
infections. Professor Chiodini, who works at the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases, revealed that such trips have led to a doubling in
cases of the flesh-eating bug leishmaniasis over the past 10 years.
Gap-year travellers are among those most at risk.

About 12 million people worldwide are affected by the condition,
which can be life-threatening, but until now, cases have been rare
among Britons.

The most common form is the Baghdad boil, where ulcers form on the
skin, but another type known as black fever can attack the organs.
Professor Chiodini, a consultant parasitologist, said travellers
could protect themselves against leishmaniasis by using insect
repellent and ensuring they are properly covered. He added: "People
are going on adventure trips because of eco-tourism. If you're going
to shell out on these holidays, then get immunised or take necessary
medication. It's now possible with a few clicks of the mouse to book
a place which is quite remote yet without being aware of the risks
involved." The hospital is seeing about 32 cases of leishmaniasis a
year, double the amount a decade ago.

A 35-year-old TV presenter was treated for the condition at UCLH. He
needed 2 rounds of toxic drug therapy to kill the bug, which nearly
destroyed half his face after he was infected by a sand-fly bite
filming Extreme Dreams in Peru last year [2008].

The bug was diagnosed after he noticed a small spot on his left
forearm that turned into an open lesion that would not heal. He said:
"A little light bulb went on in my head. I remembered reading about
leishmaniasis, which matched my symptoms. I'd always thought it was
an old wives' tale, a sand-fly bite that eats your flesh."

Professor Chiodini will tonight feature in a programme showcasing the
work of the hospital. Help I Caught It Abroad shows other
increasingly common and near-fatal conditions such as malaria,
skin-burrowing insects, parasitic worms and grapefruit-sized cysts
caused by parasites.

It shows medics treating the 1st case in the Western world of a type
of leishmaniasis that attacks the eyes. The patient was infected
after he was bitten by a sand fly on holiday in Greece.

Doctors at the hospital also warn about malaria. About 2000 people
every year return to Britain infected with the disease, and last year
[2008], there were 5 deaths. An increasing proportion of patients are
infected by drug-resistant malaria.

A man from Ruislip contracted malaria on holiday in Gambia. He did
not take anti-malaria medication. His organs failed, and doctors had
to amputate his lower legs and fingers to save his life.

[It is noteworthy that the number of imported cases to the United
Kingdom has doubled over the last decade. The point made by professor
Chiodini that eco-tourism is part of the explanation is thought
provoking. Leishmaniasis is spreading in Europe and especially in
Italy. It has been established in Northern Italy over the past decade
(Maroli M, Rossi L, Baldelli R, et al. The northward spread of
leishmaniasis in Italy: evidence from retrospective and ongoing
studies on the canine reservoir and phlebotomine vectors. Trop Med
Intl Hlth 2008;13:256-64). Perhaps changing distribution is also part
of the explanation. - Mod. EP]
