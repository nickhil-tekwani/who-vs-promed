Concerning the bird die-off, I have further information from the Director
of Treehouse Wildlife Center in Illinois.
The death toll is now up to 25 000 birds, mostly granivores! However, I am
very concerned about collateral damage to predatory birds and small seed
eating mammals. As I reported yesterday, at least one bird of prey, a
Red-trailed hawk exhibiting neurological signs was taken in for
rehabilitation.
Fish and Game authorities in Springfield have reported to the Director the
farmer that owned the field admitted he had soaked seeds in Furadan and
went out on his four-wheeler and spread them all over the field.

[Discing the treated seed into the ground would eliminate the seed from
being on top of the ground, thereby abolishing continuing poisonings. Such
a move may reduce the farmers yield next spring. Wheat is currently selling
for $2.10 a bushel and the farmers are having a tough time surviving when
they can be wiped out by a flock of birds. A few scarecrows or barking dogs
could have kept the birds out of his field and prevented the death losses.
