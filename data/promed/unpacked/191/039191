Dozens of budgies drop dead during country show
------------------------------------------------
The birds were among hundreds lined up in their cages ready to be
judged at the Gwynedd Budgerigar Society Open Show in North Wales
when disaster struck. One toppled off his perch then others began
"dropping like dominoes", according to the organisers.

Owners fearing a gas leak -- canaries have highly sensitive
respiratory systems and were once used down mines to detect leaks --
grabbed their cages and ran for the door.

Some of the birds, which are worth around GBP 1000 [approx USD 1700]
each -- were revived outside but in total 38 died. "After 5 or 10
minutes as many as 12 had died. I lost one bird myself," organiser
Rob Hughes said. "We saved the majority but what happened was utterly
horrible. It was a freak event. We may never know the exact cause."

Retired pet shop boss Dave Cottrell, 55, lost 10 birds at the event,
at the end of last month [October 2009]. "They were dying by the
second," he said. "The odd thing is, I have asthma but I was unaware
of anything."

Plumbers and gas board officials who were called in found no trace of
a leak, and inspections by the fire brigade and environmental health
officers also proved inconclusive.

A necropsy on 2 casualties revealed they died from congestion and
hemorrhaging of the lungs.

The organisers believe a boiler flue may have become temporarily
blocked by leaves, causing it to emit noxious fumes.

Upset as 38 budgies die at show
-------------------------------
Mystery surrounds the deaths of up to 38 prize budgies during a show
at a church hall. Owners and organisers rushed to get around 350
cages outside after the birds began falling off their perches at Y
Felinheli, Gwynedd.

Show organisers said the dead birds were spread across the hall. A
member of the Parochial Church Council said thorough investigations
had been carried out, and no cause for the deaths had been discovered.

Retired pet shop owner Dave Cottrell, 55, who lost 10 birds at the
show, said: "I was preparing the certificates as the birds were being
put in order when the steward came over and said he had a dead one.
Then another steward came over and said he had 2 or 3 dead. And
within seconds a 3rd steward said he had more dead," he said.

Mr Cottrell, who has 200 birds and been a fancier for 35 years,
thinks a boiler or oven flue could have been temporarily blocked,
forcing out fumes.

Robert Hughes, 34, who organised the annual open show said: "The
birds were spread across the hall. 5 minutes after the 1st one died
11 more had gone, 1 was mine."

Mr Hughes said the decision was taken to remove all the 350 cages
from the hall into the fresh air, which probably saved a lot of other
birds. "Nobody in the community has seen or heard anything like this
before," he added. "It's been bizarre -- and very difficult to get over it."

Len Williams, who is a member of the Parochial Church Council in the
village, said the hall had been closed whilst checks were carried
out. He said that despite carbon monoxide detectors being put near
all the gas heaters, along with the cooker and water heater, nothing
could be found which could have caused the deaths.

"We'd heard it was up to 18 birds which had died, but we were more
concerned about the cause," he said.

Mr Williams said the heating had been off at the time of the show at
the request of the organisers, who did not want it too warm for the birds.

"The hall has now been given the all-clear by health and safety, and
we are taking bookings again," he added.

[This is clearly a case of the most sensitive species used as a
sentinel animal. Canaries were once used in the mines to detect
noxious gases because they were so sensitive, that when they quit
singing or fell dead the miners knew there was unseen gaseous danger
and they needed to get out.

Although it may have been carbon monoxide from the heaters or a
boiler, the exact cause is not clear. If it were carbon monoxide then
the detectors are clearly not as sensitive as the birds.

If it is some other noxious gas then it needs to be located and
corrected. Perhaps that has already happened.

It is indeed sad for the show and especially sad for owners of these
fine birds. But it is fortunate that no humans lost their life. - Mod.TG]
