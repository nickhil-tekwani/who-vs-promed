Wales prepares to declare a bluetongue protection zone
------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination against bluetongue is expected to begin in Wales on 2 Jun
2008, when the Welsh Assembly Government intends to declare a
protection zone in the south east of the country.

The announcement on 23 May 2008 by the Welsh rural affairs minister,
Ms. Elin Jones, followed an announcement the same day from DEFRA that
it planned 2 further extensions to the protection zone in England.
The 1st of these, which took place on 26 May 2008, extended the zone
to cover all of Devon. The 2nd extension is planned for 2 Jun 2008,
subject to the disease situation at that time, when DEFRA intends to
extend the zone to cover Cornwall, the East Riding of Yorkshire, West
Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, the district of Selby in North Yorkshire,
Warwickshire and Gloucestershire.

This latter extension will bring the English protection zone up to
the Welsh border, and will allow the Welsh Assembly Government to
declare the current restricted zone in south-east Wales a protection
zone. Under European law, vaccination against bluetongue can take
place only in a protection zone, and a protection zone can be
designated only if bluetongue is found to be circulating in an area
or if an area borders another protection zone. There are currently no
plans to change the zoning of the rest of Wales. However, the
Assembly Government says that further announcements on the roll-out
of the vaccination programme in Wales will be made subject to
veterinary advice and vaccine availability.

Ms. Jones said: "From Monday, 2 Jun 2008, subject to the delivery of
the vaccine from Intervet and other factors, we expect vaccination
against bluetongue will be able to begin in the current restricted
zone in south-east Wales. Over the past weeks, both the Assembly
Government and industry representatives have urged livestock keepers
to contact their vets and register their interest in the vaccine. If
farmers have not already done so, I would encourage them to do it now.

"The vaccine is the best defence we have against this disease. We
must take full advantage of it and I would urge those in the zone to
vaccinate their livestock."

One million doses of the vaccine against serotype 8 of the bluetongue
virus are expected to be available in the Welsh protection zone to
begin with. Wales has secured 2.5 million doses of the vaccine as
part of DEFRA's initial order of 22.5 million doses, and it is
jointly tendering with DEFRA for 5 million more doses for use in
Wales.

In a further announcement on 23 May 2008, the Welsh Assembly
Government said that, once a bluetongue protection zone had been
declared in Wales, animals from that zone would be able to travel to
the free zone of Wales direct to slaughter. The decision had been
made following a veterinary risk assessment, and the movement to
slaughter would be subject to specific controls through general
licensing. The risk assessment considered that areas that are now
being designated as part of the protection zone came as a result of
extensions of the zones to allow vaccination against the disease, not
as a result of increasing prevalence of the disease. There was no
evidence of a resurgence of the disease in these areas, and
vaccination within them would reduce the number of animals likely to
be infected.

[2] UK vector season and vaccination
Date: Fri 30 May 2008

Midges and vaccine plan put the bite on long-suffering farmers
--------------------------------------------------------------
Around this time of year, midges can be irritating. If you're out for
a country stroll near to dusk on a humid day, they can be
particularly annoying. But for livestock farmers, they have become
persona non grata, Public Enemy Number One. Bluetongue disease,
carried by the midges, is the latest in a long line of viruses and
scares that have blighted the agricultural industry for close to 20
years.

Bluetongue is bad news for farmers because although it is
non-contagious, it is disrupting the way they market their stock and
has had a knock-on effect for the livestock mart operators and the
future of their businesses, although livestock prices for sheep and
cattle are largely going well at present.

The main problem lies with what is now referred to in some quarters
as the "thin blue line." This is the border which DEFRA places
between an area classed as within the surveillance (restrictive) zone
and those outside. Unfortunately, a midge will not be aware of them
when it is flying around. [For the "thin blue line" of the Protection
Zone, as updated 26 May 2008, see map at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/index.htm>.
- Mod.AS]

There have been no cases of Bluetongue in Yorkshire. Yet nearly all
the county is now within the surveillance zone -- the area which is
now generally referred to as "dirty" as opposed to the area above the
line which is now referred to as "clean."

When the restrictive zone was 1st put into place, the thin blue line
made life very difficult for the likes of Wharfedale Mart, in Otley,
and York Livestock Centre, who found that their trade was immediately
reduced through no fault of their own.

Ian Smith, auctioneer at Wharfedale Mart, says: "Bridge End, in
Otley, was effectively our border, so it meant that we couldn't sell
into North Yorkshire at all. With us being where we are, a huge
number of the farmers we serve could not be looked after as we would
do normally."

When a case of Bluetongue was detected in Lincolnshire earlier this
year [2008], the thin blue line was then moved further north, which
took Otley and York out of the picture. But it simply transferred the
problem to the likes of Leyburn and Darlington.

Charmaine Fletcher is the company secretary of Leyburn Mart, which
serves Yorkshire's Upper Dales farmers as well as lower-lying farms
to its south and east and large areas of County Durham. It is usually
an interesting mix but one that has been hit hard. Charmaine says:
"The boundary of the surveillance area finishes at Jervaulx and we
have a lot of customers from down that side, particularly with calves
and store stock. The result for us has been that we have sold only
one-third of the calves we did last year. Store cattle are down by
one-third too, and we were very quiet with hoggs (sheep) early on in
the season.

"It seems to me that you're okay if you're a mart that's either well
in, or well out, of a particular zone. But being on a border is not
good. Marts don't make a lot of money. We work off a commission and
the shareholders are the farmers themselves, so we'll keep going, but
March, April and May returns have eaten into our profit.

"You try to put a bit by for eventualities but there is a fine line
between making money and not making money. Long term, if the position
remains the same, we probably couldn't carry on in the same way as we
are now. But we're hoping that summer will bring about changes to the
areas, particularly with vaccinations taking place."

During the coming months, all UK livestock is being vaccinated
against Bluetongue. The process started a couple of weeks ago in the
south-west of England, but it is not compulsory -- something that has
caused concern among farmers and auctioneers.

Tony Thompson, of Thirsk Mart, is sceptical. "They're talking about
it being voluntary, but if it is, then as far as I'm concerned they
may as well not bother. It should be made compulsory and monitored
properly. I know that means more paperwork but in the long run, it
will be to the farmers' advantage."

Ian Smith is gearing up for another possible poor time in the coming
weeks as the vaccine arrives in West Yorkshire. "We've been gradually
building back up since the zone moved north, but this coming week
sees the vaccination programme due to start in both the East Riding
and West Yorkshire and that could have potential problems for us for
a while."

While he is of a similar opinion to Tony Thompson on the subject of
voluntary or compulsory vaccination, Ian reports that farmers in his
area are right behind the programme. "I think everyone sees it as a
must-do. All we want to do is get on with looking after our farmer
customers properly again."

[The concerns of the Welsh authorities which have led them to declare
now South East Wales as a Protection Zone, allowing preventive
vaccination against the threatening BTV-8, are supported by the fact
that the culicoides vector season is about to commence. As
illuminated by the French notification of 2 May 2008 (item [3]
above), the vector season seems to have already started in the
continent. Wales maintains a large, dense, highly susceptible sheep
population. The density of sheep in Wales exceeds 240 per sq/km --
significantly higher than the density prevailing in the BTV-8
affected area in South-Eastern England. Out of the total of about 34
million sheep in the UK, more than 9 million are located in Wales.
There is also a considerable, though much smaller, cattle population
in Wales; cattle, as we know, are also susceptible to BTV-8.

The following 2006 figures are derived from Farming Facts and
Figures, published in 2007 by the Welsh Assembly Government.
<http://new.wales.gov.uk/docrepos/40382/40382313/statistics/agriculture/agric-2007/farming-facts07-e2.pdf?lang=en>
a. Cattle
Dairy sector
Dairy cows: 281 000
Number of holdings with dairy cows: 3368
Average size of herd: 83
Beef sector
Beef cows: 223 600
Number of holdings with beef cows: 8478
Average size of herd: 26

b. Sheep sector
Total sheep and lambs: 9 350 700
Number of holdings: 15 271
Average size of flock: 612
Total breeding flock: 4 700 800
All other sheep 1 year old and over: 257 100
Lambs under 1 year: 4 392 800

Since the sheep grazing system in Wales includes a typical element of
seasonal translocation, when flocks move during the summer months to
pastures on higher altitudes where they are less accessible for
treatments, it seems desirable to vaccinate them before the movement.
