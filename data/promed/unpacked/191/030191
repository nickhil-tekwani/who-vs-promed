Measures taken by Estonian authorities following a _Listeria_ outbreak have improved the fish control system, according to the European Commission. A remote DG Sante audit, in October 2020, looked at checks to ensure smoked fish meets microbiological food safety criteria, as well as measures taken by authorities in non-compliances.

Eight Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) reports for _Listeria monocytogenes_ in smoked fishery products from Estonia have been issued since 2015. All but one concerned the same establishment.

A multi-country outbreak of 22 listeriosis cases linked to cold-smoked salmon and trout pointed toward MV Wool, an Estonian processing company as the manufacturer of these fish products. This was based on traceability information and a match between the outbreak strain and samples on the processing line and in 4 batches of the final product. 5 countries were affected from 2014 to 2019 and 5 people died.

DG Sante found measures put in place by authorities following this outbreak strengthened the official control system, with some areas still being addressed during the audit. The use of whole genome sequencing gave the authority additional tools to verify food firm controls and deal effectively with alerts.

At the time of alerts in 2018, authorities focused on ensuring that smoked fish in the RASFF notifications was traced and recalled from the market but some delays in action taken at the regional level were noted.

Results of whole genome sequencing in 2019 indicated the persistence of a _Listeria_ strain in the premises of the company linked to the RASFF alerts for several years.

During controls in 2019, authorities noted the hot smoking treatment was not sufficient to address the _Listeria_ hazard. They started to take environmental samples and detected _Listeria_ after cleaning and disinfection. Shelf-life studies also didn't take into consideration reasonable foreseeable storage and distribution conditions. The company voluntarily suspended activity and took steps to address the issues.

Auditors said several steps had been taken to follow up on the 2019 outbreak at the establishment level, but also to strengthen the official control system and support companies to prevent similar incidents.

These include guidance for dealing with _Listeria_ non-compliance and assessing shelf-life studies, training, increasing product, and environmental sampling, and a recommendation for sites that process fish to do random environmental sampling.

Official controls over fishing vessels, landing sites, and transport are carried out by the Environmental Inspectorate (EI) of the Ministry of Environment, which does not have enforcement powers. EI inspectors draw up an assessment form and send it to the regional VFB (Veterinary and Food Board) or county inspector.

The Veterinary and Food Board (VFB) had not verified the effectiveness of EI controls since 2017. In 2021, VFB and the Agricultural Board merged into the Agricultural and Food Board.

"The limited VFB verification of EI controls and of the VFB controls following the multi-country _Listeria_ outbreak undermines the ability of the system to ensure consistency and effectiveness of these controls," said auditors. Estonian officials said internal audits are planned in 2023 to assess EI checks and official controls in fishery establishments.

In 2019, 277 unscheduled environmental samples were taken during official control related to the outbreak. In 2020, environmental samples to detect _Listeria_ were part of the official control plan.

During the audit, Estonia was dealing with a RASFF report for _Listeria_ in smoked fish produced by another company. The DG Sante team noted that officials were using the experience gained in dealing with the multi-country outbreak to handle the incident.

[The news report above concerns a multinational European _Listeria_ outbreak associated with contaminated smoked salmon produced by a processing facility in Estonia. In June 2019, there were a total of 22 cases since 2014: Denmark had 9 cases, Estonia 6, Finland 2, France 1, and Sweden 4. In September 2019, a total of 26 people across Europe were affected, 6 of whom have died -- among them 9 people in Estonia, 2 of whom have died.

The outbreak _Listeria_ strain, ST1247 clonal complex 8, had been found both in the plant's production building, as well as from affected people. The strain was also detected at wholesale and retail stores in France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden from cold smoked or graved salmon and from 6 batches of cold smoked trout products. Raw fish had been received from suppliers in Norway and Finland.

_L. monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past listeriosis outbreaks, _Listeria_ contamination of food products occurred in parts of equipment "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled." (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/). Even if the equipment used in food processing only adds a few organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated ready-to-eat food, such as smoked fish or delicatessen meats, because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient size to cause disease.

Contaminated countertops and equipment may spread the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ to any food product prepared by the same equipment or on the same countertops. At present, the US CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria_ in which a variety of deli meats and cheeses purchased at delis in multiple states have been contaminated by the same outbreak strain of _Listeria_. The food product that initially introduced the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ into delis in multiple states is still unknown (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA (08): fatal, ready-to-eat deli meats and cheeses, 2021-22, RFI 20221111.8706690). - Mod.ML
