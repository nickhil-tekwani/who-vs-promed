Chester Zoo is mourning the death of its 2nd young elephant in a month after a 3-year-old male failed to recover from the same deadly virus responsible for killing another member of the herd.

Asian elephant Nayan Hi Way had been receiving veterinary treatment after being taken ill a few days ago. Although he had appeared to be making a recovery, his health took a turn for the worse yesterday [29 Jul 2013] morning, and he died a short time later. It follows the death of 2-year-old female elephant Jamilah, who died at the zoo on 3 Jul 2013.

A post-mortem examination will now be carried out to determine the cause of Nayan's death. He will be tested for an illness called elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), which caused the death of Jamilah. Chester Zoo was the 1st in the UK to successfully breed Asian elephants in captivity when Jubilee was born in 1977.

Dr Pilgrim, who chairs the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums Elephant Welfare Group, said: "Although it is too early to be sure of the cause of Nayan's death, EEHV hits elephants both in the wild and in zoos. This year [2013], there have been a number of reported cases of EEHV in elephants in America and in Europe, and currently there is no cure or vaccination. It is important to note that this virus does not discriminate between zoo elephants and elephants in the wild. It affects them all, and we will continue to support the research into this in the hope that one day a vaccine can be found to help the endangered Asian elephant."

There are various strains of EEHV, which have affected mostly young elephants throughout Europe and America. Supported by the zoo, the research team recently discovered the genetic maps for 2 strains of EEHV.

The rest of the elephant herd at Chester Zoo remains in good health and can be seen out in the paddock as normal.
