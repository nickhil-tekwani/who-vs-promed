Detection of an exotic virus from among more than 3800 pigs killed by swine fever in pig farms of Mizoram state since March [2013] has led the Centre [Central Government of India] to summon state officials to New Delhi for an emergency meeting on Tuesday [25 Jun 2013].

Dr Amarjit Singh Nanda, Animal Husbandry Commissioner in Department of Animal Husbandry Dairying & Fisheries (DADF) at Krishi Bhavan in Delhi will chair the meeting to chart out a strategy to contain and eliminate the exotic virus found across the border in Myanmar.

The virus causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), also known as blue-ear pig disease. It leads to failed pregnancies and respiratory illnesses in younger pigs. The illness was 1st reported in the US in the 1980s and led to a mass epidemic in China about 5 years ago [around 2008].

"This virus is found across the border in Myanmar but has never been reported in India. Though it is neither a very deadly disease nor a very fast spreading disease, it causes huge economic loss with failed pregnancies and respiratory illnesses," said a senior DADF officer at Delhi.

When the illness surfaced about 3 months back [March 2013], vets 1st thought it was swine flu and vaccinated hundreds of pigs. About half of them survived, but the detection of PRRS has alarmed vets. The virus does not die and remains active in cured pigs, creating a risk of more pigs getting infected.

The government has imposed an indefinite ban on pig imports from Myanmar. Pork is one of the most common meats consumed in Mizoram, and more than 164 piggery-based cooperative societies spread across the state currently coordinate pig farming under a government program started in 1989.

[An official "immediate notification" of the described PRRS outbreak has been submitted by the Indian Veterinary Services to the OIE on Wed 26 Jun 2013. The affected farm is located at Aizawal, Selesih, Aizawal, Mizoram state. Out of 305 "susceptible" swine, 57 were clinically affected and 10 reportedly died. According to the report, the date of the start of the event was 18 Mar 2013, while the date of pre-confirmation of the event was 19 Jun 2013. The delayed confirmation (and notification) and the discrepancy with case numbers as given in the media report can be explained by the contents of the following epidemiological comment which was included in the OIE report: "The outbreak was confirmed initially as classical swine fever. Samples were sent to the laboratory. The presence of PRRS virus was also diagnosed."

The following note, by the OIE Animal Health Information Department, was added: "Since this is the 1st time that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a zone."
