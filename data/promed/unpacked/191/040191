At least 48 persons have lost their lives in Japanese encephalitis (JE) and other such acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) out of 331 cases across Assam this year [2020], the National Health Mission (NHM) said on Wednesday [22 Jul 2020]. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) held a video conference with all districts to review the status of AES and JE in Assam, a joint statement by the health department and the NHM's state unit said.

"The state currently has 331 AES cases and 48 deaths, which includes 148 non-JE cases, 24 non-JE deaths, and 183 JE cases, 24 JE deaths," it added.

The video conference was chaired by Health and Family Welfare Commissioner and Secretary Monalisa Goswami in the presence of NHM Mission Director Lakshmanan S and other officials.

Goswami reviewed the status of the diseases in the state and instructed all concerned to ensure that the laboratories are functional and replace the Elisa Reader and Washer (equipment for testing), wherever needed.

Goswami directed her department officials to closely monitor the activities and follow up on the treatment with the JE patients.

"The monitoring and supervision need to be strengthened, and IEC/awareness activities, too, should be rigorously done at all the districts; special focus should also be given at the tea garden areas in Assam," the statement said.

Goswami further instructed all officials concerned to regularly conduct field visits to ensure that the District Task Force meetings are conducted in close coordination with various departments for a better management of AES and JE in the northeastern state.

"The VC concluded with the final remarks of the commissioner and secretary, instructing all concerned officials to work in cohesion with the different departments for better management of AES/JE in state," the statement said.

She also directed to ensure availability and earmarking of JE beds in all district hospitals and medical colleges to treat the patients of the mosquito-borne diseases, the statement said.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases are increasing again this year (2020) in Assam state from 174 cases and 23 deaths reported on 9 Jul 2020 to 331 cases and 48 deaths as of 22 Jul 2020. Of these cases, 183 mentioned above are classified as JE, and 148 are AES cases.

As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the AES etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is well underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 3-4 months.

Although mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY
