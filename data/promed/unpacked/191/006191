FDA approves Lyme disease vaccine
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against
Lyme disease on Monday. The vaccine, SmithKline Beecham's LYMErix, contains
a genetically engineered protein from the surface of _Borrelia burgdorferi_
bacteria, which causes Lyme disease. This protein, called OspA, stimulates
the immune system to produce antibodies "that appear to disable the
bacteriums' ability to infect the individual," according to an FDA
statement.
The vaccine is approved for use in people between the ages of 15 and 70,
and is given in three doses over a one-year period.
FDA Commissioner Dr. Jane E. Henney said that while the vaccine may be a
good option for people who spend a lot of time outdoors where the ticks
that spread Lyme disease are common, she also warned that the vaccine "is
not 100% effective, so other precautions should be taken. These precautions
include the traditional methods of protecting against the infection, such
as wearing protective clothing, using tick repellent, and removing attached
ticks.
The approval follows FDA review of a study of the vaccine in almost 11,000
people living in the northeast US and Wisconsin, where Lyme disease is
common. After two doses of the vaccine in the first year of the trial, the
protection rate against definitive Lyme disease was 50%, and in the second
year, after three doses, it was 78%. Safety and efficacy were shown when
the vaccine doses were given between January and April, shortly before the
peak tick season in the northeast US. But FDA officials also note that it
is not known how long protection against Lyme disease lasts after
vaccination, and that safety data on the use of the vaccine in pregnancy or
in patients with chronic joint and neurological disease is "limited."
Side effects of the vaccine include redness, soreness and swelling at the
injection site, and sometimes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Michael Caldwell, a principle investigator on the Lyme vaccine trials
and Commissioner of Health for Dutchess County, New York, said that the
most recent studies that he has conducted indicate that the same efficacy
can be achieved when the vaccine is administered over a 3-month period. "We
hope the FDA gets that information rapidly and will change the labeling,"
he commented. "That way, we can get the full vaccine in before the next
tick season, which begins here in May."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that since Lyme
disease tracking in the US began in 1982, over 99,000 cases have been
reported, mostly from the northeast, upper mid -west, and Pacific coastal
states.
