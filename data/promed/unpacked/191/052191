Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, has spread to a 4th Colorado county. A person living in Erie, in Weld County, was diagnosed with tularemia last week. Weld County health officials said the resident was hospitalized with a high fever, loss of appetite, and acute diarrhea and is now recovering at home.

Officials said a field mouse in northwest Johnstown and a rabbit southeast of Berthoud have also tested positive for tularemia.

"We are seeing more than 3 times the usual number of human tularemia cases along the Front Range this year [2014], so the public really needs to be cautious about not getting exposed to this disease," said Cheryl Darnell, Lab Manager for the Weld County Health Department.

In July 2014, 2 residents in Broomfield and Larimer counties tested positive for the disease. The Larimer County resident became sick while mowing a property near Windsor. Broomfield officials said it was likely the resident there was infected after coming in contact with dead rabbits that had been found in the person's yard.

In August 2014, a boy, from Longmont, was diagnosed with tularemia. He was the 1st Boulder County resident to test positive for the disease since 2007, according to Boulder County officials.

Symptoms of tularemia include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea, or pneumonia. Symptoms can also include abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, difficulty breathing, bloody sputum and respiratory failure. Tularemia is treatable when detected in early stages.

[The form of tularemia that occurred in this case is not clear, since diarrhea per se is not a specific symptom of _Francisella tularensis_ infection in humans. In the absence of cutaneous ulcers, lymphadenitis, conjunctivitis or respiratory symptoms, it is most likely that he had the septicemic or "typhoidal" form. Diarrhea, of course, can be a non-specific manifestation of bacterial sepsis, as is well recognized in pneumococcal post-splenectomy sepsis and falciparum malaria.

A case report of tularemic pneumonia with diarrhea as a prominent manifestation can be found with its abstract below:

Ernst M, Pilo P, Fleisch F, Glisenti P: Tularemia in the Southeastern Swiss Alps at 1,700 m above sea level. Infection. 21 Aug 2014. [Epub ahead of print]

"A 37-year-old man presented with a 4-day history of nonbloody diarrhea, fever, chills, productive cough, vomiting, and more recent sore throat. He worked for the municipality in a village in the Swiss Alps near St. Moritz. Examination showed fever (40 C), hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation (90 percent at room air), and bibasilar crackles and wheezing. Chest radiography and computed tomography scan showed an infiltrate in the left upper lung lobe. He responded to empiric therapy with imipenem for 5 days. After the imipenem was stopped, the bacteriology laboratory reported that 2/2 blood cultures showed growth of _Francisella tularensis_. He had recurrence of fever and diarrhea. He was treated with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily, oral, for 14 days) and symptoms resolved. Further testing confirmed that the isolate was _F. tularensis_ (subspecies holarctica) belonging to the subclade B.FTNF002-00 (Western European cluster). This case may alert physicians that tularemia may occur in high-altitude regions such as the Swiss Alps."
