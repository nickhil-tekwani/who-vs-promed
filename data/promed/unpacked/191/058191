Panama warns of possible malaria epidemic
--------------------------------------
Panamanian health officials on Friday sounded the alert on a possible
malaria epidemic along the border with Colombia and Costa Rica, after 20
cases of the disease were reported in the first week of December
[unspecified whether _P. falciparum_ or _P. vivax_.

A Panamanian Health Ministry spokesman told EFE Friday that 886 cases of
malaria have been reported so far this year - most of them in the border
provinces - compared to 854 in 1999 [indicating a stable situation until
now at least. During the week of 3-9 Dec 2000, 20 cases of malaria were
reported, mostly in the provinces of Bocas del Toro, on the Costa Rican
border, and San Blas, on the Colombian border, the spokesman said. Seven of
these cases were "imported" from Colombia and another 2 from India and
Honduras, the spokesman noted, adding that officials have told area
residents to limit conditions that may foster the breeding of
disease-carrying mosquitoes.

[It is difficult to determine if the 20 cases reported during the first
week of December represents a significant increase in reporting for the
year, but such a high number of cases in a single week is a warning that
transmission may be increasing. It is particularly serious if the cases are
_P. falciparum_ which is not apparent from the information present in this
article.
The increase in total numbers of reported cases from 1999 represents a 3.7%
increase for the year, which is hardly significant, but it may not be
meaningful to compare the number with the annual numbers if the present
situation applies only to a few provinces in recent weeks.
According to the PAHO Provisional agenda document for the 42nd Directing
Council meeting prepared in August 2000,
(<http://www.paho.org/English/GOV/CD/cd42_16-e.pdf>) there were 936 cases
of malaria reported in Panama for 1999 of which 40 were
either pure _P. falciparum_ or mixed with _P. falciparum_. Of interest is
that 672 of the reported cases (72 percent) were from active surveillance
efforts through epidemiologic investigations and follow-ups. ProMED-mail
would appreciate more information on this alert from reliable sources in
Panama. - Mod.MPP
