Viral Encephalitis Confirmed In Monroe Area of Louisiana
--------------------------------------------------------
State health officials have confirmed that 2 Monroe-area residents have been
hospitalized with viral encephalitis. Doctors suspect that 4 other people
who are hospitalized also may have the disease. Health officials say that
blood tests are being conducted to determine exactly what kind of viral
encephalitis is involved. Officials say that the encephalitis could be
caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus or West Nile virus. All of the cases
developed in the past week, health officials say.
The potentially deadly disease is carried by mosquitoes. Ouachita Parish is
stepping up its spraying in response to the outbreak. Health officials are
urging people to take precautions when going outdoors. They suggest keeping
arms and legs covered and using an insect repellent.

[Clusters of viral encephalitis (Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine
encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and La Crosse encephalitis) in humans
are unusual in Louisiana. So far Florida and New York are the only states
reporting West Nile virus infection in human patients. The precise diagnosis
in this out break is awaited with more than usual interest. - Mods.CP/MHJ]
