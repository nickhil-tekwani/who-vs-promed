It was only 1st officially identified in 2017, but the Asian longhorned tick has since been confirmed in 17 states across the US, according to the latest report from the CDC. This is of special concern to cattle producers because the tick carries a disease commonly called "Ikeda" that can be fatal.

According to the CDC, the tick has been found in the following states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The CDC asked that those finding these ticks save the removed pests in rubbing alcohol in a jar or a reclosable bag and contact their state agriculture department or local Extension office. The ticks have been found on pets, livestock, wildlife, and people.

Elanco Animal Health veterinarian and senior technical consultant Thach Winslow wrote in a recent report that Ikeda (_Theileria orientalis_) is a protozoal disease attacking red blood cells. To date, he noted, there is no approved treatment for the disease in cattle, nor is there an effective vaccine. Producers in Australia and New Zealand have been fighting Ikeda for at least 2 decades.

Winslow explained that Ikeda is primarily transmitted through the saliva of feeding ticks, but blood transferred through shared needles or other devices can also spread the disease. Incubation period is one to 3 weeks, with 80% of a herd infected within just 30 days. Death loss, however, is below 5%, reported the consultant.

Winslow noted Asian longhorned ticks are small, like a deer tick, which makes them hard to spot on cattle. They tend to be found on the head, ears, under the tail, axilla, and flanks. The tick can survive off the animal for up to 6 months. It is tolerant to cold, but does not survive well in hot, dry climates. Cattle are the predominant host species and, once infected, are lifelong carriers of Ikeda.

Winslow wrote once it is found, it is nearly impossible to eradicate Ikeda. He said producers need to focus on biosecurity and tick control measures, adding there is a blood test for _Theileria orientalis_.

"A tick control program consists of 2 target control points: the environment and the animal," Winslow said. "Environmental control is challenging and consists of brush and vegetation management through limiting access and controlled burning. Producers should consider cutting down pastures, trimming brush, and fencing off heavily wooded areas. In some cases, spot spraying can be implemented.

"On-animal treatment is often the most practical and effective," he added. "Total wet down with high-pressure spraying; spray boxes or dipping vats are preferred but require facilities and equipment specific for implementation. Back rubbers and oilers are more convenient and are most effective with forced daily usage by setting them up across access points to water or mineral. Insecticide ear tags will help control ticks in the ears and around the head but will have minimal impact on the rest of the body compared to other methods."

Lastly, Winslow noted if injectable or pour-on macrocyclic lactone dewormers are used to treat cattle for internal parasites, there can be the added benefit of some tick control.

[In December 2021, a notice from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) discussed this tick and its spread across the USA. The tick is invasive and, if transported on cattle or other animals, it is happy to take up a new residence and continue invading the area and causing devastating consequences on our animals.

Unfortunately, since the announcement almost a year ago, there does not seem to be much progress on controlling this pest or treating the disease it causes. There does not appear to be any research at the federal level occurring. Hopefully some pharmaceutical and agricultural companies have heard the plaintive cry of producers and are researching how to control this pest.

As the December 2021 notice from APHIS noted, this tick is not picky about where its blood meal comes from, as dogs, cats, cows, humans, deer, sheep, goats, chickens, and a host of others have suffered because of this tiny pest. As you may recall, ticks can and do transmit a variety of diseases, and in some animals it takes but a few of these bloodthirsty devils to cause anemia and death in short order.

We anxiously await help from our pest control and pharmaceutical associates in protecting our animals.

The December 2021 USDA APHIS pest alert (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/alert-asian-longhorned-tick.508.pdf) states, "ALHT has been found feeding on a number of hosts, including sheep, goats, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, chickens, black bears, foxes (red and grey), coyotes, groundhogs, striped skunks, white-tailed deer, elk, opossums, raccoons, Canada geese, barred owls, great horned owls, brown boobies, _Peromyscus_ mice, and red-tailed hawks. The tick has also been found on people." - Mod.TG
