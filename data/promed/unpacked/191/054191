Hanafiah stated on Friday (30 Jan 2009) that results of samples of
blood, nasal and throat fluids from a suspected bird flu patient had
tested negative. Subsequently the patient was allowed to return home.

During the patient's stay in hospital her clinical condition
improved. Her initially low leucocyte counts and her low body
temperature returned to normal.

The patient was initially considered to be a suspected bird flu

respiratory tract inflammation and bronchial pneumonia. There was no
indication of bird flu infection. All test results from the
laboratory of Balitbangkes Department of Health were negative for
avian influenza virus infection.
