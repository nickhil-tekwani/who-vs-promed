Cholera and AWD Outbreaks in Eastern and Southern Africa, Regional Update for 2018 - as of 31 Dec 2018
-------------------------------
Cholera continues to represent a major public health concern in Eastern and Southern Africa Region (ESAR). From January to December 2018, approximately 37 565 cases and 443 cholera-related deaths were reported in the region with an average CFR of 1.2%. These cases emerged from 10 out of the 21 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa Region (ESAR).

In 2018, the cholera burden in ESAR was markedly heterogeneous, with Zimbabwe accounting for the highest case load at 28.8% (10 807 cases), followed by Somalia reporting 17.2% of cases (6447 cases). During the same period, Kenya reported 15.4% (5782) of cases, Tanzania reported 4688 cases, Zambia declared 4127 cases, Uganda recorded 2699 cases, Angola reported 1262 cases, Mozambique declared 863 cholera cases, Malawi registered 785 cases, Rwanda 3 cases and recently Burundi declared 102 cases.

Out of the 10 countries with reported cholera/AWD outbreaks in 2018, 5 (Burundi, Zimbabwe, Angola, Somalia and Tanzania) have ongoing cholera outbreaks.

Burundi: A new cholera outbreak emerging from Rumonge Health Province in Rumonge District was declared on 28 Dec 2018. This is attributed to heavy rains that have led to flooding in the coastal areas of Lake Tanganyika. The outbreak continues to evolve with a cumulative total of 102 cases including 1 death (CFR, 1%) notified by 31 Dec 2018.

Somalia: 30 new cases of AWD/cholera were reported in week 52 (week ending 31 Dec 2018) compared to 26 cases reported in week 51 (week ending 23 Dec 2018). Cumulatively a total of 6852 cases including 45 deaths have been reported since December 2017 from 5 regions (Banadir, Lower Jubba, Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle and Hiraan). The cholera outbreak has been contained in 4 regions, however active transmission is still ongoing in the Banadir region where 30 new cases were reported in week 52. Children under 5 years bear the brunt of the cholera epidemic, representing 54.5% (3512 cases) of the total case load reported in 2018 (Epidemiological week 1 to 52).

Angola: Since the onset of the latest wave of cholera outbreaks in September 2018, a total of 312 cases including 3 deaths (CFR, 1%) were reported by epidemiological week 52. During week 52, 20 new cases were reported from Uige province compared to 10 cases reported in week 51.

Tanzania: A new district (Uvinza district in Kigoma region) reported 13 cases of cholera in Week 52. Cumulatively, a total of 33 319 cases including 550 deaths have been reported in the United Republic of Tanzania since August 2015.

Zimbabwe: The weekly case incidence has been on a downward trend in the past 3 weeks (week 50 to week 52). During week 52, 10 new cases were reported compared to 17 cases including 5 deaths (CFR, 29.4%) reported in week 51. These new cases emerged from Murehwa district in Mashonaland East (2 cases), Gokwe North district in Midlands (7 cases) and Mt. Darwin district in Mashonaland Central (1 case). Cumulatively, a total of 10 630 cases including 65 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the new wave of the outbreak on 5 Sep 2018.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Narok County)
Date: Wed 9 Jan 2019

https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001308882/two-die-17-admitted-in-suspected-cholera-outbreak-in-narok


Narok County Health Executive Vivian Mpeti said that the health officials at the facility received 19 patients who were exhibiting diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms.

"On 6 Jan this year [2019], we received the patients apparently from one village in Naroosura ward. Upon arrival, one man succumbed while another one died while receiving treatment of the same ailment at a private hospital," said Ms Mpeti.

The County Health officials said the disease surveillance team has already taken 4 samples, and results pointed at cholera, but the same blood samples have been taken to the government chemist for further verification.

So far, she said 9 of the patients were in stable condition while 8 others were in dire need of medical attention and were being handled at the facility.

Ms Mpeti said the response team comprising public health and nurses has been dispatched to the affected village to investigate the source and quality of water as well as the food being consumed by the affected villagers for further action.

"We want to find out whether the cause of the outbreak is as a result of contaminated water or food poisoning. Once we [clarify] the situation on the ground, we shall take the appropriate action," said Ms Mpeti.

She also said that the patients have already been isolated, since the disease is highly contagious and a fast killer.

The county official also speculated that the diarrheal disease outbreak could also be linked with the ongoing heavy downpour being experienced in several parts of the county.

It is not the 1st time cholera cases have been reported in the county. In 2017, cholera fears gripped Narok Boys High school after over 40 students were treated for diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms associated with the disease.

The students, according to the institution's administration began experiencing stomachache before vomiting and diarrhea, forcing the institution to call local medics. The institution's Principal, Isaac Sereti, told the press at the school that some students went to his office complaining of stomach upsets, and later the number grew.

The Health CEC has urged the county residents to observe high standards of hygiene by ensuring that they wash their hands after visiting latrines and boiling water for drinking and cooking to combat the disease.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Midlands Province)
Date: Wed 9 Jan 2019

https://news.pindula.co.zw/2019/01/09/2-people-die-26-affected-as-cholera-outbreak-hit-mberengwa-district/


Mberengwa district in the Midlands province is currently experiencing a cholera outbreak which has proven difficult to contain. The outbreak started over the festive period. Reports indicate that the outbreak has been compounded by an acute shortage of health workers in the district. One village worker is serving a population of about 10 000 people.

While speaking to The Southern Eye, Midlands provincial medical director Simon Nyadundu said: "Firstly, we need to acknowledge that countrywide, there is a low village health worker ratio in rural areas. So Mberengwa, and in particular Chomubobo community, where the current cholera outbreak is existent, happens to be one of those areas where we have inadequate village health workers. We only have one for that area, but we are pushing to beef up the numbers. The latest figures I have indicate that we now have 26 cumulative cases of cholera in Mberengwa. Only 2 people have died, and that figure has not risen since the onset of the outbreak. The patients that tested positive to cholera were treated and discharged."

Due to increasing numbers of cholera cases in Baladhiamala village in Junagarh block of Kalahandi district, local residents are in a state of panic. According to sources, more than 15 residents of Badhiamal village have been admitted to Junagarh hospital after they complained of diarrhea and dehydration. Meanwhile, one of the patients has been shifted to Bhawanipatna hospital after his condition deteriorated, added sources.

While all the affected persons are undergoing treatment now, doctors have reported that the condition of the patients is stable.

Local residents alleged that the disease has spread in the region due to consumption of contaminated water. On the other hand, Odisha Health Department and Public Health Department have said that they have taken several measures to stop the disease from spreading. Meanwhile, a combined probe has also been initiated into the matter.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
