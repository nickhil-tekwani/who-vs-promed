----------------------------------------------------------------------
The term "prevalence" (point prevalence) is a standard epidemiological term that is not at all controversial within either the elephant or the epidemiological communities. There is a detailed paper on the actual point prevalence and incidence of [tuberculosis in] elephants in the United States (Feldman et al 2013, Point prevalence and incidence of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex in captive elephants in the United States of America. Veterinary Quarterly. 33(1): 25-29; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3631271/), which calculated annual prevalence by dividing the number of living MTB [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_]-culture positive elephants by the total number of living elephants at the same points in time. This paper reports a median annual point prevalence of 0 percent within the African elephant population from 1997 to 2011 and a median annual point prevalence of 5.1 percent for Asian elephants within the same time period.

What the previous post refers to as "lifetime prevalence" is actually the "period prevalence" (between 1997 to 2011) and is probably better expressed as approximation of cumulative incidence. These calculations are not straightforward in an elephant population that is constantly changing with time. The "lifetime prevalence" calculation in the previous post was calculated by taking the total number of elephants of both species, living and dead, ever diagnosed with MTB and dividing that number by an estimation of elephants in the currently living population. Using a positive culture to define the numerator, dead elephants discovered only at necropsy can be counted as incident cases, but not as prevalent cases in the living population after their death.

The post's "lifetime prevalence" calculation also does not account for the important changes that occur in the denominator elephant population over the time period of interest, and therefore presents an inflated estimate of prevalence in a population that is decreasing in size over the same time period while the numerator consistently increases. The proper calculation of the "cumulative incidence" would require tabulation of all mortality, including tuberculosis deaths and survival analysis of the resulting data set during a defined time period.

Epidemiological calculations should be calculated similarly regardless of species or disease as a common language for One Health. Clearly stating the methodologies helps clarify population parameters and prevent unnecessary controversies where none need exist.

It is important that we not unnecessarily stigmatize elephants in human care as being sources of zoonotic disease by overestimating prevalence. In fact, there are no well-documented cases of elephants transmitting tuberculosis to humans, and only a few cases of humans -- all of whom were elephant facility staff, and not members of the general public -- seroconverting in the presence of MTB-culture positive elephants. At a time when the very future of elephants on this planet is in doubt, care needs to be taken that professionals focus on using established methods, definitions and criteria to address critical management needs and to document the validity of new methods.
