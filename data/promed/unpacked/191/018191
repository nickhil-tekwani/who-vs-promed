TVMDL has rendered their ruling: "Negative for anthrax."

[So, regarding the Axis buck Wylie saw on 18 Jul 2006 on a ranch some
30 miles north of Leakey, Real County, which was field tested
positive, the diagnosis has not been confirmed. The ranch owner has
been instructed to look out for any other deaths and to promptly call
Wylie should he see any. - Mod.MHJ]

It's the same song, yet another verse, for naturally-occurring
anthrax cases in livestock and wildlife in Val Verde and Crockett
Counties in Southwest Texas. A little rain, a lot of hot weather, and
the invisible, spore-forming bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ has
resurfaced, putting unvaccinated livestock and grazing wildlife at
risk in the area.
"Anthrax has been confirmed in a pen of deer in Val Verde County and
in a Charolais bull in Crockett County. We know that anthrax often
goes under-reported, as we hear of anecdotal reports of livestock or
deer losses without laboratory confirmation. Many ranchers forego the
veterinary inspection and laboratory tests and instead just begin
vaccinating," reported Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas state veterinarian and
head of the Texas Animal Health Commission. "Anthrax cases are not
unusual, but a laboratory confirmation should alert ranchers and
livestock owners that it is time to vaccinate their animals in Val
Verde, Crockett and surrounding counties."

[Earlier today, I spoke with the State Region 6 veterinarian, Dr.
Thurman Francher, who told me that the affected ranch was quarantined
on 21 Jun 2006 and that there had been no more animal deaths other
than this initial Charolais bull. We agreed it had probably died
about a week earlier, say 12-14 Jun 2006. Thurman said they had had
showers early in June 2006 but that the drought has continued hot and
dry. The affected ranch is some 18 miles south of Ozona on Highway
163. When I spoke later with the local veterinarian in Del Rio who
had diagnosed anthrax in the 2 penned deer, he said that he had had
no other cases on that ranch or on other ranches in the area. This
was confirmed by a deer rancher north of Del Rio. But Thurman and the
Del Rio vet suspect that they are occurring quietly in the background
on the western edge of the Edwards Plateau and have been for decades.
