[1] Israel, poultry: 8th outbreak

New outbreak of deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu near Jerusalem
-------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities are to oversee culling Wednesday [29 Mar 2006] of 30 000
chickens at Kibbutz Ma'aleh Hahamisha near Jerusalem, one day after the
deadly strain of the bird flu virus was confirmed there.
At midday on Tuesday [28 Mar 2006], an abnormal death rate of poultry was
noted, and samples sent to the veterinary laboratories in Bet Dagan
confirmed with near certainty the presence of the H5N1 strain.
The Agriculture Ministry's veterinary services made preparations to cull
the poultry. The culling is to begin on Wednesday [29 Mar 2006] morning.
The chiefs of the veterinary services and agriculture ministry have met to
discuss the complete destruction of all poultry within a 3-km radius from
the affected site. It is unclear whether culling in surrounding areas will
take place. The Jerusalem corridor is home to many moshavim in which
poultry growing is a primary source of income.
Ma'aleh Hahamisha is the 14th location in Israel where the bird flu virus
has been found [sic; should read 8th. 14 probably refers to the number of
locations where poultry was culled. - Mod.AS]. After the virus had spread
to Gaza and Jordan, the agriculture ministry issued a warning of a
potential recurrence in Israel. A main danger is an outbreak in villages of
the western Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip.
Poultry farmers have already been compensated for 50 per cent of the direct
economic damage done to them by the culling. At the same time, the
Agriculture Ministry is preparing a report on collateral harm inflicted by
the flu outbreak. The ministry estimates that the direct damage done to the
poultry growers is NIS 24 million [USD 5.11 million]. The growers
themselves estimate a greater damage of NIS 30-40 million.
Roy Klieger, chief of the wildlife supervision department in the
Agriculture Ministry, said that the culling and burial of fowl will be
completed [on 29 Mar 2006].

[Ma'aleh Hahamisha is about 10 km north west of Jerusalem. Map:
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/> (go to square 9).
According to the website <http://poultrymed.com/files/index.html>, this
outbreak occurred in a broiler breeder farm (40 weeks of age). The
(initial) mortality rate was very low (40 out of 30 000 birds in 6
buildings). The preliminary initial H5 diagnosis and its confirmation as
H5N1 were obtained by PCR at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit Dagan.
The disease spread is rather puzzling; the location is not adjacent to
previous outbreaks, and being a breeder farm, biosecurity is expected to be
of high standard. Information on the possible source of infection will be
welcomed.
The evolution of the H5N1 outbreak in Israel might be of interest to other
countries with similarly dense, intensive poultry industry. In particular,
it will be interesting to see whether the non-vaccination policy is
maintained if additional outbreaks occur. - Mod.AS]

Dead birds raise concern in Bamyan
----------------------------------
Over 100 dead chickens [and other] birds in Bamyan district [Punjab] have
raised residents' concerns about the possible outbreak of bird flu in this
central province.
Abbas, from Punjab district, told Pajhwok Afghan News: "Over dozens of
crows are dead in Dahangaw village, while many chickens [died] in Asatian
village. A cat also [died] after eating a dead bird that [had shown] the
symptoms of bird flu," he added.
Scores of wild migratory birds had been found dead in the Ghosak area, he
said, adding that the white birds had arrived here in Nawroz days [during
Nawroz festival days. - Copy editor.MSP]. He said people in the area were
concerned about the possible outbreak of bird flu.
Confirming the finding of the dead birds in Punjab district, Provincial
Public Health director Dr Ihsanullah Shahir said: "It cannot be ascertained
what is the reason behind the death of the chickens; if it is influenza, we
don't have facilities for diagnosing bird flu." He said they had told
people to avoid chicken meat. About 2 weeks earlier, many dead birds had
been found in a pool in the outskirts of Bamyan city; people since then had
stopped using water from that pool.

Czechs say EU lab confirms H5N1 bird flu
----------------------------------------
Tests at a UK-based EU reference laboratory have confirmed a dead swan
found in the Czech Republic had the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus,
the Czech State Veterinary Authority said on Wednesday [28 Mar 2006].
It is the 1st confirmed H5N1 case in the Czech Republic. The swan was found
last week in Hluboka nad Vltavou in the south of the Czech Republic. All of
the central European country's neighbors -- Germany, Austria, Poland, and
Slovakia -- have reported H5N1 cases in dead birds

[4] Denmark, wild birds: H5N1 confirmed

EU confirms H5N1 bird flu in Denmark
------------------------------------
The European Union's reference laboratory in Britain has confirmed the 1st
of 12 cases of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in Denmark, according to the
Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research.
A wild buzzard, which was found dead in mid-March 2006 in Svinoe Strand,
south of Copenhagen, carried the same strain of the virus that has
previously been found in Germany and Poland. Denmark has reported 12 cases
of H5N1 bird flu so far.
The EU laboratory in Weybridge said it trusted Denmark's laboratory testing
facilities, and therefore the country did not need to send samples of the
other infected birds for confirmation. "We are pleased, and this speeds up
the virus identification process in Denmark, since we are no longer
required to send our tests (to Britain) and wait for days for the final
confirmation," institute director Jan Mousing told AFP.

[The identification of H5N1 by the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary
Research in 11 of the 14 H5-positive tested wild birds was reported by
Denmark to the OIE in follow-up report No. 1, sent on 24 Mar 2006, which
can be seen at

Denmark's timely and comprehensive reports on the infected wild birds,
including their scientific names and mapped locations, are exemplary. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu hits MP, Icchapur tests
--------------------------------
From Jalgaon to Icchapur, the avian flu has crossed the state borders of
Maharashtra and entered Madhya Pradesh. At 3 p.m. on Tuesday [28 Mar 2006],
the state government received a fax from the Center confirming that the
dreaded H5N1 virus had spread to yet another state.
A report from Mumbai said that for the 3rd time in the last 2 months, the
H5N1 virus has been detected in chickens in Maharashtra. On Tuesday [28 Mar
2006], the Center told state and Jalgaon district officials that the virus
had been detected in 6 new pockets of Jalgaon district. The new areas
Erandol, Uttran, Bhadgaon, Parola, Varad and Paladhi are located close to
the 4 villages of Jalgaon district where the bird flu virus was earlier
detected. For the state government, the news was not unexpected, as it had
made all arrangements for a culling operation about 10 days back over such
fears.
A sample from Icchapur village, Burhanpur district, bordering Maharashtra
tested positive for bird flu, triggering a panic and forcing the
administration to ban movement of birds and animals from Burhanpur
district. Even movement of people was restricted.
