Efforts to curtail the spread of cholera in the Klang Valley now include
testing water supplies in various parts of Kuala Lumpur. Tests last week
showed low or zero chlorine levels in water supplied to Taman Melati, Taman
Melawati, Taman Bung Raya and Bandar Tun Razak in Selangor.
Although the outbreak that produced 26 confirmed cases out of 114 hospital
admissions in the city and Selangor has been traced to a foodstall in the
Gombak district of the city, and no additional cases have been reported
from districts with suspected water problems, the chlorine testing is
another element of what the city's health department director, Dr. Zainol
Airffin Pawanchee, calls "taking all possible measures."
