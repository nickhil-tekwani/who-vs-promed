CJD AND BLOOD DONORS (04)
=========================

Subject: CJD and blood donors
Reply-to: Rob_James@Umanitoba.ca
The discussion regarding TSE specifically, and blood product safety
more generally, demands a crucial distinction which has not been
addressed. In my view, the infectivity of blood products is
influenced by at least three key factors: the pathogen, the product,
and the processes used to make the product.
Properties of the agent itself have obvious implications on
blood product safety. The viability of the agent within the
conditions of blood storage (and/or fractionation) has a key role in
determining the infectivity to recipients of an infectious agent
acquired from a donor. Other characteristics of the pathogen may also
alter infectivity.
Agents may be transmissible only in fresh products, and those agents
which are transmissible in fractionated products may be limited to
only one, or a few, of the initial plasma fractions. (HIV is a good
example of a pathogen which selectively was found in some fractions
but not in others. While HIV was highly infectious in fractionated
coagulation proteins it was not (thank heavens!) transmissible in
immunoglobulins or albumin.) HCV, however, can be transmitted in
both coagulation factors and immunoglobulins.
Finally, infectious agents may, or may not, remain viable through the
various processes of fractionation, and/or the viral inactivation
steps which are now commonly (although not universally) employed.
In my view, discussions of TSE and blood product safety cannot
proceed meaningfully if these distinctions are not at least given
initial consideration. A single assessment of the safety of the
blood supply is not possible; rather any such discussion must embody
distinctions regarding pathogen, product, and process.
That said, and to the best of my knowledge, the literature lacks
experimental evidence to determine the transmissibility (or not) of
TSE, in fresh cellular products and in plasma fractions. Such
experimental data could be acquired by obtaining cellular components
and plasma from infected cattle, transfusing these to putatively
uninfected recipient cattle, and watching for outcomes in these
recipient cattle. This work needs to be done and publicly reported.
Such an experiment would clarify the transmissibility of this
pathogen in the range of blood products and under a variety
of manufacturing processes.

The information coming out of WHO is consistent with blood screening
procedures in the United States. However, the news reports appear
misleading, because they confuse cause and effect and erroneously report
that Paul Brown's study proves that blood transfusions can transmit CJD.
The study by Paul Brown of the US National Institutes of Health (reported on
3/25 by Rachel and alluded to by me in a November 1996 posting) did not find
that blood transfusions transmit CJD. In this study (still unpublished),
blood from CJD infected hamsters was manufactured into blood components and
products and injected intracerebrally into other hamsters. Paul Brown
reported briefly at a November conference on blood safety that some of the
hamsters inoculated with cryoprecipitate appeared to be "in trouble". At
that time, no post-mortem examination information was reported, and I am not
sure that any had died. I have not seen his final study report.
I talked to Paul Brown in November immediately after his presentation and
asked him how his study applied to blood transfusions, as blood transfusions
are not inoculated intracerebrally. He said that it does not prove that
blood transfusions transmit CJD, but that the potential is there. Other
studies have shown the same thing with intracranially inoculated blood. What
appears to be missing is evidence that a transfusion of blood in the normal
manner (via veins/arteries) can transmit CJD. I don't know whether it is
related to the receptors the infectious particles are looking for or if
there is a physical barrier or some other mechanism (maybe some scientist on
the list can shed light on this. I asked the e-mail list a few weeks ago it
earlier about this but didn't phrase the question correctly. I still can't).
We have ongoing studies in the US (American Red Cross and Centers for
Disease Control) to follow patients who received blood transfusions from
donors who later developed CJD. None of these patients have developed CJD.
It is the same in hemophiliacs, although studies are now ongoing in HIV
infected hemophiliacs with dementia to determine whether they have
HIV-related dementia or something else.
Regarding Mary's posting about CJD in families; she is correct, the familial
deferral is for inherited CJD. The way we get at this is to ask the donor
directly to find out if there was more than one person in the family
diagnosed with CJD and if the persons were blood relatives. We ask if they
know how the family member acquired CJD (through growth hormone, for
example). We defer donors with familial risk, but allow them to donate if
they get genetic testing and are found to be not at risk for familial CJD.
We also quarantine units of blood still available from donors who later
develop CJD. These are US Food and Drug Administration requirements and
are, again, precautionary.
However, as Mary notes, how would a familially-at-risk person's blood be
infectious? This is the question. It would really help if we knew more
about the CJD agent.
Finally, the variant strain. We do not have to deal with this in the US;
however, it probably has been addressed by the British Blood Transfusion
Society.
