According to the chief of the State Service for Plant Protection,
Ringold Arnitis, Latvia most probably will not be able to avoid
completely the plant infection fireblight. According to him, the
disease will persist in tree trunks for years and can progress again
in favourable conditions. That is why the Service needs to monitor
conditions of gardens on a continuous basis. According to Arnitis,
the special situation of Latvia is that almost each household has a
garden with apples and pears that creates conditions for the bacteria
to "hide." According to him again, the reason for the fireblight
outbreak this year [2007] was that conditions favourable for the
disease existed.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_. Many
varieties of pear and apple trees are susceptible, although the level
of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the
_Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected. The host range covers
more than 180 species from 39 genera, including also quince, loquat,
ornamental roses, hawthorn, and firethorn.
The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend
forming black hooks, cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees
invariably die. The bacteria are highly infectious and are spread by
insects (aphids, flies, bees, etc), wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds, often on flowers. The pathogen can survive on the
host as an endophyte or epiphyte for variable periods of time
depending of environmental factors, and it is apparently quiescent
through the dormant period of the host.
_E. amylovora_ was originally described from the USA as the 1st
bacterium causing a plant disease. It is now widely distributed in
northern America, Europe, small areas of western Asia, and is endemic
to New Zealand. Strict quarantine regulations, including an import
embargo on fruit from infected countries, are enforced in Australia
to keep the pathogen out. The costs of fireblight to national
agricultural industries due to yield losses and disease management
requirements are potentially enormous.
_E. amylovora_ has been placed on the list of pests recommended for
regulation as quarantine pests by the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO). Some areas of the European Union known not to be
infected have been given Protected Zone status. Phytosanitary
regulations designed to prevent a fireblight incursion are applied to
areas within the Zone. Latvia was included based on a survey in 2001,
which did not find any signs of the disease. To this day, the
pathogen is still not officially listed as being present in Latvia.
The outbreak mentioned above may be a recent introduction, despite
the quarantine regulations, or due to an internal source, which was
missed during the survey, and possibly a 1st report for Latvia.
