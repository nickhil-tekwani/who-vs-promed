_Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi_, the causal agent of chestnut brown rot, is first reported from Portugal. It was detected during surveys in 2018 in chestnut orchards (_Castanea sativa_) in northern Portugal. _G. smithogilvyi_ had been also identified in an industrial processing plant in 2017, 2018, and 2019; the proportions of infected nuts were 8.0, 5.3, and 5.0%, respectively.

[_Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi_ (Gs; synonym _G. castaneae_) as the cause of nut rot of commercial chestnuts (_Castanea_ spp. and hybrids) was identified as a new species several years ago. It has been reported as a major cause of chestnut nut rots mainly in parts of Europe as well as Australia where it has led to large crop losses in recent years (such as in 2016, ProMED post 20180618.5861211). Outside these regions, the pathogen has so far been identified in only a few locations.

The fungus affects the kernels but lives on decaying burrs and branches; it may also inhabit asymptomatic flowers, leaves, and stems. Ascospores are suspected to be the primary source of inoculum, including for infection of flowers leading to nut rot symptoms the following year. Gs is also suspected to be a cause of cankers on woody parts of the trees.

Chestnut nut rots due to other fungi, such as _Phomopsis_ species, are also known to occur.
