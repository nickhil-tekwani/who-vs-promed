An outbreak of smallpox [NOT smallpox, see below] was recorded in a private subsidiary farm located in the village of Kuznetsy, Aleksinsky district, Tula region.

According to the press service of the Rosselkhoznadzor Administration in Moscow, the Moscow and Tula oblasts, the owner of a backyard holding contacted the Yasnogorsk Inter-District Veterinary Association on [Thu 13 Sep 2018] to report the disease in sheep. At the time of the outbreak, the farm housed 20 goats and sheep. Based on the results of laboratory tests, the presence of the genome of the sheep pox and goat pox virus was confirmed.

An emergency meeting of the regional anti-epizootic commission was held on Fri 21 Sep 2018. Following the meeting, the commission adopted a number of decisions to prevent the spread of sheep pox in the Tula region. The borders of protection and surveillance zones were identified, the press service of the office said.

During the meeting of the emergency anti-epizootic commission, it was decided to kill the animals using a bloodless method and to determine the place for their incineration. Disinfection will be carried out in all relevant sites and on all equipment.

During 2018, Russia has suffered 3 events of sheep pox, of which 2 involved a single outbreak, while the 3rd one, which started 21 Aug 2018 in the Moskovskaya oblast, north of the Tula oblast (20180829.5993757), has already involved 8 outbreaks and is "continuing." In all outbreaks, only sheep were clinically affected, although, as in the current, 4th event, goats are present in the same flock.

Sheep pox and goat pox (which is the OIE's terminology of this listed disease) are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats, but most of the strains examined cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats. This is also the case in the current event in the Tula oblast, where only sheep in the mixed (sheep and goats) small flock were reportedly affected. Some strains, however, will cause a clinical disease in both species (e.g., in Kenya).

Capripox is endemic in Africa north of the equator, the Middle East, Turkey, central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, parts of the People's Republic of China, Viet Nam, and Bangladesh. Spread to other regions (e.g., Greece in 2008) have been recorded. An interactive OIE map showing all outbreaks, globally, that have been officially reported since 2010 is available at https://tinyurl.com/yb98ojkg (for the detailed situation in specific regions, click on the cluster and zoom in).

Live vaccines against sheep pox and goat pox are commercially available and widely used in the endemic countries. Further information, particularly addressing diagnosis and vaccines, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.13_S_POX_G_POX.pdf. - Mod.AS
