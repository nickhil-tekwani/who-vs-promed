The following background information on angiostrongyliasis in the United
States and Caribbean appears in GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>
United States:
- Infection is primarily limited to Hawaii. Single cases associated with
ingestion of raw snails have been reported from New Orleans (1985) and
Puerto Rico (1984).
- The parasite has been identified in captive monkeys (New Orleans, 1987);
rats (New Orleans, 1986 and 1997); wood rats and marmosets (New Iberia and
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1988); a miniature horse (Picayune, Mississippi,
1996). 20% of wharf rats in New Orleans are infected (1986 to 1997).
Puerto Rico:
Infected rats (_Rattus rattus_ and _R. norvegicus_) have been found in San
Juan, Rio Piedras, Guaynabo, Toa Baja, Arecibo, Mayaguez, Ponce, Fajardo,
Trujillo Alto, Humacao. Cayey, Adjuntas and Maricao - with highest rates
(92%) in Humacao.
Cuba:
Angiostrongyliasis was first reported in 1973. Thirteen cases have been
registered - most in the vicinity of Havana.
Note: Angiostrongyliasis [due to _A. cantonensis_ must not be confused
with infection by _Parastrongylus costaricensis_ (abdominal
angiostrongyliasis), a disease of Central and South America.
