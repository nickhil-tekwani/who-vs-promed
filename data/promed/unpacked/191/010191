70 Cases of Meningitis Reported
---------------------------------------
The Sudanese ministry of health has reported that 70 cases of
[meningococcal] meningitis have been diagnosed in 4 of the country's
states.
The ministry's under-secretary Bashir Mukhtar said Saturday that the
infections were reported in the states of Gezira in central Sudan, Darfur
in the West and Gedarif and the Red Sea states in the East. [These are all
in the more desert "north" as compared to the more tropical "south" of the
country. - Mod.JW].
"We are very alarmed over the outbreak of meningitis during the winter
season. Meningitis is usually a summer disease in Sudan," he said. "We
have a strategic stock of meningitis vaccines to deal with the situation
and control the disease," Mukhtar said. He said vaccination campaigns
would be launched in areas where meningitis had broken out.

[ProMED-mail does not usually post reports of meningococcal disease from the
endemic "meningitis belt" of Africa, which includes Sudan, but this one is
unusual as it is an out-of-season outbreak. - Mod.JW]
