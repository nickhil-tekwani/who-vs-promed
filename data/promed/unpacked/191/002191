A rash of eastern equine encephalitis cases among horses and
emus in 8 counties in south Alabama compelled health officials to
issue a mosquito alert for the state Tuesday.
State veterinarian Dr. Bill Johnston said while the disease is not
transmitted from horses to humans, and there have been no
confirmed infections in humans, the upturn in animal cases is a
signal of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the area. The peak
months for transmission of the disease are August through
October, he said.
"This should prompt residents to take precautions to avoid
mosquito bites," he said in a statement released by the Alabama
Department of Public Health.
He said emus infected with the disease have a bloody diarrhea. He
recommended that emu ranchers wear gloves and protective
clothing when handling sick birds.
The disease is about 90 percent fatal [sic in horses and 35
percent fatal [sic in humans. No vaccine is available for humans,
but horses and emus can be immunized, health officials said.
Johnston recommended that residents try to avoid mosquito bites
and to eliminate mosquito breeding areas by removing standing
water, cleaning gutters, getting rid of old tires, and use repellents if
outdoors.
He listed the following counties with cases in horses and emus:
Autauga, Baldwin, Bullock, Coffee, Escambia, Geneva, Lamar and
Monroe. The mosquito alert, he said, covers all counties.
He also said Florida has had 20 cases in 10 counties, including
four bordering Alabama.

[Something wrong here. Is the State of Alabama using horses and
emus as sentinels for predicting the presence of infected
mosquitoes? Surely there is a vector control program there that
would provide greater predictive capabilities.
It is certanly a good idea to decrease mosquito breeding sites but
the focus should be on sites where the vectors breed.
Question: If there are four 6-packs in a case, how many cases are
there in a rash? - Mod CHC
