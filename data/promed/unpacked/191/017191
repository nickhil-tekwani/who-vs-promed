Doctors are trying to track down 55 Kiwi [New Zealand] women who
might have contracted hepatitis C [virus infection] after visiting an
Australian medical clinic linked to an outbreak of the disease.
Health Ministry deputy director of public health Dr Fran McGrath said
Australian authorities identified the link between a cluster of
hepatitis C cases and a private medical centre in Victoria in April
[2010], and are now investigating how this happened. The women all
visited the Croydon Day Surgery in Croydon between 1 Jan 2006 and 7
Dec 2009.

Police in Victoria are investigating while Australian media are
reporting that legal action is planned. "The Department of Health in
Victoria, has taken responsibility for tracing, directly contacting
and confidentially informing all 3500 women concerned, including the
55 affected women giving a New Zealand address." The department began
trying to contact the New Zealanders yesterday as they worked through
the 3500 women being traced.

Around 1000 Australian women have been contacted and 746 tested. 44
of those tested have been found to have the disease, around half of
whom have had their infection linked to the private medical centre.

The New Zealand Ministry of Health will be working with its Victorian
counterpart to help trace the New Zealand women concerned. New
Zealand women who had procedures at the clinic in that time can call
Healthline in New Zealand on 0800 611 116 and be transferred free of
charge to a confidential Australian hepatitis line for further
information.

[As of 2 Jun 2010, 44 of 746 women who attended the Croydon Day
Surgery in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, have tested positive for
hepatitis C virus infection. Therefore it is highly probable that
several (at least 3) of the 55 New Zealand women who were treated at
the Croydon Day Surgery during the same period will have contracted
hepatitis C virus infection.

Further information is awaited concerning the outcome of the police
investigation in Melbourne.
