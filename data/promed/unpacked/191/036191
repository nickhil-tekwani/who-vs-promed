Nagasaki City announced on [27 Jul 2022] that a woman in her 80s died after being infected with "severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)" transmitted by ticks. This is the 1st time a death has been confirmed in the prefecture.

According to the city's regional health department, the woman developed fever and diarrhea on [15 Jul 2022]. After [16 Jul 2022] she visited multiple medical institutions and was hospitalized. She died on [24 Jul 2022]. She tested positive for the virus on [25 Jul 2022] after being tested by the city's health and environmental laboratory. There was a tick bite mark, but it is said that the details of the bite are unknown.

This is the 3rd case of infection in the city this year [2022], and the 4th case in the prefecture. "If you are in a bush or wooded area, please wear long sleeves and long pants to reduce the exposure of your skin, and if you are bitten, seek medical attention immediately," the department said.

[SFTS virus is actively transmitted again this year (2022) and this is the 3rd case. The SFTS geographic range in Japan is increasing. SFTS has been occurring sporadically in Japan since 2013, and SFTS virus has become established there. Cases were widely dispersed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. There were 96 cases in the 1st 11 months of 2019 (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd - Japan 20210705.8495328). SFTS is likely underreported in some areas. SFTS should be included in differential diagnoses when cases of _Rickettsia japonica_ infections are suspected. Since there is no vaccine, the best way to avoid infection is to avoid tick bites and contact with infected pets, especially cats.

As noted earlier, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS-virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids was not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of the longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
