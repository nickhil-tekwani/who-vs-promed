Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 3 new confirmed cases of this virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a Saudi citizen in Taif governorate, aged 65, who is suffering from chronic diseases, and still at ICU receiving the proper treatment. The 2nd one is a Saudi female citizen in Taif governorate, aged 68, who is suffering from chronic diseases as well, and still at ICU receiving the proper treatment. However, the 3rd case is a [male] resident, aged 46, in Wadi Al-Dawaser [Wadi ad-Dawasir], who passed away today [14 Jun 2013].

The MOH has pointed out that it has tested 53 samples, all of which have been proved negative.

[The announcement of these 3 new cases including one death, raises the global number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 61 including 34 deaths. It also raises the number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 46 including 28 deaths (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx).

Al-Taif is a city about 62 miles (100 km) to the south east of Mecca in Mecca province. Wadi ad-Dawasir is a town in Riyadh Province Saudi Arabia, in the Dawasir valley. Both locations can be found on the map at http://www.atozmapsdata.com/zoomify.asp?name=Country/Modern/Z_Saudi_Pol2 (with slightly different spellings).

More information on the epidemiologic investigations on the cases in Al Taif would be greatly appreciated given the proximity to Mecca and the upcoming mass gathering in the area. At present the actual primary source of transmission of the MERS-CoV is unknown. There has been person-to-person transmission documented in several healthcare facility based clusters, but epidemiologic details on these clusters and outbreaks have not been published as yet. - Mod.MPP]

MERS-CoV - update 14 Jun 2013
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has announced an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases, including one death with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The 1st patient is a 63 year old woman with underlying medical conditions from the Eastern region, the 2nd patient is a 75 year old man with underlying medical conditions from Al-Ahsa governorate, and the 3rd patient is a 21 year old man from Hafar Al-Batin governorate who died. In addition, a previously laboratory-confirmed case has died.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 33 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.
