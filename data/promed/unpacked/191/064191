Of all essential workers in Sweden in the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals and immigrants were at highest risk for infection, hospitalization, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), according to a study [see citation below] late last week in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.

University of Gothenburg researchers analyzed the occupational data of 326 052 essential workers from 2018 and 2019 who lived in Sweden as of 1 Jan 2020 and were included in a nationwide COVID-19 database from 1 Jan 2020 - 28 Feb 2021. Average worker age was 43 years, half were women, 18% were foreign-born, and 28% worked in essential occupations.

The investigators compared the risk of infection, hospital admission, and ICU admission among occupational groups and in 4 groups of Swedish- or foreign-born workers, adjusting for socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors and underlying illnesses. The study was part of a larger observational study involving multiple national COVID-19 registries.

In stark contrast to most Western countries, Sweden went with a "business-as-usual" approach to the pandemic, avoiding lockdowns and face-covering mandates and conducting school in person, a move that backfired, with a much higher COVID-19 death rate than its Nordic neighbors experienced.

Among the 326 052 employees, 29 797 (9.1%) tested positive for COVID-19, of whom 1069 (3.6%) were hospitalized, and 152 (0.5%) were admitted to an ICU. While all essential workers had an elevated risk of all 3 studied outcomes, healthcare professionals were at the highest risk.

Incidence of COVID-19 infection among foreign-born workers was 100.0 per 1000 person-years, while it was 6.3 for hospitalization and 0.8 for ICU admission. In contrast, rates for Sweden-born workers were 75.8 for infection, 2.0 for hospitalization, and 0.3 for ICU admission.

Compared with Swedish-born workers in nonessential occupations, foreign-born workers in essential positions were at 1.85 times higher risk for COVID-19 infection, 3.80 times the risk of hospitalization, and 3.79 times the risk of ICU admission. Corresponding risks among Swedish-born workers in essential roles were 1.44 for infection, 1.30 for hospitalization, and 1.46 for ICU admission.

"The joint effect of occupation and immigrant status in association with COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalisation was larger than the sum of the estimated effect of occupation alone and immigrant status alone, that is, that some proportion of health effects was beyond what would be expected from independent risks," the study authors wrote.

Essential workers, including those in the healthcare, service, security, transportation, and cleaning roles, are known to be at elevated risk for COVID-19. The researchers noted that immigrants fill many of these roles in Western countries, with higher proportions of foreign-born workers in Sweden occupying essential roles during the study period than those born in Sweden (38% vs 26%).

These types of jobs often demand in-person presence, with less possibility of physical distancing and poor access to adequate personal protective equipment. "Because foreign-born individuals more commonly have temporary employments and lower income, the fear of losing their jobs could pressure them to continue working while unwell, thus increasing their risk of poor health outcomes," the researchers wrote, adding that these workers may be more likely to rely on public transportation and face its attendant risks, as well.

Of all essential occupations, healthcare carried the highest risk for COVID-19 infection, followed by teachers, service workers, and "other" roles. The risk for hospitalization and ICU admission were elevated only for healthcare workers and other roles; teachers and service workers were not at significantly higher risk.

"These findings were little influenced by additional adjustments for individual characteristics known to be risk factors for COVID-19, which suggests a need for further exploration of possible mechanistic factors underpinning the findings," the authors wrote.

They added that the study "underscores the importance of ensuring that COVID-19-related infection protection measures are tailored to meet the needs of foreign-born workers in essential occupations who tend to bear a double burden of risk because of their socioeconomic status."

Abstract
Background. Research on occupation and risk of COVID-19 among foreign-born workers is lacking. We investigated whether working in essential occupations was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and whether foreign-born workers in similar occupations as Swedish-born individuals had a higher risk of the studied outcomes.

Conclusion. Occupation was associated with COVID-19 outcomes and contributed to the burden of COVID-19 among foreign-born individuals in this study. - Mod.LK]

[A] COVID-19 and elder mental health

Depression and loneliness have increased among older adults during the pandemic, prompting a need for more coordinated efforts to address the issue, according to a report on social isolation in older Canadians [https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/canada/employment-social-development/corporate/seniors/forum/covid-19-social-isolation/covid-19-social-isolation-en.pdf].

The report was conducted by researchers at Simon Fraser University's Gerontology Research Centre for the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers Responsible for Seniors Forum and used data from participants enrolled in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a long-term study (at least 20 years) of 50 000 Canadians ages 45-85.

Women reported a significant increase in loneliness during the pandemic, with those aged 65-74 experiencing a 67% increase in loneliness and a rise in depression from 19% prepandemic (2011-2015) to 23% in 2020. Women ages 75-84 reported a 37% increase in loneliness. Men also saw a jump in loneliness by 45% in the 65-74 age group and 33% in the 75-84 age-group.

The loneliness may be linked to limited time with family: More than 60% of women over age 65 said the pandemic separated them from family.

The authors of the report also emphasized that older Canadians were not a homogenous group: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning and their allies (LGBTQA) experienced more depression in the pandemic, as did those living in rural areas.

More outreach and digital education should be done to connect older Canadians during the pandemic, the authors said. "Ensuring all Canadians have access to low-cost home internet and free internet in public spaces should be a priority," they said in a press release [see below] on the report.

[From the Simon Fraser University press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/949296):

"Rates of depression and loneliness have increased among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a need for more coordinated efforts to address the issue going forward, according to a new report on social isolation among older Canadians."

"Effective interventions to reduce social isolation among older adults are needed

"Programs should also be tailored to meet linguistic and cultural needs and delivered via a range of formats, such as in-person, virtual, or over the phone, including support for those at risk of elder abuse. Interventions to reduce social isolation require ongoing collaboration, since they involve partnerships between a range of stakeholders from government to non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector.

"'There is a need for digital technology education and training programs for older adults to address the existing digital divide,' says Wister, GRC director. 'Participation in virtual group fitness classes can help reduce social isolation and help keep older adults healthy. Ensuring all Canadians have access to low-cost home internet and free internet in public spaces should be a priority.'

"Social activities, educational sessions, and befriending programs can also be offered by phone along with access to help and information lines.

"Expanding outreach and befriending programs between youth and older adults can reduce social isolation and combat ageist views and behaviours that have worsened during the pandemic, Wister noted. Organizations can also support older adults in safely returning to volunteering.

"Systemic issues of staffing levels and capacity were identified as having implications for supporting social connections for residents in long-term care. Adequate staff support and training is required for screening visitors, setting up technology for virtual visits and providing social activities for residents.

"The researchers note that many successful interventions are currently being supported by short-term or emergency funding. Potential roles identified for governmental organizations in their efforts to reduce older adult social isolation include funding, supporting coordinated responses and knowledge sharing, and policy-making." - Mod.LK]

[B] Risk factors for COVID-related syndrome

Children older than 5 years and those with high concentrations of ferritin in the blood -- an indicator of inflammation -- were at highest risk for intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), finds a study [see citation below] today [11 Apr 2022] in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ).

A team led by researchers at McGill University in Montreal conducted chart reviews of 232 MIS-C patients younger than 18 years admitted to 15 hospitals in Canada, Iran, and Costa Rica from 1 Mar 2020 - 7 Mar 2021. Average patient age was 5.8 years, 56.0% were boys, and 21.6% had underlying illnesses.

Among the 232 patients (106 confirmed and 126 probable), 31.5% were admitted to an ICU, but none died. About 2/3 (64.4%) required vasopressors to raise their blood pressure, with or without mechanical ventilation.

Children most at risk were those 13-17 years (46.2% vs 18.4% of those younger than 5; adjusted risk difference, 27.7%) and 6-12 years (43.6%; adjusted risk difference, 25.2%) and those with ferritin (a blood protein containing iron) concentrations higher than 500 micrograms per liter (μg/L; 18.4%), indicating inflammation.

The risk of ICU admission at Canadian hospitals was significantly higher for patients hospitalized from December 2020 - March 2021 than those hospitalized from March - May 2020 (adjusted risk difference 25.3%). Relative to patients hospitalized before 31 Oct 2020, those admitted later had higher rates of ICU admission (adjusted risk difference, 12.3%), cardiac involvement (30.9%), and abnormal blood clotting (90%).

The vast majority (89.2%) had gastrointestinal involvement, mostly abdominal pain. Of all patients, 76.4% with confirmed and 43.6% with probable MIS-C had cardiac involvement, 2.6% had acute kidney injury, and 51.7% had hepatitis.

The median length of hospital stay was 6 days, with 69.0% of patients released by day 7 and 84.9% released by day 10. An elevated initial ferritin level was tied to a longer stay.

"Further research is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of MIS-C with and without treatment, as well as changes in MIS-C severity and short- and long-term outcomes with emerging variants of concern," the researchers concluded.

"Abstract

"Interpretation. We observed that age and higher ferritin levels were associated with more severe MIS-C. We observed greater severity of MIS-C later in the study period. Whether emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants pose different risks of severe MIS-C needs to be determined.

"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifests as immune dysregulation after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The syndrome has no pathognomonic features. Thus, the diagnostic criteria of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) differ, but they all include fever, evidence of systemic inflammation, and involvement of at least one organ or system.

"Our primary objective was to assess initial clinical or laboratory features that predict severe illness in MIS-C. We also sought to explore changes in overall disease severity and cardiac involvement over time as it was the impression of many investigators that severity of MIS-C increased through pandemic waves."

"Interpretation

"Despite nearly 1/3 of patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, recovery was typically rapid, with 85% of patients discharged within 10 days. The role of adjunctive glucocorticoids and the optimal glucocorticoid regimen has not been established, with recent large studies reporting discordant results. It is not known whether glucocorticoids could replace IVIG in low-income countries where IVIG is not readily available. Of note, MIS-C resolved without IVIG or glucocorticoids in 10% of patients in our study, mainly among those admitted to hospital early in the study period. It is not clear whether this is because these patients had mild MIS-C or because not all patients require treatment. Long-term follow-up will be important to determine the role of treatment." - Mod.LK]

[3] COVID-linked antibiotic use

A review of data on Medicare beneficiaries during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic found that nearly 1/3 of outpatient COVID-19 visits were linked to an antibiotic prescription, mainly for azithromycin, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers reported late last week in JAMA [see citation below].

The analysis of Medicare carrier claims and data from the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan from April 2020 - April 2021 found that 29.6% of more than 1.1 million COVID-19 outpatient visits were associated with an antibiotic prescription. The rate of prescribing varied by month, with higher rates of prescribing occurring during a wave of COVID-19 cases in the winter of 2020-21 (range, 17.5% in May 2020, 33.3% in October 2020). Prescribing was highest in the emergency department (33.9%), followed by telehealth (28.4%), urgent care (25.8%), and office visits (23.9%).

Azithromycin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic (50.7% of cases), followed by doxycycline (13%), amoxicillin (9.4%), and levofloxacin (6.7%). Urgent care had the highest percentage of azithromycin prescriptions (60.1%), followed by telehealth (55.7%), office visits (55.1%), and ED (47.4%).

Differences were observed by age, sex, and location, with non-Hispanic White beneficiaries receiving antibiotics for COVID-19 more frequently (30.6%) than other racial and ethnic groups, including American Indian/Alaska Native (24.1%), Asian/Pacific Islander (26.5%), Black (23.2%), and Hispanic (28.8%) patients.

Despite some early studies that indicated azithromycin might benefit COVID-19 patients, subsequent randomized clinical trials demonstrated no benefit.

"These observations reinforce the importance of improving appropriate antibiotic prescribing in outpatient settings and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use for viral infections such as COVID-19 in older adult populations," the CDC researchers wrote.

"Antibiotics are ineffective treatment for viral syndromes, including COVID-19. We characterized antibiotic prescribing in older adults with outpatient COVID-19 visits to identify opportunities to improve prescribing practices."

The study was conducted during year one of the pandemic when appropriate treatments were not yet defined. But antibiotics are never effective against viruses. - Mod.LK]
