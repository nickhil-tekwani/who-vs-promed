Arboviral Activity, Four-County Alert Issued
----------------------------------------------
On October 16, 1998, state officials issued a St. Louis Encephalitis
Medical
Alert for Palm Beach, Martin, Glades and Hendry counties. Since August
14,
health officials have observed sporadic confirmed test results from
sentinel
chicken flocks, but the number increased considerably during the past
week
indicating expanding presence of the virus in the alert counties.
The medical alert is an official state action that requires health
departments in the four affected counties to contact local physicians to
encourage increased surveillance for the disease. Additionally, health
departments will work with mosquito control districts to reduce mosquito
populations, coordinate local action with school districts and
organizers of
outdoor events and provide information to the public about limiting
exposure
to mosquitoes.
For the week ending 10/16/98, 30 sentinel chickens seroconverted as a
result
of exposure to SLE virus. Sentinel flocks with confirmed
seroconversions
were from Palm Beach (6 chickens), Martin (8), Hendry/Glades (3), Lee
(7),
Indian River (4), Sarasota (1) and Osceola (1) counties. (Note: at this
time, seroconversion requires antibody levels in two blood samples taken
a
week apart.) Statewide, numbers of seroconversions remain lower when
compared with last year's activity.
No human arbovirus cases have been reported. Clinicians are reminded to
submit sera and CSF, when appropriate, from any patient suspected of
having
arboviral infection to use the Department of Health laboratories for
arbovirus analyses -- these services are free.
Florida residents and visitors can call the Department of Health's toll
free
hotline for weekly updates on St. Louis Encephalitis at 1-888-880-5782.
Information is available on the hotline in both English and Spanish.
