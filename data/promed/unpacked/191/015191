Medical Impact of Use of Antimicrobial drugs in Food Animals WHO
Consultation, Berlin, Germany, 13-17 October 1997.

There is increasing concern about the extent to which bacteria pathogenic in
humans have acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Use of antimicrobial
drugs in food animals is known as potentially adding to the development of
antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of medical relevance. However, the real
scope of the medical impact of the use antimicrobials in livestock
production is generally unknown. WHO intends to organize a scientific
consultation on the medical impact of use of antimicrobial drugs in food
animals in October 1997 in Berlin. The objectives of the consultation are:
- to review the knowledge of the medical risks regarding
antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of public health
significance associated with the use of different
antimicrobial drugs in food animal production
- in the context of the development of the WHO Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring to define the needs
on monitoring of emergence, mechanisms of development
and spread to man of antimicrobial resistance in food
and animals at national and international levels
- to obtain an international consensus on how to tackle
the identified problems.
WHO will invite about 25 experts in the field of emergence and monitoring of
antimicrobial resistance, infectious control in community settings as well
as on feed additives, food animal production and veterinary medicine,
infectious disease control
and antimicrobial resistance monitoring in animal and food production.
Draft scope and purpose of the meeting and a compilation of the major
subject areas to be discussed could be obtained from the below address.
Comments would be appreciated until 15 April 1997.
