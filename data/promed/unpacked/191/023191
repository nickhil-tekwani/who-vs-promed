[ProMED-mail very much appreciates getting regular updates on this
outbreak. However, we still do not have information on the strain of FMD
virus involved. Such information could be obtained by sending the
appropriate samples for testing -- see references below. Knowledge of the
strain is especially important because the outbreak is just across the
border from Tanzania; comparison to any virus found there would be useful
in understanding the epidemiology of the outbreak. In addition, we posted
an OIE report of the SAT 2 strain of FMD virus in Malawi as a result of
spread from Tanzania last week. - Mods.PC/AS]
