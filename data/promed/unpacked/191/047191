[This comment is in response to comments made about rashes and clinical presentations of the patients during the febrile outbreak in Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. Ross River virus and Barmah Forest viruses were proposed as possible etiological agents of those cases (see ProMED-mail post Unidentified febrile disease - Brazil: RFI 20190403.6400677>). - Mod.TY]

I wanted to make a comment about Ross River and Barmah Forest virus clinical presentation.

Professor Tony Cunningham (currently Director of Westmead Millennium Institute) followed cohorts of patients with Ross River virus disease and demonstrated they do not always present with rash (and the rash can appear before or after the onset of arthritis), but they do all display arthritis. Rash was also common on the palms of hands and soles of feet. Arthritis is often present in the small joints (fingers and toes) ankles and knees in RRV disease. Dr Jim Flexman (Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth) and I studied over 100 cases of Barmah Forest virus disease and demonstrated that rash was the 1st presenting symptom; it was a very obvious rash that often began on the face and descended the body (rather like rubella) and that while patients often displayed arthritis, myalgia was always present and could be quite severe.

Barmah Forest virus has not been found outside Australia, although Ross River virus has been the cause of outbreaks in the Pacific in the past following introduction most likely by travelers. This was driven in a human-mosquito-human cycle, which burned itself out.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Hueston for her comments about clinical pictures occurring with Ross River and Barmah Forest virus infections in Australia. The possibility of these viruses causing the outbreak of febrile disease in Brazil remains unlikely, but further laboratory tests are reported to be underway, although a preliminary report indicated positive results for chikungunya virus. - Mod.TY
