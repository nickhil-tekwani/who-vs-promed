Public health officials are investigating an ongoing multi-state outbreak of salmonellosis linked to consumption of certain Del Monte vegetable trays. To date, 3 people in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota, have reported becoming sick after consuming a Del Monte vegetable tray purchased from a Wisconsin or Minnesota Kwik Trip, according to a news release.

Patients reported becoming ill between 13 and 27 Apr 2019. It is possible additional illnesses will be reported due to the several week delay from when a person becomes ill to when it is reported to public health agencies.

The Del Monte vegetable trays associated with the investigation contain broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip. Del Monte vegetable trays may also have been distributed to other retailers in Wisconsin. Investigation for product distribution is ongoing.

Consumers are advised to not eat the following products:
Del Monte Vegetable Tray (containing broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip) 6 oz.
Del Monte Vegetable Tray (containing broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip) 12 oz.

Salmonellosis is caused by consuming food or water contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria, or by direct or indirect contact with fecal matter from infected people or animals. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pains, fever, and vomiting that lasts for several days. Bloodstream infections are rare, but can be quite serious in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Most people recover from salmonellosis on their own but may require extra fluids to prevent dehydration. It is important to wash fruits and vegetables before eating them to prevent illness from Salmonella and other bacteria.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, Minnesota Department of Health, and Wisconsin local health departments are working with the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the outbreak.
