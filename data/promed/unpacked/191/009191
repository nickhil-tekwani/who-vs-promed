The Ministry of Health received a report from Shaare Zedek Medical Center and the laboratory that diagnosed a monkeypox patient. The patient is an Israeli who lives and works in the Port Harcourt area [Rivers state] of southern Nigeria (an endemic region). The man got sick about a week after his return from Nigeria and was diagnosed today [12 Oct 2018] according to his clinic and after laboratory approval. The patient's condition is good and improving; he is currently in isolation at his home.

Monkeypox belongs to a group of smallpox diseases that can occur in different species and resembles chickenpox in essence but with different wounds. It is a viral disease characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue, with a typical rash up to 3 days later. The disease usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks and passes by itself without treatment. The disease is transmitted between animals and is generally not contagious from one person to another. The Ministry of Health takes the necessary actions to monitor and treat the disease.

In the fall of 2017, Nigeria saw their 1st confirmed monkeypox outbreak in nearly 40 years, resulting in more than 200 confirmed and suspected cases. Although that outbreak was reportedly quelled in February [2018], a small number of isolated cases have continued to be reported over the past 6 months. Fortunately, the West African monkeypox virus is less virulent and less easily transmitted than its Central African counterpart.

Although Nigeria continues to report only low levels of infection (see Nigeria CDC Monkeypox Update Epi Week 37: https://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/6c3cf1e472c509190602a5d431c0af1e.pdf), 3 cases exported from Nigeria in just over a month suggests the virus may be more active than believed.

[[ProMED-mail thanks Nati Elkin <Nati@poultrymed.com> for the Israeli Ministry of Health report of this case in Hebrew available at https://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/12102018_1.aspx. - Mod.ML]

This is the 3rd monkeypox infection contracted in Nigeria with the affected individuals having come down with the disease in other countries: 2 in the UK and now one in Israel. The Israeli man was infected in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, Nigeria. Interestingly, the 2 cases in the UK also acquired their infections in Rivers state and were linked to a cluster of cases there [see Monkeypox - Africa (14): Nigeria 20180926.6053721]. The conditions under which the man in Israel acquired his infection are not stated but likely came from a rodent reservoir host. Fortunately, the man is in good condition. The monkeypox virus clade circulating in Nigeria is the West Africa one, which has a very low to nil case fatality rate. This is likely the virus clade involved in these 3 exported cases. The central Africa clade is more virulent, with a case fatality rate of at least 10%.

Non-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp.; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Some of these rodents are consumed as bushmeat. - Mod.TY
