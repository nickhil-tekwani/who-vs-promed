I would like to know:
1. What kind of vaccine is used?
2. Is the vaccination a "complete" protection from becoming _Salmonella_
carriers? Do you know any publication dealing with that subject?
3. How do you survey your flocks in the UK?
4. What means "level of salmonellae in eggs has remained virtually
unchanged over the past ten years". How did you check that? (We use a
serological test since 1991, which was very helpful to decrease the number
of _Salmonella_ infected flocks.)
Personally I don't think vaccination is the long term answer for all the
flocks to get rid of Salmonella. I do not know many bacterial infections
which could be successfully eliminated by vaccination.

Professor Martin Hugh-Jones has emailed your request for information on
_Salmonella_ vaccination of hens. Specific questions regarding the vaccine
should be addressed to
Dr Steve Houghton, who is the Vaccine Research and Development Manager at
Hoechst Roussel Vet Limited. Contact address:

I have no e-mail address for him.
I'm sure he will be helpful to you.
I can give you a general answer to your other queries.
1. Flocks in the UK are monitored regularly for _S. typhimurium_ and _S.
enteritidis_ using recognised standard cultural methods by approved testing
laboratories. Serology for _S. enteritidis_ is used internally by some of
the large producers to compliment bacteriology and kits such as the IDDEX
kit is commonly used. There is no national serological monitoring scheme
and now many flocks are vaccinated which makes serology even more
problematical.
2. _Salmonella_ in retail eggs has indeed remained the same over the last
ten years. In UK success in reducing _S. enteritidis_ has not been matched
by a reduction in the egg laying sector. Approximately one in 700 retail
eggs are contaminated with _S. enteritidis_ either on the surface or
internally. Two structured surveys of eggs have been undertaken, the most
recent in the last two years.
3. Your own comments on serology are interesting. I am also an advocate of
serology as a screening method. However, it hasn't really been taken up in
the UK for a number of reasons. Firstly, there is a great reluctance to
change standard procedures and many people I've spoken to prefer to stick
with culture alone even though it may be more expensive and identify
infection later. Secondly, very few serological validation studies have
been undertaken in the UK due to a lack of enthusiasm. Reliable data on
cut-offs and other parameters does not exist. Vaccination is now widely
used and this compromises many of the tests. Vaccination alone would not
eliminate infection. Many other measures are also being taken to try and
reduce the level of contaminated eggs including registration and
traceability, breeding flock controls, on-farm time and temperature
controls, etc, etc. Vaccination does have its place but I would hope that
when the prevalence of contamination reaches much smaller levels a gradual
phasing out of vaccination will be seen.
I think serological monitoring when the prevalence of infection is very
small will definitely have a role perhaps by measuring antibodies in eggs.
I hope this has been of some use to you.
