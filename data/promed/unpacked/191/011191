Fish & Game in Rotorua [Waikato/Bay of Plenty] are appealing for the public's help in dealing with any further cases of avian botulism -- after receiving a report of the deadly waterfowl disease.

Senior Fish & Game Officer Matthew McDougall says some swans are reported to have died from the disease at Lake Rotokawa. He says that with the extended period of hot and humid weather, more cases are likely to occur.

Avian botulism can paralyse and kill birds. Outbreaks are often sparked by warm temperatures and water with low oxygen content, says Matthew. He added that in one outbreak in the past, "botulism killed 2000 birds in just one spot."

Matthew says the disease can affect any water-feeding bird, however, game birds like mallards and swans are especially susceptible.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

There are several types of toxin produced by strains of this bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas Type E toxin in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB

The area around the city of Rotorua, in New Zealand's North Island, contains several lakes. One of the smaller ones is Lake Rotokawa (https://www.myguiderotorua.com/regionalinfo/rotorua-lakes; see map at https://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz1086/Lake-Rotokawa/). - Mod.ML
