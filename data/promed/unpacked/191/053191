[2] Sierra Leone: 5th contact case

Sierra Leone records 5th Ebola case
---------------------------------
The National Ebola Response Center (NERC) of Sierra Leone reported on Fri [11 Sep 2015] another case positive for Ebola virus disease [EVD] in the Sellakafter village in Kambia district, north of Sierra Leone.

This brings the number of people who have been infected with the disease to 5 for the past week. Disclosing this to Xinhua in a telephone interview, the Communication Officer and spokesman for NERC, Sidi Yayah Tunis, said all the cases are relatives of the 67-year-old woman who died of [EVD] about 2 weeks ago in the village.

Tunis explained that "the victim was among a number of high risk cases quarantined in the village" and "took part in the washing and burial of the late lady." Tunis pointed out that one good thing is that "all the infected people are coming from those under quarantine and not outside the quarantine home."

The CEO of NERC, Palo Conteh told a local radio station that the new cases could be attributed to "stubbornness on the part of the relatives who failed to report to the appropriate authorities until it was very late."

He spoke of the proactiveness of the district EVD team in [locating] the lady when she died and was proved positive for [EVD] before she was buried.

He warned all business houses and restaurants that those who do not conform to the Ebola restrictions will be shut down and remain shut down until the end of Ebola epidemic.

Sierra Leone is now in the 15th month in the fight against [EVD] much as "we are winning the war, but the fight is daunting and tough," said Palo Conteh.

[Erison Turay of Sierra Leone is one of nearly 16 000 people who survived the virus. He has founded a soccer team made up of Ebola survivors... During the 1st Ebola survivor's soccer game it was scalding hot, but it was packed. There were hundreds and hundreds of people. I think the people, when they walked in, were very nervous and very curious to see what it was. I mean, I think people had heard bad things about survivors. They had kind of worried about them. But as soon as the game was over, the players were just as accepted in the community as they ever were. It was really a beautiful moment to see not only Erison, but the whole team, embraced and welcomed back into this community and without the stigma and the fear of this virus... - more]

10 Sep 2015: UN health agency [WHO] warns Ebola outbreak in West Africa has "a very nasty sting in its tail"
http://www.gnnliberia.com/articles/2015/09/10/un-health-agency-warns-ebola-outbreak-west-africa-has-%E2%80%98-very-nasty-sting-its
[The United Nations [UN] health agency's special envoy on Ebola response today [10 Sep 2015] projected that the goal of zero transmission in the human population remains "very possible within 2015." Dr. Bruce Aylward, Special Representative on Ebola Response for the World Health Organization (WHO), made those remarks at a press conference in Geneva, following his return from the "hot spots" of the epidemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

He said that despite the "ferocious rainy season" in West Africa, the number of Ebola cases has remained in the single digits for 6 consecutive weeks in Guinea and Sierra Leone. In addition, there are only 3 active chains of transmission in those countries, a development he described as a "major milestone in all 3 countries [Liberia being the 3rd] in the march towards zero" cases. "Our goal is zero transmission in the human population and that remains very possible within 2015," he said.

The senior WHO official said the focus of the current Ebola response was what he called Phase 3, aimed at ensuring that the residual risks are managed and guarding against the re-emergence of the disease, which has claimed more than 11 000 lives, mostly in West Africa.

Dr. Aylward described the remaining challenges as residual risk surveillance, sustaining rapid response teams, and survivor engagement and care, which includes the risks of transmission through semen by male survivors of Ebola. Testing for the status of semen is underway, he said, but other precautions are also being looked into such as the vaccination of sexual partners or family members to reduce the risk if someone tests positive... - more]

29 Sep 2015: Emergence of Ebola Virus Escape Variants in Infected Nonhuman Primates Treated with the MB-003 Antibody Cocktail
http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247%2815%2900923-7.pdf
Summary: MB-003, a plant-derived monoclonal antibody cocktail used effectively in treatment of Ebola virus infection in non-human primates, was unable to protect 2 of 6 animals when initiated one or 2 days post-infection. We characterized a mechanism of viral escape in one of the animals, after observation of 2 clusters of genomic mutations that resulted in 5 non-synonymous mutations in the monoclonal antibody target sites. These mutations were linked to a reduction in antibody binding and later confirmed to be present in a viral isolate that was not neutralized in vitro. Retrospective evaluation of a 2nd independent study allowed the identification of a similar case. Four SNPs in previously identified positions were found in this 2nd fatality, suggesting that genetic drift could be a potential cause for treatment failure. These findings highlight the importance selecting different target domains for each component of the cocktail to minimize the potential for viral escape.

[An African research fund launched in Kenya on Thu 10 Sep 2015 aims to raise the quality of Africa's scientific output and tackle diseases primarily affecting the world's poorest continent, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and Ebola [Ebola virus disease, EVD]. The Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA), based at the African Academy of Sciences in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, aims to draw increased funding from the West and African governments to set up centers of scientific excellence on the continent. "What AESA hopes to achieve is to look at the major diseases that are already epidemics, the neglected tropical diseases ... and the emerging challenges like Ebola, and really build the capacities to try to deal with these challenges," AESA Director Tom Kariuki told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Scientists funded by AESA will work towards creating new vaccines, products and services for diseases that primarily affect Africans.

Summary: The social vulnerability indices used in climate change and natural hazards research can also be used in other contexts such as disease outbreaks, new research suggests. The study illustrates how census and household survey data, when mapped at the district level, can help highlight the locations of households and populations most vulnerable to disease outbreaks such as the Ebola virus disease.

11 Sep 2015: Ebola virus mutations may help it evade drug treatment
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/uamr-evm091115.php
[US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases: Genetic mutations called "escape variants" in the deadly Ebola virus appear to block the ability of antibody-based treatments to ward off infection, according to a team of U.S. Army scientists and collaborators. Their findings, published online this week in the journal _Cell Reports_, have implications for the continued development of therapeutics to treat Ebola virus disease, which has claimed the lives of over 11 000 people in West Africa since last year [2014].

Ebola virus overruns the immune system, thus overwhelming the host's ability to fight off the infection. One strategy for treatment is based on the administration of a "cocktail" of antibodies that have the ability to neutralize the virus and allow the host to mount an effective immune response. One such cocktail, known as MB-003, has demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primates infected with the virus. MB-003 and ZMAb were early formulations used in proof-of-principle trials that led to the more advanced formulation, ZMapp, currently in development and authorized for compassionate use in the West African Ebola outbreak response... - more]
