[1] Saudi Arabia, Al Qasim increase in cases - MOH
Date: Thu 6 Sep 2018
From: Abdallah Assiri [edited]


Recent MERS activity in Saudi Arabia
-----------------------
Human MERS activity in Saudi Arabia increased in the last few days, specifically in Qaseem region. Sporadic cases were reported from different hospitals in the region. They were not healthcare related and not epidemiologically linked, except one case that we think acquired MERS in a dialysis unit. This case shared one dialysis session with another case that had a respiratory illness but was MERS-negative initially and later proved to be MERS-positive.

Infection Control Rapid Response Team (RRT) visited the hospital. High-risk contacts were assessed and found asymptomatic, and nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for MERS in all of them. Follow-up will continue for 14 days after the last exposure. At this moment, we believe that the risk of further secondary transmission is very low.

At this time of year, we usually experience a gradual rise in MERS activity. We alerted hospitals, healthcare workers, and people working with animals. Infection-control audits are ongoing, with a special emphasis on emergency departments and hemodialysis units.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Assiri for a rapid response to our query related to the observed increase in reports of laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV-infected individuals in Al Qaseem region. Hopefully there aren't more cases associated with this dialysis unit in the coming days. - Mod.MPP

[Of the 3 cases on whom outcomes were reported yesterday, Wed 5 Sep 2018, case no. 18-1746 had not been originally classified and was under investigation. It is always dangerous to assume, but one does wonder if this case is the individual who had contact with a MERS-CoV-infected patient in a dialysis unit, as per Dr. Assiri's information. - Mod.MPP]
