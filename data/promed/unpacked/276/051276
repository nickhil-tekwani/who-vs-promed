LOBSTER DECLINE - USA (NY) (02)

I would like to see a reference for the allegation that "traces of
pyrethroid" have been found in Long Island Sound lobsters. I would
especially like to see data that demonstrate that the materials found are
those that are used by mosquito control agencies, since pyrethroids have
many uses. If pesticides from run-off are somehow involved, why are the
many other sources of pesticides besides mosquito control ignored?
Frankly, I have been hearing these allegations for a long time, but where
are the data?
Since we operate on the southern shore of Long Island Sound, we watch this
issue very closely. I can assure you that if the data were there,
environmental groups here would be shouting it from the rooftops.
The moderator did point out that lobsters began dying before the treatments
for WNV began in 1999. Other causes of lobster die-off include infection
that was the proximate cause of death, and that there were unusually high
temperatures, which many experts believe played a very important role in
this reduction of numbers.

[Mr Ninivaggi's point is well taken. If there is evidence to support the
allegation that pesticides are involved, it would be prudent for
researchers to share it. This moderator believes the amounts of run-off of
pesticide or any of the pyrethroids would have to be extremely high to
overcome the effects of dilution of the water. Also, as mentioned before,
there have been die-offs before West Nile virus infection emerged in North
America. Likewise, lobsters are subject to infection, as are other animals.
We wish the lobster population and industry a speedy recovery. We would be
pleased to see some actual data, but until then, this thread is cut. - Mod.TG]
