Coronavirus has been found in mink at 3 more fur farms in Noord Brabant, farming minister Carola Schouten has confirmed.

The infections came to light during compulsory screening introduced since the 1st cases were found in April [2002]. A 4th suspected new outbreak is also under investigation. The disease has now been established at 6 companies and on 8 different locations at the heart of the fur farming industry.

The new cases were identified during early warning research carried out on minks that have died unexpectedly. Some 50 farms have so far sent in minks to be tested through this scheme.

Experts are currently assessing what needs to be done to stop the spread of coronavirus at mink farms, and culling all the animals on affected farms has not been ruled out, Schouten said. More information will be available later this week.

Last month [May 2020], it emerged that at least one fur farm worker had been infected with Covid-19 by a mink. However, the risk to humans remains very small as long as farm workers continue to wear protective clothing, the minister said.

[A press release published by the Dutch government on 1 Jun 2020 named the locations of the mentioned infected mink companies: the municipalities of Gemert-Bakel, Laarbeek, Deurne and Sint Anthonis, all in the province North Brabant. An additional suspected mink company is located in Venray, in the neighboring province Limburg (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nieuws/2020/06/01/nertsenfokkerijen; in Dutch).

The above, the following additional information, and more, are included in a new parliamentary letter by Minister Hugo de Jonge of Health and Minister Carola Schouten of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, submitted to the House of Representatives on Mon 1 Jun 2020.

On 19 May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was officially designated in the Netherlands as an infectious animal disease. It was announced that all mink farms, countrywide, should be systematically examined for the presence of the virus. This includes, in the 1st stage, weekly submissions of naturally dead animals to the laboratories, from all farms. The lab examinations include PM's and PCR tests. The 2nd stage is to include blood tests from all farms for ELISA tests (antibodies).

At the end of last week, the Animal Health Service reported that carcasses from 3 (out of about 50 researched) mink farms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. On Sun 31 May 2020, the carcasses, officially collected by the NVWA, were confirmed positive by the national reference laboratory, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR). This concerned 2 companies in the municipality of Sint Anthonis and a company in the municipality of Gemert-Bakel. During the weekend, a 4th suspicion was added in the municipality of Venray, visited Mon 1 Jun 2020; final results pending.

The parliamentary letter (in Dutch) is available for downloading as a pdf document at https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/06/01/brief-over-stand-van-zaken-covid-19-bij-nertsenbedrijven. - Mod.AS
