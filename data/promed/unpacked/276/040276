ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS - CANADA: 1975-1976

In 1975, during an unprecedented outbreak of St Louis encephalitis(SLE) on
the North American continent, we encountered our first confirmed outbreak
of SLE in Canada. Sixty-six cases were diagnosed in southwestern Ontario
and one case each in the provinces of Quebec and Manitoba. Four cases of
SLE were recognized the following year within the focal area of the
previous epidemic and no cases have been diagnosed since that time. While
this is circumstantial evidence only, it is tempting to speculate that SLE
had overwintered in Ontario, either in adult _Culex pipens_ or in birds.
Something worth keeping in mind in New York City for next year.
