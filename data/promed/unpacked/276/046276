The 1st Irish case of a new tropical disease called Besnoitiosis has been discovered on a cattle farm in Co Tipperary.

The case is the latest in the spread of the parasitic disease to have been formally identified since it was 1st detected in Europe in the 1990s. The case was spotted by a University College Dublin (UCD) vet student, and veterinary practices have now been notified by the Department of Agriculture of the tell-tale signs of the disease to look out for. It can initially resemble IBR [infectious bovine rhinotracheitis], with fever and discharges from the eyes and nose. It can also persist as lumps in the skin in the chronic stages, when animals may not be visibly sick, bar carrying cysts in their eyes or vulva.

Besnoitiosis is a parasite that is similar to toxoplasmosis in sheep or nocardia in cattle. It does not affect people, nor is it a food risk. The discovery continues the trend of diseases moving from tropical and sub-tropical areas to temperate regions due to climate change.

[According to a review published by EFSA in February 2010, _Besnoitia besnoiti_, known to circulate in southern Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America (and not in cattle in North America), was, "according to recent epidemiological data," confirmed as expanding its geographic spread in cattle herds in "some EU member states." EFSA further concluded: "...therefore, bovine besnoitiosis [BB] should be considered an emerging disease in the EU." The paper, available at 20100215.0530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1499.pdf, was reviewed in posting 20100215.0530.

The 1st BB case in Switzerland was reported in posting 20120707.1193311 (July 2012). This posting included Swiss-sourced information on BB's presence in the West European EU members France, Portugal, and Spain and prescribed guidelines for Swiss border examinations of imported animals (German version at http://tinyurl.com/dxkmap4; French at http://tinyurl.com/ckaxfra).

BB is caused by toxoplasma-like organisms, which multiply in endothelial, histiocytic, and other cells, causing changes in the skin, subcutis, blood vessels, mucous membranes, and other tissues in cattle.

Infected cattle often show no clinical signs other than a few cysts in the scleral conjunctiva [of the eye -- see photo below]. Illness begins with fever followed by warm, painful swellings ventrally (anasarca). Swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea, inappetence, photophobia, rhinitis [inflammation of the inside of the nose] and orchitis [inflammtion of the testes] also are seen. Anasarca gives way to sclerodermatitis; the skin becomes hard, thick, and wrinkled and develops cracks that allow secondary bacterial infection and myiasis [infestation with fly larvae] to develop; movement is painful. There is loss of hair and epidermis. In addition to the skin lesions, there may be focal, disseminated myositis [inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue], keratitis
[inflammation of the cornea of the eye], periostitis, endostitis [inflammation on and in the bones], lymphadenitis, pneumonia, periorchitis, orchitis, [scrotal pain], arteritis, and perineuritis. Severely affected animals become emaciated.

Diagnosis can also be made by finding crescent-shaped bradyzoites in skin scrapings, biopsy, or conjunctival scrapings.

Although mortality is low, convalescence is slow in severe cases. Severely affected bulls can become permanently sterile. Affected animals remain carriers for life.

Additional information can be found in the Merck Veterinary Manual (9th edition, 2011) at http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/50500.htm.

Live-attenuated vaccines have been developed; they are produced and are applied on a limited scale in selected animal groups such as imported bulls and breeding cattle in South Africa and Israel.

BB is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases and does not infect humans. - Mod.AS
