The post entitled "Tomato chlorosis virus, tomato - Philippines (Mindanao)"
and dated 25 Jul 2005 was in error.
The title was incorrect and should have read "Tomato leaf curl -
Philippines (Mindanao)", not Tomato chlorosis virus, tomato - Philippines
20030725.2155. It will be changed to the correct title.
ToLCV is a begomovirus, not a closterovirus. The virus is common throughout
India and other Asian countries.
I am grateful to Bob Heisey of United Genetics Seed, Hollister, CA, who
detected my error. I sincerely apologize for my mistake.
