[These updated outbreaks from Libya confirm the recently published (17 Sep 2013, archive number 20130917.1951481) request by ProMED regarding new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in this country communicated by the media.

The WAHID disease time series analysis shows that between January 2011 and September 2013, 54 outbreaks were reported to the OIE: 11 in 2011, 31 in 2012, and 12 in 2013 to date (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries).

The total number of animals affected in the 54 outbreaks is: 4797 susceptible, 2360 cases, 280 dead, and 0 destroyed. Included among the affected species were: camelidae, cattle, goats, and sheep.

Our attention is drawn to the fact that camelids are indicated as a susceptible species. In their last follow-up report Libyan animal health authorities indicate 146 camelids as a susceptible population (on 3 farms, in outbreaks numbers 1, 3 and 6 reported in 2013). According to the OIE's Terrestrial Code, Chapter 8.6. on Foot and mouth disease, Article 8.6.1., _Camelus dromedarius_ is not considered a ruminant, apparently because, in contrast to other camelidae, this species is not susceptible to FMD ("For the purposes of this chapter, ruminants include animals of the family of Camelidae [except _C. dromedarius _]" -- http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.6.htm). Since Camels in Libya are single-humped (_C. dromedarius_), these 146 animals should not have been included among the susceptible species.

According to the OIE's Terrestrial Manual, amongst the camelidae, Bactrian camels and new world camelids have been shown to be susceptible (Larska et al., 2009) (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf).

Details of each outbreak can be found at the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary (note: to view the information on FMD, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).

Information about the recent isolates, including in the afore-mentioned site, is as follows:
- FMDV SAT 2 (2012): topotype VII. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00010%20SAT2%20Libya%202012.pdf;
- FMDV O (2012): topotype EA-3. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00021%20O%20Libya%202012.pdf;
- FMDV A (2009): topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Iran-05. Genotyping at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-00011-Libya-A.pdf

For this series of events, which date back to 2011, the outbreaks are primarily attributed to serotypes O and A. However, it is important to note that there is one immediate notification communicated to the OIE in 2012 which was attributed to serotype SAT2 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=11741). Therefore it is of interest that the inactivated vaccine used only includes bivalent, A and O. Is SAT2 not circulating any more? Or is SAT2 restricted to a limited zone of the country? These questions are raised because it is unclear if SAT2 is widely dispersed throughout the country or is in fact just limited to a certain area. From the official reports submitted, the events include all 3 serotypes (event started 2011:A,O and event started 2012:SAT2) and are reported as affecting the entire country and not just a certain zone.

A 22 percent mortality rate in cattle is noted. Although the age of the cattle is not indicated, this high mortality rate could be due to the fact that these cattle were young. The disease is rarely fatal in adult animals, but there is often high mortality in young animals due to myocarditis or from lack of milk when the dam is infected by the disease.

The severity of clinical signs varies with the strain of virus, the exposure dose, the age and breed of animal, the host species and the immunity of the animal. The signs can range from a mild or inapparent infection to one that is severe (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf). - Mods.CRD/AS
