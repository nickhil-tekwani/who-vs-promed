From: Jon B. Bruss <jonbruss@mtccnmi.com>

We have had a single case of serologically confirmed dengue fever in a
patient who had recently traveled to Kiribati. The patient had hemorrhagic
dengue but not dengue shock syndrome.
The only known vector on Saipan is _Aedes albopictus_.
An investigation for possible secondary transmission is underway.

[We thank Dr. Bruss for this rapid response. In addition, we had a message
from Dr. Joseph Kevin Villagomez, Secretary of Health for the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, relaying much the same information, and a
message from someone on Saipan who had not seen anything in the newspapers
or heard any rumors of dengue there. Obviously there is no epidemic,
outbreak or cluster of cases, just a single imported case of dengue, which
happens all over the world.
This rapid response to our request for information demonstrates how
remarkable are modern communications (in this case, 24 hours from receipt
of rumor to final report) and how careful we must be in drawing inferences
from preliminary reports. As I see it, one of the major drawbacks to
ProMED-mail is that our reports are not 100% definitive 100% of the time.
We are not a scientific journal; we only attempt to get news (warnings?)
out as soon as possible. This requires balancing what may be rumors with
what may be real news. An onerous task, but we eventually get it right, so
our subscribers should bear with us. Better to have some warning than to
have no warning, as I see it. - Mod.CHC]
