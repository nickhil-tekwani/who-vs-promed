Texas anthrax situational update no. 5
--------------------------------------
Since the July 29, 2019 update, anthrax has been detected on 2 new premises in Crockett County and 2 new Sutton County premises. Anthrax has been previously confirmed in both counties this year [2019].

[See counties in the map of Texas at the source URL above]

The newly identified premises are located in the following areas:
- 1 premise is in central Crockett County;
- 1 premise is in east central Crockett County;
- 1 premise is in northwest Sutton County;
- 1 premise is in central Sutton County

The Texas Animal Health Commission quarantined the premises after animals tested positive for the reportable disease. Anthrax quarantines are typically lifted 10 days from vaccination or the last death loss.

To date, 18 premises in 5 Texas counties have had animals confirmed with anthrax. Animals include the following species: antelope, goat, horses, deer, and cattle. Producers have been advised on vaccinating exposed animals and have been instructed on the proper disposal of affected carcasses, as outlined by TAHC's rules.

2. Kinney / 1
3. Sutton / 9

The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides benefits to eligible livestock owners for livestock deaths caused by eligible loss conditions. Anthrax is identified as an eligible disease.

[My one-time grad student reported back to me at the end of last week (week of 29 Jul 2019) as they were wrapping up this anthrax safari and the many samples collected. A notable aspect of this epidemic is that the old hands are largely silent. It is the new ranch owners who are talking and requesting help and advice. The losses on these ranches, and presumably the other quiet affected ranches, are significant. - Mod.MHJ
