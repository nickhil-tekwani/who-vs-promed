Malaria, imported - Germany 1999
---------------------------------
A provisional total of 918 cases reported in 1999 is likely to increase by
about another 100. The age and sex distribution of malaria cases (58% aged
25 to 44 years, over two-thirds male) reflects the population of travelers
and immigrants. In 1999, 60% of malaria cases were Germans, who acquired
the infection while traveling, mostly in Africa (80%), but also in Asia
(8.5%), the Americas (5.2%), and Oceania (1.5%). Eighty per cent of cases
of malaria in 1999 were caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_. _P. vivax_
accounted for 12%, and _P. ovale_, _P. malariae_, mixed, and unspecified
infections accounted for the rest.
Sixty-nine per cent of patients spent only one to four weeks in an endemic
area. Holiday makers formed the largest group of cases; 17% became ill
while abroad for professional reasons. Of the cases notified in 1999 only
7% had used a mosquito net, 5% only repellents, 6% both, and 61% of cases
had not used chemoprophylaxis. Only 14% of the 32% who claimed to have used
chemoprophylaxis took their drugs regularly. Over half of those who took
drugs took them irregularly and stopped taking them too early.
15 male cases and 5 females died from malaria in 1999, among them a child.
All deaths were caused by _P. falciparum_; 19 cases acquired the infection
in Africa (11 in Kenya) and one in the Dominican Republic or Haiti. 13 of
the fatal cases had not taken chemoprophylaxis, 3 had taken chloroquine,
and 2 mefloquine.
The unsatisfactory situation with respect to malaria is similar to that
reported in previous years, with respect to the number of cases, the number
of deaths, and the lack of attention paid to recommendations for
chemoprophylaxis.

[Approximately 20 000 cases of malaria are imported into Europe annually.
Case fatality rates are difficult to get, but data from the United Kingdom
show that approximately 0.5% die from the infection. The figure of 2.2%
reported here must therefore be considered high. Malaria is in principle an
infection which can be treated, and fatalities are due to a mixture of
patient and physician delays. 19 of the 20 patients who died returned from
Africa and it would be interesting to know which kind of prophylaxis they
were advised to use, but perhaps more important, if the hospitals were able
to cope adequately with complicated, drug resistant malaria. -Mod.EP
