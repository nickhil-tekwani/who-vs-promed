The [number of cases] of meningitis in [the Brazilian state of] Bahia
continues to increase. [As of] Thursday [10 Dec 2009], there were
2218 cases reported to the Directorate of Health Information by the
Secretary of Health of the State (Sesab). The capital of Bahia
[Salvador] leads the notifications, with 1445 [cases], followed by
Vitoria da Conquista, with 157 and Irece, with 103. With the increase
of cases, the number of deaths also increased accordingly. In Bahia,
138 deaths were reported.

According to the epidemiological bulletin of Sesab in 2009, [as of]
the 5th of this month [December 2009], there were 178 cases of
meningococcal disease (serogroup C), with 48 deaths confirmed in the
state. In the previous year [2008], were 137 cases of meningitis,
with 26 deaths. Salvador [the capital of the state] is experiencing
an increase in the number of cases of [serogroup] C disease, with 56
cases and 15 deaths reported in 2008 and 100 cases and 25 deaths
reported in 2009, 44 percent more than in 2008, according to the
epidemiological bulletin.

Confirmed cases of meningitis in Bahia in 2009 occurred in 43
municipalities, with the highest incidences reported in: Nazareth,
Porto Seguro, Formosa do Rio Preto, Antonio Cardoso e Itacare.

According to Sesab, meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of

bacteria, viruses, fungi, and noninfectious agents and some
chemicals. It occurs throughout the year with predominance during the
colder periods.

[The state of Bahia is one of 26 states of Brazil and is located in
the northeastern part of the country on the Atlantic coast; it can be
seen on the map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/brazil.jpg>. The population
of Bahia in 2008 was 14 109 000; about 70 percent live in cities, the
largest of which is the capital, Salvador, with a population of 2.8
million (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia>). The population of
Vitoria da Conquista is 300 000.

Assuming meningococcus serogroup C is the cause of meningitis in the
unconfirmed cases, then the attack rate for Bahia is 15.7 per 100
000; and for Salvador, 51.6 per 100 000; and for Vitoria da
Conquista, 52.3 per 100 000. For those with confirmed serogroup C
meningitis, the attack rate for Bahia is 1.26 per 100 000 and for
Salvador, 3.6 per 100 000. However, the time period over which these
cases occurred is not specified in the news release, other than that
they occurred in 2009.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease has been defined as the
occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period
of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease
attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is about
10 times greater than the normal occurrence
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>. Further
information would be appreciated as to the time line during which the
cases of meningitis occurred in Bahia and probable etiologies in the
unconfirmed cases.

The state of Bahia and its capital, Salvador can be seen on the map at
