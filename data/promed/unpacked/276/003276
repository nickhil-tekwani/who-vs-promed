[On 5 Sep 2013, an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) was reported in Guinea in the Siguiri prefecture, see ProMED-mail archive number 20130906.1926591. Guinea veterinary authorities indicated that the event was resolved on 22 Aug 2013. See Guinea's final report sent to the OIE http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14098.

According to this final report, the affected animals (Siguiri's outbreak) belonged to farmers moving between Mali and Guinea. Infection was detected when these farmers returned to Guinea. Precautionary measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease to other herds. This included a vaccination campaign throughout the region which started in August 2013 and is scheduled to end in December 2013.

The Beyla prefecture, where the current outbreak was reported, is located in southeastern Guinea in the Konyan region http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyla,_Guinea. The distance between the Beyla and Siguiri prefectures is about 310 km http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Guinea_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Beyla(Beyla)&toplace=Siguiri(Siguiri)&fromlat=8.6833333&tolat=11.4166667&fromlng=-8.6333333&tolng=-9.1666667.
