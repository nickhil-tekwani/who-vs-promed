African swine fever [ASF] has been reported from 2 farms at Mananthavady in Kerala's Wayanad district, officials said today [22 Jul 2022]. The disease was confirmed after the samples were tested at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal.

An official from the animal husbandry department told news agency Press Trust of India that the samples were sent for testing after pigs at one of the farms died en masse. "Now the test result has confirmed the infection. Directions have been issued to cull 300 pigs of the second farm," the official said.

The department said steps are being taken to prevent the disease from being spread.

[Since the first ASF outbreaks occurred in Assam State in January-April 2020, ASF outbreaks have been reported in the Indian states Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Bihar, Tripura, and -- most recently -- Uttar Pradesh (initially, undiagnosed). In view of the spread in the above northern states, the southern Kerala State government declared the state as a "controlled area" and banned the transportation of pigs, pork and pork products, pig waste to and from the state for 30 days from 14 Jul 2022, to mitigate the risk of ASF introduction from other affected states (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/state-on-alert-against-african-swine-fever/articleshow/92944625.cms). Just a week later, the first local outbreaks have been reported in Kerala.

This may be indicative of a wider spread of the virus throughout the Indian subcontinent than hitherto identified.

Additional updated information on the ASF situation and the control measures adopted in India and other Asian countries is available in the 21 Jul 2022 update of FAO-EMPRES ASF situation update, available at https://www.fao.org/animal-health/situation-updates/asf-in-asia-pacific. - Mod.AS
