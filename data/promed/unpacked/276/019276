Leptospirosis, which made the news over the summer after numerous people contracted the disease while swimming in natural springs in northern Israel, shows no signs of relenting. At the end of August 2018, 462 people were diagnosed with the disease, but by mid-September 2018, the figure grew to 620 diagnosed, with 146 hospitalized.

Due to leptospirosis, many sites in the north are still closed. The Ministry of Health (MOH) warned that the water sites still pose danger to visitors and that the prohibition on entering many streams remains in force.

The Majrassa Nature reserve, one of the most popular sites in the southern Golan Heights, reopened a few days ago. The rest of the sites in the area are still closed, including the Jordan Park, the Hexagons ("Meshushim") pool, the El Al & the Zavitan streams, and others. To the displeasure of people involved in tourism in the Golan Heights, the Health Ministry has yet to remove the warnings about the danger. Business owners in the area reported cancellations and heavy economic losses, which had not been felt to a similar extent even during the most difficult security periods in the past.

According to MOH guidelines, it is possible to travel in the Golan Heights, but travelers are required to be careful in places where there are warning signs against entering the water. The web-sites of the Nature & Parks Authority and of MOH are continuously updated about the permitted and banned (due to contamination) water sites.

Abstract:
We report preliminary findings of a large outbreak of human leptospirosis with 36 confirmed/probable and 583 suspected cases from June-August 2018, linked to contaminated water bodies in Northern Israel. There was a travel-associated case in Germany; additional cases are being investigated in other countries. The presumed chain of transmission, implicating wild boar and cattle, raises multiple challenges for risk assessment, risk management and risk communication currently being addressed by a public health response team.

[See full article (7 pages) at the source URL above for a map, tables, figures, references, discussion.

For subscribers' convenience, the paper's paragraph "Outbreak description" is hereby copied (references omitted):

"As of 31 Aug 2018, 619 suspected cases of leptospirosis had been notified to the MOH, of which 33 were laboratory-confirmed and 3 were probable. The remaining cases had initial negative MAT and/or PCR (leptospirosis not ruled out). The epidemic curve of the outbreak is shown in Figure 1. Retrospective case finding identified a confirmed case of infection afflicting a water inspector dating back to June 2018. The characteristics of laboratory-confirmed cases are summarised in Table 1.

"Of the 33 laboratory-confirmed and 3 probable cases, 31 were male, and the median age was 20 years (mean 25, range 7-64). The incubation period ranged from 2-21 days (mean 9.9 days, median 10 days). Influenza-like symptoms were common while rash and conjunctivitis were rare. The majority (n = 31) of confirmed cases were hospitalised; 12 had hepatic or renal involvement, and one patient developed pneumonia. Three were reported to have been admitted to an intensive-care unit; no deaths were reported. There was one travel-associated case reported in a German tourist who developed severe leptospirosis; it is thought that this case was exposed in early June 2018."

As shown in figure 1, titled: "The epidemic curve of the outbreak," the event initially started in June 2018, becoming public in mid-August 2018, a week before it peaked. It has not been resolved yet and is expected to continue its deleterious effect upon the region's tourism industry during the week of the Sukkot festival (Biblical Feast of Booths or Tabernacles), which starts Mon 24 Sep 2018.

The bacteriological aspects of the event are addressed in the following sections of the paper (copied in entirety):

"The National Reference Laboratory for Leptospirosis (Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), Ness Ziona), mounted a surge response in order to process a large number of clinical samples by means of a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogenic leptospires (targeting the 16S rRNA and the LipL32 genes) and microagglutination test (MAT). A real-time PCR testing of water for the implicated water bodies has also been performed on a 'research use only' basis

"Positive serological tests by MAT were reactive against a range of serovars as commonly seen in early leptospirosis. The Pomona and Burgas antigens (Serovars Pomona and Balcanica, respectively) were particularly reactive (7 and 10 cases, respectively) with titres ranging from 1:200 to 1:1600. The Pomona serovar, in particular, is naturally adapted to wild boar and there have been recent reports from the Israeli veterinary authorities on the emergence of _L. Pomona_ infection in wild boar and cattle in Northern Israel [4]."

Reference [4], mentioned above, a review, is available at http://www.promedmail.org/post/5973544. The review, authored by M.D. Bernstein, presented concise information on the epidemiology of leptospirosis in animals in Israel during the last 25 years; it did not include 2018 data. The author remarked [excerpted]: "We have yet to be informed as to which serovar is implicated in the recent rise in human exposure. Both _Leptospira hardjo_ and _L. pomona_ could potentially contaminate pools of water or streams in recreation areas where either free-range beef cattle or wildlife congregate. A serological survey to monitor beef cattle herds has been initiated to provide the basis for a program to try to reduce the contamination of water sources and natural pools."

So far, results obtained during the mentioned serological survey, and findings from sampled boars, have not become available. The epidemiological studies of the event and in particular those of the causative agent in humans are yet to be completed on the genetic level. This will, hopefully, be accomplished soon and be coordinated with animal health investigators. The direct link between human and animal infection by a common zoonotic pathogen is yet to be unequivocally demonstrated, requiring close cooperation and coordination between the relevant institutions. - Mod.AS
