A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

In response to the ProMED-mail posting in the digest: ProMED-AHEAD
Digest V2007 #114, there was some work done on risk factors and
clinical disease in small animals that is available in the following
2 journal articles. I believe CVJ [Canadian Veterinary Journal] is a
freely available journal.
1. Duncan C, Stephen C, Campbell J: Clinical characteristics and
predictors of mortality for _Cryptococcus gattii_ infection in dogs
and cats of southwestern British Columbia. Can Vet J. 2006 Oct; 47(10):993-8.
2. Duncan, CG, Stephen, C, Campbell, J. Evaluation of risk factors
for _Cryptococcus gattii_ infection in dogs and cats. J Am Vet Med
Assoc. 2006 Feb 1;228(3):377-82.
Regarding exposure and infection without clinical disease we also
published 2 papers in Medical Mycology that may be of interest to some readers.
1. Duncan C, Stephen C, Lester S, Bartlett KH. Sub-clinical infection
and asymptomatic carriage of _Cryptococcus gattii_ in dogs and cats
during an outbreak of cryptococcosis. Med Mycol. 2005 Sep;43(6):511-6.
2. Duncan C, Stephen C, Lester S, Bartlett KH. Follow-up study of
dogs and cats with asymptomatic _Cryptococcus gattii_ infection or
nasal colonization. Med Mycol. 2005 Nov; 43(7):663-6.
