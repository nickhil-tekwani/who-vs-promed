Outbreak of Q fever in South Australia
---------------------------------------
South Australia is dealing with its largest outbreak of Q fever in more
than a decade. It has been confirmed that 9 farmers in the state's
mid-north have the disease, and there are another 6 suspected cases.
Dr. Jack Shephard, from Jamestown, says anyone who comes into contact with
sheep, cattle, goats, or kangaroos could contract the disease. Shephard
says it's likely his patients got it from the local sheep saleyards in
October 2004.
He said, "We've had people racing in demanding to be tested straight away,
but testing is not simple. We have to prepare a special batch of skin
testing. It's been excellent publicity to make people realize they should
really come and be tested if they're going to handle sheep or goats or any
other animals like them in the future."

8 come down with Q Fever
---------------------------
Health authorities are still trying to work out why 8 people in the
mid-north town of Jamestown in South Australia have been struck by Q Fever.
Another 5 suspected cases are being investigated.
Authorities say people with the disease will feel like they have got the
worst case of influenza they have ever had. Dr. Rod Givney, from the
Department of Health, says that, in some cases, victims can spend weeks or
months in the hospital recovering. He says the people who have Q Fever have
all had contact with sheep, but the department still does not know what the
exact link is.
Dr. Givney says the department needs to talk to the people and compare
their stories before they get a final answer.

[Q (query) fever, caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, the "query" fever
bacterium, is the only common rickettsia to be transmitted usually by
aerosol rather than through an arthropod vector. Most aerosol exposures are
direct from animal to human. It is possible that this is a common source
outbreak, although no detailed epidemiologic information is given.
Worldwide, this zoonosis is primarily found in cattle, sheep, and goats,
but many mammals and birds may also be infected. The diagnosis is usually
serological, as it presumably was in this outbreak, and the illness is most
commonly either a self-limited febrile illness lasting up to 2 weeks, or,
pneumonia with, or without, hepatitis. - Mod.LL]
