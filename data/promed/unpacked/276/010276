The health minister in the Kurdish autonomous region said today [12
Oct 2008], 37 people have been infected by anthrax in northern Iraq
in the country's 1st outbreak of the disease since the 1980s. The
Iraqi health minister, Ziryan Othman, said the disease appeared to
have been passed on from livestock. The 1st human case of the
outbreak was discovered in remote Dahuk province last month
[September 2008]. None of the reported cases had yet proven fatal, he
said. The 37 cases in humans have all affected the patients' skin,
rather than their lungs or internal organs, as occurs in more serious
anthrax cases.

Mr Othman said the authorities have ordered that infected animals be
slaughtered and buried, while animals not yet infected should be vaccinated.

"The health and agriculture ministries are trying to contain this
disease, because if it is spread among animals and then is
transferred to humans it will have a negative effect on the economy," he said.

[Thanks to the unrest in the country current animal disease reports
to OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) are lacking. There is a
singular Handistatus report for 2004 involving 78 outbreaks in sheep
and goats with 156 cases and 108 deaths; in that year 424 878 sheep
and goats were vaccinated out of a national flock of 15 million
animals (see
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=91&c_mald=20>).

Between 1976 and 1980 between 200 and 269 human cases in Iraq were
reported each year. In 1981 there were 74 human cases. This renewal
of local human reporting might be taken as an indicator of the
relative peace in the north and the increased prosperity there.

When I visited Erzurum in eastern Turkey in 2006 it was made clear to
me that their southern border was porous to livestock movements and
therefore to the anthrax situations in the adjoining 2 countries. Put
another way the disease was enzootic in the Kurdish areas. Dahuk
forms about three quarters of the Iraq/Turkey border. Elsewhere, who
knows at this time, as the veterinary services are less than
rudimentary. - Mod.MHJ]
