In Sweden, there have been more than 100 coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours. More than 100 people who had been infected with the new coronavirus died in 24 hours in Sweden, according to the count published Tuesday [7 Apr 2020] at 2 p.m. by the public health agency.

The country of 10.3 million inhabitants had adopted more flexible measures to contain the progression of the virus but now counts 7693 cases of infection and deplores 591 deaths, a mortality clearly higher than that observed in its northern neighbors. However, the agency notes, of the 114 new deaths recorded on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], part comes from revised figures for the past few days.

Maharashtra, on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], breached the 1000 mark with 150 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, taking the tally to 1018, the highest for any Indian state. Tamil Nadu has 690 positive cases, while Delhi reported 525 cases until 9 p.m. on 7 Apr [2020].

This is the steepest one-day rise in Maharashtra since the outbreak, state health department officials said.

Of the 150 new cases reported on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], 116 are from Mumbai, which accounts for 642 cases, the highest among Indian cities. Pune recorded 18 cases on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], while Nagpur, Aurangabad, and Ahmednagar reported 2 each. Maharashtra recorded 12 COVID-19-related deaths on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], taking the state's death toll to 64. Six of the 12 deaths were reported from Mumbai, followed by 3 in Pune, and one each in Nagpur, Thane, and Satara. According to the state health department, 34 695 people have been put in home quarantine, while 4008 are in institutional quarantine.

The department said 20 877 tests (5564 of them in private laboratories) have been carried out so far across the state, resulting in 1018 positive cases. Seventy-nine patients have been discharged after complete recovery, officials said.

The rise in numbers necessitated a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], held via video conference as some of the ministers were in their constituencies.

Senior government officials told HT that ministers pressed for additional testing facilities to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. "The government is likely to seek permission for more labs for testing," an official said. A private laboratory can start testing only if it is certified by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

In March [2020], Maharashtra had applied for and received permission to set up at least 7 private laboratories, in addition to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and Kasturba Hospital Lab in Mumbai. "We have increased the number to more than 1500 tests per day," a state government official said.

According to a minister who attended the cabinet meeting, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said the lockdown in the state is unlikely to be lifted on 14 Apr [2020].

[The minister] said, quoting Thackeray, "The lockdown has helped Maharashtra contain the spread of the virus. Maharashtra was the first to impose restrictions in the 2nd week of March [2020]. When the number of patients is rising, we cannot lift the lockdown next week."

Thackeray also clarified that even if the government decides to partially lift the lockdown, after reviewing the situation early next week, it would be within districts and only for unaffected areas. He said that the district borders will remain sealed, and the resumption of train services was unlikely.

The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health [FOPH] said the number of COVID-19 infections in Switzerland and the principality of Liechtenstein reached 22 242 on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], 590 more than the previous day, and stated that the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Switzerland is 641.

Approximately 167 000 tests have been performed for COVID-19 so far, of which 15% were positive. The age of laboratory-confirmed cases ranged from 0-108 years, with a median age of 53 years (50% of the cases were younger and 50% older than this age). Adults were significantly more affected than children.

Most Swiss are satisfied with authorities' response to COVID-19 despite calls to revive the economy, RTS television reported on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], citing a Sotomo Institute poll for SSR released the same day [7 Apr 2020].

Simonetta Sommaruga, president of the Swiss Confederation, traveled to the canton of Vaud on Tuesday [7 Apr 2020], one of the cantons most affected by COVID-19. After visiting the emergency and intensive care units of the CHUV (Center Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois) in Lausanne, she said that she was "deeply moved and full of gratitude" for the nursing staff and all those who work alongside her. "Our healthcare system is working well; it is holding up," she said.

The GBV AoR is the global-level forum for coordination and collaboration on GBV prevention and response in humanitarian settings.

Emergency medical teams (EMT) initiative
-----------------------------------------
- Over 100 emergency medical teams (EMT) and focal points worldwide are working closely with the EMT secretariat, and are continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international COVID-19 response operations.
- As of 5 Apr [2020], 5 international EMTs have been deployed to 8 countries; 29 EMTs are supporting and reinforcing local national health systems across all regions. EMTs are also involved in discussions to strengthen capacity and support to countries in Africa. In addition, WHO is working with EMTs worldwide to identify technical experts and coordinators who can support integrated public health and clinical teams.
- WHO has finalised technical guidance on COVID-19 community facilities and treatment centers, pre-hospital emergency medical services recommendations, and recommendations for medical surge capacity and deployments of EMTs. A modular training package on COVID-19 is currently being developed for the EMT workforce.

Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) deployments and partnership activities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- WHO has deployed 59 experts from 27 partner institutions and technical networks to support countries. Twenty-two partners of the GOARN Capacity Development Network are meeting this week to strengthen coordination of training and capacity-building activities.
- The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF, and WHO are supporting Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE) with a special focus on highly vulnerable populations, and integration of humanitarian partners to support social distancing solutions among migrants and in camp settings. This week's focus is mask guidance among the general population, and in the event of easing of movement restrictions. The partnership is also looking at social science and community insights, including perception surveys and community engagement during lockdowns, to explore guidance, operational challenges, and lessons learned from ongoing experience.

Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) research activities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GOARN research activities include:
- Creating a repository of RCCE data collection tools to aid researchers and public health organizations to roll out rapid assessments in their communities of interest. If you would like to contribute, please contact Dr Jeni Stolowat <jstolow@tulane.edu>.
- Coordination with field epidemiology training programmes, regional and global networks, and alumni networks on exchange of protocols and tools for investigations and response.
- Coordination of global partners to support the WHO COVID-19 Research Innovation and Research Roadmap Social Science Working Group. Ongoing research includes psycho-social impact of community-based interventions, psychosocial assessment of healthcare workers (HCWs), HCW readiness for COVID-19 infection prevention and control, home-based care delivery, and decision-making for palliative care.
- Knowledge management of COVID-19-related information, including identification of research findings and channeling of findings to appropriate audiences; and development of a process for rapid literature searches/reviews. For information on the above activities, please contact Dr. Lina Moses at <lmoses2@tulane.edu>.

Critical supply chains and goods
--------------------------------
- UNICEF is leading joint UN efforts to access substantial quantities of critical items such as PPE and supplies for intensive care, through a joint tender where the overall allocation principles of supplies will be guided by WHO and the Supply Chain Inter-Agency Coordination Cell. The detailed process is under development.
