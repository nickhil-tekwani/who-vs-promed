Wheat issues "unprecedented"
----------------------------
The damage to Missouri's wheat crop is "unprecedented", according to Bill Wiebold, University of Missouri. Reports of vomitoxin in the state's wheat are "everywhere."

Wayne Flanery, University of Missouri Extension, [says] the problem started with stripe rust and the combination of issues is the worst he's seen, "We've had scabby wheat occasionally every year but I think with both of those problems together, it just complicates things." He says the wheat disease problems are taking a toll financially.

Flanery says wheat yields in Missouri vary. Missouri is one of a number of states with similar wheat disease problems because of prolonged wet weather.

[Head blight
-----------
Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called ear blight, scab) of small grain cereal crops (wheat, barley, rye, oats, maize) is caused by several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_. FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent and reduces the grade of harvested grain. The fungi can also cause foot rot and seedling blight and form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings and adult plants. Current names of the fungi include _Gibberella zeae_ (previously _Fusarium graminearum_), _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Fusarium_ or _Microdochium nivale_), and _Microdochium majus_. The pathogens are favoured by humid conditions.

Depending on fungal strains involved and environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins (including vomitoxin). The total crop may be lost because of toxin levels. The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues, spores are spread by wind, water, mechanical means and with infected plant material (including seeds). For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management includes fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, long crop rotations with non-hosts, and planting of cereal varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide. Re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported from the UK (ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497). In Canada, the emergence of a new FHB strain with increased mycotoxin levels has been reported in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211).

Stripe rust
-----------
Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
