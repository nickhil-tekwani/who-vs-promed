The NHS [National Health Service] Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) [Clinical Commissioning Groups, which are responsible for delivery of NHS services in England https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_commissioning_group] have released an update in the Strep A [Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_] outbreak, which has taken the lives of 13 people.

There have been 35 people in total affected by the Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) [invasive GAS infection] outbreak in mid and west Essex. There have been 32 cases confirmed by the CCG and 3 further probable cases noted.

Today [Tue 6 Aug 2019], they have confirmed that the 2 cases in west Essex were part of the outbreak discovered in mid Essex.

They say the patients affected are older people in the Braintree District and the neighbouring area in west Essex, Chelmsford city and the Maldon district. The majority of patients were receiving treatment for wounds, with some in care homes but most in their own homes, report the Mid Essex CCG.

A statement released on their website reads: "As part of the investigation, Public Health England has undertaken Whole Genome Sequencing of the GAS bacteria found in patients within the outbreak. Since the 2 cases in west Essex were identified, samples from these cases were analysed to check whether they were part of this outbreak, and this process has confirmed that they are linked to the outbreak in mid Essex.

Whole Genome Sequencing is used within a Public Health laboratory setting to investigate differences and similarities in the DNA sequence of bacteria. This method allows Public Health England to check which iGAS cases are genetically linked and which are not. This is done by analysing the DNA sequence of each bacterial sample collected from patients within this outbreak."

[This outbreak of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection (32 cases with now 13 deaths, which had been previously 12 deaths, since February 2019) is reported to be occurring in Essex, a county in the southeast of England, northeast of London (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex). Cases are occurring mainly in the Essex districts of Braintree (population 147 084 residents), with smaller numbers in Maldon (population 64 000 residents) and Chelmsford (population 176 200 residents) and a few cases are occurring in other Essex districts; see previous ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK: (England) fatal, RFI

A map of England showing the location of Essex can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex and a map of Essex showing the location of these districts can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/england/counties/essex-map.html; according to this map, Braintree and Chelmsford appear to be located in mid Essex and Maldon in east Essex.

The above news report says that whole genome sequencing of the clinical isolates of GAS has identified an outbreak strain and has linked cases occurring in west Essex and mid Essex. - Mod.ML
