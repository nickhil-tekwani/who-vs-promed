[It is now 6 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report there are 4 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 3 in Guangdong and 1 in Heilongjiang. In the past week, there have been a total of 9 locally transmitted infections confirmed in Guangdong. It is now one week since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? There were a total of 42 newly confirmed cases of which 38 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 907 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3336 deaths, representing an increase of 42 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (8 Apr 2020) report, and 1 newly reported death (in Hubei). An additional 3 suspected cases were newly reported, all in imported cases, 2 in Inner Mongolia and 1 in Shanghai. 13 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 38 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1141. There are an additional 53 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine translated report above, there were 47 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 14 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1097. 349 of these are importations from abroad. There were 14 originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours -- all were imported cases.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and ended it in Wuhan on, 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing.. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong that is of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

Additional information from the English Language website from 9 Apr 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):
Clusters of interest and concern
--------------------------------
- From a bar (Liquid Soul) in Seocho-gu, Seoul, 4 cases have been confirmed since [6 Apr 2020]. Epidemiological investigation is underway.
- From a wine bar (UnWined) in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, 4 additional cases have been confirmed since [4 Apr 2020]. In total, 17 cases (wine bar = 13; family/acquaintances of confirmed cases = 4) have been confirmed. (The figures on Table 2 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of [9 Apr 2020] and may differ from above.)
- In addition, 2 cases were confirmed who were workers at a nightlife entertainment venue in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Since nightlife venues tend to be closed spaces which make it easier for infectious viruses to spread, KCDC asked people to be particularly cautious about such venues.

Nightlife entertainment venues are under limited operation on the condition that they follow the infectious disease prevention and control guidelines. The venues that remain in operation must strictly comply with the guidelines set forth by the infectious disease prevention and control authorities including disinfection, ventilation, distancing between users, and mandatory mask wearing.

Gene mutation monitoring
------------------------
- KCDC is continuously monitoring for any occurrence of gene mutations in the virus responsible for COVID-19.
- To date, no significant gene mutations affecting infectivity or pathogenicity of the virus has been found based on the results of analysis of 73 viral gene sequences obtained from patients in Korea.

Pooled testing
--------------
- To improve testing efficiency, KCDC and Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine has jointly prepared a protocol for pooled testing.
Pooled testing (or sample pooling) is a method in which biological samples from multiple people are combined into a testing pool and tested via a single test. In the case of a positive result, individual testing is carried out in previously reserved samples. This method is useful for screening asymptomatic high-risk groups.

Importations
------------
- In light of the continued rise in the number of imported cases, KCDC again urged inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to comply with home quarantine guidelines.
- Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the self-quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels, or other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 27 cases and 4 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (7-8 Apr 2020) when there were 39 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 450 confirmed cases, including 208 deaths were reported today, up from 10 423 cases and 204 deaths yesterday [8 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 15 consecutive days and below 50 for 2 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 65.1% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.7% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported no newly confirmed cases. Gyeonggi reported (33.3%) of the newly confirmed cases, followed by Gyeongbuk (25.9%) and Seoul (18.5%). Quarantined imported cases represented 14.8% of the newly confirmed cases, with 4 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. 12 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

The English language update of 9 Apr 2020 is noteworthy for the presentation of clusters by province, as well as data analyses demonstrating that a major problem/concern for the country is imported cases. As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 352 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Also as in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/coronavirus-updates-iran-covid-19-deaths-cross-4-000-but-figures-show-drop-in-new-cases-2208968


Iran's health ministry on Thursday [9 Apr 2019] said 117 new deaths from the novel coronavirus took the total to 4110 in one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic.

But ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the latest figures showed there was a downward trend in the number of new coronavirus infections. "Today [9 Apr 2020] we are clearly seeing a decline in the number of new cases," Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. "We have identified 1634 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 66 220."

The spokesman praised the people of Iran for following guidelines aimed at stopping the spread of the disease. "We owe the reduction in the number of cases of the disease to... our beloved people, as well as to the intervention of our colleagues in the health system. "In the past 24 hours, we have lost 117 people. We have had a total of 4110 deaths due to the COVID-19 disease."

Iran, which announced its 1st COVID-19 cases on [19 Feb 2020], is by far the worst hit by the pandemic in the Middle East, according to official tolls.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s. As of today [9 Apr 2020], totals of 152 446 cases and 15 238 deaths have been reported, up from 146 690 cases and 14 555 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 204.7. It is 1st in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 152 446 cases, approximately 66 579 (43.7%) have been hospitalized and 7671 (5.0%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data. The crude reported case fatality rate is 10.0%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7207551,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]

The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has warned coronavirus [COVID-19] poses "an existential threat to our continent." Evidence from past crises shows not everyone is affected equally; the most vulnerable people invariably suffer the worst. This threat will strike worst at the 53 million-or-so people living in the thousands of dense informal settlements, or slums, that pack sub-Saharan Africa's fast-growing cities.

The risk is particularly high in slums because of the combination of poverty and poor planning. Poverty leads to fewer choices -- do you spend your money on food or medicine? -- and few safety nets. Poor planning, if any, has led to millions of people living in largely neglected overcrowded settlements. Their houses are built of waste materials, with little or no running water, electricity, garbage disposal or sanitation.

"Social distancing" is next to impossible when a settlement can have just 380 toilets for 20 000 people. Even before pandemics strike, such places erode the health of residents, causing and worsening ailments that include respiratory diseases.

The call from the United Nations is for rich countries to provide more funding for Africa. But rich donor countries are themselves fighting the crisis and are unlikely to focus their attention elsewhere.

This leaves Africa in desperate need of resources. For example, the Central African Republic, home to nearly 5 million people, has just 3 ventilators.

A history of deadly crises
--------------------------
Tragically, Africa is no stranger to crises, including pandemics. In 2014 Ebola swept through West Africa, killing more than 11 000 people. Lessons emerged from this experience. One was the power of rumour and misinformation -- especially in dense urban neighbourhoods. For instance, it was said that Ebola always kills. The claim created panic and led to households hiding sick relatives, resulting in fewer reported cases. The explosion of social media use -- even since 2014 -- increases this risk.

In 2018, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) recorded its 10th outbreak of Ebola in 40 years. The outbreak affected the regional capital Goma, a city that is no stranger to crises, having experienced disaster, conflict, and a huge refugee influx. In 1994 hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the Rwandan genocide arrived in Goma. A cholera epidemic that killed nearly 12 000 people followed. Goma endured years of civil war (along with the rest of the country) and a volcanic eruption in 2002.

Now the city is facing coronavirus, having recorded its 1st case in March [2020]. A recent Los Angeles Times article notes that, while chronically under-resourced, Goma's recent previous experience may help the city fight coronavirus: Due to the Ebola crisis, the city is dotted with checkpoints where everybody is subjected to a temperature check -- performed with handheld infrared thermometers -- and required to wash their hands at chlorinated water stations before being allowed to pass.

A testing laboratory is also being built. This is something, but such measures are likely to have limited impact in slums.

Predictions of disaster ignored
-------------------------------
A decade ago, a World Health Organisation bulletin drew attention to a 2009 study that warned Africa's urbanisation "is a health hazard for certain vulnerable populations ... [that] threatens to create a humanitarian disaster."

Africa has urbanised substantially in the last 11 years. And its slums have grown at break-neck speed. Africa's population, now 1.1 billion people, is expected to double by 2050, with up to 80% of that increase in cities, especially in slums.

The coronavirus, whose risk to life and economic impacts threaten to eclipse previous crises, threatens to expose the mismanagement and neglect of Africa's urbanisation in the most visceral of ways. And the most vulnerable people will pay the highest price, as they always do.

[This article serves as an eye-opener about the realities in Africa and the implication of the introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into these countries. In today's update from Congo DR, there have been a total of 215 cases to date, 203 in Kinshasa, 5 in North Kivu, 4 in South Kivu, 2 in Ituri, and 1 in Kwilu (https://mailchi.mp/8ebfeda7e268/covid-19-bulletin-n-17-jeudi-le-09-avril-3909613?e=e838b4d57b). North Kivu and Ituri provinces are the locations of the most recent Ebola virus disease outbreak that continued from August 2018 through March 2020. The longest duration of Ebola virus disease outbreaks in Congo DR. North Kivu and Ituri are active conflict zones and healthcare workers as well as civilians have been targeted in these areas as part of this conflict. And now the SARS-CoV-2 virus is being introduced. South Africa has confirmed 1964 cases as of today (9 Apr 2020), Cameroon 803, Cote d'Ivoire 444, Niger 410, and Nigeria 288, to highlight a few of the countries. And new cases are being confirmed daily. - Mod.MPP
