[Anthrax is sporadic in Romania, and, with a perception of minimal risk, any investigation seems to have been also minimal. But this outbreak is in the same general area, Vaslui, as the singular 2019 outbreak. And it is mid-summer, so it would have occurred in grazing livestock, and so the probable source would be an anthrax cattle grave in the pasture where the animals were grazing. A guess. It would be wise if they repeated the herd vaccination for at least 3 years just in case any other animal in the affected herd has acquired a latent infection. And if there is a cattle grave in the pasture, it is presenting a risk from spores that have worked their way to the surface, and this risk will persist also. - Mod.MHJ
