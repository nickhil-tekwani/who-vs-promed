In Vietnam, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai called on the army and
police to help with anti-flu work as new outbreaks were reported
despite mounting efforts to contain the virus, state media reported
Friday [11 Nov 2005].
In a telegram sent to ministries and provincial governments, Khai
called on local governments to "mobilize the armed forces, militiamen
and university students," according to the newspaper Pioneer. It
didn't say what they were expected to do.
Worst-hit Vietnam has reported 2/3 of the 64 human deaths attributed
to the H5N1 strain of bird flu in Asia since it appeared in late 2003.
Elsewhere in Asia, North Korea issued a bird flu alert, exhorting
people to unite against a potential outbreak of the disease and
calling the task "significant".
The announcement came a day after Pyongyang issued an "emergency
alert," putting chicken farms off-limits to outsiders and requiring
feed transport vehicles to be disinfected, according to the North's
Korean Central Television Broadcasting Station, monitored by South
Korea's Yonhap news agency.
Bird flu hit North Korea early in 2005, forcing the communist state
to cull about 210 000 chickens and other poultry. In April, the FAO
said the outbreak was successfully contained. No new cases of bird
flu have since been reported. [Reportedly, the causative avian
influenza virus strain in North Korea, as identified by OIE's
reference laboratory in Australia, was H7N7. - Mod.AS]
H5N1 first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997 but was curbed when
authorities destroyed all poultry in the territory. It re-emerged in
December 2003, and has recently spread from Asia to Europe.

China has reported a new outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird
flu in poultry in its northeast, the 7th in the country since the
beginning of October 2005, the government said.
About 300 chickens have died since 6 Nov 2005 in Beining in Liaoning
province, where there had already been 3 outbreaks, the Agriculture
Ministry said in a statement posted on its website.
The outbreak has affected 4 townships, and 2.5 million poultry within
a radius of 3 km (2 miles) had been culled, it said. Birds had been
vaccinated and the area sealed off and disinfected.
Premier Wen Jiabao warned this week that the country was facing a
"very serious situation" as the disease had not been brought under
control and was likely to spread.
China has yet to report a human case of bird flu, which has killed
over 60 people in Asia since 2003, though the World Health
Organisation is helping probe a possible human case in Hunan
province, which had an outbreak in October 2005.

China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday [10 Nov 2005] informed
the country's 800 million rural residents of the ways to prevent and
control bird flu through the issuance of an open letter.
In the letter posted on the official website of the ministry, it said
in simple language that the epidemic avian flu has hit 15 countries
and regions since September, and is yet to be brought under control.
4 provincial areas in China, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region in north China, Anhui Province in east China, Liaoning
Province in northwest China and Hunan Province in central China, have
been hit by the epidemic, according to the letter.[China's provinces,
including an interactive map, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_China>].
The ministry said the prevention and control of the disease in China
faces a "very grave situation," and advised the farmers to enhance
their awareness of the disease, improve their capability to prevent
the further spread of the epidemic, and take action to prevent any
human infection of the bird flu virus.
In the letter, the ministry tells chicken farmers how to keep their
henhouses clean, and introduces the basic symptoms of chickens
already catching the bird flu.
Farmers were also urged to have their chickens vaccinated and not to
buy fake vaccines, and be quick in reporting suspected cases to local
vet stations or government departments in charge of poultry husbandry.
To date, China has reported 4 [areas of] H5N1 bird flu outbreaks.
Health authorities fear that the more the H5N1 virus spreads, the
greater chance it has to mutate -- picking up genes from ordinary flu
that could make it highly contagious among humans.

[CBC news (Canada) included the following information in a news item
of 11 Nov 2005: "China's Agriculture ministry has warned farmers that
counterfeit vaccines are being sold in Liaoning province and that
millions of birds may not be protected from the virus". China's last
official notification to the OIE, dated 10 Nov 2005, indicated that
198 million chickens have been vaccinated in Liaoning in response to
the outbreak, applying 3 vaccine types:
1. Inactivated mono H5N2 vaccine;
2. lnactivated recombinant H5N1 vaccine;
3. Live recombinant avian pox virus vectored H5 vaccine.
The official control upon animal vaccines, certifying their efficacy
and safety and permitting their release, is a crucial activity of
state veterinary services. - Mod.AS]
