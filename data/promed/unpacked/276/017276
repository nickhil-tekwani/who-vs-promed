Measles Cases Associated with Presumptive Prior Exposure in the USA
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Apr 2001, the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican
Minister of Health received a report of 3 cases of measles confirmed by
Behring test. The report relates to a family residing in Benito Juarez
Municipality in Quintana Roo. The index case was a 33-year old male, with
US nationality and from Utah; his illness began on Fri 13 Apr 2001 with the
background of having traveled on 22 Mar 2001 to a convention in Dallas,
Texas, were he had contact with 15 people. On Sun 15 Mar 2001 he traveled
to Benito Juarez Municipality, via Houston, where he had contact with some
Koreans. The secondary cases are his 32-year-old wife and his 4-month-old
daughter. The samples were positive by Behring and BelliniÂ´s test.
The Minister of Health initiated a search for associated cases with the
following results: (1) Intensive search for febrile exanthematic disease
(FED) cases in 46 public and private clinics, health centers, and
hospitals, detected a total of 35 cases. All clinical records with a
suspected FED diagnosis were reviewed from 1 Jan 2001 to the present. (2)
Authorities assembled 30 field teams and 275 homes were visited in the
neighborhood the [35 FED cases; 3 additional FED cases were found. As a
consequence, vaccination efforts were intensified, although the preschool
children coverage in Benito Juarez Municipality up to April 2001 was 97.7
percent.
According to this information, we consider that the index case was probably
infected in the USA or during his [return travel to Mexico. On the basis
of these facts, we suggest that the epidemiologic study of the outbreak
should begin in the USA, and these cases should be classified as imported
cases to Mexico.
