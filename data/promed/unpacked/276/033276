I would like to provide information confirming that these are indeed separate cases. The Japanese Ministry of Environment articles [in Japanese] posted on 4 Apr and 8 Apr [2022] detail the infected crow cases with the fox and raccoon dog cases, respectively:

- 4 Apr 2022 https://www.env.go.jp/press/110892.html [64th incident of infection in crows and one red fox (kitsune)]
- 8 Apr 2022 https://www.env.go.jp/press/110915.html [67th and 68th incidents of wild domestic birds with the raccoon dog (tanuki)]

The dates recorded for both the collection of the animals and genetic testing results are different, and it was also noted that the fox tested positive for H5, with no N subtype mentioned, while the raccoon dog tested positive for H5N1.

The fox was stated to be dead upon collection, while the raccoon dog had been collected in a weakened state and had died later.

Of note, foxes (kitsune) and raccoon dogs (tanuki) are both quite tied into Japanese culture (they are worshipped as deities and gods at some shrines).

I would like to respond to this inquiry, as our laboratory [performed the laboratory studies]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses subtype H5N1 were detected and isolated from 2 mammals -- one Ezo red fox and one raccoon dog -- at the same place in Sapporo. This area is the same area where the infected crows were found. Genetic information of the isolates will be released to the public database as soon as possible.

[This clarifies the situation and confirms that there have been 2 different mammals infected during this HPAI H5N1 outbreak that also involved wild birds. ProMED thanks the unnamed subscriber and Prof. Sakoda for responding so promptly to our request for information. - Mod.PMB
