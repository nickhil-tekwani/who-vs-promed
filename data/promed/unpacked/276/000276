Agriculture: vaccination of 1.7 million cattle to contain FMD in the govrnorates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Suhair Abdel Kader, Head, Central Department for Preventive Medicine of the Veterinary Services at the Ministry of Agriculture, has revealed that approximately 1.7 million cattle have been vaccinated in different governorates of the Republic against FMD serotypes SAT1 and SAT2, Rift Valley fever and Three-day-sickness. This has been done to contain and to prevent the further spread of FMD and the otrher diseases. to control the other diseases. The immunisation against FMD has contributed to its complete control; vaccinated animals being fully protected.

In her statement to to 'Youm Sab'ah' ('7th Day'), Dr Suhair Abdel Kader added that 2 million doses of the FMD vaccine have been received from the Agriculture Ministry's Serum and Vaccine Laboratory [Abbassiyah] and the Holding company of the Ministry of Health, "VACSERA". Following the completion of vaccination, booster vaccination is being undertaken.

The FMD SAT 2 epizootic started 24 Feb 2012 and caused the sickness of more than 100 000 animals and death of more than 21 000. It has been decided to establish veterinary committees, coordinated with the Interior Ministry and the armed forces, which would be responsible for the performance of the checkpoints between the provinces to prevent illegal animal transportations and violations of the legal requirements.

[It will be interesting to note if the information on the inclusion of FMDV SAT-1 in the vaccine, as reflected from the above newswire, is accurate; if other FMD serotypes known to be present in Egypt (O and A) are included as well; and if the RVF vaccine (inactivated?) and BEF (Bovine ephemeral fever = 3-day sickness) vaccines are administered simultaneously/mixed in the same injections. It will be also interesting to note if FMD vaccinations cover small ruminants as well.

An official OIE FMD follow-up report, with detailed vaccination figures, will be helpful. Egypt has submitted to the OIE, since the start of the FMD SAT-2 outbreak in Feb 2012, 5 reports addressing a total of 49 outbreaks; the most recent report was submitted on 24 June. All of them and an interactive map are available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11748.- Mod.AS.
