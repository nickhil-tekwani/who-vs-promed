State, federal disease experts confer on Maryland botulism case
----------------------
State health authorities said yesterday they are working with federal
disease experts to investigate a Maryland botulism case. Officials said
that a patient was hospitalized, but provided no other details of the case.
Botulism is a dangerous bacterial infection that can occur in the digestive
tract, lungs, or through broken skin. About 100 cases occur annually in the
United States, according to Dr. John G. Bartlett, chief of infectious
diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School, of Medicine.
Because of its toxicity, naturally occurring botulinum toxin is often
mentioned as a potential biological weapon. "But we don't believe at this
point there is any link" between this case and terrorism, said Arlene
Stephenson, state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene deputy secretary
for public health services.

[One wonders if this is related to the bread/naan recall in Canada? More
information on this case and the investigation would be appreciated. -
