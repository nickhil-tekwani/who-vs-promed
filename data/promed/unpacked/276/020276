The Ministry of Health reported on Friday [2 Dec 2011] the deaths of
10 indigenous people as a result of rabies infection spread by forest
bats in this area [most likely _Desmodus rotundus_ vampire bats. -
Mod.TY].

The director of communication of the Ministry, Paulina Ponce, said
that "the rabies cases have occurred in 3 communities [in Taisha
canton], Wampuik, Tarimiat, and Tsurik Nuevo", all small settlements
some 260 km [161 mi] south east of the capital [Quito], in Morona
Santiago province.

The mayor of Taisha, Celestino Wisum, said on Sonorama Radio that,
"there are 10 people who have died as a result of rabies," transmitted
by hematophagous bats whose populations have increased considerably in
the forest around these 3 settlements of people of Ashuar ethnicity,
for reasons that have not been deciphered.

The Morona Santiago director of health, Susana Aguilar, stated to
Radio Sonorama that, "Up to now, 150 people were bitten by bats," and
are being treated with antirabies sera [and/or probably vaccine. -
Mod.TY]. She said that, together with Brazilian technicians from the
Pan American Health Organization, they are working to deal with the
situation with actions such as massive vaccination, which consists of
10 continuous and interrupted doses for each infected [exposed?]
person. A total of 5600 vaccine doses have arrived in this area.

The affected [possible exposed] individuals have been urged to go to
physicians and not to traditional (folk) healers, to be assured of
effective help.

[The number of dead and ill children is not consistent with previous
reports. The 28 Nov 2011 report (ProMED-mail archive no 20111129.3483)
indicated that there were either 4 or 6 dead and another 8 with
apparent rabies hospitalized. Perhaps some of the hospitalized
children subsequently died. The report above is the 1st indication
that 150 individuals in the 3 settlements have been bitten by vampire
bats. Also, the post exposure treatment regime conflicts with the
earlier report -- 10 vaccine doses above versus 7 in the earlier post,
neither of which matches WHO recommendations. The type of vaccine use
is not specified, nor is there any mention made of vampire bat control
measures (anticoagulant pesticide treatment) being employed.

The bat involved in transmission of rabies virus in this outbreak is
most likely _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common hematophagous bat in
the region. An image of the bat can be accessed at
