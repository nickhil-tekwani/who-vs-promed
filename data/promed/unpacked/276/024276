Warning on hidden potato threats
--------------------------------
Hidden threats could unseat British potato businesses unless steps
are taken now to address long-term plant-health issues. Warnings on
the devastating disease _Dickeya_ (formerly _Erwinia chrysanthemi_)
and progress on the Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN) Directive dominated
discussions at Potatoes in Practice (PiP) 2009.

"The more we understand about _Dickeya_, the more serious we realise
the implications are for the British crop," warned SCRI's [Scottish
Crop Research Institute] Ian Toth. Scottish government and Potato
Council funded research, as well as collaboration with international
partners, is "producing some interesting but uncomfortable findings,"
he told growers.

On the continent _Dickeya_ has already cut a deep swathe through
potato profitability. Over 20 percent of the 2007 Dutch seed crop was
downgraded as a result of the disease, while losses in the country
have increased fivefold in recent years to a staggering 25 million
Euro [approx. USD 35.6 million]. Early reports suggest this season
[2009] could be similar to 2007. "We don't yet have a problem in
Scotland, but it's an on-going concern in England and Wales. At
present sourcing seed through the Safe Haven Accreditation Scheme is
just about the only way we can limit introduction of the disease."

SASA's [Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture) Jon Pickup
brought growers up-to-date with the latest developments of the PCN
directive in Scotland. "A key issue is the PCN control and waste
disposal measures for ware production on infested land, which growers
may be faced with as a result of the wider sampling programme," noted
Dr Pickup. Farm-saved seed and ware land will be included and a much
greater sample size will be taken. This will increase the chances of
detection.

Britain, and Scotland in particular, trades on its high health
status, noted Potato Council head of seed and export Mark Prentice.
"There needs to be a clear focus on protecting clean land," he said.
But it is in the long-term interest of the industry to address hidden
plant health threats, he said. "Issues such as _Dickeya_, PCN, and
ring rot are often out of sight, so it is easy to disregard them. PiP
has been hugely beneficial at highlighting not only the scale of
these threats, but also the fundamental and practical research needed
to address them."

[2] Late blight, nematodes - UK: impact of EU pesticides directive

Sixth of potato production under EU threat
------------------------------------------
Up to a sixth of the UK's potato production could be lost as a result
of an EU directive on pesticides [see link below], an expert said
yesterday [16 Aug 2009]. Rob Clayton, of the Potato Council, based
his warning on the effects of removing several chemicals essential in
keeping pests and diseases, such as blight, slugs, and eelworm
[nematodes] at bay. He said the loss of a single major pesticide used
in the control of eelworm could cost the industry more than GBP 50
million [approx. USD 82.4 million] a year in reduced production. And
withdrawing one chemical used to fight potato blight could reduce the
UK crop by 10 percent on its own.

One of the biggest problems for growers of the humble spud is the
damage that blight can cause. Over the past 200 years, many a crop
has been left devastated by this disease and only in the past 50
years has the grower had a chemical means of controlling it.

"We are really under pressure with [late] blight now," she said. "We
have a new strain coming in that attacks crops 2 weeks earlier than
normal and we have a real battle with late blight attacking the crop
just before it ripens. That means we have at least 2 additional
sprays to add to a normal control programme." Ironically, a surge in
people growing their own potatoes has increased the spread of blight.
"We believe these small plots of potatoes are now inoculants that
help spread blight into commercial crops."

Almost two-thirds of all potato growing land in the UK is infected by
eelworm. On land growing crops for the eating market, soil treatment
can help reduce eelworm cysts but again one of the main control
chemicals is under threat of removal. While the short-term solution
to this problem might be in widening the interval in which crops can
be grown, the longer-term solution lies with producing varieties that
have resistance to the pests.

[3] _Tobacco etch virus_, undiagnosed diseases - USA (Massachusetts,
Connecticut)

A plant virus is spreading into Connecticut from Massachusetts
--------------------------------------------------------------
In Massachusetts, many tobacco farmers are plowing their fields under
after at least 4 tobacco viruses emerged in the area. One of them,
the tobacco etch virus, is believed to have spread from nearby potato
crops, which are also suffering from a variety of diseases.

"It got to be more lucrative to grow potatoes again and the
Massachusetts guys were equipped for it," said a tobacco grower. But
many diseases can be passed between tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco,
and the etch virus, which is spread by aphids, jumped between the
crops. "Massachusetts was hurt very bad and they are finding it in
some Connecticut fields," the grower said.

[_Dickeya chrysanthemi_ causes soft rot on potato and can also affect
some other crops. The rot rapidly destroys potato tubers, and the
bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material, by
mechanical means and water. The pathogen has been included on the
quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
For more information see ProMED-mail post 20081112.3567.

Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_) and pale (_G. pallida_)
potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato.
They can also infect other solanaceous crops and weeds, and cysts
containing viable eggs can survive in the soil for up to 20 years.
Disease management includes exclusion and crop rotation with non-host
species. For more information on the PCNs see data sheet links below.
There are also several species of free living nematodes
(_Pratylenchus_ species) affecting potato crops in the UK (see
ProMED-mail post 20090212.0628).

Ring rot of potato is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_, which is listed as a quarantine
pathogen by EPPO. For more information on this disease see
ProMED-mail post 20071105.3601 and links below.

Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop losses in
potato and tomato. The emergence of new strains with increased
virulence and fungicide resistances causes worldwide concern, and an
estimated 20 percent of world potato production is lost to this
pathogen every year. For more information see links and previous
posts below.

_Tobacco etch virus_ (TEV; genus _Potyvirus_) is one of around 40
viruses known to affect potato. It is transmitted by more than 10
aphid species (including _Myzus persicae_) and is spreading in East
Asia and the Americas. Item 3 above is an interesting example of
virus spread between crops due to insect vectors with a wide host
range.
