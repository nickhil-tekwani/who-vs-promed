A fox in the Woodmoor North neighborhood just south of the Douglas
county line tested positive for rabies Friday, 23 April 2010,
according to the El Paso County Department of Health and Environment.
This is the 1st rabid fox in Colorado to be reported in 2010. 30
animals in Colorado have tested positive for rabies so far this year
[2010], including 4 from El Paso County.

The Division of Wildlife (DOW) responded to a call regarding the fox
acting unusual and having difficulty walking outside of a home. DOW
captured and euthanized the fox for testing. According to DOW, the
fox appeared quite ill and had clinical signs suggestive of rabies.

While rabies is most commonly found in bats, people and pets should
avoid contact with skunks and other wild animals such as foxes or
raccoons, since these animals may be rabid.

It is critical that pets be vaccinated against rabies.
"Un-or-undervaccinated dogs and cats that are exposed to rabies have
an extremely high chance of getting infected and dying from the
disease. These pets also pose a tremendous risk to humans because
they can bring rabies into the home," said Kandi Buckland, RN, MPA,
executive director of the El Paso County Department of Health and Environment.

Rabies is spread primarily through the bite of rabid mammals and is
almost always fatal.

"This fox is likely to have been infected by a rabid skunk, so we
continue to see rabies infection spillover into different mammal
species in our county. We urge citizens to keep pets up-to-date with
rabies vaccinations and to take all the necessary rabies prevention
measures to protect the family," Buckland said. "Leaving pet food
outside will attract wildlife. We ask that you keep pet food away and
make it inaccessible to wildlife."

In 2010 so far, El Paso County has identified rabies in 3 skunks and
one fox. In 2009, rabies was detected in 8 skunks, a fox, horse, and
mountain lion. Prior to 2009, El Paso County last reported a rabid
skunk in 1974.

Here are some key rabies prevention steps:
- Ensure that dogs, cats and ferrets are vaccinated properly against
rabies by a licensed veterinarian. Also, discuss vaccinating horses
and other livestock with your veterinarian.
- Don't feed wild animals or allow your pets around them. Teach
children to stay away from wild mammals. Do not keep pet food outside
as that may attract wild animals.
- Protect all pets, particularly animals too young to be vaccinated,
from contact with wild animals. Puppies and kittens can be vaccinated
for rabies as early as 4 months old.
- Contact your veterinarian if your dog or cat is bitten or scratched
by wild animals, such as skunks, bats, foxes, or raccoons.
- If you or a family member has been bitten by a wild animal or a
domestic animal unknown to you, contact your physician and the Humane
Society of the Pikes Peak Region without delay.
- If you see a skunk during daylight hours acting abnormally, such as
stumbling or acting overly aggressive, make sure you keep children
and pets away from the animal and call the Division of Wildlife to
report the location.
- To remove a dead skunk on your property, do not touch the animal.
Remove the carcass with a shovel or other tool, and double bag it for
the trash.
- Take steps to bat proof your home.

their website every Friday with rabies data at

[2] North Carolina: fox

Officials in Carteret County say a fox that jumped a 4 foot [1.3 m]
fence to attack a dog last Friday evening [23 Apr 2010] [in Morehead
City] has tested positive for rabies.

The dog's owner came to the dog's defense and killed the fox by
beating it with a lead pipe. Although the dog suffered some injuries,
it was treated and released by a veterinarian on Monday [26 Apr
2010]. [Then likely the dog was vaccinated. Most state laws require
revaccination and a short period of quarantine as a precaution. - Mod.TG]

"This is the 3rd positive rabies case in wildlife in 2010," states
Mike Hardy, lead Animal Control officer for Carteret County Health
Department. "We want to remind all our residents, wherever you live,
that rabies is present in wildlife throughout the county. Be sure to
keep your dogs and cats up to date on their rabies vaccinations, and
call law enforcement or animal control quickly if you see unusual
behavior in wild or domestic animals. If your pet has contact with a
wild animal, be sure to protect yourself from exposure to saliva."

Dogs and cats need their 1st rabies vaccine at 4 months of age
followed by a rabies booster at 1 year, and then an annual shot. It
takes 21 days for the 1st rabies shot to protect; follow-up shots
protect immediately. [Provided the follow up shots are done in a
timely manner and that the animal is immunologically competent. And
in Israel there was a case of a vaccinated dog having rabies. Please
see ProMED-mail post 20100326.0962. - Mod.TG]

Contact your veterinarian for more information about rabies, or
contact Carteret County Health Department Animal Control at 252.728.8585.

An announcement from the Greenbrier County Health Department said a
5th case of rabies was confirmed on Friday, 23 Apr 2010. A raccoon
from Ronceverte tested positive. A dog discovered with the animal has
been quarantined and given booster shots. The dog had no obvious
signs of scratches or bites.

On Mon 26 April 2010, another raccoon described as behaving
abnormally was shot. That animal was located on a property
neighboring the one from the case on Friday [23 Apr 2010]. Test
result on that animal should be available Tuesday [27 Apr 2010].

In 2009, Greenbrier County had reported 7 cases of rabies by this
date. Greenbrier County Health Department leaders urge residents in
the area to keep rabies vaccinations current on their domestic animals.

[Without any statistics, it seems there are more rabies being
reported this year (2010) as compared to the 1st 4 months of 2009.

As urban areas encroach on wildlife habitat, and wildlife finds easy
sources of food in urban areas, the interface between wildlife and
domestic animals is likely to be less distinct than it already is.

It does not matter if you are a city dweller or a country dweller,
protecting yourself, and your pets from this very deadly disease is
critical. Vaccination is a very cheap insurance when it comes to
protection against this disease.

Each state has its own rabies law, although there are some
similarities, such as vaccinating companion animals by 4 months of
age. Most states recommend vaccination for your large animals (horses
and cows) if you have contact with them.

If you think your animal has been exposed to a rabid animal, report
it to the animal control authorities. Take your pet to the
veterinarian and make sure you get medical attention if you think you
were exposed to a rabid animal. - Mod.TG]
