New outbreak of coral disease hits reefs in Kaneohe Bay
-------------------------------------------------------
Scientists have discovered a new outbreak of coral disease hitting reefs in Oahu. A team at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology said Thursday [5 Jan 2012] nearly 200 colonies of coral in Kaneohe Bay are being threatened by a strain of the disease.

A scientific rapid response team is documenting the outbreak. Residents trained in identifying reef threats are being asked to report any signs of the disease.

The disease, known as Montipora white syndrome, was 1st seen in reefs in the area nearly 2 years ago [2009]. The disease is believed to be caused by infectious bacteria and only affects rice coral. Surveys found that more than 100 colonies of rice coral died during the 1st outbreak.

[Montipora White Syndrome (MWS)is a coral disease that results in tissue loss. It has been reported to occur throughout the Hawaiian archipelago and was found to be particularly prevalent in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the numbers of coral diseases, coral species affected and disease outbreaks. This is especially true in the Indo-Pacific, where coral disease has recently been recognized as a problem. As very little is known about the ecology of MWS, it is especially difficult to evaluate the effect this disease might have on Hawaiian reefs. It has been reported from numerous locations throughout the Indo-Pacific, constituting a growing threat to coral reef ecosystems.
