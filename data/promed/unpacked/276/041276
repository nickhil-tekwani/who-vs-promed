The number of cases of vaping-related illnesses spiked sharply again this week [week of 23 Sep 2019] as pressure mounts to uncover the cause of the mysterious symptoms.

There have been 805 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury linked with e-cigarette use across 46 states and the US Virgin Islands, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on [Thu 26 Sep 2019]. The case count marks a surge from the 530 cases reported last week, and the 380 cases reported the week prior. The agency also reported 12 deaths linked to the illnesses.

Many of the patients said they had vaped THC [tetrahydrocannabinol, responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects], but many also vaped both THC and nicotine. Some patients have said they only used e-cigarettes for nicotine products, but health officials have noted some patients are hesitant to disclose THC use. Health officials still have not identified a culprit or culprits behind the recent spate of illnesses.

"This is a complex investigation and I don't think we should expect definitive answers imminently. This may take some time," the CDC's principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, told reporters last week.

At a congressional hearing [Wed 25 Sep 2019], Schuchat said she is "extremely frustrated with the pace of the investigation," which has been complicated by the vast market of vaping products. She also noted the data collection needed for the investigation is reliant on "antiquated systems," which has slowed the process down.

The illnesses have escalated an ongoing conversation about the potential health risks related to e-cigarette use. They have also sparked legislative action to rein in vaping, particularly among young people. On [Tue 24 Sep 2019], Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker issued a 4-month ban on the sale of all vaping products in the state. And on [Wed 25 Sep 2019], Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo issued a temporary ban on flavored vaping products.

[The numbers appear to climb. One question I see is how many were ill/deceased before it was connected to vaping? This question may have no answer until a retrospective study is done. If vaping was not noted on initial intake, then the connection regarding vaping may be lost. These numbers could be higher if this is the case. To gain a better understanding of the difficulty of this investigation, please read item [3] in: Vaping-related illness - USA (03): deaths, CDC 20190919.6682101. - Mod.TG
