Swine fever on the Belgian-German border
---------------------------------------------
BRUSSELS: At the Belgium-German border, a ban has been placed on
transport of sows and piglets after discovery of swine fever in a
wild boar in the Ardennes. Sale and slaughtering of wild boars is
prohibited as well.

[From a further communication from Dr Huisman, it appears that the
infected wild boar was killed on 28 Oct 2002 in the area of
Rocherath. Official control measures to prevent the spread of
Classical Swine fever, including animal movement restrictions, are
