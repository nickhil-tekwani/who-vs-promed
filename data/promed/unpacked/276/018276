With the recent events of West Nile virus in New York and involvement
of bird reservoirs, researchers may be interested in the following
references:

Work, TH, Hurlburt HS, and Taylor RM. 1953. Isolation of West Nile
virus from hooded crows and rock pigeons in the Nile Delta. Proc Soc
Exp Biol Med 84:719-722

Work, TH, Hurlburt HS, and Taylor RM. 1958. Indigenous wild birds
in the Nile Delta as potential West Nile circulating reservoirs. Am J
Trop Med Hyg 4:872-888
Taylor, RM, TH Work, HS Hurlburt, and F Rizk. 1956. A study of the
ecology of West Nile Virus in Egypt. Am J Trop Med Hyg 5:579-620.

This may give some insight into present investigations.
