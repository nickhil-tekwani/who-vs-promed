[1] Vaccination campaign status

Progress in getting the 2.2 million people in Darfur vaccinated against the yellow fever virus moves forward as thousands gather in vaccination points in targeted localities in the region. In just one day, 13 per cent of the target population in Geneina, Kerinik, Habila, and Beidha in West Darfur were vaccinated, according to a World Health Organization Situation Report of 22 Nov 2012.

During the 12-day emergency response vaccination campaign, some 2.2 million population in 12 prioritized localities are targeted for the vaccination.

Yesterday [24 Nov 2012], the campaign began in the Northern Darfur localities of Saraf Omra and Seref. While the necessary vaccine campaign goes through the various localities, the number of yellow fever cases and fatalities continue to rise.

According to the WHO, as of 21 Nov [2012], the total number of reported cases has reached 537, including 127 deaths (case fatality rate of 23.6 per cent). The outbreak has now affected 30 localities in Central, South, West, North, and East Darfur. This is up from 459 cases and 116 deaths just 4 days prior.

In addition to the epidemiology and surveillance assistance from the WHO and other organizations, the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) based in Cairo, Egypt, has deployed a team to Sudan to support laboratory analysis of collected samples as well as conduct on-the-job training sessions at the National Public Health Laboratory starting Saturday 24 Nov 2012.

According to the WHO, yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus, and the mosquito is the primary vector. It carries the virus from one host to another, primarily between monkeys, from monkeys to humans, and from person-to-person.

Once contracted, the virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days, followed by infection that can occur in one or 2 phases. The 1st acute phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.

There is no specific treatment for the viral illness but it can be contained using bed nets, insect repellents and long clothing.

Prevention of this viral disease is through vaccination.

[The yellow fever vaccination campaign appears to be moving ahead swiftly, as it moves toward its stated goal of having individuals in all critical area vaccinated within 10-12 days -- now nearly half over. The European Commission indicated that it is ready to help the Sudanese government cope with this recent outbreak of yellow fever. The Commission, as part of the campaign, has already deployed humanitarian experts on the ground to monitor the disease outbreak along with several NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and humanitarian groups.

Kristalina Georgieva, European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response stated, "To ensure that all people at risk are vaccinated, it is essential that all affected areas are covered by the campaign, including those which have been inaccessible to humanitarian agencies in the past." (see http://allafrica.com/stories/201211270337.html. So far, there has been no mention of what the plans and activities are after the 10-12 day vaccination campaign has ended. It is unlikely that all people in Darfur will have been vaccinated, leaving the possibility of small-scale, smoldering foci of transmission and sporadic cases in more remote, lesser populated areas. Thorough surveillance will be necessary with vaccination teams ready to move into those areas to halt resumption of the outbreaks.

[2] Logistical challenges
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2012

A yellow fever outbreak in Sudan's Darfur region shows the difficulties faced by immunisation teams operating in some of Africa's most remote and under-developed regions.

A yellow fever vaccination campaign has began in 4 of those regions, targeting some 2.4 million people. Darfur is still affected by serious instability since conflict broke out there in 2003 -- hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, the region is impoverished and has very basic infrastructure. One of the biggest obstacles is keeping the 'cold chain' intact; in Darfur temperatures can often reach well above 40C [104 F] and vaccines can become obsolete [ineffective] if they are not kept in a temperature range of about 2-8C [36 - 46 F].

"It's a real challenge," says Dr Anshu Banerjee the World Health Organisation's representative in Sudan. "In Darfur we're travelling miles from urban centres along poor roads. Most places we visit have no mains electricity; often we can't find batteries or even fuel for generators so keeping fridges running for the vaccines is very difficult."

At the lowest level of village distribution, in the absence of fridges the vaccines are usually transported in cool boxes with ice packs inside, either being carried on foot or on the back of motorbikes. In the most extreme cases, health care workers may have to walk for up to 3 days carrying these boxes, visiting families door-to-door. Although Banerjee says Sudan currently has a good reputation and donor support for maintaining the cold chain, significant losses can be incurred especially if a break in the chain begins higher up in the distribution network.

Vaccines lose their 'integrity' if the cold chain is interrupted. "Both the patient and the health care system suffer" says Alexo Dodoo, director of the International Centre for Pharmaco-vigilance based in Accra, Ghana. "Patients may experience adverse reactions to the bad vaccines and the immunisation programme doesn't know whether that's due to a faulty product or because quality and efficacy have been compromised."

Over the border in Chad innovative ways to keep the cold chain intact are being tested. UNICEF and the health ministry are launching a programme of solar powered fridges which remove the need for mains electricity, wiring and plug sockets, or a reliable source of fuel for generators.

The 1st solar fridges are on order from the US and UK and should arrive in December [2012]. "We're hoping to re-equip some 800 health centres across the whole of Chad by 2016" says Clement Njumo, immunisations specialist at UNICEF Chad. "Each 100 litre fridge costs around [USD] 5000 but in the long run we'll definitely be saving money as fewer vaccines will be wasted and we won't have to buy petrol anymore."

UNICEF say they've already been using solar fridges to great effect in similar vaccination campaigns in Sierra Leone, with some types of fridges even being capable of sending out signals and SMS messages when the temperature varies more than 2C [36 F] from the perfect level.

"It's a real problem for us if children have walked for hours with their parents to the vaccination centre only to find that there are none left because of these bottlenecks in supply," says Hector Calderon, head of communications for Unicef Chad. "Sometimes parents won't return for a 2nd time -- that's a child's life and ultimately we need to cover 100 per cent of children to be successful in these campaigns."

Further research is going on at the level of the drugs companies to develop so-called 'thermo-stable' vaccines which are less sensitive to the extreme temperatures. But tackling the practical problems surrounding the distribution networks is just one issue -- lack of awareness and low turn-out for immunisation campaigns is also a serious challenge in these isolated regions.

[This report provides a vivid account of the challenges in ensuring that viable vaccine reaches the arm of the individual in these campaigns. Lack of infrastructure is surely a major problem in Darfur. Should the campaign need to move into more remote areas, that challenge will become even greater. Little has been said about the armed conflict in the area, and how that is affecting the vaccination campaign. - Mod.TY
