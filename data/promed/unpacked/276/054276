Fear of a revisit of Japanese encephalitis in the state [Manipur] has
surfaced with at least 8 patients found to have developed syndromes of the
dreaded disease and been admitted at RIMS [Regional Institute of Medical
Sciences] Hospital. To confirm the disease blood samples of the patients
have been sent to JN Hospital, where facilities for blood testing for
Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] were recently installed, state
malaria officer, Dr H Nimaichand said today [29 Jun 2010].

Facilities for testing blood to confirm other mosquitoborne diseases are
now available at RIMS Hospital, JN Hospital, Churachandpur District
Hospital, and Tamenglong District Hospital. With the facilities available
in the state, [there is no] inconvenience in getting results to confirm the
kind of disease suffered by a patient related to mosquito bites, the doctor
said. He also said that facility for testing for Japanese encephalitis
[virus infection] will also be made available in other hospitals at the
earliest opportunity. Authorities have started taking steps to provide
[testing] in some selected government hospitals.

Stressing the need for cooperation from other government departments,
Chandramani said that the long abandoned pitch dug for the sewerage project
undertaken by the PWD [public works department] in Imphal areas has become
a favourable egg hatching ground of mosquitoes. Water reservoirs of the
PHED [Public Health Engineering Department] at different places also need
to be covered properly. The Fishery department also needs to supply fish
that consume eggs [larvae and pupae] of mosquitoes.

[It will be of interest to see if these cases are confirmed as Japanese
encephalitis virus infections. Being relatively close to the Myanmar
(Burma) border, one wonders if cases are occurring there as well.
