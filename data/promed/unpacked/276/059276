Around 80 percent of sheep farmers surveyed in the Irish Republic are planning to vaccinate against Schmallenberg virus [SBV] before tups are put to the ewes.

Indeed, 3 quarters of all sheep, suckler and dairy herd owners questioned across the Republic of Ireland are minded to use the new vaccine this year [2013].

Hardly surprising given that 1 in 6 farms in the Republic of Ireland and almost 1 in 4 farms in counties across the south and south east have been affected by Schmallenberg disease, according to the results of this survey conducted in recent weeks.

Conducted by Dr Pat Bogue of Broadmore Research on behalf of MSD Animal Health, the survey involved face-to-face interviews with 506 farmers. Almost 2 thirds of the participants are based in the "high risk" south eastern Irish counties of Cork, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Tipperary South where the majority of SBV infections identified to date have been located.

Dairy farmers accounted for 40 percent of the participants with the remainder running suckler herds and/or sheep. The average size of herd was 91 dairy cows, 37 suckler cows and 128 breeding ewes.

Of the farmers surveyed, 16.6 percent said they had an incidence of SBV on their farms and a further 6.5 percent said their farms were possibly infected with the virus.

In the "high risk" counties, 23 percent of those surveyed said they had an incidence of the virus while 31 percent said they were aware of an incidence within 5 miles of their farm.

When asked about the risk of the disease affecting their farm within the next year, 38 percent said they felt the risk of infection was likely/very likely.

The concern about the risk of infection was much higher among farmers with larger herd and flock sizes. More than half of dairy farmers with over 70 cows felt they were at risk of infection. The figure for larger suckler and sheep farms was 40 and 45 percent respectively.

The survey shows big variation in the level of knowledge among farmers on the most likely time of infection and on the symptoms of SBV infection.

Just over 30 percent of farmers felt that summer was the period of highest risk and a further 23 percent said the risk was greatest in the spring [see comment].

One quarter of farmers said they did not know the most likely time of infection.

Almost half of respondents identified breeding ewes as being most at risk of contracting SBV, while 35 percent said all livestock were at risk.

When asked about their sources of information on the disease, one 5th of farmers said they had seen no information.

Over 60 percent said their main source of information was the farming press, while around 20 percent said they had learned about the disease from their neighbours or their vet.

The survey was conducted in the weeks before the license was granted to MSD Animal Health to market a SBV vaccine.

When asked if they would use a vaccine if one became available, 45 percent said they would definitely use it and a further 30 percent said they would probably use it.

The likelihood of vaccination was highest among sheep farmers, with just over 80 percent saying they would either definitely or probably do so.

[Information derived from farmers on the "period of highest risk of SBV infection" is to be critically evaluated. Several months may elapse between infection and its impact (birth of affected offspring); this time gap may be 2-4 months in sheep and 3-5 months in cattle. Abortions may occur shortly after infection. When an animal breeder says that the risk was greatest in the spring, he may refer to the parturition (respectively lambing or calving) time, and not necessarily to the risk of infection, which may have taken place months earlier.

The apparently wide distribution of SBV in European livestock has become a cause for concern for exporters and particularly their clientele in SBV-free importing countries. SBV was initially discussed during the 80th General Session of the OIE, May 2012. The issue has been discussed again during the recent 81st GS, 26-31 May 2013, in Paris.

Special attention is called for the discussion recorded in article 257 of the Proceedings, addressing "Criteria for the inclusion of diseases and infections on the OIE List (Chapter 1.2.)". The debate included SBV-related interventions by the delegates of Russia, Ireland (speaking on behalf of the 27 EU Member States), Israel, Belarus, Somalia and Haiti. The debate included the following summarising statements:

"Dr Thiermann (President of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code Commission) accepted the proposal of the Delegate of Russia for review of the Schmallenberg virus according to the OIE criteria for disease listing.

Dr Vallat, the Director General, supported Dr Thiermann's comments. With respect to the Schmallenberg virus, Dr Vallat noted that the main point of discussion related to the impact of the virus. He informed Member Countries that the questions relating to Schmallenberg virus would be discussed as from September [2013] with a comprehensive review by experts from Europe and other regions."

The epidemiology of SBV was reviewed during the Session by Dr Ben Jebara, head of OIE's information department, as recorded under article 312 of the Proceedings, titled "Emerging disease: Schmallenberg virus". The review included the following passage:

"[A total of] 9 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands and United Kingdom) reported the presence of SBV by sending an immediate notification through WAHIS, citing 'emerging disease' as the reason for the notification. Following discussions on the subject at the 80th OIE General Session, it was considered that SBV, which had originally been considered as an emerging disease in Western Europe, no longer fulfilled the criteria for notification in the countries having already notified a great number of outbreaks. Consequently, Member Countries stopped notifying SBV through WAHIS. However, to support the OIE's expressed views on the need for clarification regarding the concept of emerging diseases and their notification requirements, 11 additional countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden) informed the OIE, by letter (instead of through WAHIS, as they should have done), of their 1st detection of SBV."
