Health officials Thursday [17 Jan 2008] investigated new bird deaths
in eastern India to see whether bird flu was spreading to additional
areas despite a poultry cull aimed at curbing the disease, officials said.

Hundreds of bird deaths were reported in 4 new districts of West
Bengal state on Wednesday [16 Jan 2008] after an outbreak of bird flu
killed more than 54 000 birds in nearby Birbhum and Dinajpur
districts, said Anisur Rahman, state minister of animal husbandry.

Rahman said the symptoms in the new deaths, which all occurred in
areas close to each other, suggested they were not caused by bird
flu, but a virus locally known as Ranikhet -- a contagious and fatal
viral disease affecting all species of birds but with no record of
attacking humans.

The new areas under watch are in Nadia, Murshidabad, Burdwan, and
South 24 Parganas districts of West Bengal state, Rahman said.

[Ranikhet is an Indian vernacular name for New Castle disease, which
is also known as "pseudo fowl-plague" due to its clinical resemblance
to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, known in the past as
"fowl plague"). See ProMED-mail 20060214.0492. - Mod. AS

Officials in Iran have confirmed their country's 1st H5N1 avian
influenza outbreak in domestic birds, while authorities in eastern
India are working on a massive poultry cull amid worries about
possible new H5N1 outbreaks.

A report that Iran filed with the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) yesterday [16 Jan 2008] says the outbreak occurred in
Mazandaran, a northern province that fronts on the Caspian Sea.
Authorities destroyed a flock of 475 surviving free-range chickens
after 14 chickens died in an outbreak that began 10 Dec 2007, the report says.

The outbreak was detected through Iran's passive surveillance program
for avian flu, officials reported. Samples from the birds first
tested positive in the Iran Veterinary Organization's central
laboratory in December [2007], and an OIE reference lab in Padova,
Italy, confirmed the findings on 8 Jan 2008. The source of the
outbreak is under investigation, the report says.

Iran's only previous reported outbreak of H5N1 in birds occurred in
February 2006 and killed 153 wild swans in Gilan province, which
borders Mazandaran on the west, according to OIE records. The country
has reported no human cases.

In India, meanwhile, an official in West Bengal state voiced concern
that the virus may have spread to several other villages near one
where a poultry outbreak was confirmed on 15 Jan 2008, according to
an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report published today [17 Jan 2008].

"Reports have reached [us] that hens have started dropping dead in
several villages surrounding Margram," Anisur Rahman, the state's
animal resources minister, told AFP. "We are worried over the
situation. We have sought more help from the federal government."

In a 15 Jan 2008 report to the OIE, Indian officials said the virus
had killed more than 35 000 chickens on "small and marginal farms" in
3 villages in Birbhum district and 261 birds in a separate outbreak
in Dinajpur district. Both districts are in West Bengal. The report
said control measures would include destroying all poultry within
about 5 km (3 mi) of the outbreak sites. News reports have said that
about 400 000 birds would be destroyed.

An Associated Press (AP) report today [17 Jan 2008] quoted Rahman as
saying that hundreds of bird deaths were reported on 4 new districts
of West Bengal yesterday [16 Jan 2008] [see item 1 above]. But rather
than avian flu, he said the signs in those cases suggested a virus
locally known as Ranikhet, which affects all bird species but not
humans [see commentary].

The AP story put the number of birds killed by the H5N1 virus in
Birbhum and Dinajpur districts at 54 000.

The World Health Organization (WHO) expressed concern about the
Indian outbreaks today [17 Jan 2008], according to several news
reports. "More serious risk factors are associated with this current
outbreak than previously encountered, including that the affected
areas are more widespread and because of proximity to extended border
areas," the WHO was quoted as saying. The statement was carried by
AFP and by The Statesman, a West Bengal newspaper, among other
reports, but it was unclear which WHO official or office issued it.

Rahman said about 8000 birds were killed yesterday [16 Jan 2008], the
1st day of culling, but officials were facing some resistance from
bird owners, according to the AFP story.

West Bengal borders Bangladesh, which also has had recent avian flu
outbreaks. A Reuters report today [17 Jan 2008] said poultry culling
in Bangladesh was going smoothly after the detection of the virus in
3 more districts. Authorities reported 13 Jan 2008 that avian flu had
killed 500 chickens in the northeastern district of Moulivabazar.

[The news from Iran, stating that the outbreak in Mazandaran had
started already almost 6 weeks ago -- on 10 Dec 2007 -- is rather
disturbing. During the period which elapsed until its finally
confirmed diagnosis, the virus might have spread to other holdings
within and even beyond the affected region, unless rigorous measures
undertaken.

Iran's official notification, submitted to the OIE on 16 Jan 2008,
includes the following epidemiological comments: "The event was
reported according to the Iranian passive surveillance programme in
place; a post-outbreak investigation to trace the source of the
infection is ongoing to detect the probable spread and circulation of
the virus. Active surveillance is ongoing."

Vaccination against HPAI is "prohibited" in Iran; India, on the other
hand , declared "No vaccination." not a prohibition. Iran submitted
its report one day after India.

Iran's notification, with a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6685>.


The 1st item above, derived from Iran's official broadcasting
service, refers only to the Indian situation though mentioning the
findings in Iran would have been expected. According to some media
sources, the Iranian authorities have prohibited the country's media
from covering the problem of avian flu in Iran. We cite this
information with reservation, since it may have been politically
tainted; its confirmation or otherwise, from local sources, will be
helpful. - Mod. AS]
