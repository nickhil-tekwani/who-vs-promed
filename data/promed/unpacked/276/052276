The country completed 5 polio-free years on Wed [13 Jan 2016], but it still faces a hurdle virologists had been warning about all these years -- the very vaccine used to fight polio is causing infection in some children.

In 2015, 2 children, including a 2-year-old child from New Delhi, tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV). So far, 44 cases of VDPV have been reported in India. The King Institute of Preventive Medicine in Chennai, 1 of the 8 WHO-authorized laboratories for polio in India, did not see any cases. In the past 1 year, it tested 10 559 stool samples in patients with polio-like symptoms after taking oral drops. Vaccine-virus was detected in 151 stool samples tested in the laboratory.

"This is not unexpected. As part of the mass immunization programme, we give oral polio drops to children below 5. This vaccine has live attenuated virus. Some children may develop polio-like symptoms but like everyone else the virus will be flushed out of the person's system within 3 months," said institute director Dr Gunasekaran.

Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains a weakened vaccine virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, if a population is seriously underimmunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for an extended period. "The longer it survives, the more genetic changes it will undergo," former public health director Dr S Elango. In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis, he said. "Every child who has tested positive for the virus in the stool should be followed up and monitored every month by a health worker," he said.

While there has always been a debate on the safety of OPV compared to injectable polio vaccine, Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO representative to India, said as a long-term measure, to prevent VDPVs, oral polio vaccine should be gradually withdrawn from the programme after wild poliovirus has been eradicated. As part of the global polio endgame plan, the health ministry is preparing for withdrawal of type 2 component of OPV in April 2016. "This will ensure no VDPV occurs due to type 2 that cause most VDPVs globally," he told TOI [Times of India].

Director of Public Health Dr K Kolandaisamy said there was no cause for worry if a child tests positive for virus in stools during AFP surveillance, because in areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine virus can spread in the immediate community and offer protection to other children through 'passive' immunization, before eventually dying out. "However, we will continue to immunize children until we eradicate every VDPV case," he said.

[Trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contains live attenuated strains of all 3 serotypes of poliovirus in a 10:1:3 ratio. The vaccine viruses are grown in monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line). The vaccine is supplied as a single 0.5-mL dose in a plastic dispenser. The vaccine contains trace amounts of neomycin and streptomycin. OPV does not contain a preservative. Live attenuated polioviruses replicate in the intestinal mucosa and lymphoid cells and in lymph nodes that drain the intestine. Vaccine viruses are excreted in the stool of the vaccinated person for up to 6 weeks after a dose. Maximum viral shedding occurs in the first 1-2 weeks after vaccination, particularly after the 1st dose. Vaccine viruses may spread from the recipient to contacts. Persons coming in contact with fecal material of a vaccinated person may be exposed and infected with vaccine virus. (From http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/polio.pdf) - Mod.LK]

[2] Wild type polio-free status, 5 years

As India has maintained its polio-free status in the 5th year, WHO said that India should continue to remain vigilant. Despite the continued threat of polio virus importation from the remaining polio-endemic countries, the entire south-east Asian region completed 5 years without any case of wild poliovirus on 13 Jan [2016].

"Countries in the region have been making commendable efforts, stepping up vigilance against polio and continuing to protect children against the crippling virus," said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director for WHO South-East Asia. The last case of wild poliovirus in the region was reported from West Bengal in 2011.

Khetrapal said, "Completing half a decade without any case of wild poliovirus is yet another achievement and a reminder that we need to continue our efforts until the disease is eradicated globally. We need to ensure that our efforts and investment over the years to eradicate polio do not go to waste. Globally, polio transmission is at its lowest-ever levels. However, the risk of importation of the poliovirus into all polio-free areas persists".

She added that as part of the Polio End Game strategy, countries in the Region are accelerating introduction of 1 dose of injectable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in childhood immunization schedules, along with plans for a phased withdrawal of oral polio vaccines. "These strategies are aimed at addressing all polio -- including the rare cases of vaccine derived polio," Khetrapal said.

India's 1st injectible inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was recently launched by union health minister JP Nadda as part of the country's commitment to global polio eradication. IPV injection will now be given to children below 1 year of age, along with the 3rd dose of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) at the routine immunization sessions free of cost.
