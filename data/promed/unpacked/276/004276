A 4th test, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), confirmed the substance found in vials in a Las
Vegas motel last week was the deadly toxin ricin, officials said
Tuesday [4 Mar 2008].

The CDC and the Southern Nevada Health District reported they have
found no evidence the powder spread outside the several vials that
police said they received in a plastic bag from a motel manager on
Thursday [28 Feb 2008].

"At this point, from all the investigation, we don't have any
definitive ricin contamination," said Von Roebuck, a spokesman for
the CDC in Atlanta. He said 2 CDC officials remained in Las Vegas to
assist in the investigation.

Earlier tests by police, the Nevada National Guard and a medical
laboratory also identified the substance in the vials as ricin, police said.

Investigators still had no conclusive proof that ricin poisoning led
to the breathing difficulty that a 57-year-old man reported when he
summoned an ambulance 14 Feb 2008 to the Extended Stay America motel
several blocks off the Las Vegas Strip.

Health district spokeswoman Jennifer Sizemore said ricin breaks down
in the body within several days and becomes harder to detect as it is
metabolized. She noted that authorities did not test for the toxin
when the man was 1st hospitalized.

"It may be that we find something definitive, that we can say he was
exposed to ricin," Sizemore said. "But if we don't find something
definitive, we may never know."

The man remained in critical condition at Spring Valley Hospital in
Las Vegas, a spokeswoman said. Police have characterized him as
unconscious and unable to speak.

Authorities believe they recovered all the ricin in several vials
that his cousin gave to a motel manager after going to remove the
man's belongings from the motel room. Officials said castor beans,
from which ricin is made, also were found.

Police did not detect ricin when they went to the room 2 days earlier
at a manager's request to recover firearms and what police called an
"anarchist-type textbook" marked at a spot containing information about ricin.

After the vials were taken to the motel office, the man's cousin and
6 other people were decontaminated at the scene and taken to
hospitals for examination.

[It is unlikely at this point that the tests on the man will reveal
any ricin. It is possible they will detect other substances, but that
is speculative as well. - Mod.TG]
