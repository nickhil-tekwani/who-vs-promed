Re: Identity of agent responsible for HFMD outbreak in Auckland
------------------------------------------------------
The strain of Coxsackie virus responsible for the current outbreak in Auckland, New Zealand is Coxsackie virus A6 (CV6). Identified by Virus Laboratory, Auckland City Hospital, by PCR amplification and sequencing of VP1 region. This isolate is 100% congruent with posted sequences of a Japanese CVA6 isolate. This strain has to date been non-cultivatable in our routine cell lines and we are currently attempting culture with other cell lines.

[ProMED-mail thanks Margaret Croxson for the prompt response to our request for information concerning the identity of the agent responsible for the current e outbreak of FMDV in Auckland. It is interesting, and to some extent reassuring that the agent responsible for the HFMD out break in Auckland is the more benign Coxsackievirus A6, and not the Enterovirus 71 strain responsible for outbreaks of more serious illness in parts of South-East Asia, and the strain of Enterovirus 71 circulating in Australia which has been associated with cases of flaccid paralysis. - Mod.CP]
