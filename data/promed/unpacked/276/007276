Watchung Stables closed its doors to the public after 2 horses tested positive for equine herpes.

The news of the stable temporarily closing was posted on Union County's website. After the 1st horse was diagnosed, the estimated opening date was 5 Apr 2018, but after the 2nd diagnosis came in, the opening date has been pushed further back.

Last month [March 2018], the state announced a horse had tested positive for the "highly infectious equine herpes myeloencephalopathy" at the Union County property. Shortly after, another horse contracted the respiratory form of the disease.

"The property is still under quarantine with a potential release date of 9 Apr 2018 pending no more cases," said Jeff Wolfe, public information officer for the state Department of Agriculture. "Temperatures of the horses are being taken twice daily, and there have been no new illnesses."

The state did not confirm which stable the equine herpes was at due to a policy, but Union County's website explicitly named Watchung Stables.

The 2 Union County horses are the 1st reported EHV-1 cases (equine herpes virus) in New Jersey in 2018, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

When the 2nd horse contracted equine herpes, the horse had an elevated temperature and was showing respiratory signs, but no neurological signs were noted by the attending veterinarian, according to a news release.

The 2nd horse has been moved into the isolation barn on the property, and the entire property remains under quarantine. No horses have moved onto or off of the property in approximately a month, so exposure to horses outside the area is considered unlikely.

The 1st horse was moved into the isolation barn on the property when it was diagnosed with equine herpes. The finding of the other herpes-positive horse had reset the quarantine clock and delayed the release date.

The equine herpes virus organism spreads quickly from horse to horse and can cause respiratory problems, especially in young horses, spontaneous abortions in pregnant mares, and the neurologic form of the virus can result in death, according to the release. The incubation period of the virus is typically 2 to 10 days.

Clinical signs include respiratory disease, fever, nasal discharge, depression, cough, lack of appetite and/or enlarged lymph nodes. In horses infected with the neurologic strain of equine herpes virus, clinical signs typically include mild uncoordination, hind-end weakness and paralysis, loss of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in the hind end.

The virus spreads readily through direct contact with infected materials. While highly infectious, the virus does not persist in the environment for an extended time and is neutralized by hand soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and sunlight.

The virus does not affect humans and other domestic animals, with the exception of llamas and alpacas.

Concerned owners should consult with their veterinarian prior to taking any action as the clinical signs of infection with the neurological form of equine herpes virus are common to many other diseases. The NJDA Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory provides testing for the neurologic form of equine herpes.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) has announced the state's 1st confirmed case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) this year [2018].

"The 5-year-old Standardbred gelding from Washtenaw County tested positive for ... EHM after developing a sudden onset of neurologic signs: weakness, incoordination in the hind limbs, and difficulty urinating," the MDARD said in a 27 Mar 2018 Facebook post. "The horse is currently under veterinary care and is isolated. The stable where the horse originated from is under quarantine and is being monitored closely."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[Other horses at these facilities should have their temperature monitored and recorded at least 2x daily, as a slight rise in body temperature may be the only and the earliest sign of illness.

If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae.

The neurological form of this disease may have a positive outcome but often does not.
