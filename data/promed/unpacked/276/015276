Since 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH; founded as Office International des Ã‰pizooties) has been at the forefront of tackling animal health challenges alongside its 182 members worldwide. The organisation works across borders to improve animal health and welfare globally, creating a safer future with its vast expertise, particularly in setting international standards.

From today, the organisation previously known as the OIE is revealing a new brand image, as well as furthering the use of its full name, World Organisation for Animal Health, with the matching acronym WOAH (OMSA in French and Spanish).

As the interdependence of animal health systems with human health, livelihoods, and ecosystems has never been more apparent, the rebrand comes at a crucial moment. The impacts of disease outbreaks have become more important and highly publicised. The need for international coordination and mobilisation is clear, not only to those working in the global health sector, but also increasingly to policymakers and the general public.

To continue carrying out its mandate effectively, WOAH endeavours to further increase awareness of its thematic work, expertise, and unique positioning by actively advocating for global animal health and welfare issues and providing science-based solutions. Collaboration is the key to achieving these goals, which is why WOAH strives to foster solidarity among all its members and create substantial networks of expertise with easy access to knowledge and data.

By improving animal health globally, livelihoods are transformed, economies are boosted, and the world becomes a safer, healthier place. WOAH seeks to be a leader in building a more sustainable world, one that fully embraces the interdependence of health systems.

Because animal health is essential to our future.

Animal health is our health. It's everyone's health.

[The World Organisation for Animal Health has recently adopted a new acronym: WOAH (OMSA in French and Spanish).

As of 28 May 2022, the World Organisation for Animal Health's acronym aligns with its actual full name. A video of the launching of the new acronym is available at https://youtu.be/fU1LbhkN1Vo.

[The WOAH] is "the global authority on animal health. Founded in 1924 as the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), in May 2003 we became the World Organisation for Animal Health. An intergovernmental organisation, we focus on transparently disseminating information on animal diseases, improving animal health globally, and thus build a safer, healthier, and more sustainable world."
