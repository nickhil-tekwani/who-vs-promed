Affected by blight and wilt diseases with incessant rains, pomegranate yield has come down by at least 60% in the state. The diseases leave the fruit with black spots and cracked surfaces, reducing their quality.

Farmers say that despite multiple sprays, the fruits can still be attacked. Due to the contagious nature of the disease, sometimes even well-guarded fields get infected from neighbouring fields.

Officials say they have not been notified of any major crop losses. They say that infections can be slowed down, but it is not possible to avoid them completely. Integrated disease control is important. They say that the problem is not a lack of control methods, but a lack of their implementation on farms.

[Blight
------
While a number of fungal leaf blights are known to affect the crop, the report above is likely to refer to oily spot (also called bacterial blight, black spot) caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (Xa) pv. _punicae_ which is rife in the region. Oily spot leads to blighting of leaves and sometimes also fruit and can cause up to 90 percent crop loss. It is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry in parts of India, including Karnataka, with up to 85 percent incidence in some areas, but 100 percent infection in some orchards (for example, see ProMED posts 20091120.3993, 20140430.2439412, 20150730.3546876).

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit, twigs and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human activities), and wind-splashed rain. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures, and bactericidal sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead to rejection of exported fruit by some countries (such as within the European Union). No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

Wilt
----
Wilt diseases of the crop have been reported to be due to fungi in the genera or species complexes of _Ceratocystis_, _Fusarium_ ,or _Rhizoctonia_, in single or combined infections; nematodes and insect pests affecting the roots may also be involved. Root pathogens and pests are generally soil borne.

Disease management of soil borne pathogens is difficult. It may include phytosanitary measures, crop rotation, and use of certified disease-free planting material. Agrochemicals are generally not very effective but may be helpful as treatments for seedlings or scions before planting. Genetic resistance, if available, is generally considered the best means of control.
