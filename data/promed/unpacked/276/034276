[According to the last avian influenza update from CIDRAP on 26 Dec 2018, "In India, tests on dead peacocks from a zoo in Patna, located in Bihar state in the country's northeast, were positive for H5N1, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported yesterday [Tue 25 Dec 2018]. The development temporarily shuttered the zoo. A state health official told PTI that it's not clear how the birds contracted the virus, and the report said the virus was recently implicated in a poultry outbreak in a district about 124 mi [200 km] from the zoo" (<www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/flu-scan-dec-26-2018>).

The district referenced in the CIDRAP article where this detection was made is Munger (https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/patna-zoo-closed-after-bird-flu-virus-found-in-dead-peacocks/article25826826.ece). It's likely that the case they note in this article is the same case notified by India. - Mod.CRD
