Dozens of domestic poultry that died in the western Georgian district
of Zestaponi on Saturday [7 Jan 2006] were victims of Newcastle
disease virus (NDV) not bird flu, Georgian Agriculture Minister
Mikheil Svimonishvili said on 8 Jan 2006.
Laboratory tests received at 4 am [local time] today [9 Jan 2006]
were negative for bird flu. I can assure [everyone] that currently
there is no threat of bird flu in Georgia, Svimonishvili told Imedi
TV on Sunday [8 Jan 2006].
