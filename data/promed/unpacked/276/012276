Officials have confirmed that a North Portland apartment complex had a new case of Legionnaires' disease in late September [2021], the latest in an outbreak attributed to the waterborne illness since January [2021].

The Multnomah County Health Department said the outbreak at Rosemount Court, the affordable housing complex for people age 55 and older, has resulted in 10 confirmed cases of Legionnaires', including one death, and 4 presumptive cases.

In January [2021], the county said an outbreak at the North Dekum Street building had killed one person and hospitalized 3 others, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. About 100 residents temporarily left while the county shut off the water and disinfected the system.

The disease is caused by the bacteria _Legionella_, which lives in water and is spread when humans breathe small droplets containing the bacteria.

While the building management, Northwest Housing Alternatives, has offered to permanently relocate some residents, many have struggled to find affordable housing, according to an Oregon Public Broadcasting report.

Multnomah County spokesperson Julie Sullivan-Springhetti said the county has worked with _Legionella_ experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who have said it's not uncommon for Legionnaires' cases to linger after a water system has been disinfected.

"The most recent case suggests there is still some risk to Rosemont Court residents, but it's hard to quantify," she said. "We are working with them on multiple fronts."

[The last ProMED post on this outbreak from 15 Oct 2021 (Legionellosis - USA (10): (OR) fatal, apartment complex, cases after remediation 20211015.8699064) reported Legionnaires' disease in 13 residents of Rosemont Court, an apartment building for the elderly. This is the same number of Legionnaires' disease cases that were reported in a 25 Jun 2021 ProMED post (Legionellosis - USA (04): (OR) fatal, apt. complex, 20210625.8475267). Three of the 13 cases occurred between 17 Mar 2021 and 23 Jun 2021, suggesting continued transmission of Legionnaires' disease despite prior attempts at remediation in the apartment building that occurred between January 2021 and 17 Mar 2021.

Because no new cases were reported between 23 Jun 2021 and 15 Oct 2021, I questioned in the moderator comments if additional attempts at remediation may have occurred since June 2021 to explain the absence of new cases. However, the news article above now reports that a new case of Legionnaires' disease occurred in late September 2021 in a resident of the apartment complex. We are not told if there is _Legionella_ isolate in this patient and if its genotype matches that of previous _Legionella_ isolates from infected apartment residents. Matching clinical genotypes would suggest a common source outbreak.

We have also not been told if _Legionella_ were isolated from suspected environmental sources and if environmental and clinical genotypes matched. If the genotypes of an environmental and clinical _Legionella_ isolates match, that confirms the environmental source for the individual cases. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Rosemont Court is described as "an older historic building" with studio, 1-, and 2-bedroom apartments (https://www.rent.com/oregon/portland-apartments/rosemont-court-4-lnp001E000000nye2DIAQ).
