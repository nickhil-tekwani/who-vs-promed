Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) virus serotype SAT-2 confirmed in the Gaza Strip
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are informed that FMDV serotype SAT-2 has been identified (ELISA test) by the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at Pirbright (UK) in a sample from clinically suspected cattle in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Palestinian Autonomous Territories (PAT). This confirms the initial diagnosis performed by the FMD laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) at Beit-Dagan, Israel. Following the initial diagnosis of a sample obtained as FMDV SAT2, the KVI laboratory sent the sample to WRLFMD for final confirmation and genotyping.

[In its recent update on FMDV SAT-2 in Egypt and Libya, the FAO included the following statement: "Movements of animals from the Nile Delta eastward through the Sinai Peninsula and north into the Gaza Strip have been deemed the highest risk for the spread of the SAT2 FMD virus strain into the wider Middle East region". (see at http://tinyurl.com/cshn77s). The current development underlines the actuality of the said statement, within the region and beyond.

The early diagnosis of the FMDV SAT-2 outbreak in Rafah (Gaza strip, PAT, adjacent to the borders with Egypt and Israel; map at
http://www.maplandia.com/gaza-strip/rafah/,
has become possible due to the exemplary cooperative efforts of several parties:

1. The Palestinian veterinary services, which managed to discover and sample the suspected animals in spite of the very low morbidity rate (according to their OIE notification, only 3 out of 120 susceptible animals; see ProMED post 20120419.1107093).

2. The FMD laboratory in the KVI, which managed to isolate and identify the virus shortly after receiving a manageable sample and subsequently submitting samples for confirmation and genotyping to WRLFMD. The essential importance of safeguarding the performance of this BSL3 FMD laboratory at an intercontinental crossroad of FMD and other epizootics has been underlined.

3. The WRLFMD, which carried out the ELISA test on the epithelial suspension immediately upon receipt (week-end!).

It will be interesting to note if the morbidity in the affected herd in Rafah has increased in the meantime; serology may be helpful in revealing the actual within-herd (subclinical?) infectivity.

Results of the genotyping of the Rafah strain at WRLFMD are expected with interest; hopefully, they will soon become publicly available (the genotyping results of the Egyptian SAT-2 strain are not yet available, probably since their publication has not yet been sanctioned by Egypt). - Mod. AS.]
