NDA Quarantines Backyard Flocks Due to Low Path Avian Flu
---------------------------------------------------------
State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes has placed several backyard
mixed bird flocks under quarantine after receiving confirmation of a
case of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in a backyard flock in
Eastern Nebraska. A Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) Bureau of
Animal Industry staff member detected the LPAI case through routine
testing conducted at a recent exotic bird sale.

"Low path avian influenza commonly occurs in wild birds, and so we
conduct routine testing of backyard flocks because those flocks often
are exposed to the outdoors," Hughes said. "Upon confirmation of the
LPAI case, we quickly determined where the birds originated from and
where the birds were dispersed to through the exotic bird sale. We
have no reason to believe this case is anything other than an isolated
incident."

"This is low-path Avian Influenza which isn't usually a human health
concern," said Dr. Joann Schaefer, the state's Chief Medical Officer
and Director of Public Health for the Nebraska Department of Health
and Human Services. "Low-path avian influenza is very different than
the high-path (H5N1) avian influenza that continues to circulate
overseas and is a cause for concern."

The backyard flock in which the LPAI was discovered (the initial
flock) has been quarantined and will be depopulated based on United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) protocol. Hughes said owners of 5
additional backyard flocks in Eastern Nebraska purchased birds from
the initial flock at the exotic bird sale. So far, 5 of these flocks
tested positive for LPAI and also will be depopulated. Backyard flocks
that are within a 2-mile radius of the 3 infected flocks currently are
being quarantined and will undergo testing.

"A backyard flock typically consists of hobby birds, show birds or
birds used for personal consumption," said Susan Joy, the general
manager of Nebraska Poultry Industries.

NDA encourages all backyard flock producers to follow biosecurity
measures on their operations, including: requiring individuals to wash
their hands before and after contact with birds; avoid contact with
neighbors' birds; and disinfect boots and change clothes that come
into contact with birds other than your own.

NDA conducts avian influenza testing as part of a cooperative
agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture. Producers
who are interested in having their flocks tested, free of charge, can
call the NDA.

[This article does not tell us what strain of avian influenza was
found. Not all low pathogenic strains are reportable to the OIE.
This article mentions exotic bird sale. This may mean it is a swap
meet where a variety birds are traded, sold, exchanged in a community
market situation.

There will likely be an investigation to determine how many birds may
have the disease and how far they may have been transported.

ProMED-mail would be grateful if the Nebraska officials or USDA
officials would publish which strain of avian influenza this was. -
