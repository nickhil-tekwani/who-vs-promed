Two children died and 4 other family members were downed by suspected paralytic shellfish poisoning in the island town of Daram in Samar [Eastern Visayas], according to the Department of Health (DOH-8) Wednesday [16 Sep 2020].

An 8-year-old boy and his 3-year-old brother manifested symptoms of food poisoning after eating green mussels (tahong) for lunch on Tuesday [15 Sep 2020] in Barangay Bagacay of said town.

The victims experienced numbness, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. 6 of the 7 family members were rushed to the hospital, however, the 2 children were declared dead on-arrival at Samar Provincial Hospital in Catbalogan City.

Roderick Boyd Cerro, the regional epidemiology surveillance unit chief, said all the symptoms indicated the patients suffered from paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) after eating red tide-infected shellfish.

He also reminded the public PSP can be fatal depending on the number of toxins ingested by a person.

Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR-8) information officer Christine Gresola, said their provincial office has already launched an investigation on the incident since the coastal waters of Daram are not contaminated with red tide based on samples collected by their laboratory.

Irong-Irong Bay in Samar, Cancabato Bay in Tacloban City; Matarinao Bay in the towns of General MacArthur, Hernani, Quinapondan, and Salcedo in Eastern Samar; Carigara Bay in Babatngon, San Miguel, Barugo, Carigara, and Capoocan in Leyte; and the coastal waters of Guiuan, Eastern Samar are currently infested by red tide.

BFAR-8 continues to appeal to the public to refrain from gathering, selling, and eating shellfish from these areas because these are not safe for human consumption.

[Dinoflagellates produce a number of toxins. How the disease is designated or named tends to reflect the organism responsible.

Paralytic shell fish poisoning is sometimes referred to as a "red tide". Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because, under certain circumstances, these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally, these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals -- such as clams, oysters, mussels -- in which the toxins bioaccumulate.

One interesting note is that both people and dogs can be sensitive to the spray effects associated with a red tide bloom. Dogs react in much the same fashion as people, with eye irritation, nose, and respiration irritation, and some dogs will have inflamed ears, and irritated skin.

Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish for consumption to be toxic.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals who swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms. Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this genus are capable of causing "red tide" that may be visible for long distances along a coastline.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are likely linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis, and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases, death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_ (previously known as _Gymnodinium breve_), which in high concentrations can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. _K. brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in the Gulf of Mexico waters and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning. The new name -- _Karenia brevis_ -- was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days. - Mod.TG
