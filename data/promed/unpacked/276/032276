Russia: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in the Rostov Region
-----------------------------------------------
13 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been recorded today
[7 Jul 2005] in the Rostov Region. According to the Rostov Region
Administration, that is almost 25 percent more than for the whole of last
year [2004].
The largest number of cases have been recorded in the Salskiy and Orlovskiy
Districts of the region. The recent decline in incidence of CCHF is a
result of greater awareness among regional and city hospital staff of the
consequences of outbreaks of serious diseases such as CCHF. In particular,
training of medical staff responsible for implementing primary
anti-epidemic measures has been improved.

[The Rostov Region is in the south of Russia at the mouth of the river Don
and has a common border with the Stavropol Region, where other outbreaks
have been reported this year [2005] (see below), which possibly correspond
to greater activity of the vector of CCHF in this part of southern Russia
this year. Only 9 cases of CCHF were recorded in the Rostov Region in 2004,
giving a morbidity index of 0.02 per 100 000 inhabitants. - Mod.NR and Mod.CP]
