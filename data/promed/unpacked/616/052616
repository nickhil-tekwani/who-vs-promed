The source WHO document [for the Outbreak News Today article] at http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273497/OEW30-2127072018.pdf [item 2 below] states 2 confirmed cases, 42 contacts, (not 42 suspected cases): "On 13 Jul 2018, a case of CCHF was confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in a 30 year old female, originally from Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, living in Katojo Camp in Nakivale Refugee Settlement. She presented with a 4 day history of fever and a bleeding diathesis on 7 Jul 2018.

"By 17 Jul 2018 the husband of the index case had tested positive for CCHF. No deaths have been reported and both cases are in isolation in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. A total of 42 contacts were listed on 17 Jul 2018, all household and close community contacts to both confirmed cases."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Lai for her contribution. Indeed the Outbreak News Today report as posted in the referenced archive above says "42 suspected cases" and the WHO report at [2] below says "42 contacts" -- only 2 cases on page 4, clearly mentioning the difference in number of CCHF cases and suspected contacts under investigation. - Mod.UBA]

Event description
-----------------
The Nakivale Refugee Settlement, Isingiro district, is suffering twin outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The settlement is in Isingiro district in the south of the country, bordering Tanzania. Isingiro district is host to 113 444 registered refugees, 106 592 of whom live in Nakivale Refugee Settlement. Uganda hosts a total of 1 470 981 refugees and asylum seekers.

On 13 Jul 2018, a case of CCHF was confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in a 30 year old female, originally from Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, living in Katojo Camp in Nakivale Refugee Settlement. She presented with a 4 day history of fever and a bleeding diathesis on 7 Jul 2018. By 17 Jul 2018 the husband of the index case had tested positive for CCHF. No deaths have been reported and both cases are in isolation in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. A total of 42 contacts were listed on 17 Jul 2018, all household and close community contacts to both confirmed cases.

A 47 year old butcher from Kanyatsi village, Kasese district fell ill on 20 Jun 2018, with a high fever and headache and was found dead by family members on 21 Jun 2018. A nasal swab sent to UVRI the same day tested positive for RVF. As of 9 Jul 2018, there were 8 reported cases of RVF, 4 suspected and 4 laboratory confirmed, from Isingiro (4), Ibanda (3), and Kasese (1). Of the 4 laboratory confirmed cases, 2 were from Isingiro, one from Ibanda, and one from Kasese. There were 2 deaths among the 4 confirmed cases, one in Kasese and one in Isingiro (case fatality ratio 50 per cent). 2 confirmed cases have recovered and been discharged from hospital. One new suspected case originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reported as of 9 Jul 2018. As of 17 Jul 2018, samples have been collected from 125 animals -- 95 cattle, 27 goats, and 3 sheep.

Public health actions
---------------------
- A rapid response team (RRT) was deployed by the ministry of health, supported by WHO, to establish outbreak response. The team comprised members with expertise on case management, epidemiology and surveillance, risk communication, laboratory testing, and veterinary medicine.
- WHO is participating in the national task force and providing technical guidance at national level. A district task force, chaired by the [Congo DR], is coordinating the response at district level.
- Case management is being provided at the isolation facility at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, and health workers are being instructed by clinicians deployed as part of the RRT. Affected districts are being prepared to manage cases at source. All suspected cases are being investigated promptly according to protocol, which includes laboratory sampling and dissemination of results.
- WHO had prepositioned personal protective equipment (PPE) for VHF management in 2016, which is now being used in initiation of infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. Supplies for supportive treatment have been mobilized by Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital.
- Surveillance teams have initiated field investigation and active case search in Isingiro and Ibanda districts and are developing a line list and case definition to support effective case identification and referral.
- Social mobilization and community engagement is being initiated by the risk communication team and some information, education and communication materials have been produced.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF and in which CCHF is endemic -- Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. A recent Food and Agriculture Organization risk analysis identified Uganda as at very high risk of amplification in some districts of the cattle corridor, which covers 52 districts cutting across the central part of the country from the south west in Ankole-Kigezi to the north eastern region in Karamoja. The RVF virus has been isolated frequently in domestic animals in all affected areas. In addition, the practice of eating 'Sanga meat', meat harvested from sick animals, in some districts heightens the risk of zoonotic transmission of both VHFs. At present, there is inadequate community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by these practices. Most of the 52 districts in the cattle corridor lack such engagement.

Challenges around inadequate surveillance, poor case identification, point source tracing of contacts with possible contaminated animals and active case search further hamper prevention and response efforts, increasing the risk of further transmission and geographical spread of both diseases. A strong One Health response is needed, which encompasses both animal health management and surveillance by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries and is not limited to the inclusion of veterinarians in a RRT team after the event. A comprehensive multi-sector response to these twin threats is needed.
