Could you please inform moderator CHC, that even if his comment was in
jest, it is still sexist and extremely inappropriate. The man's mother may
have in fact taught him how to wash his hands, yet he simply decided to
ignore her. When will society stop blasting mothers for everything that
happens with adults? Furthermore, his father also had the same obligation
to teach him how to wash his hands. Flippant and inappropriate comments
like this continue to perpetuate sexist stereotypes and serve no useful
purpose. ProMED is an extremely valuable and well respected service to
humanity. Moderators should not stoop to such a low level of reporting.

[Absolutely right. I sit corrected. I know a lot of mothers and I like
them. I must have had a bad role model; my father never washed his hands.
Too much reading of Macbeth, too. I am pleased to have the opportunity to
beg forgiveness for this sin, else I would have had to carry it for another
year. Just made it under the wire. Cord cut. - Mod.CHC
