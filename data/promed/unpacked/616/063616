There have been 68 new outbreaks of bluetongue in France in the last 2 weeks of September [2016], a recent report from the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) has shown.

This brings the total number of outbreaks of bluetongue in France to 385, with most of the outbreaks reporting cases of between 1 and 6 animals [see comment].

In total 10 734 cattle were susceptible the disease, with herds varying in size from as small as 56 to as large as 4000.

Out of these susceptible animals, 92 positive cases of bluetongue were detected. Meanwhile, there was also a positive outbreak of the disease reported in a flock of 54 sheep, with 18 of the animals testing positive.

All of the cases were detected as part of active surveillance and as part of pre-movement testing, while none of the infected animals died from the disease or had to be destroyed/slaughtered because of it, the report indicates.

Controls such as screening, surveillance, disinfection and the control of disease transmitting midges have been put in place to deal with the outbreaks, according to the OIE.

The reported outbreaks of the disease occurred mainly in the centre of France, with the Allier and Puy-De-Dome regions of the country most affected.

[France's most recent follow-up report to the OIE, No. 44, was submitted on 26 Sep 2016, with an interactive map showing the locations of the 26 new "outbreaks". The report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21036.

The affected locations/farms were detected as part of active surveillance and as part of pre-movement testing. In 21 of the 26 farms, only one single animal reacted positive. The others were: 2 farms with 2 positive cattle each, one farm with 4 positive, and 2 farms with 6 positive cattle each. For details on all 26 farms, please go to the OIE URL above.

OIE's total statistics of the BTV-8 event in France, as summarised since its reported start on 21 Aug 2015, are as follows:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 380 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 66 530 / 527 / 3 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2961 / 34 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep & goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / na / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

BTV serotype 8 is currently known to circulate also in Cyprus and Israel. The surveillance in France is applied in line with EU's policy to control the spread of the virus. Its clinical impact in France seems, at present, to be minimal. It will be interesting to note if the strain, currently circulating in the eastern Mediterranean, is being genotyped and if it is identical to the one in France. - Mod.AS
