The number of confirmed cases of salmonellosis related to Lucky's Taproom & Eatery [Dayton, Ohio] has more than doubled to 20, and 7 of those who contracted the food-borne bacterial infection are employees of the restaurant, health officials announced Tuesday, 8 Mar 2016. Health officials are wrapping up their investigation, according to John Steele, spokesman for Public Health -- Dayton & Montgomery County.

The restaurant and craft-beer bar in Dayton's Oregon District remains closed after shutting down 29 Feb 2016 when the investigation began. The 7 employees who fell ill won't be able to return to work until after they have had 2 negative test results at least 24 hours apart and are symptom-free, according to Steele.

House-made mayonnaise that tested positive for salmonellae is presumed to be the culprit behind the food-borne illness outbreak. Tests on 2 other food items -- avocado and goat cheese -- came back negative, Steele said. But of 21 people who submitted stool samples, 20 have tested positive for the bacteria, he said. Not all of the 80 people who reported falling ill submitted stool samples for testing. Steele said it's "virtually impossible to tell how the contamination took place."

Jennifer Wentzel, Public Health's environmental health director, said health inspectors "will do a walk-through of the facility before Lucky's reopens to make sure the facility is clean, sanitized, and safe for the public going forward."

Lucky's owner Drew Trick has said he has taken several steps to ensure the safety of future patrons, including throwing out all food items in the kitchen. And he says the restaurant will never again make its own mayonnaise. The restaurant and craft-beer bar was planning to celebrate its 5th anniversary all this week, but hasn't set a date to reopen, Trick said.

Steele said Lucky's had a good record of restaurant inspections and characterized the owner's level of cooperation as "fantastic. They've gone over and above."
