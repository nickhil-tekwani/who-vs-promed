[The following additional information has been added to the Brazilian
Ministry of Health statement included in the preceding ProMED-mail
post: Viral hemorrhagic fever - Brazil (RIO) ex South Africa: RFI,
archive number 20081202.3792]

1. A 53-year-old man arrived in Brazil on 23 Nov [2008]. On 25 Nov
[2008] he presented the 1st symptoms of a febrile hemorrhagic disease
as yet undiagnosed.

2. On [28 Nov 2008], he went to 2 private hospitals in Rio de
Janeiro, with a clinical picture of fever, chills, vomiting,
hematuria, hepatomegaly, and small skin eruptions [?petechiae]. On [2
Dec 2008], the patient died.

5. One of the viruses suspected to be the cause of death of the
patient is an [South African] arenavirus. It can be transmitted by
direct contact with secretions or blood from rodents or from infected
patients.

[Previously it was stated that there had been no reports of similar
symptoms among health professionals who had contact with the patient,
and that implementation of quarantine was not considered necessary.
Diagnoses of dengue, malaria, and ebola [hemorrhagic fever] had
already been discarded. Other etiologies, such as leptospirosis,
hepatitis, and hantaviruses will be investigated.

This additional new information suggests that the South African
visitor had contracted his illness prior to arrival in Brazil, and
not during travel within the country. The patient's illness had been
diagnosed as a viral hemorrhagic fever and the results of laboratory
tests are awaited. There is as yet no direct evidence that the
patient had contracted the novel arenavirus recently identified as
the cause of an outbreak of disease associated with the treatment of
a Zambian patient in South Africa. - Mod.CP]
