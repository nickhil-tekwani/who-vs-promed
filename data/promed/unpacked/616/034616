As the potato harvest in the United Kingdom progresses, there are increasing reports of widespread scab.

In the East, scab has now been reported as widespread on susceptible varieties. Following heavy rain, localised waterlogging has led to some circumstances of bacterial rot. In the West, scab is reported as widespread but not altering demand at this stage. A small amount of localised blight has been reported. In the South, yields have been reported as good, however, scab is often present, especially on salads [varieties].

The generally wetter weather in Scotland has led to fewer reports of scab than in other regions for most varieties with the exception of M[aris] Piper, which has proved more susceptible.

[Common scab of potato is caused by the bacterium _Streptomyces scabiei_ and has been reported from most potato growing areas worldwide. Symptoms include cracks and lesions on tubers that coalesce into large rough or corky areas, but above ground plant parts appear normal. Scab reduces crop quality, although scabby potatoes are generally fit to eat and store well. Infection occurs during early tuber formation, and if soils are dry at that stage, disease levels can be high. The pathogen can also affect other root crops, such as carrot, parsnip, radish, beet and turnip. Each of the crops can serve as reservoir host in case of successive rotations with the others and so increase overall scab incidence. The disease is favoured by alkaline soils.

The bacterium is soil-borne and can survive on infected tubers and plant debris. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include cultural techniques such as 3-5 year rotations with non-host crops, increase of organic matter in fields to increase soil moisture and adjusting soil pH. Use of certified scab-free seed tubers is essential. Commercial potato cultivars differ in their levels of susceptibility, but none with complete resistant to scab are currently available. Research is being carried out into biological control of scab by antibiotic-producing strains of _Streptomyces_.

Similar symptoms on potato tubers can also be caused by powdery scab due to the fungus-like organism _Spongospora subterranea_, which is also the vector for _Potato mop-top virus_ (see, for example, ProMED-mail post 20100616.2020).

The other diseases mentioned above are likely to be bacterial (soft) rot (_Pectobacterium_ or _Dickeya_ species) and late blight (caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_). For more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
