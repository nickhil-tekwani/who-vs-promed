AQUATIC BIRNAVIRUS IN TASMANIA
Notice: Views expressed by this message are not necessarily those of the
Department of Primary Industries and Energy or of the Government of the
Commonwealth of Australia.

During routine examinations under the Tasmanian Salmonid Health Surveillance
Program, an aquatic birnavirus was isolated from a pool of farmed Atlantic
salmon (_Salmo salar_ L.) post smolt pinhead fish in Macquarie Harbour.
There was no outbreak of clinical disease associated with these fish.
During subsequent investigations, the virus was also isolated from farmed
rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_ Walbaum) and some wild fish species
(greenback flounder Rhombosolea tapirina and probably cod). All isolations
were made from fish in Macquarie Harbour which is situated on the west coast
of Tasmania; the majority of Atlantic salmon farms are located on the
south-east coast of the state.
While investigations into virus characterisation are continuing,
precautionary measures have been taken although there is no clinical disease
associated with the virus isolation. These measures include a ban on the
removal of live salmonid fish from the farms in Macquarie Harbour and their
associated fish processing plants; the restriction of processing of fish
from these farms to specified processing plants; a ban on the removal of
fish or fish produce derived form these fish farms from the processing
plants unless viscera and gills have been removed; the restriction to
dispose of gills, viscera and dead fish not intended for processing on a
land based site; and the direction to remove seacage nets from these sea
farms for cleaning on a land based site and return them to those farms and
not use them elsewhere.
Birnaviruses are widespread in the aquatic environment but have never been
reported from Australia despite comprehensive testing under the Salmonid
Surveillance Program. Investigations are continuing to further characterise
the virus and obtain information about its distribution in Tasmania. Testing
to characterise the virus includes laboratory-based characterisation by
immunodiagnostic methods and nucleic acid techniques as well as experimental
infection studies.
