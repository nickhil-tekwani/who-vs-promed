A rare tick-borne disease is making its rounds at Lake Tahoe at an
unprecedented pace, according to health officials. Tick-borne
relapsing fever is non-lethal in most cases, but can result in
serious complications if left untreated.
People contract the disease from soft ticks, which live in the nests
of small animals like mice and chipmunks. Rustic, rodent-infested
cabins are often a source of the disease.
"The Tahoe Basin is becoming a hotbed for this disease," said El
Dorado County Health Officer Jason Eberhart-Phillips. Five cases were
reported here in 2005, and health officials have identified 3 cases
so far this summer [2006].

There are only about 25 cases of tick-borne relapsing fever in the
USA each year, according to the CDC, primarily in high-altitude,
coniferous Western forests.
Doctors in the area are well aware of the disease and will recognize
its symptoms, said Ginger Huber with El Dorado County's Department of
Environmental Management.
"The most important thing is to not sleep in rustic cabins or homes
that have obvious rodent infestations," Huber said.
A woman who lived in an urban home in Tahoe contracted a serious case
of the illness in 2005. The home was being remodeled, and birds had
bored holes that allowed rodents to enter the walls and build nests.
Soft ticks usually bite at night and transmit the disease within
minutes of finding a host, so people usually do not know that they
have been bitten.
Patients experience high fever and flu-like symptoms that last about
3 days then disappear, then come back after about 7 days. The
relapsing fevers can occur up to 10 times in people who are not
treated, according to the CDC. CDC estimates the disease is fatal in
5 to 10 percent of cases if left untreated.

[Relapsing fever is caused by a spirochete in the _Borrelia_ genus.
The _Ornithodoros_ tick vector can be seen at:

The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be readily made during febrile
periods by a Wright's stain of the peripheral blood. Unlike other
spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The
typical peripheral blood smear can be seen at:

The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein
antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the
manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 1 and 2 are useful.
