Health Protection Scotland (HPS) has revealed that the number of people infected with _E. coli_ O157 almost doubled in the 1st half of 2014 compared to the previous year. In total, 129 cases have been confirmed, up on 66 for the same period in 2013. However, Dr Eleanor Anderson, epidemiologist for HPS, said levels of illness from the bacteria were particularly low in 2013.

There have also been 2 large _E. coli_ outbreaks in 2014, including one associated with burgers cooked at Glasgow's Hydro concert venue, which affected 21 people. Another outbreak was linked to a Fife restaurant.

Dr Anderson added that it was usual for cases to peak during the summer. "It might be something to do with people cooking outdoors," she said. "Some cases will be travel related."
