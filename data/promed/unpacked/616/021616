Re: the moderator's comment that: "Something wrong here. Is the State of
Alabama using horses and emus as sentinels for predicting the presence of
infected mosquitoes? Surely there is a vector control program there that
would provide greater predictive capabilities."
The experience in Louisiana this year [1999 is that testing veterinary
submissions for EEE is far more predictive than testing either mosquito
"pools" (collections of trapped mosquitoes) or testing sentinel bird blood.
In July there were 28 confirmed cases of equine EEE in 14 parishes (64
submissions). At the same time our state laboratory found 2 positives in 484
mosquito pools, and only 3 positives in 1356 samples of bird blood. In fact,
the extremely low prevalence of positive bird samples (0.2%) may be near the
level of false positives for this test.
It appears that equine cases provided a better distribution of 1999 EEE
activity at a fraction of the cost of the other two surveillance methods.
While we did not plan Louisiana's horses to be a sentinel population, they
are serving the purpose better than our planned surveillance.

[Sentinel chickens, or the right kind of wild birds, serve as hosts for
mosquitoes that carry EEE virus. Amplification of the virus occurs in
birds. Therefore, the first stage of an impending epizootic always is the
bird-mosquito cycle. One can test birds or one can test mosquitoes. Given
that the birds are fed on by many mosquitoes, a seropositive bird indicates
the presence of at least one infected mosquito.
Seroconversion (seronegative to seropositive) in birds occurs about two
weeks before the first horses are observed to be infected. In turn, the
first horses are infected about two weeks before the first humans are
infected. Thus, if one has either a bird or mosquito surveillance system
that is faulty, or does not have such a system at all, the first warning
will be when the first horse is infected. This provides two weeks LESS time
to act (mosquito control, education, etc.).
Of course equid cases of EEE provide a better distribution of EEE virus
activity; they are the first cases we would hope to prevent. The idea is to
garner a bit more breathing room than two weeks. An "extremely low
prevalence of positive bird samples (0.2%)" less likely represents false
positives (I do not know which test is being used) than it does rare
positives. A positive (if it is positive, not simply a borderline positive)
means the bird had been fed on by infected mosquito. Clearly, a positive
bird here and a positive bird there doesn't indicate an imminent epiornitic,
but it means something if the prevalence rate increases and the system in
place is adequate.
I suggest that the mosquito surveillance system noted above may be
inadequate, not insensitive, and that the wild birds being sampled are
either not the right birds, or the right species in the wrong places.
CDC/Ft. Collins can provide more specific and thorough advice than this.
I once had a state public health official in a very large state tell me that
they were using "a sentinel drunk" system for detecting amplification of St.
Louis encephalitis virus. He seemed to think this was humorous; I didn't.
In this age of cost-cutting, elimination of level after level of potential
alarms will leave us with a sentinel horse system. We might next be left
with a sentinel human system. - Mod.CHC
