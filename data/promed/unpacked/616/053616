Congress Told Military Vaccines Linked to Diabetes, Anthrax Vaccine a Risk
---------------------------------------------
The Committee on Government Reform of the United States House of
Representatives heard testimony today on the subject "Defense Vaccines:
Force Protection or False Securities." The committee heard from Dr. J.
Barthelow Classen about the increased risk of autoimmunity following
immunization in the military and the link between vaccines and diabetes. The
Committee on Government Reform chaired by Dan Burton held the meeting in
part because of growing concern about the safety of the anthrax vaccine and
its ability to induce autoimmune diseases.
Congress heard evidence that vaccination may be doubling the risk of
diabetes in military personnel. Data was provided showing an increased risk
of insulin diabetes in navy personnel compared to people in the general
population. Men drafted into the Swedish military also have twice the risk
of diabetes than expected. The anthrax vaccine may cause 1 in every 1,000
recipients to develop insulin dependent and as many as 1 in 200 may develop
chronic adverse events from the vaccine.
Extensive research in animals and humans indicates vaccine induced diabetes
is common and preventable. Research on childhood vaccines indicates
immunization starting in the first month of life is associated with a
decreased risk of diabetes while immunization starting after 2 months of
life is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The effect is not
limited to a single vaccine but appears to occur with most, if not all,
vaccines.
Classen proposes that public health officials be made accountable for
adhering to laws which assure safety of vaccines. Manufacturers should be
required to perform long term testing of their vaccines for the development
of diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. Recipients and parents need to be
informed of data linking vaccines to diabetes and that the age when the
first dose is given may affect the risk of diabetes. Development of safer
immunization technology should be given priority over the development of new
vaccines.
Dr. Classen's research has been published in numerous journals and featured
in national news reports. For the latest information on the effects of
vaccines (including anthrax) on insulin dependent diabetes and other
autoimmune diseases visit the Vaccine Safety Website (http://vaccines.net).

[The above was copied for comment to John Grabenstein of the US military
vaccination program, who replied as follows - MHJ

From: "Grabenstein, John D LTC" <John.Grabenstein@otsg.amedd.army.mil>

On October 12, 1999, John Barthelow Classen, MD, MBA, claimed at a hearing
to a U.S. Congressional committee that vaccinations during military service
increase the risk of developing diabetes. In written and oral statements,
Dr. Classen based his assertion on findings in Sweden of more diabetes among
vaccinated military men compared to less-vaccinated civilian women, but the
opposite among vaccinated men and women in the US Navy. Dr. Classen did not
explain why the effect in the two studies was reversed, nor why he focused
on a Navy study that did not show a statistically significant difference by
gender. Nor did he offer any written or oral explanations of whether or how
he adjusted for varying degrees of scrutiny in diagnosing diabetes in the
separate studies, varying case definitions of diabetes, adjustment for the
expected effects of aging, or other biases or confounding effects that
imperil simple comparisons.
An Associated Press release dated October 12, 1999, about Dr. Classen's
testimony did not mention comments offered by Neal A. Halsey, MD, professor
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health. At the same
hearing, Dr. Halsey described workshops conducted by the Institute for
Vaccine Safety (Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal 1999; volume 18: pages
217-22) and the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases
(British Medical Journal 1999;317:159-60,
http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7152/159).
Each of these workshops found no scientific basis for Dr. Classen's
hypotheses. In addition, the investigators of a study upon which Dr.
Classen's assertions are based recently published results showing there is
no association between vaccination and diabetes (British Medical Journal
1999;318:1169-72, http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7192/1169).
Although Dr. Classen criticized the military anthrax vaccination program
during his testimony, he holds U.S. patents on infant vaccination schedules
for administration of anthrax, plague, HIV, leprosy, yellow fever, or other
immunogens to newborn babies, as a means of preventing diabetes (British
Medical Journal 1999;318:electronic letter #4;
http://www.bmj.org/cgi/eletters/318/7177/193#EL4; U.S. patents #5,723,283
and 5,728,385). Indeed, Dr. Classen's own animal findings (Autoimmunity
1996;24:137-45) show that nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice given anthrax vaccine
developed diabetes at a lower rate than comparable mice given either
phosphate-buffered saline, a kind of placebo, or other vaccines.
The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) notes that "The only
evidence suggesting a possible increase in risk has come from Dr. John B.
Classen (Classen 1996; Classen and Classen 1997). Other researchers who have
studied the issue have not found an increased risk of diabetes associated
with vaccination (Parent 1997, Dahlquist 1995, Blom 1991, Heijbel 1997,
Hyoty 1993).
These other studies, however, all examined the relationship of vaccination
and development of diabetes without regard to when the vaccines were
administered. Still, the results of these other studies are relevant to the
question of a possible increase in risk of diabetes and they do not support
such an association with vaccination." CDC concludes "Dr. Classen's results
are not consistent with current scientific thinking and have not been
verified by other researchers"
(http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/vaccinesafety/sideeffects/diabetes.htm).
No elevated risk of diabetes was seen in more than 1500 laboratory workers
at Fort Detrick, Maryland, vaccinated against anthrax or other dangerous
infections and followed for many years. The Department of Defense conducts a
monitoring program to assess the safety of anthrax vaccine that encompasses
the whole human body, including diabetes. The anthrax vaccine's safety
record is substantial. DoD continues to believe anthrax vaccination is a
prudent measure to protect people in the Armed Forces from lethal biological
weapons.
