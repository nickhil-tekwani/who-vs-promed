Amid a surge in cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam, as many as 12 fresh cases were reported in the state on Monday [11 Jul 2022].

The total cases of JE since July [2022] now stands at 98 in the state, data from the national health mission (NHM) in Assam showed.

Of the 12 new cases, 3 were reported from Morigaon district; 2 each were from Karimganj, Nagaon, and Sonitpur districts; and one each was from Chirang, Darrang, and Tinsukia districts.

[Assam continues to have very active Japanese (JE) virus transmission again in 2022. In just the past 5 days, the number of deaths has increased from 6 to 10, and the number of JE cases from 48 to 98. Interestingly, none of these 98 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). No mention is made in the above report if any of these affected individuals reported above had been vaccinated against JE or if a vaccination campaign is planned. Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission, so more cases are likely to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY
