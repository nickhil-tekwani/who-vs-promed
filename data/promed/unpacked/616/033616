66 per cent or 2584 out of 3923 malaria cases reported in the country last year [2015] derived from monkey (zoonotic) malaria, with the highest number of patients recorded in Sabah, Sarawak and Kelantan.

Head of the Health Ministry's Vector-Borne Disease Sector Dr Rose Nani Mudin said 730 cases or 19 per cent of malaria infections began with foreign workers in the plantation sector.

According to statistics, she said in the 1st quarter of this year [2015], 356 cases, or 67.6 per cent of the 527 cases of malaria were detected to be derived from monkeys, she told reporters after the launch of national-level World Malaria Day 2015 at the Gua Musang Hospital here yesterday [25 May 2015].

Galas assemblyman Ab Aziz Yusof officiated the launch, which was also attended by Kelantan Health Department director Datuk Dr Ahmad Razin Ahmad Mahir.

Dr Rose Nani explained that the zoonotic malaria outbreak occurred when _Anopheles_ mosquitoes, which bit infected monkeys, also bit humans. Overall, she said the number of malaria cases in the country had dropped dramatically due to various efforts and steps taken by the ministry to monitor and control the spread of the disease.

She said that compared to the 1990s, when there were more than 50 000 malaria cases recorded nationwide, the number had declined dramatically to only 3923 cases last year [2014] and was expected to continue to decline this year [2015] with the cooperation of all parties.

"Death due to malaria is also low, with one death recorded in the 1st 3 months this year [2015] compared to 2 deaths recorded in the corresponding period last year [2014]," she added.

[The general concept of human infections with _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is that they are transmitted from the macaque monkey reservoir and that no human-to-human transmission occurs. A very high proportion of human cases are classified as _P. knowlesi, and we assume that the species identification has been done by molecular methods. Studies addressing the question of whether _P. knowlesi_ is adapting to human-to-human transmission are badly needed. - Mod.EP

One can't help but wonder if there is transmission of _P. knowlesi_ in neighboring Indonesian provinces on the island of Borneo. - Mod.MPP]
