Thrifty Foods is voluntarily recalling its Kitchen Crab Cakes because
of a contamination danger, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says.
The crab cakes may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, the
bacterium that causes botulism.
Consumers should check the packaging for the item code 29273. The
recalled products, sold in Thrifty Foods stores across British
Columbia, were made using Phillips brand pasteurized crab meat. The
CFIA had recalled the Phillips crab meat in late October 2006 because
of a possible _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination danger.
There have been no associated reported illnesses.
