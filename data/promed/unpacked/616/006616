_Tomato mottle mosaic virus_ (_Tobamovirus_; ToMMV - EPPO Alert List) was identified for the 1st time in seeds harvested from tomato plants (_Solanum lycopersicum_) grown in the Netherlands, which were part of a variety selection programme. The sample also tested positive for _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (_Tobamovirus_; ToBRFV - EPPO A2 List) and _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_; PSTVd - EPPO A2 List).

Previously, ToMMV had already been intercepted in 3 tomato seed lots imported from China in April 2020 and July 2021, as well as in a seed lot of unknown origin in 2015 [Source: https://doi.org/10.1002/ndr2.12067].

[_Tomato mottle mosaic virus_ (ToMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) can affect tomato and capsicum, resulting in unmarketable fruits in both crops. Symptoms may include necrotic lesions, chlorosis, distortion and mottle on leaves, as well as necrosis on fruits. A disease incidence of up to 87% has been reported in tomato. The virus has also been reported in aubergine in mixed infection with _Tobacco mild green mosaic virus_, but its role in symptom development in this crop is as yet unclear. Chickpea has been reported as an asymptomatic host. Symptomatic leguminous hosts have also been confirmed recently (ProMED post 20211021.8699190). ToMMV is spreading in Europe and is considered an emerging virus for tomato and capsicum in the region.

ToMMV is very stable and can be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material (cuttings, tomato transplants, crop debris), contaminated soil, water, as well as by insect pollinators used in some commercial crops. Volunteer crop plants and weed species are potential pathogen reservoirs.

Similar to _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV; see ProMED post 20200206.6959141), resistance genes used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses, such as _Tomato mosaic virus_, do not appear to be effective against ToMMV.

Many tobamoviruses are seed transmitted. Its fast international spread suggests that this is also the case for ToMMV, at least in some hosts. Capsicum and tomato seeds imported for sowing have been found to be positive for ToMMV (e.g. in Australia; ProMED post 20200210.6976116). While virus transmission to seedlings germinated from infected seeds remains to be proven, the evidence for its presence on or in commercial seed confirms the potential of introducing the virus to new areas in this manner.

For some tobamovirus species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species such as _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (see previous ProMED posts in the archives), surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos.

Disease management of tobamoviruses relies mainly on exclusion, but may include phytosanitation (disinfection of tools, removal of crop debris) and control of pathogen reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or seedling transplants is crucial. Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade.
