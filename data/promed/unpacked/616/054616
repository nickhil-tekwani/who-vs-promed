The State Center for Health Surveillance (CEVS) today stated that a yellow fever case in the Candelria municipality was discarded as such. The Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo confirmed that case was a hantavirus [infection], an acute disease caused by a virus. In Brazil, hantavirus [infections] occur as cardiopulmonary syndromes. In the initial phase, symptoms are fever, arthralgia, headache, back pain, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. In the cardiopulmonary phase there is fever, respiratory difficulty, tachypnea, tachycardia, dry cough, hypotension, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and the patient develops acute respiratory insufficiency and circulatory shock.

The infection occurs through the inhalation of [virus containing] aerosols of urine, feces and saliva from virus infected wild rodents. After contact with the virus in the environment, in 1-5 weeks, varying from 3-60 days, symptoms appear. There are various types of hantaviruses, each associated with a species of reservoir rodent. Urban rats (common rats, roof rats and house mice) are not reservoirs in Brazil. [Brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) and black rats (_Rattus rattus_) are reservoirs of Seoul hantavirus around the world and in Brazil as well. - Mod.TY]

In general, agricultural activities (cleaning of storage structures, harvested crops, etc.), household or leisure (fishing, hunting) activities can be directly or indirectly associated to wild rodent exposure and/or their excretas, as the main risk factors for hantavirus infections.

To prevent [infection] it is necessary to guarantee hygiene practices and avoid contact with contaminated environments. Some action to combat rodents, such as cleanup of the areas around the house, adequate disposition of trash, keeping food materials in closed containers and helping keep the are rodent free and avoidance of their interaction with people.

[Although this fatal case was initially reported as confirmed yellow fever, samples were sent to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo which subsequently confirmed the case as a hantavirus infection. As the above report mentioned, there are several possible hantaviruses that could be responsible for this case. The specific hantavirus that infected the above patient is not given in this report. Several hantaviruses are known to circulate in various part of Brazil.

As Dr Jan Clement and his colleagues pointed out in their comments Seoul hantavirus should be considered as an etiological agent responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Americas, and there is evidence for its presence in Brazil (see Hantavirus - Americas (54): Panama (LS) comment, Brazil 20171024.5398648). The ProMED-mail report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008 (see Hantavirus update 2008 - Americas (10): Brazil (MG) Archive Number: 20080702.2020) indicated that hantaviruses circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the _Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had previously been found in Para state, but without a known host. Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. Araraquara virus infection has also caused HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Necromys [Bolomys] lasiurus_ in Brazil. Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent of HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Oligoryzomys fornesi_ in Brazil. The occurrence of any of these or other hantavirues in Mato Grosso do Sul state has not been reported. - Mod.TY
