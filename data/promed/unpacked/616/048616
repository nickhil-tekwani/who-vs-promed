Five Samples from Shandong, Jiangxi, and Guangdong Test Positive for H7N9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The News Office of the Ministry of Agriculture announced on 5 May 2013 that the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory found that 3 environmental samples among 412 collected from Shandong tested positive for H7N9 avian influenza. The samples were from Xingfu Road Market in Shizhong District of Zaozhuang City, Shandong.

Jiangxi Animal Disease Control Center sent 4 samples for review by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory and 1 was found positive for H7N9 avian influenza. The sample came from a chicken in a commercial site in Xiangtang Town of Nanchang County in Nanchang City, Jiangxi.

The Guangdong Animal Disease Control Center sent one sample which was confirmed positive for H7N9 avian influenza. It was from a chicken in Dongcheng Sanniao Wholesale Market of Dongguan, Guangdong.

[The confirmation of LPAI A/H7N9 zoonotic virus in a chicken sampled earlier in a wholesale market in Dongguan, Guangdong, adds this southeastern province (map at http://tinyurl.com/czjs62a) to the 10 provinces/municipalities in China found, so far, infected by the virus. Since 26 Apr 2013, this chicken sample was suspected to include an H7 virus, but confirmation from a reference laboratory and full diagnosis were pending (see 20130430.1683206, 20130504.1690089).

Guangdong becomes the first province in China where animals (i.e., birds), not humans, are the sentinels of the virus for humans and not vice versa. This finding justifies earlier media publications in neighbouring Hong Kong demanding intensification of the sanitary-veterinary measures to prevent the introduction of the new virus from the mainland. Guangdong is the main supplier of live poultry to Hong Kong. - Mod.AS]
