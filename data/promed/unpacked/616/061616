STRIPE RUST, WHEAT - LEBANON

Lebanon's wheat production is at risk from virulent strains of fungi
that threaten to devastate production. An unusually mild winter
2009-2010 already resulted in a "serious" outbreak in the country of
the mutated and especially potent adaptation of "rust fungi" [stripe
rust], but experts are fearful that knock-on effects of global
warming will only further intensify the country's susceptibility in
the coming years.

The disease has the capacity to destroy some 50 percent of wheat
stock and is presently being blamed for the loss some one million
hectares in Syria [ProMED-mail posts 20101021.3815 and
20100609.1930]. If serious steps are not taken to monitor the spread
of rust fungi and take measures to diversify wheat crops, the
situation could spread across the region, said the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) Food Outlook report.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale
(wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the
fungus survives on living host plants, generating a "green bridge"
between seasons. Disease management includes the use of resistant
varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging, and
regional monitoring programmes are important to recognise them. A new
strain identified by ICARDA (International Centre for Agriculture in
Dry Areas) is currently causing serious outbreaks in the Middle East,
North Africa and Central Asia (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed
below). Although it is not clearly stated above, from the Lebanese
report it can be inferred that this pathogen is also affecting wheat
production in that country. However, additional rust fungi and/or
different strains may be present as well.

Breeding programmes for resistance to stripe rust are in progress at
ICARDA and elsewhere, but the process of releasing new varieties to
farmers is slow.
