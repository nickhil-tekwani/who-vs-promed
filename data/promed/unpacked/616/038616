Below is an information that should put an end to the discussion on
ProMED-mail
on what is precisely a sporadic case of BSE in Belgium:
Belgian veterinary national services have declared today, 10 of March, the
second BSE case ever identified in Belgium. The dairy cow (the previous case
was a meat cow, Blanc Bleu Belge) was born on the 26th Dec, 1992 (this is a
BAB case). Her mother was born in December 1989, but her origin is not
mentioned yet. The cow positive for BSE was born on the same farm where she
spent her dairy life, which is located in Western Flanders, in Rudderwoorde.
The case was confirmed by the Belgian national laboratory this morning. All
the 48 animals will be slaughtered and the brains of all cows over 2 years
of age will be examined for BSE.
The clinical suspicion was made on the 18th of February by the local
veterinary practitioner: the cow's behaviour had changed in the 7 previous
days, becoming more "excitable" and with frequent abrupt changes in the
behaviour. The official veterinarian made a visit on the 20th February, and
the cow was brought to the rendering house where she has been slaughtered.
The brain went to the national lab and the rest of the carcass has been
rendered and then burnt.
....
Very interesting. Do two cases still make it "sporadic"? Does it not seem to
make some common source more likely rather than less likely? Will we see a
third? Are we using the same definition for sporadic, i.e. that the disease
occurs rarely and without regularity. Having the second case occur so
closely to the first in time maybe not in space would begin to reduce my
confidence that the disease is indeed sporadic in Belgium.
