Concerning your posting on cholera in Mozambique and South Africa [border
regions, I think that [there is a problem [with looking only for ill
people, because the carrier rate is very high for _Vibrio cholera_, El
Tor. In this case you can have a lot of carriers crossing the border. This
makes international control of cholera difficult.
I think that South African authorities must continue with the surveillance
of water sources and alert all health facilities [of the cholera case
definition for quick response when a case is identified.
Health education [for the population is crucial, as water storage at home
has played an important role for the spread of cholera in Mozambique.
