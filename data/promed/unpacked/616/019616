Nearly 100 apes and an unspecified number of wild pigs have been found dead
in mysterious circumstances at the uninhabited rugged terrain of Golelcha
Woreda, in Bale Zone of Southern Oromiya State, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported Friday.
The report quoted Ashebir Zewdie, a local zonal official in charge of
agriculture, as saying that the apes met their deaths at the thickly wooded
massif stretching between Buria and Bulala areas in an enigmatic
pestilential animal disease. Ashebir said the wild pigs died after preying
on the carcasses of the infected apes and the number of
dead pigs could not be established due to the inaccessible terrain.
He said the apes before their death showed such symptoms as dysentery,
insatiable thirst for water, blood vomiting, hair withering and loss of
weight.
He said the zonal agricultural department has notified the problem to the
state agricultural bureau and indicated the urgent need to solve the
problem, as the area is a major tourist site.
The Golelcha Woreda is home to over 19 herds of apes each having 500-1000
family members, according to the report.

[There are some conflicting statements here: "inaccessible terrain" &
"tourist site," ability to count dead apes but not dead pigs. We assume
that the "apes" are in fact baboons, ground-living omnivorous primates that
may have become infected by a filovirus such as Ebola or Marburg, or a
similar hemorrhagic fever, from a smaller animal they ate -- hence the
dysentery (blood in the feces) & bloody vomit. But the other symptoms
donÂ´t match. Would anyone who can clarify the species of "ape" (monkey?) &
give any further information please communicate with us. - Mod.JW]
