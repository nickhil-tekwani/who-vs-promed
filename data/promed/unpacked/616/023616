[A "new strain" of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype A virus has been, reportedly, spreading in China since early 2013. It has been officially reported from Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangdong, and Qinghai provinces, and now also from Jiangsu Province in eastern China, and has, probably, a wider circulation. According to China's previous OIE notifications, these serotype A virus strains belong to SEA 97 G2 clade. Genotyping of 2014 isolates is not (yet) available. Genotyping reports of strains collected in 2013 from swine in Guangdong Province and from cattle in Qinghai Province are available, respectively, at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00004%20A%20PR%20China%202013-2.pdf and http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00009%20A%20PR%20China%202013.pdf. Both are closely related to 2013 FMDV-A strains from eastern Russia (Amur, Zabaikal), into which they are suspected to have penetrated since March 2013. An outbreak of FMD serotype A was reported also in eastern Kazakhstan in May 2013, on the border with China.

China reported, in previous OIE reports on this virus, among its control measures, "vaccination in response to the outbreak," and provided statistics of vaccinated animals (cattle, sheep and swine). Information on the vaccination history of the affected porcines, reported from Jiangsu Province, will be helpful.

China is also suffering outbreaks of FMDV serotype O. - Mods.AS/CRD]
