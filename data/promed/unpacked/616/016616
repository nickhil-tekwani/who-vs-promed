Two cases of travel-associated bubonic plague in New York City
---------------------------------
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) has
presumptively diagnosed bubonic plague in a 53-year-old male resident of
New Mexico who was visiting New York City. In addition, the patient's
47-year-old wife has symptoms consistent with bubonic plague and laboratory
test results are pending.
Both patients reside in Santa Fe County, New Mexico - in an area that is
known to be an enzootic focus for plague. The source of these patients'
infections is suspected to be rodents and rodent fleas near their home, as
a woodrat that was found in the patients' back yard this past July tested
positive for plague. Fleas taken from this woodrat also tested positive
for plague.
This couple traveled to New York City on November 1, 2002 and both
developed a flu-like illness on November 3rd. As symptoms continued to
worsen, they were admitted to a hospital on November 5th and on examination
both had fever and swollen, tender inguinal lymph nodes ("buboes"). A
blood culture on the male patient tested positive at the NYC DOHMH's Public
Health Laboratory this evening for Yersinia pestis by both polymerase chain
reaction and direct fluorescent antibody testing. Further confirmatory
tests will be performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Laboratory tests on the female patient are still pending, but her
clinical presentation is consistent with bubonic plague. Both patients are
being treated with aminoglycosides and doxycycline. The 53-year-old male,
who is also diabetic, is in critical condition with a secondary septicemia
and multi-system failure; the 47-year-old female is stable.
All epidemiologic evidence suggests that these infections were naturally
acquired in New Mexico. Although the exact source of exposure for these
patients is not yet known, most human plague cases are due to bites from
plague-infected fleas around the home. The usual incubation period for
plague is between 2 to 7 days. As these patients became ill within 48
hours of their arrival in New York City, their exposure occurred in New
Mexico. Since Y. pestis was isolated recently from fleas on their property,
this is the location where they probably were infected. The New Mexico
Department of Health and the CDC are currently conducting an environmental
investigation in the area around these patients' home to assess potential
sources of exposure.
As neither patient had symptoms or radiographic evidence of pneumonia,
antibiotic prophylaxis has not been recommended for any hospital or social
contacts. Laboratory staff handling specimens from these patients have
been instructed to follow Biosafety Level 2 precautions.
Naturally occurring plague is a disease primarily affecting rodents, and
transmission between rodents is via infected fleas. In the United States,
bubonic plague is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected
fleas; bubonic plague is not transmitted person to person. Pneumonic
plague is transmitted after plague bacilli are inhaled following direct
contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets (cats
and dogs) or via droplet transmission from a patient with pneumonic plague.
Bubonic plague symptoms in humans include fever; painful swollen lymph
nodes in the groin, armpit or neck areas; chills; and headache, vomiting,
and diarrhea. Patients may develop secondary septicemic plague or pneumonic
plague; pneumonic plague can be spread person-to-person. With prompt
diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment and supportive care, most
patients with bubonic plague survive.
Human plague has been reported most often from the four western states of
Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. Wild rodents, especially
ground squirrels and prairie dogs, are the natural reservoir for the plague
bacterium. Since January 1980, there have been 272 cases of plague
reported in the United States; the overwhelming majority of cases were
bubonic plague. Of these, 143 (53%) were acquired in New Mexico. Plague
is not enzootic in the eastern United States; there has not been a case of
plague in New York City in at least 100 years.

An Individual who travelled to New York City from Sante Fe, New Mexico is
preliminarily positive for plague
This Form Of Plague Is Not Spread From Person-To-Person
------------------------------------------------
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has
presumptively diagnosed bubonic plague in a 53-year-old male resident of
Santa Fe, New Mexico who was visiting New York City. In addition, the
patient's 47-year-old wife has similar symptoms and laboratory test results
are pending. He is currently hospitalized in critical condition; she is in
stable condition. The couple arrived in New York City from New Mexico on
November 1, 2002 and went to the hospital after two days of flu-like
symptoms, high fevers and swollen lymph nodes. The usual incubation period
for plague is between two to seven days. As these patients became ill
within 48 hours of their arrival in New York City, their exposure occurred
in New Mexico. These individuals live in a plague-endemic area and all
epidemiologic evidence indicates that the source of their infection is
rodents and rodent fleas in the vicinity of their home in which plague was
confirmed earlier this summer. Bubonic plague is not spread from
person-to-person. An investigation of the patients' home is being conducted
by the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) and the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Bubonic plague is a bacterial disease of rodents transmitted to humans
through the bites of infected fleas. Pneumonic plague, a more serious form
of the disease occurs when plague bacteria are inhaled after direct contact
with infected animals including rodents, wildlife and pets. Most people
become ill two to seven days after being infected with the plague bacteria.
Plague symptoms in humans include fever; painful swollen lymph nodes in the
groin, armpit or neck areas; chills; and sometimes headache, vomiting, and
diarrhea. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the
fatality rate in people can be greatly reduced.
CDC reports that there are 10-15 cases of plague per year, mostly rural
areas in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, California, Oregon and Nevada. The
illness occurs in areas where infection of wild animals is common,
including parts of the American Southwest. Wild rodents, especially ground
squirrels and prairie dogs, are the natural reservoir for the plague
bacterium. Rats, other wild rodents, cats and dogs can become infected with
plague, and the disease is occasionally transmitted to people by these
animals or their infected fleas. Most patients with plague can be
successfully treated with antibiotics, particularly if treated in the early
stages of the disease. If detected in its early stages, plague is treatable
with antibiotics. Plague is treatable by a 10-day course of antibiotics.
However, approximately 10% of patients who become ill from plague die.
The hospital reported the case to the DOHMH on Tuesday, November 5. Within
hours of this report, specimens were sent to DOHMH's Public Health
Laboratories and presumptive positive results were received this evening.
This case underscores the critical link between hospitals and physicians
with the DOHMH to control and prevent diseases in New York City. The DOHMH
is working closely with CDC, NMDOH and the New York State Department of
Health in this investigation.

[In our earlier report we noted the lack of mention of bubos with concern
for a possible plague pneumonia picture. Thanks to the excellent summary
of the clinical syndrome and epidemiologic information provided by the New
York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, it is clear these are
cases of classical bubonic plague. -
We were reminded by "Jeff Danska" <jdanska@salud.unm.edu> in the Department
of Medicine UNM School of Medicine, that there have not been any reports of
human plague cases in New Mexico this year prior to these cases. - Mod.MPP]
