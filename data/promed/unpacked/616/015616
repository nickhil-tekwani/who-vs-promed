During a routine slaughter of [4] mature dairy cows from Kibbutz Maoz Hayim, in an abbatoir, pathological changes suspected to be indicative of tuberculosis were discovered. The suspected material was forwarded to the Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan, where presumptive confirmation was obtained; samples submited to the Ministry of Health's TB Laboratory (National laboratory) in Abu Kabir were found there to be _Mycobacteriun tuberculosis complex_ positive. Further investigation to define/type the specific pathogen has been undertaken; its completion will take some time.

The farm of origin has been put under quarantine. Last week, all animals on the said dairy farm older than 6 months were tested by the delayed hypersensitivity test (Tuberculine); the results were read yesterday [Sun 17 Mar 2019], when 36 adult cows and 10 calves [older than 6 months] were found positive. All [46 cattle] were due to be culled today [18 Mar 2019].

If you visited Maoz Hayim and had access to the cows, contact a physician immediately.

Following last night's [16 Mar 2019] warning about a tuberculosis outbreak in Beit She'an valley, people who visited Maoz Hayim and had access to the cows are requested by the Health Ministry to contact a physician immediately.

Do not use public transportation; call the physician and ask what to do.

According to the Health Ministry, the chance of getting infected from milk is minimal, but people who had physical access to the animals need to contact a physician.

[Not a single event of tuberculosis in cattle has been reported from Israel since September 1999, when a sporadic outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, involving 2 grazing beef cattle herds on the Golan heights, was declared as resolved. This satisfactory situation has now been compromised for the 2nd time since the start of 2019. On 8 Feb 2019, Israel notified an outbreak of tuberculosis in a cattle fattening unit in northern Israel, composed of 254 calves imported from Portugal. The causative pathogen was identified as _Mycobacterium caprae_ (see 20190209.6307221). Notably, the current case, yet to be fully typed, is Israel's 1st on a dairy operation since 1973.

Since 1 Mar 2015, periodic tuberculin testing in cattle was discontinued. Prior to this decision, the tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. The said announcement included, among others, the following articles 3-5:

"3. Monitoring and surveillance of TB disease is to be moved from the field to the handling by slaughterhouses. The Department of Animal Products Control will publish a monitoring procedure in the coming month.

4. The laboratory of bacteriology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute will examine the introduction of modern bTB testing methods.

5. The State Veterinary Services will perform risk analysis at least once every 2 years to examine the bTB epidemiological picture and ways of controlling the disease. They will update the Ministry of Health in case any changes are implemented."

On 31 Dec 2017, the Israeli Government published its decision "To impose on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development the establishment of an inter-ministerial team to examine the possibility of selling some of the research and laboratory services of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, and, accordingly, to recommend the outline of the sale."

According to the 2015 decision, the 1st risk analysis of the bTB situation should have taken place, at the latest, by March 2017. In case performed, its summary and conclusions will be useful.

The apparent challenges to animal and public health, as reflected in the TB and other recent zoonotic events (e.g. leptospirosis, brucellosis, rabies), and hazard of further deterioration if privatisation proceeds, deserve to be taken into consideration by the decision makers. - Mod.AS
