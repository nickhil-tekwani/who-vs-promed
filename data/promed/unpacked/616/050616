[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there have been 5 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported cases. No new deaths were reported. Also, 3 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, with no new cases reported in Macau. A total of 1761 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 10 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours: 2 locally acquired, 8 imported. There were 2 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The last report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was a single case on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions are, what is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 38 cases and 1 new death compared with 35 cases in the previous day (31 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 58 consecutive days. Today's (1 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 36 cases were locally transmitted, and 2 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeonggi (15), Seoul (13), and Incheon (8). Imported cases were 1 each in Quarantine and Seoul. Note that 14 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases (compared with 12 provinces and Quarantine on 31 May 2020).

From the English language page, notice 348 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):
With respect to the 35 cases reported yesterday (31 May 2020), 5 imported and 30 locally acquired.
Clusters include:
- Coupang logistics center cluster in Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi Province, in total, 112 cases (74 workers and 38 contacts).
- A pastors group in Gunpo and Anyang area in Gyeonggi Province, 9 cases have been confirmed to date. It is presumed that transmission occurred through a gathering Jeju Island during 25-27 May 2020, where 25 members from 12 churches participated.
- Newly planted local churches in Incheon City and Gyeonggi Province region, 23 cases were newly confirmed. The cluster is related to 13 small churches in the region (11 in Incheon, 2 in Gyeonggi). It is presumed that transmission occurred between participants through events such as prayer meetings and praise meetings which the churches took turns hosting.
- In light of the recent ongoing spread of COVID-19 through bible studies, weekday meetings, and other religious gatherings, KCDC urged faith communities to refrain from gathering and switch to non-face-to-face meetings.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 233 197 cases, including 33 475 deaths, up by 178 cases and 60 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (31 May 2020) 24-hour change was 355 cases and 75 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4842_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined today (1 Jun 2020) account for only 51.7% of reported newly confirmed cases (a decrease from 84.8%) in the past 24 hours. For the 1st time, another province reported more newly confirmed cases than Lombardy -- Liguria reported 56 cases, Lombardy reported 50 new cases. For the 1st time since we have been following Italy, there were no provinces reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), another 3 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 2 provinces (Lombardy and Liguria) reported more than 50 but fewer than 100 cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Liguria (56), followed by Lombardy (50), Piedmont (21), Emilia-Romagna (19), and Lazio (10).

Italy is now 29 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 13 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

Iran's confirmed novel coronavirus [COVID-19] cases rose to 154 445 on Monday [1 Jun 2020] after an overnight registration of 2979 new infections, according to official IRNA news agency. During his daily briefing, Kianush Jahanpur, head of Public Relations and Information Center of the health ministry, said, "Out of the new cases in the past 24 hours, 652 were hospitalized."

The pandemic has so far claimed the lives of 7878 Iranians, up by 81 in the past 24 hours. So far, 121 004 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals and 2578 remain in critical condition. According to Jahanpur, 955 865 lab tests for COVID-19 have been carried out in Iran as of Monday [1 Jun 2020].

Iran's health officials have urged the public to wear facemasks in crowded places, particularly while using public transports. All employees have returned to work since Saturday [30 May 2020] and high-risk places such as gyms and beauty salons have opened for business.

[As of 1 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 154 445, including 7878 deaths, an increase of 2979 cases and 81 deaths since 31 May 2020, an increase in daily newly confirmed cases from 2516 newly confirmed cases and 63 deaths in the preceding 24 hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April, and now the slowly increasing daily fatalities, it may well be a second wave due to too early lifting of restrictions.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 859 323 including 106 925 deaths, an increase from 1 837 170 and 106 195 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York State represents 20.5% of the cumulative case reports and 4.2% of the newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, showing a decrease in the proportion of cumulative cases and a decrease in daily newly confirmed cases. New York City had a cumulative total of 200 547 as of 13:00 PM EDT on 31 May 2020 (an increase of 283 newly confirmed cases since 31 May 2020), including 16 882 confirmed deaths (an increase of 34 deaths since 31 May 2020) and an additional 4725 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

COVID-19 update 123 [data as of 1 Jun 2020 12:00 CET]
-------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.MPP]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 239 638 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 127 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2) [286 718 - Worldometer accessed at 1 Jun 2020 18:06 EDT (GMT-4)].

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. While Table 1 shows 71 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, the change in numbers of total cases is 209 new cases in the past 24 hours. A total of 27 127 deaths were reported, unchanged from 31 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 13.87, again showing a continual slow decrease over the past 30 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases, Madrid has 68 852 cases followed by Catalonia at 59 019, Castile and Leon at 18 907, Castile-La Mancha at 17 259, and Basque Country at 13 511. In terms of population-based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14-day period, Catalonia is 1st with 34.23 followed by Ceuta at 33.03, Castile and Leon at 25.84, Madrid with 24.16, and Castile-La Mancha at 21.99.

According to Table 2, of the 239 638 cases, an additional 245 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 9 cases were admitted to ICUs over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICUs.
