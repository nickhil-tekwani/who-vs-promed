A case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been reported in the village of Krasnoye, in the Tambov region of Amur, which has been experiencing severe floods.

The outbreak has affected 182 head of cattle on the Korfovsky cooperative and 98 head of cattle, 60 sheep and goats, and 215 pigs on private farms.

The veterinary authority Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] said that the flooding in the region has made it difficult to deal with the outbreak.

There has also been an outbreak of FMD in the village of Ust-Ivanovka in the Blagobeshensky region [Amur], which has also been hit by the floods.

[The outbreak in Korfovsky has been reported by Russia to the OIE in follow-up report no 8, submitted 19 Aug 2013. It referred to an outbreak caused by FMDV serotype A in Krasnoe, Tambovsky District, Amur Oblast and included the following (selected) data:
1. Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 56 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Swine / 125 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0
[In contrast with the media report, sheep and goats are not mentioned].
2. Epidemiological information: the outbreak is in the buffer zone. The outbreak is near the state border of Russia and China.
3. Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak.

For the full text of the follow-up report above, with a map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13942.

According to Russia's reports to the OIE on the current epizootic caused by FMDV serotype A, which started on 3 Jun 2013, there have been, so far, 9 outbreaks. In fact, the epizootic is composed of 2 distinct epizootics, separated by thousands of kilometers and caused by 2 genetically different genotypes. One started on 3 Jun 2013 in southwest Russia, northeast to the Black Sea, bordering northern Georgia. It is caused by FMDV 'A IRAN-05 LINEAGE'. So far, 6 outbreaks have been recorded, in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, Krasnodar, and Kabardino-Balkar.

The other epizootic started on 24 Jun 2013 in Amur (Siberia), on the border with China, caused by the FMDV A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97, which is the same strain as the one reportedly circulating in China since the end of 2012. So far, 3 outbreaks have been recorded in Russia's Amur, the most recent one being the subject of this posting.

For an OIE summary of all 9 outbreaks combined see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013942_20130819_152712.pdf. The map included will demonstrate the distance between the 2 epizootics.

According to a current media update, the situation created by the recent outbreaks in Krasnodar Krai, the Republics of Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria is complicated by the fact that this is a new strain of FMD, "which is not sensitive to current vaccines". More information on this Russian vaccination issue will be helpful. Genotyping results of recent (March 2013) Iran 05 isolates are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLFMD-2013-00002%20A%20Iran%202012-2013.pdf. The file includes tables addressing "most closely related reference viruses" (potential vaccine strains).

The media report further states that Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Rosselkhoznadzor, has revealed plans to ban the export of cattle from the south of the country both abroad and to other parts of the country. "In September [2013], Rosselkhoznadzor will ban the export of live cattle from the North Caucasus and Southern federal districts to prevent the further spread of FMD," said Rosselkhoznadzor spokesperson Alexei Alekseyenko (see at http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/Foot-and-mouth-outbreaks-in-southern-Russia). - Mod.AS
