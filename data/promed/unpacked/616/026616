The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) has confirmed 2 cases of Potomac horse fever (PHF), one in Essex County and one in Norfolk County.

The Norfolk County horse, whose age, gender, breed, and vaccination status were not reported, presented on 16 Jul 2019 with clinical signs including being "off feed" and uncomfortable -- signs generally associated with mild colic -- followed by fever and diarrhea. Veterinarians diagnosed the horse with PHF the following day. The horse is reported to be recovering. Massachusetts' single 2018 confirmed case and a suspect case occurred at the same stable.

The 2nd horse, located at an Essex County boarding stable, presented to a referral hospital with signs of colitis (inflammation of the large or small colon). The horse subsequently developed fever and diarrhea but is responding to treatment.

_Neorickettsia risticii_, an organism found in some wormlike parasites that infect aquatic snails and insects (such as caddisflies and mayflies), causes PHF. Horses are exposed by inadvertently ingesting aquatic insects infected with flukes carrying the bacteria and by drinking flukes directly from rivers or streams.

The MDAR encouraged owners -- especially those with horses grazing near rivers, streams, and creeks -- to watch horses closely for clinical signs of:

**Mild to severe fever;
**Diarrhea;
**Dehydration;
**Loss of appetite;
**Laminitis; and
**Colic.

Potomac horse fever's incubation period is one to 3 weeks, and its mortality rate is 5 to 30 percent; many horses with PHF respond to treatment. Vaccines against PHF are not always effective but could lessen disease severity. For that reason, horse owners should consult their veterinarians concerning vaccination protocols.

Equine owners are encouraged to keep horses off flooded pastures to reduce exposure potential. While horses most commonly contract PHF when they ingest infected insects from water bodies, even those residing far from water could be at risk. Barn and stall lights can attract vectors, which could end up in horses' feed or water sources. As such, owners should keep barn and stall lights off at night.

"Please continue to monitor your horses' health," said MDAR Division of Animal Health director Michael Cahill in a statement. "Temperature monitoring continues to be our best early warning system."

The department encouraged owners to contact their veterinarian as soon as possible if horses exhibit clinical signs, even if the horse is vaccinated. Potomac horse fever is a reportable disease in Massachusetts.

["Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent is _Neorickettsia risticii_. The infection of enterocytes of the small and large intestine results in acute colitis, which is one of the principal clinical signs of PHF. The disease is usually seen in spring, summer, and early fall and is associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers. The epidemiology of PHF has been shown to involve a trematode vector. Sporadic disease caused by _N risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to infection.

_N risticii_ is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium with a trophism for monocytes. Initial morphologic studies of this organism isolated from cell culture, as well as the serologic responses of _N risticii_, caused this bacterium to be assigned to the genus _Ehrlichia_. However, DNA analyses have shown _N risticii_ is most closely related to _N helminthoeca_, the agent of salmon poisoning in dogs, and _Ehrlichia sennetsu_, a disease of people in Japan. The organism is not visible in monocytes in blood films from clinical cases, in contrast to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, which is readily identifiable in granulocytes of infected horses.

_N risticii_ has been identified in freshwater snails and isolated from trematodes released from the snails. _N risticii_ DNA was detected in 13 species of immature and adult caddisflies (Trichoptera), mayflies (Ephemeroptera), damselflies (Odonata, Zygoptera), dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera). Transmission studies using _N risticii_-infected caddisflies have reproduced the clinical disease. One route of exposure is believed to be inadvertent ingestion of hatched aquatic insects that carry _N risticii_ in the metacercarial stage of a trematode. The incubation period is around 10-18 days. The causative organism is present in the feces of experimentally infected horses, but the biologic significance of this is unknown. Clinically ill horses are not contagious and can be housed with susceptible horses. Additional studies are needed to determine the exact role of the vector and helminth hosts in the complex maintenance cycle of _N risticii_.

Potomac horse fever presents with clinical signs of mild depression, anorexia and fever, decreased intestinal sounds. These are followed by diarrhea which may be mild to moderate, or very watery. Horses at this point may have colic or abdominal discomfort. Some horses have dehydration and sepsis. These clinical signs are frequently indistinguishable from the clinical signs of _Salmonella_. Other clinical signs may include laminitis. Abortion may occur in pregnant mares.

Treatment with the antibiotic oxytetracycline should result in signs of improvement and a reduction of fever in approximately 12 hours. Antimicrobial therapy, fluids and non-steroidals should continue for a minimum of 5 days but may be longer.

There is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease. Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same strain of _N risticii_ are commercially available. Although vaccination has been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field. Vaccine failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity among the over 14 different strains of _N risticii_ isolated from naturally occurring cases. Furthermore, vaccine failure may also be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure, because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be oral ingestion of the agent. Minimizing insect ingestion in stabled horses by turning off barn lights at night, which normally attract the insects, has been suggested."

This disease is definitely hard on the animal and any caring owner but it is not necessarily a death sentence to the animal as some other diseases are. As with any illness, early detection of your animal being off his/her best and early treatment are important.

There are several other names by which Potomac horse fever has been called. Those names include equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, ditch fever, Shasta River crud, and equine ehrlichial colitis. You will note that some of these synonyms are descriptive of the water as well as the condition.

Despite the name, this disease is fairly widespread, and if the disease is in your area, consult your veterinarian regarding vaccination of your animal. - Mod.TG
