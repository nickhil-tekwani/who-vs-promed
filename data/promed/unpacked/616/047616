Toddy sector reeling under crisis
---------------------------------
Toddy [fermented palm wine] tappers in Alappuzha district [Kerala state]
are left literally "jobless" due to various diseases affecting coconut
trees. These diseases have weakened the health and vitality of coconut
trees. Many holidaymakers hit the area to taste the toddy.

Toddy tapping is a major source of income for many. Out of the 3000-odd
toddy tappers working in the district, over 760 work in the Kuttanad
region. However, diseases like 'lethal yellowing', which has affected the
trees, have prompted many to leave.

Toddy from Kuttanad was transported [previously] to other districts, now
not even the district's requirement can be met. Tapping was a blessing to
the ailing coconut farmers who were reeling under dipping coconut prices
and the disease "mandari" [eriophyid mite] which badly hurt the coconut market.

[2] Quick wilt - black pepper: replanting

Replanting to boost pepper productivity
---------------------------------------
A programme for replanting of pepper covering 23 000 hectares [about 56 800
acres] in the northern district of Wayanad in Kerala and the north-eastern
region of the country covering Assam, Tripura, and Meghalaya should help
the plantation sector raise productivity, according to Anand Sharma, Union
minister for commerce and industry.

The pepper replanting programme comes after a similar one for the district
of Idukki in central Kerala was announced early this year [2009]. The
Spices Board, the government trade promotion agency, will overlook the new
programme.

Root wilt disease and bee wasp attacks on the poles on which pepper vines
grow have literally destroyed 70 per cent of the crop in Wayanad which till
2 decades ago accounted for an annual production of 40 000 tonnes and has
now gone down to 8000 tonnes.

[A range of diseases of coconut palms have been reported in India, and
several of these may be contributing to the yield decline reported above.
In particular, a phytoplasma disease called "Kerala wilt" (or root wilt,
referred to above as "lethal yellowing") is spreading in parts of Kerala
and Tamil Nadu. The KW phytoplasma was thought to belong to a separate
taxonomic group, but has recently been placed as a species within the
lethal yellowing (LY) group. It is spread by insect vectors, but there is
no evidence of seed transmission. It has been suggested that weeds as
pathogen reservoirs may also play a role in KW epidemiology.

KW is not lethal, unlike other LY diseases, but it significantly reduces
production. Symptoms may include drooping leaflets, yellowing and marginal
necrosis of older leaves, necrosis of inflorescences, and root rot. Fungal
leaf rot is often found as a secondary infection. Disease management relies
on eradication of diseased palms, improving the general conditions of
coconut groves, and replanting with resistant or tolerant varieties.
Resistance breeding programmes based on disease escapees from heavily KW
affected areas are in progress.

Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_ and was reported to cause
problems in Wayanad earlier in 2009. It is likely to be the disease
referred to above as "root wilt", although slow wilt (also called slow
decline, yellows) caused by nematodes is also present in Kerala. Quick wilt
is considered the most serious threat to this crop in India and a yield
decline of 75 per cent has been reported in some instances. It affects
leaves and vines, but once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies
within a month. The fungus is spread by splashing rain and mechanical
means. It has a very wide host range and therefore a large pathogen
reservoir making it difficult to control. Disease management includes
fungicides, biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars, and
cultural practices. The large scale replanting mentioned above would
suggest that suitable resistant varieties are available, since these
programmes will not eliminate the pathogen from the area.
