[25 Nov 2011], the number of dengue patients has reached 1071. "Though
the temperature has dipped, afternoons are still warm, which provide
suitable conditions for mosquito breeding. I am still getting a few
dengue cases daily," said a senior doctor from the department of
medicine at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital." This year [2011], 5
persons, including a one-and-a-half-year-old boy, have succumbed to
the disease.

- India (Tamil Nadu state). 22 Nov 2011. The state is seeing a spurt
in the number of dengue cases this year [2011] with the health
department recording as many as 1845 cases across TN till date. 8
persons have died so far due to the disease. "We had only 2060
confirmed cases and 8 dengue-related deaths reported for the entire
year of 2010 and considering that there is one more month to go for
this year to end, the numbers are expected to increase," said a senior
health official. The union health ministry has said that more than 10
000 dengue cases have been detected in the country so far. This ranks
Tamil Nadu as the 3rd state with the highest number of dengue cases
for the year after Punjab and Orissa.

- Pakistan (Lahore city and Punjab province). 21 Nov 2011. No death
was caused by dengue fever in any hospital of the City on Sunday [20
Nov 2011]. The downward trend of new patients of dengue fever also
continues in Lahore as a total of 50 patients have been tested
positive in different hospitals in the City on Sunday [20 Nov 2011],
which brought the total number of patients to 33 182 in Lahore alone
[for 2011]. Meanwhile, the Health Department has confirmed one death
in Punjab due to dengue fever during the last 24 hours, which brought
total figure of deaths to 335 in Punjab and 289 in Lahore. According
to Health Department's report released on Sunday [20 Nov 2011] , the
total number of dengue patients reported in Punjab from January 2011
to-date has reached 21 275 out of which over 17 454 were diagnosed in
Lahore alone. A total of 30 patients, confirmed of dengue fever, have

[The reason for the significant discrepancy in the numbers of dengue
cases and deaths between apparently unofficial figures in the popular
press and those of the Ministry of Health are not clear. In any event,
there has been a significant dengue outbreak in Lahore city and Punjab
province over the past 4 months.

- Philippines (Valenzuela City, Metro Manila). 23 Nov 2011. The number

officer, told the Inquirer that the city had a total of 1440 partial

on Arno Atoll near Majuro, but no new cases have been seen on other

- Marshall, Yap, and Guam Islands. 23 Nov 2011. An investigation by
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has now shown
that the epidemics of dengue fever currently ongoing in our region are
caused by 2 different virus strains, DENV-2 in Yap State and DENV-4 in
the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The Director of the Guam
Department of Public Health and Social Services is particularly
concerned by the newly confirmed occurrence of DENV-2 in Yap because
this virus strain has not circulated widely in our region of the
Pacific in recent years and thus a large proportion of the population
will be susceptible. In addition, the rainy season on Guam has
resulted in an increase in the mosquito populations that spread
dengue. Fortunately, to date there is still no evidence that dengue is
being spread locally on Guam.
