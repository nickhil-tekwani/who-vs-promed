It could be 3 more weeks before residents of a southern Colorado town
can drink water straight from the tap, after dozens of cases of
salmonella infection were linked to municipal water, putting 7 people
in the hospital. An analysis indicates the municipal water system in
Alamosa is the source of the bacterial outbreak as suspected, said
Ned Calonge, chief medical officer for the state health department.

Governor Bill Ritter declared an emergency Friday [21 Mar 2008] in
Alamosa County, activating the National Guard and providing as much
as USD 300 000 for response efforts. The city and county have also
declared emergencies as officials scrambled to provide safe water and
disinfect the system with chlorine.

The earliest the city water system could be flushed is Tuesday [25
Mar 2008], and disinfecting it and making sure it is safe could take
many days, said James Martin, executive director of the state health
department. Water agencies from Denver, Aurora and Fort Collins were helping.

As of Friday [21 Mar 2008], 138 cases of salmonella linked to the
outbreak had been reported in people from infancy to age 89, of which
47 were confirmed by lab testing, Calonge said. The conditions of
those hospitalized weren't released. Alamosa, with about 8500
residents, gets its water from a deep well system. The water is pure
from the aquifer and is not chlorinated.

Investigators are exploring how the system was contaminated.
Possibilities include a compromise in a storage tank or
cross-contamination with a sewage line, Calonge said.

About 45 businesses are providing enough bottled water to supply
residents for several days, in some cases for free, said Hans Kallam,
director of the state Division of Emergency Management. Bulk water is
also available from East Alamosa, which is not connected to the city system.

Boiling tap water will kill bacteria, but health officials warned
that no one should use even boiled tap water once the flushing of the
water system begins. People were warned not to give pets tap water either.

San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center bought in bottled water, and
equipment was being sanitized with alcohol, said Chief Operating
Officer Henry Garvin.

"It's becoming much more costly to deliver care, but for patient
care, it's not going to be an issue," Garvin said, who did not have
an estimate on the extra costs. The city had been working to switch
to a chlorinated system, but the outbreak is speeding up the
timetable, Calonge said.

Only 15 salmonella outbreaks from public water systems were reported
from 1971 to 2004, the CDC said.

More cases of suspected salmonella have been reported in the southern
Colorado city of Alamosa. Jefferson County official Jim Shires says
the number reached 216 on Sunday [23 Mar 2008]. He says 9 people have
required hospital treatment.

Health officials believe the outbreak may be caused by Alamosa's
municipal water system. Residents have been told to stop drinking and
cooking with tap water. The state activated the Colorado National
Guard on Friday [21 Mar 2008] to help distribute safe water.

[This outbreak has grown substantially. It has not been stated in the
posting whether one or multiple serotypes of _S. enterica_ have been
found and/or whether other gastrointestinal illnesses other than
salmonellosis have been found. If there was a contamination of the
city's municipal water supply with sewage, it would be expected that
a variety of bacterial, viral and even protozoan infections would be
diagnosed. If a single organism is found, a contamination other than
sewage per se ought to be found, whether accidental or not.
