Around a million dollars of equipment and vaccines are urgently
required to help stem outbreaks of deadly foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
in North Korea, followed by a more prolonged and concerted effort to
modernize veterinary services in the country.

A joint FAO and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) mission
travelled to North Korea at the government's request between 27 Feb
and 8 Mar 2011. The mission found that the country's capacity and that
of Veterinary Services' to detect and contain FMD outbreaks, need
significant strengthening -- in particular implementing best-practices
in biosecurity measures and improving laboratory infrastructure and
capacity.

Outbreaks of Type-O FMD have been reported in diverse locations in 8
of North Korea's 13 provinces. To bring the situation under control,
the team recommended the following steps:

- Thorough surveillance to locate and map disease clusters
- Protecting unaffected farms through movement controls and
biosecurity measures
- Adequate sampling in order to correctly identify the virus strain
or strains involved
- Improving biosecurity measures to prevent further spread of the
disease
- The strategic use of the appropriate vaccines to contain and
isolate disease clusters

FAO estimates around 1 million USD is required immediately for
training, supplies and infrastructure, vaccine acquisition and the
setting up of monitoring, reporting and response systems.

The FAO-OIE mission visited several collective farms as well as the
national veterinary laboratory and various animal health field
stations.

Virus identification
--------------------
FAO and OIE provided guidance to North Korean veterinary authorities
on taking and handling of FMD samples -- new samples will be collected
by North Korea and sent to an international reference laboratory for
testing.

Only by accurately typing the virus or viruses involved in the
outbreaks will it be possible to identify the most effective vaccine
to use against it [see comment].

Food security bulwark
---------------------
FMD does not pose a direct health threat to humans, but affected
animals become too weak to be used to plough the soil or reap
harvests, suffer significant weight loss, and produce less milk. Many
animals are dying from the disease.

Farm animals are crucial to food security in North Korea. Cows and
oxen are primarily used for dairy production and are a key source of
draft power in agricultural production. Goats and pigs, also
susceptible to FMD, are important source of dairy products and meat.

Current North Korea's livestock population consists of 577 000 head
of cattle, 2.2 million pigs and 3.5 million goats.

FMD affects cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, swine and other
cloven-hoofed animals. It is highly contagious and spreads through
mucus, saliva or body fluids that can contaminate materials such as
clothing, crates, truck beds, and hay and be transmitted to other
animals.

[According to North Korea's last official report to the OIE,
submitted 21 Feb 2011, the FMD outbreak there is characterised by high
morbidity rates in the affected species (in percentage: 39.8 in
cattle, 91.2 in goats, 67.5 in swine) and high mortality and case
fatality rates in the latter (respectively, 51.5 and 76.2).

As indicated in North Korea's most recent available annual report
(2007), FMD is notifiable in cattle, goats, sheep, and swine, and
routine vaccination is one of the control measures applied. The
apparent inefficiency of the vaccination in preventing the current
major epizootic may be explained by a deficient quality/efficacy of
the vaccine and/or inadequacy of the selected vaccine strain. This
underlines the urgent need to accurately identify the field strain(s)
in an international reference laboratory, including its serotyping and
genotyping, as strongly recommended by the FAO/OIE expert team.

The 2007 FMD outbreak in North Korea was caused by FMDV serotye Asia
1; this was found retroactively by the WRLFMD at Pirbright. The most
plausible candidate for the current outbreak is FMDV serotype O,
similar to the strain which has been identified in South Korea, Japan,
Hong Kong and Mongolia. Hopefully, suitable samples are to be
submitted to the ref lab the soonest. The vaccine eventually applied
in South Korea seems to have rendered the vaccinated livestock
satisfactory protection.

The handling of the DPR Korea (North Korea) FMD epizootic by FAO and
OIE may serve as a timely test-case for the ability of the
international community to attend to such events in a satisfactory
manner during the shortly expected post-rinderpest era. - Mod.AS
