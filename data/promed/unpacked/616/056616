[Between September 2020 and April 2021, 10 outbreaks of FMD-SAT 2 were reported in cattle in the regions of Kavango, Oshikoto, Ohangwena, and Oshana. The event was declared resolved on 24 Apr 2021. See the last follow-up report No. 5 and updated map of this event at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=34280.

Namibia contains 3 FMD zones:
- FMD Infected zone
- FMD Free zone
- FMD Containment zone

"The Zambezi region is called the FMD Infected zone due to periodic occurrence of FMD in this region. The Zambezi region forms part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), and the presence of African buffalo, which is the carrier of FMD, makes control of this disease in this region very difficult."
