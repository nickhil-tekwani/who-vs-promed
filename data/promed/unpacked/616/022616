Death of 5000 cattle due to blackleg, in a relatively small area over a
relatively short period of time, seems very unusual, especially if the
diagnosis is really based upon "...some black spots on the legs..."
Cattle should be vaccinated routinely against _Clostridium chauvoei_
infection, but it sounds as if the financial needs run to good diagnostics
as well as vaccines.

[Indeed 5000 is a very large number. But major outbreaks of blackleg,
particularly affecting young, unvaccinated cattle of beef breeds and on
infected premises/pasture (disturbance of soil has been often
incriminated), can occur. Though laboratory confirmation concerning (any)
disease situation is always recommended, in cases of blackleg clinical
observations followed by an on-farm necropsy, performed by an experienced
practitioner, will often be enough to establish a diagnosis. Such a
diagnosis might be based upon the environmental situation, the population
involved, its vaccination history, the occurrence of rapidly fatal febrile
disease, the crepitant swellings of the heavy muscles, and especially the
typical necropsy findings and smell. Could colleagues in Zimbabwe add some
light? - Mod.AS]
