HANTAVIRUS INFECTION, SUSPECTED - PANAMA: ALERT

A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org/>
ProMED-mail received two messages. The first was received indirectly and
we did not post it because so little information was included and because
even a possible diagnosis was unclear. In addition, we do not know who
sent it. Now we have received a second message, this one via the BBC
on-line news service. Both messages are posted, with some editing by the
Moderator. - Mod.CHC]

I just got back from the Ministry of Health (now in the Gorgas Hospital
complex), where they said that they still don't know the cause of the
disease with pneumonia-like symptoms that has made nine people sick in or
near Las Tablas. Three of these people have died, one is in critical
condition and the others have fully recovered.
The Ministry of Health has called in experts from the US and Cuba to help
diagnose the problem, and because they don't know the cause, in Los Santos
they're waging war on rats, testing all water sources and spraying
insecticide, and pleading with people to clean up their homes and
surroundings.
We get to a tricky balance here---irresponsible rumors could ruin Carnival
in Las Tablas, which would mean hunger and privation for some residents of
that community and a big loss of foreign exchange income from tourists. On
the other hand, it could be prudent to party elsewhere this year if they
can't figure out the problem in the next week or so.

Panamanian authorities have suspended the country's best known carnival
celebrations amid fears of a health epidemic after a hantavirus spread by
rats killed three people.

Every year thousands of Panamanians flock to the rural town of Las Tablas,
400 kilometres west of Panama City, to take part in the four-day carnival
festivities.
But the authorities have declared a public health emergency in the region
after the three deaths.
Officials say the movement of people to the festival would increase the
risk of an epidemic, forcing them to order the suspension of this year's
celebrations.

[We still do not know the method of diagnosis or the etiologic agent of
this disease. If it is caused by a hantavirus we still do not know which
hantavirus. People define "rat" differently in many parts of the world, so
we do not know that the vector is a rat. Bottom line: we do not know very
much about this experience. If anyone at CDC or in Cuba who might have
access to data would send us a summary of those data, we would appreciate
it. Could be leptospirosis, plague, or a number of other diseases, hence
"suspected" in the header of this posting. - Mod.CHC]
