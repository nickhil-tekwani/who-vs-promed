Rare birds fall prey to botulism
--------------------------------
Dangerously high numbers of one of the world's rarest and most spectacular
birds have died from disease in the last month. An outbreak of avian
botulism has killed 71 black-faced spoonbills in Taiwan since 9 Dec 2002.
This is more than 7 percent of the world population of 969 birds, according
to BirdLife International. The outbreak follows a spell of unusually warm
winter weather, and ornithologists think similar incidents could become common.
Avian botulism is caused by a water-soluble toxin produced by the bacterium
_Clostridium botulinum_ (in this case, type C). It is a potent neurotoxin.
Black-faced spoonbills breed on small islands off the west coast of the
Korean peninsula and China. Their main wintering wetland sites are in
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, China, Japan, Macao, and South Korea. A census
conducted in January 2002 concluded the 969 birds found were the entire
global population.
The first dead birds were reported by the Wild Bird Federation of Taiwan
(WBFT) on 9 Dec 2002, and analysis showed avian botulism was the cause.
They were found in Taiwan's Tseng-wen estuary, the most important wintering
site in the world for the birds, with more than 70 percent of the global
population.
WBFT, the Taiwan partner of Birdlife, and its local branch, the Wild Bird
Society of Tainan, set up an emergency rescue team to try to save some of
the infected birds. The last dead birds were reported on 4 Jan 2003, and 17
others have recovered so far.
The Taiwanese authorities and WBFT are working to minimise any recurrence
of the disease at Tseng-wen by changing the way organic pollution is
controlled. They are also stockpiling type C botulism antiserum, which was
used to help 5 sick spoonbills back to health.
Professor Chien-chung Cheng, the president of WBFT, said the loss of more
than 7 percent of the world's black-faced spoonbills was "a significant
blow to this already endangered species". BirdLife says: "The
higher-than-usual winter temperatures that appear to have triggered the
outbreak seem to be consistent with anticipated climate change patterns.
BirdLife fears more incidents of this nature may be expected to occur in
future."
The entire outbreak included 3 distinct waves of the disease, each
following a sudden temperature drop. Scientists think the earlier warm
temperatures caused fishponds around the estuary to become eutrophic, a
process in which the population of algae would have increased rapidly.
The colder weather could have caused a mass algal die-off, with the
decomposing algae depleting oxygen levels in the water. This would have
killed fish and shrimps, providing ideal conditions for the bacteria to
multiply rapidly.
The birds' endangered status means ornithologists think they face a very
high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future. Until 2001 they
were classified by IUCN, the World Conservation Union, as "critically
endangered", facing an "extremely high" extinction risk.
Their prospects, ironically, had actually improved with the establishment
of a protected area in the Tseng-wen estuary in November 2002.
