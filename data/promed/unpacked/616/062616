We imported 2 groups of Holstein heifers to our farm in Ukraine from
Germany. Shortly afterwards, we experienced an outbreak of disease amongs
our herd which has resulted in 45 calf deaths and 12 cows. IBR (Infectious
Bovine Rhinotracheitis) virus was isolated by our epidemiological laboratory.
Did any deaths occur as a result of the outbreak in Algeria?
