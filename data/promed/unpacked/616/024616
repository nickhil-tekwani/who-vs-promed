The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday [19 Oct 2007] it
was investigating a suspected outbreak of yellow fever in Sudan,
which has killed nearly 30 people.
The viral disease, which causes jaundice in some patients, is
transmitted by mosquitoes but can be confused with malaria, typhoid,
viral haemorrhagic fevers, and hepatitis.
"We have 31 suspect cases including 28 deaths. Samples are being
tested, we should know early next week whether it is yellow fever or
not," said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl. The outbreak was near the
Nile about 3 hours from Khartoum and the samples were being sent to a
laboratory in Cairo for analysis, he said.
Yellow fever symptoms include fever, muscle pain, nausea, and
vomiting, but most patients improve after 3-4 days, according to the
United Nations health agency.
Some 15 percent of patients enter a "toxic phase" within 24 hours,
with bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach as kidney
function deteriorates. Half die within 2 weeks. There is no specific
treatment -- except for oral rehydration salts and paracetamol -- for
the disease, which has caused large epidemics in Africa and the
Americas.
Intensive care may save the most seriously ill patients, but it is
rarely available in the poorest countries. Vaccination is important
for rapid control of outbreaks, according to the WHO.

[Unfortunately, this report does not indicate the exact location
where the suspected yellow fever (YF) cases occurred. If it is in
South Kordofan, it might be in the same or nearby area where the
previous YF virus outbreak took place in 2005. ProMED-mail requests
additional information confirming (or not) this outbreak as YF, and
if so, about the mosquito vectors involved and emergency control
measures being taken to halt virus transmission.
Concerning likely vectors, in ProMED-mail archive no. 20051223.3665
Dr. Alan Kemp wrote about YF virus vectors in Sudan, "_Aedes
(Stegomyia) aegypti_ played a minor role in the 1940 outbreak while
_Aedes (Fredwardsius) vittatus_ and _Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer/
taylori_ (may have included _Ae. (Dic.) cordellieri_, which was
described long afterwards) were believed to be responsible for most
of the transmissions.
