The [Kerala] State government has sanctioned a contingency programme to control the outbreak of bud rot disease in Malabar region. The fund will be used to control infestation in 434 347 coconut palms in Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasaragod districts.

Bud rot disease has been a major threat to livelihood in the coconut farming sector, especially in the northern districts, and had claimed over 14 000 hectares [about 34 600 acres] of yielding coconut groves in the past few years.

Triggered by the fungus _Phytophthora palmivora_, the disease has been found to be severe in the highland region with its core in Kuttiyadi, [which] is known for superior quality West Coast Tall [variety] (WCT) palms.

Excess rainfall in north Kerala, absentee farmers, increase in soil acidity, and reluctance to cut down affected trees have contributed to the spread of the bud rot disease. Acute shortage and high cost of labour to effectively implement curative measures [have also aggravated the problem].

[Bud rot (also called heart rot) of coconut palm can be caused by several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_, including _P. palmivora_ mentioned above, as well as some species of fungi and bacteria. Different pathogens may be prevalent in different areas, with _P. palmivora_ the main pathogen in south east Asia. Usually, the pathogens also affect other palm species, including oilpalm, and are favoured by high rainfall. Trees of all ages can be affected and also become more susceptible to secondary insect or pathogen infestations and adverse environmental factors. Bud rot is one of the most serious diseases of palms.

Symptoms may include discolouration, wilting, collapse, and death of young leaves, as well as drooping and distorted older fronds, defoliation, stem end rot of nuts, premature nut drop, nut discolouration, and rotting of the growth bud ("heart" of the palm) leading to the death of the tree. Disease incidence is usually more severe in high humidity.

The pathogens enter the host via the crown. They are spread by wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities), and with infected plant or other material. Disease management may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely affected palms, and treatments with appropriate agrochemicals (for example copper compounds) at or before onset of symptoms. Different palm varieties or hybrids may show different levels of susceptibility to bud rot.

_P. palmivora_ is known to affect more than 150 tropical hosts. It also causes, for example, black pod of cocoa. In Kerala, it is suspected to be associated also with a severe disease of nutmeg (see ProMED-mail post 20130822.1896447). New strains that spread faster and are more difficult to control are emerging.

West Coast Tall (WCT) is an important coconut variety grown extensively in India and also used worldwide in breeding and coconut improvement programmes due to its hardiness and relative drought tolerance. Crosses with different Dwarf varieties have given rise to a number of economically important hybrids.
