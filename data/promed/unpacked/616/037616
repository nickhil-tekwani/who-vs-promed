TOXOPLASMA: Lethal disease linked to cat feces turns up in a Resurrection
Bay otter
----------------------------------------------
A sea otter found injured in Resurrection Bay last month tested positive
for a lethal parasite that has infected or killed hundreds of California
sea otters in an outbreak blamed on domestic cats. This appears to be
Alaska's first confirmed case of an otter sick with _Toxoplasma gondii_, a
protozoon that matures only inside cats and spreads through their feces.
The otter is under care at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward.
The parasite generally doesn't threaten healthy adult people and doesn't
appear to spread otter to otter, say scientists and health officials
involved in the case. But pregnant women are urged to avoid cleaning cat
litter boxes because exposure to the parasite could harm a developing
fetus. "A large percentage of cats either have it or have been exposed to
it," said veterinarian Carrie Goertz, rehabilitation manager at the SeaLife
Center. "Up to about 50 per cent of people, if you test them, will have
antibodies to the disease."
How an otter caught the bug in the ocean near Seward isn't known, but
scientists and local people have some guesses. While birds and rodents can
temporarily carry the parasite, only cats shed its immature eggs in feces.
The disease in California has been linked to places with rivers and storm
drains, where cat poop gets washed into runoff and inserts the parasite
into the food chain. The same thing could have happened in Seward,
especially if someone disposed of cat litter improperly on the beach, said
WC Casey, Seward public works director. The parasite can then concentrate
inside clams and other bivalves, favorite food for otters. Once inside an
otter, the parasite can lead to a deadly infection in the brain, Goertz said.
"We hope it's a localized case, but the fact that toxoplasmosis has
appeared here in Alaska is just one more hit for Alaskan sea otters,"
Goertz said. Biologists don't think the disease is likely to appear along
remote coasts without a ready source of domestic cat droppings, said sea
otter biologist Angela Doroff with the US Fish and Wildlife Service: "It's
more like a point-source contaminant. It's not necessarily that we're
concerned about sea otters Alaska-wide."
Sea otters along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain have crashed in
number over the past few years and may soon be listed as threatened under
the federal Endangered Species Act. But Gulf of Alaska otters appear
stable, Doroff said. Probably fewer than 100 sea otters forage in
Resurrection Bay near Seward.
State health officials don't plan to issue special warnings for shellfish
in Resurrection Bay, but testing might be a good idea, said Kristin Ryan,
director of the state Division of Environmental Health. "It would be very
difficult to determine at this point if there is any level of concern,
because we don't know how the otter got the toxoplasmosis," she added. "We
need to do some further investigation to see what's going on."
The otter, an adult male nicknamed Uno for the popular card game, was found
on Jan 29 on the shore near Seward's skate park with a broken rib, plus
puncture wounds and broken bones in its right front paw. What hurt the
otter isn't known, Goertz said. But the animal was recovering from the
injuries at the SeaLife Center when rehab staff noticed it would "zone out"
into a stupor while floating in its tank, a symptom of neurological
problems that could be caused by the parasite.
Multiple tests by experts at the University of California Davis confirmed
the presence of antibodies to toxoplasma, she said. The animal could
recover after treatment with antimicrobial drugs, but the danger of a
relapse might prevent its return to the sea. A sick otter would quickly die
in the wild. "We can clinically get him better, but there's always the
chance he could still have it," Goertz said.

Researchers are keeping an especially close eye on a sea otter in Seward.
The otter, which was found in Resurrection Bay, has come down with a
disease linked to big problems in California.
His nickname is Uno, which means "one" in Spanish. And for Alaska, this is
a 1st as well. Uno is the 1st Alaska sea otter to test positive for the
disease toxoplasmosis.
In California and Washington, the disease has played a role in the deaths
of hundreds of sea otters, with some studies linking it to cat litter. It
could be that some people are flushing cat feces down the toilet, affecting
the ecosystem, including the clams that otters eat. "It's possible, but it
hasn't been definitively figured out," says Carrie Goertz, a veterinarian
for the Alaska SeaLife Center.
Uno came in with a bone injury, but it was a blood test that led to the
diagnosis. In addition to the injury, Uno was acting oddly, bumping into
things and unaware of his surroundings. So far, he's responding to
treatment, lying on his back in his own swimming pool, eagerly munching the
goodies floating in a plastic tray beside him. "He's looking good," says
Goertz. "His clinical signs have diminished. He has fewer episodes of being
zoned out and they're much shorter and more mild."
Still, the issue raises questions. Does Seward have a pollution problem?
Will the parasite affect other sea otters? Biologists in Alaska have only
been studying diseases like this one for the past 2 years. So, for now,
they are not alarmed, and they point out that the disease already exists in
some other marine mammals in Alaska.
"I think this is just an isolated case," says Verena Gill of the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service. "It's localized. This is a parasite that
is transmitted through cat feces, so that could be a very localized problem
in the Seward area. I don't think it's anything we have to worry about on a
widespread scale in Alaska."
Experts say Uno's chances of recovery are 50-50. But, if he recovers, they
hope to release him back into Resurrection Bay and follow his path. If they
know where he's eating, that may help solve the mystery of how Uno got
sick. But for now he'll stay at the Alaska SeaLife Center, where officials
will hope for the best.
Officials say if Uno is released back into the bay, he would not pose a
threat to humans or any other sea otters. His treatment will continue for
several weeks.
