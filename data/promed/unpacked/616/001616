A La Plata County resident is suspected of having died from the plague, San Juan Basin Public Health [SJBPH] reported Thursday [8 Jul 2021]. If confirmed, it would be the 1st plague death in Colorado since 2015. SJBPH was notified about the potential case on Wed 7 Jul 2021. While initial test results indicated a potential case of the plague, the diagnosis could not be confirmed until additional testing is completed by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE]. Test results will likely be available as soon as Monday [12 Jul 2021], said Tiffany Switzer, SJBPH deputy director of operations. Only one other case of the plague, identified in El Paso County, has been reported in 2021.

In a letter emailed on Thursday [8 Jul 2021] to 4-H Weaselskin Club members, leaders of the club said a 4-H member, age 10, died on Monday [5 Jul 2021] from the plague. "Medical and health professionals are trying to track down where she contracted the disease," the email reads. "At this time, that is still unknown."

Jann Smith, La Plata County coroner, confirmed the child had a suspected case of the plague but said the Coroner's Office has not determined the official cause of death.

The plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals.

The bubonic plague killed millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Human plague infections continue to occur in rural areas in the USA West. Modern antimicrobials are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death, according to the CDPHE.

Plague frequently is detected in rock squirrels, prairie dogs, wood rats and other species of ground squirrels and chipmunks, according to an SJBPH news release. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases increases during summer months when humans and animals are in closer contact, although the risk is present year-round. Symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, extreme weakness, painful lymph nodes, abdominal pain, bleeding into the skin and blackened skin or tissue, according to CDPHE.

SJBPH recommends controlling the presence of wildlife and fleas around homes as well as wearing repellent and appropriate clothing when heading outdoors. Wild animals should not be fed or handled, especially those that appear sick. Nor should dead animals or animal waste be handled. Pets should be kept up to date on vaccinations and protected from fleas.

"Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas so keeping pets on flea protections will decrease risk to both pets and people," the news release said.

It is important that children are also aware of these precautions and know to tell an adult if they have had contact with a wild animal, SJBPH said.

SJBPH investigates prairie dog population die-offs for the presence of plague. If an active colony of prairie dogs suddenly disappears, people should report the incident to SJBPH.

Colorado has perhaps its 1st human plague death in 6 years, according to public health authorities in Durango. San Juan Basin Public Health said in a press release that it was notified of the potential case on 7 Jul 2021, and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is conducting additional testing to confirm the diagnosis. CDPHE is leading the investigation.

Most plague cases in the USA occur in the west, and within Colorado, most cases are found in the southern part of the state, according to the CDC. Plague outbreaks tend to hit rural, agricultural areas. Residents of La Plata County make up almost half (9 of 22) of Colorado's plague cases between 2005-2020, according to CDPHE.

County / Cases of plague
-------------------------------
Adams / 4
Archuleta / 1
Boulder / 1
Denver / 3
Grand / 1
La Plata / 9
Larimer / 1
Mesa / 1
Pueblo / 1
-----------------
Total / 22

In 2004, a Pueblo man died of the plague after hunting near Breckenridge. One of the deadliest years nationally for plague came in 2015, when 4 people died, including 2 Coloradans: an adult in Pueblo County and a teenager in Larimer County.

The plague is caused by a bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, and is usually transmitted to humans through an infected animal or a rodent flea bite, according to the CDC. While it killed millions of people in the middle ages, today it is treatable with antibacterials.

"About 85% of human cases are due to bites from infected fleas, which often appear in a linear pattern on the skin," reads a public health update from Tri-County Public Health written in 2005. "Cats can also serve as a source of infection to humans exposed to them (via biting, scratching, or coughing). In 2004, 22 cats in Colorado tested positive for plague."

[The epidemiological and clinical aspects of this suspected fatal case are not given. ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the post.

Plague was first introduced into the USA in 1900 (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html), by rat-infested steamships that had sailed from affected areas, mostly from Asia. Epidemics occurred in port cities. The last urban plague epidemic in the USA occurred in Los Angeles from 1924 through 1925. Plague then spread from urban rats to rural rodent species, and became entrenched in many areas of the western USA.

The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, cats, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or in cases where the bubo does not occur, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. Suspicion of septicemic plague without a bubo must occur in areas where the infection is endemic to minimize fatalities. About 14% (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the USA are fatal (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf).

In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year in the United States (range: 1-17 cases per year) (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of the "Four Corners" states -- Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah -- although California and, to a lesser extent, Oregon also may have cases. - Mod.LL
