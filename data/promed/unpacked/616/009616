Influenza update - 10 Sep 2010
------------------------------
Introduction
------------
The Global Influenza Programme is regularly monitoring influenza activity
worldwide and publishing an update every 2 weeks.

The updates are based on all available epidemiological and virological
data: influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and member states, data
collected through FluNet and FluID. Data can vary in completeness and
timeliness due to differences in available resources in member states as
well as influenza seasonality.

Displayed data reflect the most recent information reported to FluNet, WHO
regional offices or on ministry of health websites in the last 2 weeks.

The percent of specimens tested positive for influenza includes all
specimens tested positive for all influenza subtypes. The pie charts show
the distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were tested
positive for influenza.

The available country data were joined in larger geographical areas
(influenza transmission zones) with similar influenza transmission patterns
in order to present an overview

Influenza - update 116
----------------------
As of 10 Sep 2010, influenza activity is currently most intense in the
temperate areas of the southern hemisphere and southern Asia.

India is still experiencing a country-wide outbreak of H1N1 (2009) with
active transmission and a substantial number of fatal cases in several
states across the country.

Chile reported on a sharp increase in respiratory disease activity in the
last 2 weeks. All age groups are affected, but the age groups below 65
years appear to be more affected than the older population. The level of
activity in Chile in September 2010 is very unusual for this time of the
year, as the country usually experiences a peak of respiratory disease in
June and July. H1N1 (2009) virus has been the most commonly detected
influenza virus so far this season, but in the recent weeks, there has been
a shift towards influenza virus type B and influenza A (H3N2), with a
decreasing proportion of H1N1 (2009) viruses. Respiratory syncitial virus
transmission has also been widespread and intense, primarily affecting
young children.

Australia has reported increasing influenza activity throughout August and
September 2010, though recently the numbers of patients seen in emergency
departments for influenza-like illness seem to have levelled off in parts
of the country. Overall, influenza activity is well below the activity
observed in the winter of 2009. The most commonly identified influenza
virus in Australia is H1N1 (2009), though influenza type B is also being
detected.

In New Zealand, influenza activity has decreased in the last week of August
2010, although activity is still well above baseline levels and with
significant regional differences. The majority of influenza detections have
been characterized as H1N1 (2009). Levels of influenza transmission in 2010
are below 2009 levels nationally but have exceeded 2009 in some localized
areas of the country.

In Africa, the Central African Republic reported on their 1st ever
detection of H1N1 (2009). South Africa observed a decrease in detection
rate of influenza viruses in outpatients seen for respiratory disease for
the 2nd week in a row. Influenza type B has been the most commonly detected
influenza virus throughout this winter season [2010] in South Africa,
though in recent weeks, the proportion of H1N1 (2009) viruses has
increased, and a small, decreasing number of influenza A (H3N2) continues
to be detected.

Qualitative indicators
The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health care
services.

The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported.
Information is available for about 60 countries each week. Implementation
of this monitoring system is ongoing, and completeness of reporting is
expected to increase over time

[The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 10 Sep 2010 that in the
wake of its August 2010 move to a post-pandemic period, it will no longer
post weekly flu situation reports on its disease outbreak website. The WHO
is still monitoring global flu activity and will post updates every other
week on the Global Alert and Response (GAR) section of its website.

In the 1st of these bi-weekly updates, the WHO indicates that the most
active areas of flu transmission are in the temperate regions of the
southern hemisphere and southern Asia. - Mod.CP]
