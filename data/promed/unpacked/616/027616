Kuwaiti agriculture officials have notified OIE of additional cases of
contagious caprine pleuropneumonia. The susceptible community of goats is
less than half the number reported in February. However, the disease has
been detected in new locations - Kebd, Salmi, Jahra, and Mina Abdella - in
a survey conducted to determine the spread. The February outbreaks were in
Abdalli, Khiran, Fintas and Bubiya.
Control has largely focused on treating sick animals, while explorations
continue for location a reliable vaccine source.
