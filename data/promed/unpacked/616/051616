African swine fever was detected in 16 wild boars in Latvia last week [week of 26 Sep 2022], according to the information released by the Food and Veterinary Service. African swine fever was also detected last week in 4 wild boars in Gulbene [municipality]: 2 wild boars in Litene parish, 1 in Dauksti parish, and 1 in Stradi parish.

In the wild boar population, African swine fever was detected in a total of 872 wild boars in 29 counties in 192 parishes in Latvia this year [2022].

African swine fever in Latvia was registered for the 1st time in June 2014, in 3 wild boars, a few meters from the border with Belarus. It is a very dangerous disease, and the entire herd must be slaughtered in a house where the disease is found. In 2022, African swine fever also affected 6 farms with a total of 1512 domestic pigs.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries.- Mod.PMB
