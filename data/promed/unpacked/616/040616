According to the authorities, nearly 5000 cases have been reported since 1 Sep 2016. The peak of the epidemic was reached in March 2017. The number of clinical cases or suspects has been declining since.

[2] India (Kerala): 'magical remedies', alert

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-issues-warning-against-magical-remedies-for-dengue/articleshow/59374075.cms


The directorate of health service has issued a warning against the promotion of drugs which are manufactured unscientifically or unethically claiming to be a remedy for dengue fever. It never spreads through human being but it is spread by the mosquitos, she said. She appealed to the people that no miraculous or magical remedy is available for the dengue fever and hence the people should not become prey at the hands of quacks. It has also to be remembered that people should not have own treatment if they are having dengue or fever.

With the fever cases increasing day-by-day the health department has opened 393 fever clinics across the state. Apart from this 22 mobile fever clinics have also been set up to provide treatment for the people who are unable to reach up to the hospitals in the remotest areas. An additional posting of 80 doctors, 60 staff nurse, 22 pharmacists, and 16 lab technicians have been created to meet the demand. All the hospitals have been asked to conduct medical camps in their neighbouring areas. Meanwhile on [Thu 29 Jun 2017], 27 684 cases of fever were reported from the state, taking the total fever cases reported this year [2017] to [1.428 million]. Today 175 dengue cases were also reported. 2 dengue deaths one each from Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram were also reported on [Thu 29 Jun 2017].

[3] India (Delhi): co-infections
Date: Sun 9 Jul 2017 4:47 AM IST

As the capital [Delhi] witnesses a rise in cases of mosquito-borne infections, hospitals in the city have reported cases of co-infection -- where the patient tests positive for 2 infections at the same time. According to the latest data released by the MCD [Municipal Corporation of Delhi], 71 cases of malaria, 55 cases of dengue, and 108 cases of chikungunya have been reported up to [1 Jul 2017].

Doctors have confirmed that there are cases wherein a patient has tested positive for both malaria and dengue, as well malaria and chikungunya. At least 7 patients have tested positive for a co-infection at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a senior hospital official confirmed. The latest case reported at the Delhi hospital is of a 30-year-old man, who came with the most common symptoms of chikungunya -- fever and joint pain. "When he was examined, the patient tested positive for chikungunya. Since there is no treatment for chikungunya, we treated the symptoms and advised the patient to drink fluids to avoid dehydration," Dr Atul Gogia, Consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Gangaram Hospital, said. However, doctors said the symptoms of fever and chills did not abate. "We tested the patient for malaria and it came back positive," the doctor said.

In another case, a 22-year-man who was referred to Sir Gangaram Hospital had a reduced platelet count -- a symptom of dengue. "The patient had high grade fever and low platelet count. When examined, he tested positive for dengue. But the fever continued. We later tested for malaria and it was positive," Dr Gogia said.

The doctor said patients with co-infections have to be correctly diagnosed to ensure no further complications arise. "In dengue and chikungunya, one can only treat the symptoms. There is no specific treatment. However, when the patient has dengue and malaria, it should be ensured that malaria is diagnosed first. Since symptoms of malaria mimic those of dengue, it remains undiagnosed in most cases. Hence, diagnosis of malaria is most important as the infection is treatable unlike dengue and chikungunya," Dr Gogia said.

Last year, AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Science] had confirmed the presence of co-infections with chikungunya -- 9.4 per cent of patients had both dengue and chikungunya, while 3 per cent had malaria and chikungunya. Chikungunya and dengue are mosquito-borne viral infections with symptoms such as fever, rashes, and joint pain. The causative organism, chikungunya virus, is transmitted to humans by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Malaria, however, is a mosquito-borne infection caused by parasitic protozoans and is commonly transmitted by an infected female _Anopheles_ mosquito.

[Both 'malaria' and 'dengue' are known to be rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases and of high importance in terms of both mortality and morbidity, posing a worldwide public health problem due to ease in globalised travel. Malaria is a protozoan parasitic infection caused by _Plasmodium_ spp. which is usually transmitted by _Anopheles_ spp. The major _Plasmodium_ spp. infecting humans are _P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P. ovale_, and _P. malariae_ [1].

Early differentiation between dengue and malaria could help clinicians to identify patients who should be closely monitored for signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever or severe malaria. Whereas dengue is a viral infection. The pathogen is dengue virus. The main mosquito vector is _Aedes_. Both diseases can cause acute febrile illness. However, malaria can be chronic while dengue cannot. The specific triads of dengue, atypical lymphocytosis, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia might be a clue for differential diagnosis of dengue infection from other tropical infections including to malaria [2]. Diagnostics for malaria should be employed first or concurrently in these settings, so that antimalarial therapy can be provided as soon as possible.

There have been cases of dengue and malaria coinfections with leptospirosis, hepatitis, typhoid, and chikungunya infections, even up to the presence of 4 acute infections at the same time. In such cases, laboratory investigations are important to arrive at a definite diagnosis, but in settings of mixed infections, the interpretation may be challenging [3].
