Four soldiers have died of yellow fever in the third outbreak of the
disease during the last few months in camps of the Ecuadorian army .
Yesterday, 27 soldiers entered the Military Hospital of Quito presumably
infected with yellow fever. The soldiers came from the Amazonian garrisons
of Lorocachi and Montalvo in province of Pastaza. The four dead soldiers
all came from the same garrisons. According to the Minister of Health, all
shared indications of yellow fever as transmitted by insect bite.
No further information was present in the paper, and I don't recall having
read of the previous reports in El Comercio during the past few months.
