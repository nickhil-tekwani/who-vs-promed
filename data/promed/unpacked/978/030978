At least 47 villagers in Timor in East Nusa Tenggara [Nusa Tenggara
Timur] were hospitalized after consuming meat from a cow carcass
believed to be tainted with anthrax. The residents of Tetaf village in
West Amanuban district complained of diarrhea, vomiting and high fever.

Head of veterinary health at the provincial animal husbandry agency
Benyamin Bili confirmed Thursday [9 Apr 2009] the incident in which
dozens of villagers had to be treated after consuming meat from the
dead cow. "There are no fatalities in the incident," he said. "Such
food poisoning cases after consuming beef often occur in the area."

He added 19 people were being treated at the Niki-niki community
health center, while the other residents were receiving outpatient
treatment.

Another food poisoning case occurred at Takari district in Kupang
regency, where 28 residents had to be treated after consuming pork.
"The residents ate the pork at a mourning house," said provincial
health agency head Stefanus Bria Seran.

[As yet, there is no laboratory confirmation that this Timor Tengah
Selatan incident is in fact anthrax. East Nusa Tenggara is regularly
afflicted with anthrax, but the country is coy about providing
details. In 2007, there were, over a period of 11 months (January to
November 2007), 5 reported bovine cases and 16 in sheep and goats,
but there were 788 associated human cases with a minimum of 8 deaths;
this was reported in ProMED, not to OIE. In 2008, OIE WAHID had just
2 outbreaks for the whole of Indonesia, a caprine case in January
2008 and a "wildlife" case in June 2008, both in East Nusa Tenggara.

Confirmation as to the cause of these recent incidents -- both bovine and
porcine -- would be much appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
