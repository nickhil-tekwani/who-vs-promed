The 1st public report of falsified parenteral artesunate has been published, within a paper describing quality testing of artemisinin-based medicines in Myanmar.

The sample is stated as collected in Bago, Myanmar, labelled as 'Artesun' 50 mg artesunate for injection and labelled as made by Guilin Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, with batch number LA131111.

High performance liquid chromatography did not detect any artesunate within the sample and chemistry also suggested that the accompanying vial of '5 per cent sodium bicarbonate' did not contain bicarbonate.

As the authors state, "Clinical trials in severe malaria, both adults and children, suggest that in comparison with quinine, parenteral artesunate reduces mortality by 34.7 per cent and 22.5 per cent, respectively, and is recommended as 1st-line therapy by WHO for severe malaria. With increasing use of this life-saving drug globally, the discovery of one sample of falsified parental artesunate has grave implications and strongly suggests that enhanced global monitoring of the quality of these products are urgently required."

This posting is to alert the wider public health and malaria control communities of this finding out of concern that there are likely to be more falsified artesunate for injection elsewhere.

[ProMED-mail thanks Paul Newton for alerting us to this report.

There is little doubt that falsified drugs play a major role in the development and spread of artemisinin resistance in South East Asia, in particular Cambodia and Thailand. This is the 1st time that we have come across falsified artesunate for intravenous use.

The finding underlines the importance of quality control of batches of essential drugs before delivery to hospitals, and inexpensive and rapid HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) methods are available (Debrah P et al. Artemether-lumefantrine concentrations in tablets and powders from Ghana measured by a new high-performance liquid chromatography method. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2016; 95(1): 158-63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27139437).

We have previously argued that antimalarials should be delivered free in South East Asia to curb the trade in substandard or falsified drugs, just as HIV medicine is delivered free in many countries. - Mod.EP
