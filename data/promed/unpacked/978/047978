Following its decision to voluntarily withdraw its BVD [bovine viral
diarrhea] vaccine Pregsure BVD from the German market due to a
possible link to bovine neonatal pancytopaenia (BNP) -- the condition
previously known as bleeding calf syndrome -- Pfizer Animal Health has
now ceased supplying the product in all European states.

In a statement, Pfizer said the temporary action was taken as a
prudent step while the company and other stakeholders continue a
comprehensive investigation of the possible causes of BNP and any
possible link to the use of Pregsure BVD.

Speaking on behalf of the company, Edward Fergusson said Pfizer was
funding an epidemiological survey aimed at identifying the common risk
factors between the reported cases of BNP. "Pfizer is actively
conducting a robust investigation of BNP in conjunction with vet
research institutions."

Responding to the decision, SAC [Scottish Agricultural College; see
item 2] said it welcomed the decision as it would help SAC and other
investigators understand better the origins of the disease and help
monitor its epidemiology. SAC advises farmers not to stop using their
proven vaccination programmes and says Pfizer should be consulted for
advice concerning unused doses of Pregsure BVD.

SAC welcomes Pfizer's decision to voluntarily stop selling Pregsure
BVD in all EU Member States, including the UK.

It has been suggested that the use of Pregsure BVD may be associated
with BNP (bovine neonatal pancytopenia), commonly known as bleeding
calf syndrome. Pfizer's decision will help SAC and other investigators
understand better the origins of the disease and help monitor its
epidemiology.

We note that no direct causal link between the use of Pregsure BVD and
BNP has been proven. What causes this syndrome is unknown, but it is
believed many factors may be involved. SAC advises farmers not to stop
using their proven vaccination programmes. Pfizer should be consulted
for advice concerning unused doses of Pregsure BVD vaccine.

So far this year [2010], SAC has confirmed 72 calves with BNP or
bleeding calf syndrome. These calves came from 61 farms (6 dairy farms
and 55 beef suckler farms) with submissions received by all of
Scotland's 8 Disease Surveillance Centres. Four of the beef farms
involved had cases diagnosed in their calves in 2009.

SAC Consulting Veterinary Services was 1st presented with a suspected
case of BNP in April 2009. There had been reports of the condition
elsewhere in Europe during 2008. In 2009, SAC confirmed 48 cases of
BNP on 35 farms in Scotland. The condition is confirmed by postmortem
examination and the study of bone marrow cells.

Together with colleagues in the Veterinary Laboratories agency (VLA),
the Dick Vet [Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies]in Edinburgh,
the Moredun Research Institute and overseas, SAC is working to gain a
better understanding of BNP. Preparations are being made by the
partners for a case-control study based on knowledge gained through
the post mortems of suspect BNP cases previously offered free of
charge to farmers and their vets and which, for the moment, are
continuing.

Affected calves are aged less than 28 days. They can have a persistent
fever with bleeding from the nose, gums, ear-tag holes and injection
sites. There may even be intestinal bleeding, with calves passing
dark, tarry dung. Most calves were growing well before showing
clinical signs, with no history of prior problems. However, it should
be stressed that some calves can die without any noticeable signs of
bleeding.

SAC vets are grateful for the cooperation of farmers and their vets.
It is believed the increase in numbers during 2010 may be due in part
to raised awareness of the condition amongst producers. We continue to
urge any farmers who believe they have a case to contact their own
vets 1st.

[Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP, popularly named "bleeding calf
disease," also neonatal haemorrhagic diathesis) is a disease of
unclear aetiology affecting calves under 4 weeks of age, characterised
by thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and multiple unexplained haemorrhages.
Since early 2007, this condition has been reported in several European
countries, including Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland),
Belgium, France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Ireland.
Investigations concerning the syndrome are being carried out in
several of the said countries.

The French Buiatrics Association hosted, during its European Buiatrics
Forum held in Marseilles, France 1-3 Dec 2009, a Satellite Symposium
on the syndrome; see at 20091209.4195. Have the proceedings been
published? [Buiatrics = the study of cattle and their diseases].
