Case count update
-----------------
A total of 14 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O26 have been reported from 6 states. The 2 new cases have been reported from Michigan. Both new cases reported eating at Jimmy John's restaurants and consuming sprouts in the 7 days preceding illness.

Among the 14 persons for whom information is available, illnesses onset dates range from 25 Dec 2011 to 7 Feb 2012. Ill persons range in age from 9 years to 49 years old, with a median age of 25 years old. All of ill persons are female. Among the 14 ill persons, 2 (14 percent) were hospitalized. None have developed HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome], and no deaths have been reported. Illnesses that occurred after 4 Feb 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

The type of bacteria responsible for this outbreak are referred to as STEC [Shiga toxin-producing] or EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_]. EHEC bacteria are grouped by serogroups (such as, O157 or O26). The EHEC serogroup found most commonly in American patients is _E. coli_ O157. Other _E. coli_ serogroups in the EHEC group, including O26, are sometimes called "non-O157 EHECs." Some types of EHEC frequently cause severe disease, including bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Others, such as common strains of EHEC O26, typically cause milder illness. Currently, there are limited public health surveillance data on the occurrence of non-O157 EHECs, including EHEC O26; therefore, EHEC O26 infections may go undiagnosed or unreported. Because non-O157 EHEC infections are more difficult to identify than EHEC O157, many clinical laboratories do not test for them. The EHEC O26 PFGE [pulsed field gel electrophoresis] pattern in this outbreak has rarely been seen before in PulseNet.

Based on previous outbreaks associated with sprouts, investigation findings have demonstrated that sprout seeds might become contaminated in several ways. They could be grown with contaminated water or improperly composted manure fertilizer. They could be contaminated with feces from domestic or wild animals, or with runoff from animal production facilities, or by improperly cleaned growing or processing equipment. Seeds also might become contaminated during harvesting, distribution, or storage. Many clover seeds are produced for agricultural use, so they might not be processed, handled, and stored as human food would. Conditions suitable for sprouting the seed also permit bacteria that might be present on seeds to grow and multiply rapidly.

In 1999, the US FDA released guidance to help seed producers and sprout growers enhance the safety of their products. Specific measures recommended in the guidelines include a seed disinfection step and microbiologic tests of water that has been used to grow each lot of sprouts. The microbiologic tests currently recommended under this guidance would not identify the presence of EHEC O26.

Preliminary results indicate that this strain of _E. coli_ produces Shiga toxin type 1 and does not produce Shiga toxin type 2.

[This outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of verotoxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle and, although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6), the O26 serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in EHEC infections treated with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials should not be used for known acute cases.
