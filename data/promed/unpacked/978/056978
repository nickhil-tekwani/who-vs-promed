The Division of Public and Behavioral Health has declared an outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough) in Elko County as of 20 Oct 2014. According to its data, Elko County has seen a rise in pertussis cases over recent years. As of Mon 27 Oct 2014, Elko County has had 14 cases of pertussis reported since July 2014. Controlling the spread of pertussis requires quick identification of cases and contacts prompt treatment of these individuals, and immunization of susceptible persons.

Pertussis spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. A person can spread the disease while he or she has cold-like symptoms and for at least 2 weeks after coughing starts. Vaccination of persons who are not up-to-date for pertussis provides long-term protection. Getting your child the vaccine helps protect them against whooping cough. It also protects other people who cannot get the vaccine, especially newborn babies, who can get very ill and can die from this infection. The division asks that you make sure your family's vaccinations are up-to-date. Older children and adults, including pregnant women, should get a pertussis booster shot called to protect themselves and infants near or around them. If you need the vaccine, contact your doctor. Early treatment of pertussis is very important. If treatment for pertussis is started early in the course of illness, during the 1st one to 2 weeks before coughing attacks occur, symptoms may be lessened.

The CDC is monitoring a disease outbreak in Staunton, [Macoupin County] Illinois. Cases of whooping cough appear to be spreading quickly. At last report, there were 24 confirmed cases of the illness in public and private schools in Staunton. The disease got its name from the sound babies make when they have pertussis or whooping cough. Classrooms are getting a deep cleaning.

Health officials said some people in the community are on edge after a toddler recently died [in Staunton]. They want everyone to know the child's death had nothing to do with whooping cough. If a student tests positive the youngster is given antimicrobial treatment and is out of class for 5 days.

A 3rd elementary school student has been diagnosed with whooping cough in Princeton [Mercer County].

A letter was sent home to parents of students at Community Park School today [27 Oct 2014] notifying them that a student attending the school has a confirmed case of whooping cough. Another student at the same school tested positive for whooping cough in late September [2014]. A student from Riverside Elementary School [Princeton] also tested positive for whooping cough.

Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial disease of the nose, throat, and lungs that causes long bursts of coughing. It is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. Whooping cough can cause violent coughing fits as children choke and gasp for air while making a whooping sound. Adults and older children still get whooping cough, but they may not make the characteristic "whooping" noise when coughing and are often not diagnosed.

Babies need protection from whooping cough because this disease can make them very sick and is very contagious. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the bacteria that cause the disease. Many babies who get whooping cough are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease. When babies catch whooping cough, the symptoms can be very serious. Young babies could get pneumonia and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than 1 year of age who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.

Because the disease can make babies so sick, and they can catch it from anyone around them, they need protection. If you are pregnant, you'll need the whooping cough vaccine in your 3rd trimester. Surround your baby with vaccinated family members and caregivers and make sure your baby gets all his doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to the CDC's recommended schedule.

It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
