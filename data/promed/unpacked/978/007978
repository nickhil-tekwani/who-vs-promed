Two sheep flocks in central Alberta have been quarantined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) for scrapie, a fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of both sheep and goats and is related to mad cow disease. The 2 flocks were quarantined due to scrapie being found in one sheep.

The CFIA said in mid-June [2019] it confirmed a sheep had scrapie, and implemented disease-control measures at that farm. It found the diseased sheep had lived on multiple premises, which resulted in a flock at a 2nd farm being quarantined as well. All sheep having come in contact with that particular sheep will be given a genetic blood test, the CFIA said, and those not having a genetic trait making them resistant to the disease will be humanely killed.

There's no known link between scrapie and human health, according to Health Canada. CFIA said one of the options for humanely killing the animals is slaughtering them for meat. After the infected or susceptible animals are killed, the quarantined farms will need to be cleaned and disinfected.

"It's a progressive disease, usually takes a while before the animal will show signs," said University of Calgary veterinary medicine professor Michel Levy. "The signs are very different. Animals can become very nervous, they can scratch themselves a lot, and then eventually, you know, over time, they will die." The disease can take up to 8 years to develop. Once an animal appears ill, it will die within months. There's no treatment or vaccine.

Scrapie can be spread from a mother to her offspring, and infectious prions -- misfolded proteins, primarily in the brain, replicate by causing other proteins to become distorted -- have been found in milk, saliva, feces and urine of infected animals.

Levy said there's an effort to eradicate the disease in Canada. That could mean dozens of animals being killed if they came in contact with the infected sheep, to prevent the disease's spread. "It may be that sometimes the herd or the stock may be affected and quarantined and destroyed. So financially it's a big problem," he said.

Levy said the best way to prevent the disease is to ensure animals are tested or quarantined before being introduced to a flock. That's something that's top of the mind for goat producer Jeanette Hall, who moves her herd to different fields to cut grass for clients. She said she's tightened her own bio-security practices. "The only way to prevent catastrophe here is to adopt the best management strategies and be proactive and get ahead of it. Because once it's taken off there's nothing we can really do about it," Hall said. "It's crippling. It will destroy your company."

Hall said she'd like to see more reliable traceability programs implemented in the country, and urged municipalities to create their own policies. "The reason we want traceability is so we can track our food from farm gate to your plate," she said. "Animals are moving throughout our province all the time ... and if we aren't taking the appropriate steps in doing that safely we're going to put a lot of people at risk." Hall also said she's unhappy she hasn't received many details or updates on the situation from the CFIA -- a concern echoed by the Alberta Lamb Producers. "Some producers want to know. This has the potential to affect our livelihood. Those questions are there, and because we have no answers, it is incredibly frustrating for us as an organization and for producers," said director and chair [of Alberta Lamb Producers], Darlene Stein. "We have no idea who was affected. It would be nice to be able to reach out to them and offer support. Sometimes just having the support of an organization behind you as you go through the process, you feel supported," Stein said.

CBC News has reached out to CFIA for further comment, and for details on how many animals have been euthanized. Scrapie was 1st detected in Canada in 1938 and was made a reportable disease with a control program in place in 1945.

[Scrapie is the oldest known transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease. It was 1st described in sheep in the UK in 1732 and in Germany in 1750. Today the disease is widely distributed; it is endemic in many countries in Europe, as well as Canada, the USA, Brazil and Japan. There have also been outbreaks of scrapie in various other countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. As of 2012, only Australia and New Zealand are internationally recognized as free of classical scrapie (https://www.in.gov/boah/files/Scrapie_-_An_Overview_of_the_Disease_and_the_NSEP.pdf).

Scrapie is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects both sheep and goats, and a disease that is difficult to control given the nature of its incubation period, mode of transmission and duration of infection. An animal can become infected with scrapie at any point in its life, and there is no way to tell definitively where a positive animal became infected. More importantly, once an animal becomes infected, it can shed and share that disease with other animals without showing any clinical signs of the scrapie. Since 1984, 200 Canadian farms have been identified as a scrapie source or infected farms. Disease control actions on each of these farms have seen anywhere from one animal to 20% of the population destroyed because of scrapie (https://scrapiecanada.ca/strategic-planning-for-eradication/).

Transmission: Scrapie is spread through fluid and tissue from the placentas of infected females. It can be transmitted from an infected female to her offspring at birth, or to other animals exposed to the same birth environment. Males can contract scrapie, but they do not transmit the disease to other animals. A sheep's genes affect both its susceptibility to the disease and the length of the incubation period.

Diagnosis: Scrapie is diagnosed after death by microscopic examination of the brain tissue, tonsils, lymph nodes, or spleen that have been treated with a special stain. Biopsies of peripheral lymphoid tissue from live sheep can accurately identify certain animals that have scrapie. However, a negative lymphoid biopsy does not rule out that a particular animal has the disease.

Scrapie is slow to develop, usually takes more than 1.5 years for clinical signs to appear in an infected animal, although it has been known to take up to 8 years to develop. Typically, cases occur in animals between 2 and 5 years of age. Once an animal appears ill, however, it will die in 1 to 2 months.

Symptoms vary tremendously between cases of scrapie. One may observe an older animal with changes in general behaviour such as aggression or apprehension, tremors, incoordination or abnormal gaits. However scrapie can also present as a mature poor doing animal with a poor wool coat or even simply as a found dead.

A difference in the predominant presentation of the clinical disease has been documented between countries. Wasting and debility appear to be more prominent clinical features in North America. Pruritis remains the most prominent clinical feature in Europe.

Clinical signs of scrapie: One or more of the following clinical signs may be present in affected animals. It is important to note that not all sheep or goats show all the signs of scrapie. Sometimes these signs can be so subtle that they are missed or misdiagnosed until they have progressed.

- Weight loss, despite retention of appetite
- Behavioral changes
- Itching and rubbing
- Wool pulling
- Biting at limbs or side
- Bunny-hop movement of the rear limbs
- Swaying of hips and hind limbs
- Sensitivity to noise and movement
- Tremor
- Down, unable to stand

Dramatic wool loss can develop over a short period of time in animals who are scrapie positive. The wool loss can be accompanied by proprioceptive deficits and a classic lip-smacking response.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) program: Scrapie is a reportable disease under the federal Health of Animals Act, and a control program exists to prevent its spread. As scrapie is a reportable disease, any suspect scrapie case must be reported to a CFIA veterinarian immediately. Canadian veterinarians and livestock producers have been alerted to the symptoms and signs of scrapie. When an animal is identified with scrapie, all the animals that were exposed to the same birthing environment and are deemed at risk to developing the disease are ordered destroyed. Producers are compensated for the loss of their animals. The maximum amount of compensation paid for sheep ordered destroyed under the Health of Animals Act is CAD 825 (USD 632) for non-registered animals and CAD 1200 (USD 919) for registered animals. The maximum amount of compensation paid for goats ordered destroyed under the Health of Animals Act is CAD 600 (USD 460) for non-registered animals and CAD 1000 (USD 766) for registered animals. Sheep or goats that are known to be infected with scrapie are humanely destroyed, and their carcasses are burned or buried under CFIA supervision. Owners are further compensated for their disposal costs. (https://scrapiecanada.ca/about-scrapie/). - Mod.TG
