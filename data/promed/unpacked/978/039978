African swine fever virus (inf. with), Hong Kong
------------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 27 May 2022
Confirmed: 30 May 2022
Reported: 1 Jun 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: African swine fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: Tai Lam Wu, Sai Kung
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 May 2022
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Wild boar (_Sus scrofa_): Suidae-Artiodactyla / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population descriptions: ASFV was detected in samples taken from a wild pig carcass under the government's ASF surveillance programme.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The Hong Kong government has established a surveillance system for ASF. A debilitated wild pig was found in the area near Tai Lam Wu, Sai Kung, while following up on a wild pig sighting report from a member of the public recently. The wild pig subsequently died and samples were collected from the carcass for testing. Results were positive for ASF virus. The Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department will continue to monitor any wild pig deaths that warrant attention, and maintain surveillance in the wild pig population. There is one pig farm located within 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] of the affected location, the Department will arrange veterinary inspection to this farm and follow up if necessary. At the moment, no pig farms are found affected by this case. The Department has been closely monitoring the health condition of pigs on all local pig farms and samples will be collected for testing if necessary.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: movement control; screening; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; ante and post-mortem inspections.

Wild control measures applied: screening; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; movement control

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department National Laboratory / wild boar / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 May 2022 / positive
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department National Laboratory / wild boar / Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 30 May 2022 / positive

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses.

ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
