A 9-year old girl is suspected of [having contracted] bird flu [avian
influenza A(H5N1) virus infection]. The patient was admitted to the
bird flu/swine flu isolation unit of the Dr Soedarso Hospital at
11:30 pm on Mon 13 Sep 2010, according to Dr Tita Selati Sundari,
spokesperson for the Dr Soedarso hospital. The patient, who is a
resident of Jalan Padi, Pontianak city, had signs/symptoms of avian
A(H5N1) virus infection and had direct contact with birds. Chickens
reared in the patient's house were reported to have suddenly died
before she started to develop fever.

In the meantime, the Dr Soedarso Hospital has collected throat swab
samples from the patient to be sent to a Ministry of Health
laboratory in Jakarta. The patient is recovering, and her temperature
has fallen. The result of the diagnostic testing in Jakarta is
awaited, said Dr Tita.

This patient is the 2nd suspected bird flu case treated at the Dr
Soedarso Hospital within past 2 months.

Reports of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus
infection in the local Indonesian press are rarely confirmed by
laboratory diagnostic testing. As the patient described above has
recovered, it seems unlikely that a diagnosis of bird flu infection
will be confirmed. Further information is awaited.
