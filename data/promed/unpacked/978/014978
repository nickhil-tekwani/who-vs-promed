UPDATE ON THE ENTEROVIRUS 71 OUTBREAK
IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
The hand, foot and mouth disease (HFM) epidemic associated with
entervirus type 71 (EV71) in Perth, Western Australia (WA),
appears to be declining. General practitioners and child care
centres have reported far fewer cases of HFM in the past two
weeks. In addition, there have been no new cases of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) identified since the second week of June [1999
and no new cases of enteroviral meningitis identified since the
first week of July.
So far, enterovirus type 71 has been identified by neutralisation in
stool and throat isolates from 3 cases of AFP, 4 cases of
enteroviral meningitis and in skin isolates from 5 cases of HFM.
Further attempts at diagnosis will be made by serum neutralisation
tests using using virus isolates obtained during the outbreak.

The outbreak appears to have been largely confined to the Perth
metropolitan area and to the Mandurah district south of Perth. We
plan to type enterovirus isolates in stool specimens from children in
the surrounding towns of Geraldton, Bunbury, Albany and
Kalgoorlie and other regions of WA in an attempt to identify the
geographic extent of EV71 activity.
