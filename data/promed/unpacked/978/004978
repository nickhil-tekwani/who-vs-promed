Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials confirmed anthrax in 5 cattle on a Crockett County premises. This is the 1st anthrax case in Texas this year [2017].
The premises is located approximately 13 miles east of Ozona and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other cattle on the premise prior to release of the quarantine.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation," said Dr Susan Rollo, TAHC State Epidemiologist. "Producers are encouraged to remain vigilant and consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are affected with anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock."

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Anthrax cases in Texas are historically found in the triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass. This area includes portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney and Maverick counties. A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas.

Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and appear to decompose quickly. Livestock or animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official.

If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5254645,245. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif. Crockett is in western Texas, immediately north of Val Verde. It is rough country, and tree covered.

Normally anthrax outbreaks in Texas start in June so this year [2017] we are running a bit late. Until the spring of 2016, when it broke, there had been a 3 year drought in this area. That drought would have killed anthrax spores in a number of places and the pathogen is having relative problems recovering. Unfortunately an absence of outbreaks can encourage procrastination in vaccinating. And as this disease is enzootic in deer in this area, eradication is impossible until we can develop an effective and cheap oral vaccine for the white tail deer. As they are trained to come to feeding stations, to support their numbers, breeding, and shooting, delivery of an oral vaccine is not a problem. Back in 2007 we did proof of concept trial feeding Sterne vaccine to goats, and it was successful. See: Shakya, Krishna P., Martin Hugh-Jones, and Philip H. Elzer, 2007 Evaluation of immune response to orally administered Sterne strain 34F2 anthrax vaccine, Vaccine 20;25(29):5374-5347 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TD4-4NSWTYB-4&_user=3290496&_coverDate=07%2F20%2F2007&_rdoc=22&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235188%232007%23999749970%23661821%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=5188&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=30&_acct=C000060173&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=3290496&md5=c5d5a3ff2223eff66c636ce441963786. That was the easy part. - Mod.MHJ]
