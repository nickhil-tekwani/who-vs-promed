The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases -- a tenant agency at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland -- is investigating after 5 laboratory primates tested positive for the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.

Tuberculosis -- a bacterial disease that primarily affects the lungs -- can cause chest pain, persistent coughing and coughing up blood. It's rarely fatal among patients in the United States, but does require at least a 6-month treatment regimen of 4 antibiotic drugs.

The disease was found among a group of cynomolgus macaques, also known as crab-eating macaques -- an important species to biomedical research. One monkey was identified as a suspect for tuberculosis in late February [2018] and tested positive for the disease in March [2018] after a necropsy, said Caree Vander Linden, a spokeswoman for USAMRIID.

Further testing identified 5 other macaques with latent tuberculosis, meaning they tested positive for the disease but did not show outward signs.

The monkeys were obtained by USAMRIID from the National Institutes of Health Animal Center near Poolesville, according to Vander Linden. The NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also oversees the importation of laboratory animals into the United States.

A human caretaker who works closely with the macaques tested positive for tuberculosis bacteria, Vander Linden said. The worker will receive antibiotic treatment for the disease.

The agency has identified 115 other people who worked in areas where the animals were housed. They will be contacted by the Frederick County Health Department, which is working with USAMRIID to track potential exposures.

The Health Department is still waiting to receive a list of people who need to be interviewed, said Darlene Armacost, manager of the Communicable Disease and Preparedness Program.

USAMRIID has expanded the search to any worker who may have come in contact with the monkeys from 1 Nov. 2016 -- when the 1st infected animal arrived at the agency -- to 15 Feb. 2018.

"At most, we'd expect someone who might test positive for tuberculosis infection -- meaning they have the bacteria in their body but they're not sick, so they're not showing active symptoms [for people vs signs for animals] and can't transmit [the disease] to anyone," Armacost said.

She emphasized the disease was unlikely to be contracted by anyone without direct exposure to the infected macaques. Because the human caretaker did not have active signs of tuberculosis, it is unlikely that the caretaker spread the disease to a broader circle of contacts.

"For right now, the monkeys were the patients that could have spread the bacteria, so the contact investigation revolves around those monkeys," Armacost said.

It's still unclear how the animals at USAMRIID contracted the disease, according to Vander Linden. Research has shown tuberculosis can circulate at low levels among primates imported to the U.S. for research, but there are also strict quarantine protocols before the animals are distributed to labs.

The 1st monkey identified with tuberculosis had undergone multiple health evaluations by the CDC quarantine facility, NIH Animal Center, and USAMRIID's own animal facility.

The animal had been disease-free in all previous screenings, according to a statement from Vander Linden.

Employees identified the original macaque after noticing a neck lesion. The animal was euthanized, and a pathologist noted lesions in the lungs and other organs that were consistent with tuberculosis infection.

[Tuberculosis may be transmitted by people to non-human primates and vice versa. Generally animals entering a research facility such as this are tested numerous times. Likewise caretakers are tested prior to being able to work with these animals. Consequently, this investigation has a lot of digging to figure out where the silent carrier came into the facility. Was it human? Was it animals? Could there have been another source or cross contamination from another research work?

In many research facilities macaques may be used to closely mimic the anticipated response of a human being when examining pharmaceutical and vaccine agents. Among the applied animal models, nonhuman primates, particularly macaques (and these animals were cynomolgus macaques) share the greatest anatomical and physiological similarities with humans. As such, macaque models have been used for investigating tuberculosis pathogenesis and preclinical testing of drugs and vaccines. However, we are not told what these animals were used for at this facility.

In monkeys and large apes, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _M bovis_, and _M avium_ complex can cause severe disease of the lungs and other organs. Epidemics in primate colonies may be caused by contact with infected human caregivers. Transmission is usually by aerosol with respiratory infection, but the oral route is also possible. Bacilli may also be shed in urine. Old tuberculin is used in skin tests in preference to purified protein derivative (PPD), because it provides greater sensitivity in detecting animals infected with _M tuberculosis_ or _M bovis_. Biologically balanced PPDs prepared from _M bovis_ or _M avium_ can be injected intradermally at separate sites on the abdomen to conduct a comparative test. Skin tests are observed at 24, 48, and 72 hr for induration and swelling. Tuberculins prepared for use in people are not of sufficient potency to elicit a response in nonhuman primates. Treatment of cases of tuberculosis in nonhuman primates has been attempted using drugs that have had success in people, eg, isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampin. Drug sensitivity tests should be conducted to determine sensitivity of isolates. Efficacy is limited, and there are overriding arguments against therapy, based on the removal of infected animals, zoonotic risks, and the danger of developing drug resistance. Exacerbations may occur.

[We are told in the news report above that 6 laboratory macaques tested positive for "the bacteria that cause tuberculosis." One of the 6 macaques died with tuberculosis on autopsy and "tested positive for the disease." Five other macaques had non-contagious latent tuberculosis. Usually the diagnosis of clinically active tuberculosis is confirmed by isolation of "_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex", a genetically related group of _Mycobacterium_ species that can cause tuberculosis. Of this group, infections due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ are most common, _Mycobacterium bovis_ are less common, and infections with other members of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (M. _africanum_, _M. microti_, _M. canetti_) are rarely reported in macaques (http://www.dpz.eu/fileadmin/content/Infektionspathologie/Bilder/Dokumente/MAETZ-RENSING%20TB-the%20diseasse%20FORMAT%20COP_Korr.pdf).

We are told that the macaque identified with tuberculosis had undergone multiple health evaluations by the CDC quarantine facility, so tuberculosis was likely acquired after arrival at the facility in Nov 2016. The so far unidentified source could have been a caretaker or other human working in the facility in contact with the macaques, another monkey, or some other animal with pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, immunodeficiency in macaques associated with simian immunodeficiency virus could facilitate tuberculosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233680/). Was the macaque that died co-infected with SIV?

The one human case, a caretaker, mentioned in the news report above has latent tuberculosis, a non-contagious form of the disease. Latent tuberculosis is diagnosed by means of a positive tuberculin skin test or a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay or IGRA, a blood test. No _M. tuberculosis_ is isolated from people or animals with latent tuberculosis. However, if mycobacteria are subsequently isolated from a human or an animal with a contagious form of tuberculosis that had been in contact with the 6 tuberculous macaques, genotyping these isolates and the one isolate from the dead macaque can establish transmission pathways.
