The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has
confirmed that a deer harvested by a hunter in November 2010 near Pine
Island in southeastern Minnesota had chronic wasting disease (CWD),
which is fatal to deer, elk, and moose but not known to affect humans
or cattle. The diagnosis, which was confirmed 25 Jan 2011, marks the
1st time CWD has been found in Minnesota's wild deer herd.

The disease is a serious concern, not only because of the obvious
harmful effects on cervid health, but also due to the negative impacts
to landowners, hunters, and businesses.

The DNR has been actively on the lookout for CWD since 2002, when the
disease was first found in a domestic elk farm in central Minnesota.
The agency has been conducting surveillance for the disease because an
important management strategy is early detection.

Since 2002, the DNR has tested more than 32 000 hunter-harvested or
road-killed deer, 60 elk, and 90 moose as part of its early CWD
detection strategy. Until now, laboratory analysis had never found a
wild deer "presumed positive" for CWD.

[This is a significant finding as it has been 9 years since the 1st
captive cervid was found positive for this disease.

Prions have been detected in urine. Furthermore, captive cervid
facilities personnel have observed deer urinating through the fences.
Perhaps this is one way that the agent may have gotten into the wild.
Other ways may be through inadvertent transport of deer material. Or
perhaps it has always been there and is just now reached a level to be
found.

I am sure surveillance will continue. - Mod.TG]
