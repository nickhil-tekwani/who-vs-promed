Venereal disease resistant to drugs
-----------------------------------
The treatment of gonorrhea in Scotland is being threatened by the emergence
of a drug-resistant form. One case in 20 investigated by a team from
Edinburgh University Medical School turned out to be less easily treated
than before using the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and 2.2 per cent of cases
were completely resistant.
Resistance to the antibiotic has been growing in the Far East and the
evidence is that the resistant strains are being introduced into Scotland
by "sexual tourists". Thailand was the largest single source. The danger is
that the imported version will spread within Scotland, as is already
happening. The team responsible for the report suggest in The Lancet that
gonorrhea caught abroad ought not to be treated by ciprofloxacin.
Dr Hugh Young and colleagues reviewed the degree of gonorrhea resistance to
ciprofloxacin, marketed as Ciproxin by Bayer, over an 8-year period.
Samples were taken from 4415 infections. The researchers found that the
proportion of cultures with lowered susceptibility increased from 0.5
percent in 1991 to 5 percent in 1999. The proportion of cultures with
clinical resistance was significantly higher in 1999, at 2.2 percent, than
the average for the preceding 4 years (0.9 percent).

[This problem is not new, and is not restricted to Scotland as will be
noted by reading the archived ProMED-mail postings cited above. This
article does serve to remind us of the ongoing problem of
antibiotic-resistant strains of _N. gonorrhoeae_ which may be imported from
the Far East. - Mod.ES
[In areas where there is a significant rate of resistance to the
fluoroquinolones, there are a limited number of options that remain when
treating patients who have gonococcal infection. This is a particular
problem for patients in whom there is a documented cephalosporin allergy.
For the information of our subscribers, there are numerous other trade
names for ciprofloxacin. According to my version of the GIDEON program,
other names for ciprofloxacin include: Baycip, Belmacina, Biamotil,
Carmicina, Catex, Ceprimax, Cetraxal, Ciflan, Ciflox, Cilox, Ciloxan,
Ciplox, Ciprex, Cipro, Ciprobay, Ciprogis, Ciprolan, Ciproquinol,
Ciproxina, Ciproxine, Cirpok, Cunesin, Estecina, Filoxan, Flociprin,
Floxacipron, Giroflox, Globuce, Huberdoxina, Inkamil, Keefloxin, Megaflox,
Nivoflox, Nixin, Oflaciclox, Piprol, Plenolyt, Procin, Quinaflox, Quinox,
Quipro, Rigoran, Sepcen, Septocipro, Tam, Uniflox, Velmonit, and Xorpic. -
