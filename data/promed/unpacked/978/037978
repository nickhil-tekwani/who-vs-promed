Trang Hospital chief Somneuk Cheuthong said yesterday [30 May 2009],
the mosquito-borne chikungunya disease is believed to have killed for
the 1st time in Thailand, claiming a 6-day-old baby boy.

Trang doctors performed emergency surgery on a 28-year-old pregnant
chikungunya patient on [23 May 2009] to save her 2.7-kilogram [6 lb]
baby. The baby suffered slight oxygen deprivation from choking and
was admitted to an ICU room.

Somneuk said yesterday [30 May 2009] that [the baby] had died from
respiratory complications. He explained that the infant had
contracted the virus from his mother's blood and that it had
penetrated 40 per cent of his body.

The hospital has put 10 other pregnant women with chikungunya [virus
infection] under close observation.

[The 1st death associated with chikungunya infection in Thailand
during 2009 is a 6-day-old low birth weight boy from Trang province,
a southern province, which was previously reported as having more
than 500 cases as of 19 May 2009 (see ProMED archive no.
20090520.1894). Transmission of disease was most likely
transplacental.

Southern provinces had reported increasing numbers of chikungunya
virus infections during May 2009, with previous newswires reporting
outbreaks in Trang, Phuket, and Krabi provinces (see prior postings
listed below).

According to the Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance Report (WESR) of
the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand,
dated 20 May 2009, and available in the Thai language at
<http://203.157.15.4/wesr/file/y52/F52205.pdf>,
there were 20 541 cases of chikungunya infection reported from 23 provinces.

[Respiratory symptoms have not been reported in cases of CHIK,
although there have been cases of multi-organ failure in patients with
pre-existing conditions hit by CHIK infection. A doctor in Reunion
wrote to ProMED in 2006 "several cases of myelo-meningo-encephalitis
have been reported, some in neonates, with a strong suspicion of
maternal-foetal transmission" -- see: Chikungunya - Mauritius and
Reunion Island (03): Reunion 20060124.0230.

This report from Thailand does not give the reason for the emergency
Caesarian operation, but I am not at all convinced from what it says
that CHIK infection was the primary cause of death. - Mod.JW]
