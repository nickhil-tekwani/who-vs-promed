In a rare case, a woman contracted a potentially deadly bacterial infection while on a 12-hour flight from Japan to Germany, according to a new report.

Called meningococcal disease, this bacterial infection is generally transmitted only through close contact, for example, by kissing or living in close quarters with someone who is sick, according to the World Health Organization. The new report is only the 3rd case ever reported of this disease being transmitted on an airplane, said Yushi Hachisu, of the Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health in Chiba, Japan, who helped investigate the case. Hachisu presented the case on [5 Oct 2017] at IDWeek, an infectious disease conference in San Diego.

Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacteria _Neisseria meningitidis_. About 10 percent of the population carries this bacterium in their nose and throat without showing any symptoms of disease. But the bacteria can cause serious illness if it gets into the blood or the brain. In the brain, the bacteria can cause meningitis -- a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord; in the blood, it can cause and infection called septicemia.

The woman and her husband, both in their 50s, were traveling from Japan to Germany on [8 Aug 2015], according to the report. They happened to be on the same flight as a team of Scottish and Swedish scouts who were returning from the World Scout Jamboree, an international gathering of scouts ages 14 to 17. A total of 6 of the scouts later developed meningococcal disease in an outbreak that was linked to attendance at the jamboree. [See ProMED-mail posts in the See Alsos. - Mod.ML]

The married couple did not sit directly next to the scouts, but sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts. They noticed that one of the scouts seated in front of them was coughing throughout the flight, the report said. Once they arrived in Germany, the couple hopped on another flight to Spain, where they went sightseeing. But a few days later, on [11 Aug 2017], the woman felt tired and developed pain in her throat and a cough. Her husband also developed pain in his throat and a mild fever.

They felt sick for the rest of their trip, but felt somewhat better upon their return to Japan on [16 Aug 2015], the report said. However, on [19 Sept 2015], the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, as well as pain in her joints. She visited four health care facilities and underwent tests before she was finally hospitalized on [25 Sept 2015]. The fluid in her joints tested positive for _N. meningitidis_ bacteria, which means she had a blood infection with _N. meningitidis_ that spread to her joints. Samples taken from the husband's nose and throat also tested positive for _N. meningitidis_, although he did not develop further symptoms. Both the woman and her husband were infected with the same strain of _N. meningitidis_ that caused the outbreak in the scouts, the report said. The woman was treated with antibiotics and recovered.

Meningococcal disease is rare in Japan, with only about 3 cases per 10 million people, the researchers said.

The new report "strongly suggests that _N. meningitidis_ was transmitted from the Scottish scouts to the Japanese couple during their international flight," the researchers wrote in their report.

Still, the overall risk of transmitting meningococcal disease on an airplane is low, Hachisu said. But it can happen -- in 2005, officials in Australia reported cases of 2 people who got sick with _N. meningitidis_ after traveling on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Officials determined it was likely that one of the infected passengers spread the bacteria to the other passenger, or both of the infected individuals got the bacteria from another person on the flight that wasn't showing symptoms.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that passengers who sit next to someone with _N. meningitidis_ on a flight that is more than 8 hours long receive preventive antibiotics. A longer flight increases the chance of transmission, Hachisu said.

[From 29 Jul 2015 through 8 Aug 2015, about 34 000 boy scouts and their leaders from 150 countries attended an international Jamboree in Yamaguchi, Japan. Invasive meningococcal disease subsequently developed in 3 scouts and one parent from Scotland and 2 scouts from Sweden after Jamboree ended. The index case was reported to have developed symptoms while returning to Scotland. The strains from all 6 cases were identical and belonged to serogroup W (Kanai M, Kamiya H, Smith-Palmer A, et al. Meningococcal disease outbreak related to the World Scout Jamboree in Japan, 2015. Western Pac Surveill Response J. 2017; 8(2): 25-30. Published online 2017 May 8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729922).

The Japanese woman and her husband, described in the news report above, were traveling by plane from Japan to Germany on 8 Aug 2015, and sat in a row behind and across the aisle from the Scottish scouts, one of whom, presumably the index case, was coughing throughout the flight. Three days later, they both began to feel ill with pain in the throat. About 6 weeks later, the woman developed a sudden high fever and chills, and was subsequently diagnosed with meningococcal septic arthritis. The incubation period for invasive meningococcal disease is 3 to 4 days, with a range of 2 to 10 days; however, this incubation period commonly pertains to meningitis or meningococcemia (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html).

The Japanese woman had primary meningococcal arthritis (i.e., arthritis without signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or meningococcaemia), which is rare occurring in as little as 1 percent of meningococcal infections (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628474/). It is usually preceded by an upper respiratory infection in 50-55 percent of presentations, and patients may appear nontoxic, afebrile, and polyarthralgic. Her husband had pharyngitis from which meningococci were isolated.

Both the woman and her husband were said in the news report above to be infected with the same strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ that caused the outbreak in the scouts. Presumably both wife and husband became infected with the outbreak strain by exposure to the index case on the 8 Aug 2015 airplane flight. However, we are not told if matching isolates was based on genotyping or just that all the isolates were serogroup W. Most likely genotyping was done.

Meningococci are thought to spread from person to person by exposure to nasopharyngeal secretions, which can happen during close contact (coughing or kissing, living in the same household). Dispersion of large droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions occurs within 3 feet of a coughing patient, such as the few rows directly in front of or behind an ill airplane passenger.

Other respiratory illnesses that have spread onboard air flights include influenza, tuberculosis and SARS (1-5). For active tuberculosis in a passenger, all passengers seated on an airplane in the same row and in the 2 rows in front of and behind the index case are considered contacts (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf).

In addition to the proximity of passengers to the index case, risk to passengers and flight crew members also depends on the flight duration, the ability of a patient to generate an infectious spray of nasopharyngeal secretions, and the number of organisms per ml of respiratory excretion. However, aircraft ventilation systems are believed to be highly efficient at keeping the air free of pathogens, which it does by exchanging the air frequently in passenger cabins and passing the circulated air through high-efficiency particulate-arresting (HEPA) filters (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2006/who_htm_tb_2006_363.pdf).

The U.S. CDC employs a passive surveillance system by which local health departments report suspected cases of air-travel-associated meningococcal disease. In 2001, the CDC reported that from February 1999 through May 2001, it received 21 reports of cases of air-travel-associated invasive meningococcal disease, an average of one report every 6 weeks (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). Approximately half of these cases were reported to a CDC airport quarantine station, and the rest were reported to CDC headquarters. The mean time between the completion of the flight and the onset of illness was 1.9 days (range: 0--10 days). As many as 5 case-patients had onset of illness before arrival, but the others had onset of illness after the flight had landed and the exposed passengers had dispersed. The CDC noted at the time that no secondary cases among air travel contacts of persons with meningococcal disease had been reported to the CDC, perhaps because of difficulties in subsequently tracing exposed passengers.

Because the attack rate among close contacts of patients with meningococcal disease is an estimated 500--800 times greater than the general population, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis is recommended for contacts that are exposed to the respiratory secretions of the index patient to prevent secondary cases of meningococcal disease. The assessment of risk to passengers and flight crew members should be based on the flight duration and seating proximity to the index case-patient. The CDC recommends that household members traveling with an index case-patient, persons traveling with an index case-patient who have had prolonged close contact (e.g., roommates), and, for flights more than 8 hours, including ground time, anyone having direct contact with a patient's oral secretions should also be identified and the need for antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis evaluated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).

In the CDC communication (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm), because of the absence of data at the time about increased risk to other passengers, the CDC limited their recommendations for chemoprophylaxis to those passengers seated in either seat next to an index case-patient. However, we now have data that risk extends to passengers in adjacent rows. Because the risk for illness in the close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after exposure to an index case-patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). Chemoprophylaxis administered later than 14 days is probably of limited or no value.
