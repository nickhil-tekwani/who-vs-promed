So far this year [2012], 50 children have died from whooping cough [pertussis], 23 of them in Bogota and 6 in Antioquia [department]. This is a highly contagious respiratory disease in children under 1 year of age in the country.

Deputy Health Minister, Martha Ospina, who referred to the increase of the disease in the country said, "We have an increase of pertussis in the country, foreseeable within expectations, because since 2010 we have the possibility of carrying out tests that help us determine whether children actually have this disease."

In addition, the official said that the goal is to control the death rate from this disease.

"So far this year [2012], 50 children have died from pertussis, of which 54 percent were children under 2 months of age. It is not that they don't have the necessary health measures, but that they were not old enough to participate in the vaccination schedule," Ospina said.

According to Ospina, a timely diagnosis and care at the health centers, coupled with basic hygiene recommendations, such as washing hands, contribute to the reduction of deaths from pertussis in children.

[The unfortunate death of a significant number of infants in Colombia underscores how important it is to cocoon vaccinate around the, as yet non-protected, infant. This includes booster immunization of any relatives involved with the infant's care and most importantly, making sure that the pregnant mother has received a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine) during the 2nd or 3rd trimester to provide transplacental protection if she had not been boosted in recent years. - Mod.LL
