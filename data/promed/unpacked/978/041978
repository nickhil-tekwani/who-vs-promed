African Swine fever outbreak in Kabardino-Balkaria
--------------------------------------------------
The African Swine fever [ASF] epidemic rages in
the Mayski rayon of Kabardino-Balkaria. The focus
of infection was identified in the farm
"Novoivanovskoe." So far, 2400 animals have been
culled; 600 additional pigs are scheduled to be
culled. The authorities announced the territory
as an emergency zone, facilitating measures to prevent further spread.

ASF does not affect human health, but has a
significant economical impact. While the losses
of the Novoivanovskoe farm have not been
calculated yet, the all Russian losses from ASF,
during 2009, are estimated to have been 30 billion rubles (1 billion USD).

[The ASF outbreak in the village Novoivanovskoye,
holding "Lenintsy", Maisky, Kabardino-Balkarskaya
republic, was notified by Russia to the OIE on 23
Mar 2010 in its follow-up report number 23. See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9075>.
According to the report, 4 cases were seen among
the 2300 strong pig population of the affected
farm. Stamping out was declared to be applied;
this has, thus, been carried out according to plan.

informs that no additional ASF outbreaks have
been recorded since the described Maisky event.

Since 11 Sep 2009, 48 ASF outbreaks have been
