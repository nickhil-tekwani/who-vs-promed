An Irish toddler was covered in horrific sores and blisters after allegedly contracting hand, foot, and mouth disease at a holiday resort in Mallorca, Spain.

Two-year-old RLC was treated in Dublin's Tallaght Hospital after her family had to cut short their holiday when she fell ill.

Around 50 people have caught the virus so far, most of them being children, at the Club Mac Hotel in Alcudia since 11 Sep 2018, the Irish Sun reports.

The Dublin toddler arrived at the hotel on 25 Sep 2018 with her mother, brother, and grandmother. Her father later flew out to Spain to be with his daughter. He said: "They borrowed a cot from the hotel for her, and we think that's how she got sick." The family noticed the sores when they went down at the beach.

Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP, said that it was absolutely possible that the disease had spread to other parts of the island. Dr. Jarvis said: "Kids can stay infectious for several weeks, so if they've been to the beach, they can spread it to other kids."

Club Mac confirmed that 48 people had been infected but said that the virus was under control. They said: "Currently, we have 2230 people staying, of which 667 are children, and only 5 cases of children with hand, foot and mouth. Please note, it is an airborne virus like the common cold and its spread has nothing to do with the cleanliness of the hotel."

[Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is a virus of the genus _Enterovirus_ in the Picornaviridae family. HFMD is usually mild, with few complications, but the EV-71 HFMD strain can be fatal because of its severe complications, which include neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems. It is also more infectious than the Coxsackie virus, the most common cause of HFMD.

Although this is a report of HFMD in Europe, countries in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced increased HFMD activity, and this paper (KY Lee. Enterovirus 71 infection and neurological complications. Korean J Pediatr. 2016 Oct; 59(10): 395-401) contains useful information on EV-71 [Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5099286/.]:

[Conclusion]
--------------
"Epidemics of EV71 infection have caused many fatalities from serious neurological complications in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997 and have become a serious public health problem in these areas. Among the diverse neurological complications of EV71 infection, brainstem encephalitis is the most critical neurological manifestation, because it can cause pulmonary hemorrhage leading to death. During EV71 epidemics, the neurological complications of EV71 infection always should be considered in the differential diagnosis in children with neurological diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and milrinone can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with CNS involvement relating to EV71 infection. Recently, phase III clinical trials of 3 new EV71 vaccines were completed in China. However, it seems to take time for the promotion and approval of these vaccines to take effect in various countries." - Mod.LK
