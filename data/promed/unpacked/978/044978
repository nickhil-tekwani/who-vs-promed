[1] Cholera - Sudan (Darfur)

A cholera outbreak in Sudan has spread to the war-torn western Darfur
region, posing a serious threat to the 2.5 million living in squalid camps
in cramped conditions, a U.N. statement said. Cholera spreads rapidly in
close-knit populations. An outbreak that began in late Jan 2006 in south
Sudan has killed at least 516 people among more than 13 800 cases,
affecting 6 of the 10 southern states.
"The WHO in Nyala (south Darfur) confirmed 65 cases of acute watery
diarrhea," said a UN statement sent late on Sun, 11 Jun 2006. The
statement said an aid agency had confirmed a cholera fatality in Gereida,
in southeast Darfur, where almost 100 000 people have fled their homes to
seek safety in the town.
Three years of rape, pillage and murder in Darfur has herded much of the
population to crowded urban centers away from rural villages. Scarce food
supplies, a lack of healthcare and the upcoming rainy season make them more
vulnerable to the water-borne disease.

[4] Cholera, non-O1, wedding guests - Malaysia

A wedding feast landed some 60 people, including a 3-year-old girl, in a
hospital recently. The guests, who were among 300 who attended the wedding
on 31 May 2006 in Kampung Lepai, Langgar, have been diagnosed with
cholera. They are now quarantined in hospitals in Jitra and Yan here. The
bridal couple and their parents were spared, as their food was prepared
separately from that for the guests.
Health authorities were alerted after 2 guests sought treatment for signs
of food poisoning at the Alor Star Hospital on 1 Jun 2006. They tested
positive for cholera non-O1, a mild strain of the infection.
In Kuala Lumpur, Health Ministry disease control department director Datuk
Dr Ramlee Rahmat confirmed the case and said measures were being taken to
contain the spread of the disease. This included dispatching medical teams
to trace the guests at their homes. He said, "It is difficult to trace the
source as the food was prepared via gotong-royong [communally - Mod.LL].
"We've traced 300 guests, of which 60 tested positive, including 3 cases
today (11 Jun 2006). Their treatment will take at least a week. Some have
been discharged, while the rest are being treated," Dr Ramlee said.
