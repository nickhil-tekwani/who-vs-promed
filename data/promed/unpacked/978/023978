The South Australian Health Department says it will not make public the
name of the egg company with a possible link to a salmonella food poisoning
outbreak.
The source of 6 cases of Salmonella food poisoning was first traced back to
the Buono Pasta Company at Klemzig. Batches with 'best before' dates of 20
and 27 Sep 2006 have been recalled as a precaution.
The Health Department says the pasta company does not appear to be at fault
because the people who became sick reportedly ate the pasta raw. Now the
department says a further 11 people who have not eaten the pasta have
become sick with the same strain of salmonella.
Department Director Kevin Buckett says eggs used as an ingredient could be
the source of the contamination. "But in this case the eggs are still just
a working hypothesis," he said.
