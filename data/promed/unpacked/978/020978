Madagascar plague outbreak: external situation report no.12 - [20 Nov 2017]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO continues to support the Ministry of Public Health and other national authorities in Madagascar to monitor and respond to the outbreak of plague. From [6 to 17 Nov 2017], 216 cases of plague (1 confirmed, 20 probable and 195 suspected) were reported to WHO. The date of onset of the last case of bubonic plague was [7 Nov 2017] and the last confirmed case of pneumonic plague was reported on [14 Nov 2017].

From [1 Aug to 17 Nov 2017], a cumulative total of 2267 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 195 deaths (case fatality rate 9 per cent), have been reported from 55 of 114 (48 per cent) districts in Madagascar.

Analamanga Region in central Madagascar has been the most affected, with 68 per cent of all recorded cases. Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases have been treated and recovered. As of [17 Nov 2017], only [no number is given - Mod.LL] people were hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country.

Most of the reported cases (1732, 76 per cent) have been clinically classified as pneumonic plague, 327 have been classified as bubonic plague (14 per cent); 1 was septicemic; and 207 have not yet been classified (further classification of cases is in process). A total of 81 health care workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died.

Of the 1732 clinical pneumonic cases, 389 (22 per cent) have been confirmed, 612 (35 per cent) are probable and 731 (42 per cent) remain suspected (additional laboratory results are in process). Thirty isolates of _Yersinia pestis_ have been cultured and are sensitive to all antimicrobials recommended by the National Plague Control Program.

Of the 7270 contacts identified during this outbreak, about 99 per cent (7166) have completed their 7-day follow up and a course of prophylactic antimicrobials, and 11 contacts have developed symptoms compatible with plague and became suspected cases. On [17 Nov 2017], all 33 contacts currently under follow-up were reached and provided with prophylactic antimicrobials.

Plague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe District, where the current outbreak originated.

A seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, usually occurs yearly between September and April. In 2017, the plague season began earlier than usual. The current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting both endemic and non-endemic areas, including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (a port city).

[There is a continued downward trend in cases. With so many cases of pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate seems low.

A student from public elementary primary school (EPP) in Andranomena Antananarivo-city reportedly has bubonic plague. The Ministry of National Education published the information on its Facebook page yesterday, [Fri 17 Nov 2017], around 22 hours (10 pm). "The health staff confirmed the disease. He is already under treatment in a hospital," said the ministry. A disinfection and disinfestation operation was to be organized at this facility today [Sat 18 Nov 2017]. People who have been in contact with the patient will also have to undertake contact prophylaxis, to prevent the spread of the disease. If all these procedures are followed, the plague should not affect other students or school staff. Moreover, every school, private and public, has a device, like an isolation room, and can monitor the health of each pupil, under the control of the state, making it possible to detect a probable case of plague at school level.

This is the latest new case notified to Antananarivo-city, after a few days of silence about the plague epidemic. A total of 12 patients are being treated in hospitals of the Big Island; 6 of them are in Antananarivo, 3 in the Upper Matsiatra region, 1 in the Bongolava region and 1 in Itasy. A notable fact of this latest plague situation is, also, the existence of a patient in the region of Atsimo-Andrefana.
