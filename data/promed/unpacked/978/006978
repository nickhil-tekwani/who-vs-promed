The deadly soil disease, melioidosis, infected 114 people last year and 19
died, according to the Environment Ministry (ENV). This is about double the
number of cases and deaths seen in 1997, when 58 people were infected and
nine died. The jump breaks the pattern of decline seen in the last few
years.
Since 1989, there have been 544 cases and 175 deaths here from the disease,
which makes it a bigger killer than more common diseases, such as dengue and
malaria combined.
Melioidosis is caused by bacteria [_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ found in wet
soil and on the surface of muddy water. The disease is endemic throughout
South-east Asia.
In Singapore, most of those who develop symptoms suffer from other
illnesses, such as diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer. Another common
factor is age. The majority are people above the age of 65, said ENV.
