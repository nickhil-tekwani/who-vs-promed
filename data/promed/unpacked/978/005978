2000/049 Monoclonal antibodies to identify adults of _Trialeurodes
vaporarium_ and _Bemisia tabaci_
There is an obvious need for rapid and simple methods to identify adult
whiteflies, either in consignments moving in trade or in crops. As a first
step, two monoclonal antibodies have been developed to distinguish between
adults of _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ and _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2
quarantine pest). When used in combination, these monoclonal antibodies can
readily identify adults of _T. vaporariorum_ and _B. tabaci_ in an ELISA
test. The authors noted that further studies are needed to incorporate
these monoclonal antibodies in a detection kit which could be used by
growers, extension workers, phytosanitary inspectors and even gardeners. In
addition, studies will continue on the development of monoclonal antibodies
to distinguish B. tabaci biotype B (also referred to as B. argentifolii)
from other biotypes.

[An important aspect of this report is that _B. tabaci_ and _B.
argentifolii_ (silverleaf whitefly) are vectors of some plant viruses.
According to scientists at the University of Florida (Jane Polston, Bob
McGovern, and P. J. Stansly), _B. argentifolii_ feeds and reproduces on a
greater range of plant species, including vetetables, broadleaf row crops,
weeds and many ornamental plants including poinsettia. Because of its heavy
feeding and higher rate of reproduction, B. argentifolii dominates in the
southern United States and other areas. - Mod. DH]
