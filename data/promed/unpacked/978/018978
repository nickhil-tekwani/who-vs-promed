Israel, VTEC [verotoxin-producing _E. coli_] outbreak, Southern District [HaDarom]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of gastroenteritis has been reported to affect a nursery in the Nir-Oz Kibbutz in Southern Israel. Of 14 infants, a total of 7 (50 percent) have developed symptoms ranging from diarrhea to bloody diarrhea or fever. 3 out of the 7 cases (aged 4-10 months) have developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and 2 of them required intensive care. A total of 5 infants have been admitted to the regional hospital (Soroka Medical Center) for treatment of this infection.

A local petting farm has been suggested as a potential source of infection and was closed for visitors by the district health authorities until further notice. This, as well as other possible sources are currently being investigated.

Infection control measures implemented include closure of the nursery, heightened awareness and specimen referral for new diarrhea cases, and maintenance of strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene.

VTEC [also known as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, EHEC], is an uncommon cause of gastrointestinal infection in Israel, with only a handful of cases reported annually. However, it is a well documented cause of bloody diarrhea and HUS worldwide.

To the best of our knowledge this represents the 1st documented outbreak of VTEC infection in Israel.

[A reliable source has informed us that several sheep, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and 3 ponies were kept on the petting zoo; only the ponies are still there. It will be of interest to note where the other animals are currently being kept and if they have been sampled before movement. The Nir-Oz Kibbutz also maintains a large beef-cattle feedlot.

Without further evidence, considering the petting zoo as the source of infection remains a "suggestion", as rightly commented by the authors - Mod.AS]
