Kenyan animal medicine manufacturer Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute (KEVEVAPI) is under siege after being accused of manufacturing contaminated drugs.

An African Union report QCR 849, authored by the Union's Pan African Vaccine Centre [see comment - Mod.AS], details the level of contamination of many of the products released by KEVEVAPI over the time period assessed by the report.

The matter has incensed some practitioners, who want to call for an audit of the practices at the institute. According to interactions within an online forum called the Kenya Veterinary Alumni (<vetkenya@googlegroups.com>) and Kenya-Kabete 1909 Vet's Group (kvet forum), some Kenyan vet doctors citing these problems have called for an overhaul of the institute.

In a post in the groups, Henry Maduma Kamagy, a Kenyan veterinary doctor, states that the institute has sold contaminated vaccines to unsuspecting farmers. The incident forced the chair of the Council of Governors (CoG) to write a letter advising all counties in Kenya to stop any further procurement of vaccines from KEVEVAPI until it clears its mess.

In the recent past, KEVEVAPI has been facing problems compounded by other reports that came out in September 2018, which suggested that President Uhuru Kenyatta was fooled by the same institute to launch contaminated vaccines worth KES 92 million [USD 885 771].

One report (https://www.tuko.co.ke/286397-uhuru-fooled-by-veterinary-institute-launch-contaminated-vaccine-worth-ksh-92-million-report.html#286397) seen on Kenyan online portal Tuko cites another report stating a vaccine that had neither been registered nor [had its required] level of purity ascertained was launched by Kenyatta; the incident caused embarrassment to the head of state.

This came against a backdrop of a grant of KES 200 million [USD 1 925 590] given by the government of Kenya to KEVEVAPI for producing vaccines for a range of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth [disease], contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia (CBPP), lumpy skin disease, contagious caprine pleuro-pneumonia (CCPP), peste de petits ruminants (PPR), sheep and goat pox (S&GP), and Newcastle disease (NCD).

The report indicates that "KEVEVAPI received a grant of KES 200 million [USD 1 925 590] vide A.I.E serial No. A741283 dated [23 Aug 2016] and Ref No. D002806-011205-V2/2014/15 from Treasury through State Department of Livestock, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation Development Vote."

In addition, "All 430 000 doses of vaccine expired, with the institution losing about KES 92.45 million [USD 890 104]. In addition, the institution suffered losses worth KES 78 million [USD 750 980] due to contamination of vaccines. Disposal was not done as per the disposal Act 2015," the report states.

In spite of failing quality control tests, KEVEVAPI continued to release the drugs to the market.

There is a concern that Kenya's veterinary practitioners will shun the products from KEVEVAPI until their quality issues are addressed.

Efforts to contact the chief executive officer of KEVEVAPI for a comment were futile.

[According to earlier media reports, the contaminants of the addressed released vaccines were bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus and mycoplasma (https://www.tuko.co.ke/286397-uhuru-fooled-by-veterinary-institute-launch-contaminated-vaccine-worth-ksh-92-million-report.html#286397).

The Pan African Vaccine Centre is located in Ethiopia. On 3 Apr 2019, the African Union published a press release stating that a new facility, based in Debre-Zeit, Ethiopia, is to be constructed for the centre. It will include the Continental Vaccine Bank, quality control unit, biological reagent production facility, and a training centre, amongst others. The project is supported by the US government through its Biological Engagement Program, a part of the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) (see https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20190403/pan-african-veterinary-vaccine-centre-modernization-set-enhance-operations).

The website of KEVEVAPI, available at https://kevevapi.or.ke/, presents all manufactured vaccines. One of the institute's named objectives is to "market and distribute veterinary vaccines locally and abroad," which means that, if the information on the contamination is correct, such vaccines could have been distributed beyond Kenya. Additional information from knowledgeable sources, including confirmation or denial of the above data, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
