A 3rd victim of suspect rabies, a 47-year-old woman, died on Mon 14
Sep 2009 in Sanglah Hospital [Tabanan Regency]. She had been bitten by
her own dog when it suddenly ran amok in her kitchen on 20 Jul 2009.
She was bitten on her right arm and was rushed to the health clinic in
Kediri where she received a tetanus injection. The dog was 3 years old.

A month after she had been bitten, the victim reported feeling unwell.
On Sat 12 Sep 2009 she experienced symptoms such as drastic sweating
around her head, chest pains, and difficulty in breathing. She was
then taken to Tabanan Hospital at 23.00 hr and received emergency
treatment and 2 types of medication. Afterwards she was told to rest
at home.

When her condition did not improve she was taken to Sanglah Hospital
on Sun 13 Sep 2009, where she was placed in an isolation room. It
appears that she was already paralyzed and could not be resuscitated,
finally dying on 14 Sep 2009. Her husband revealed that a few weeks
after having been bitten, that his wife became scared of water and
drafts, but was always thirsty and feverish.

On Mon 14 Sep 2009, 6 officials of the Tabanan Health Department
visited the woman's home and interviewed her husband, but the reason
for this is unclear.

As of today [15 Sep 2009], there have been 3 fatal cases of suspect
rabies: 2 victims came from Desa Buahan, Tabanan, and one from Kediri,
Tabanan.

[The island of Bali is divided into 8 regencies (Badung, Gianyar,
Tabanan, Bangli, Karangasem, Jembrana, Buleleng, and Klungkung, and
one municipal city (Denpasar); see
<http://www.2indonesia.com/regency.html>.
Three of these, Badung, Denpasar and now Tabanan, all adjacent, must
now be considered confirmed or probable rabies epidemic areas. Little
progress appears to have been made in containing the outbreak. The
case described above appears to be the 3rd human case of suspected
rabies in Tabanan Regency. Official confirmation of the diagnoses is
awaited. The situation regarding the control and treatment of rabies
virus infection in the island of Bali remains dire.
