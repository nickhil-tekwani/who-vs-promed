The Health Ministry has asked the Selangor Health Department to submit [a
report on the chikungunya disease, which has returned to affect residents in
Taman Kemp, Port Klang, since several weeks ago.
Its Minister, Datuk Chua Jui Meng, said today that he was informed two more
patients had been admitted to the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital here
[Klang within the past several weeks and had not received any report on it.
He said the District Health Office had been directed to monitor the affected
area to prevent any outbreak of the disease.
Early this year, Chua confirmed that about 27 residents in the affected area
had been affected by a disease known as chikungunya which is spread by
mosquitoes.

[The name "chikungunya" means "my joints hurt" in the language of that part
of East Africa where the causative alphavirus was first isolated from a
dengue-like outbreak. The virus has since been isolated from outbreaks in
the Philippines. The disease is painful but not fatal - Mod.JW
