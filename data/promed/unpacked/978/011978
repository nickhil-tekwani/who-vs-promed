Biological means to help control cassava diseases
-------------------------------------------------
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has announced a
new project that will enable the use of biological means to control
_Bemisia tabaci_ whitefly that has ruined cassava production. The
whiteflies, which are driving a dual viral epidemic including cassava
mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), are said to
be spreading along the Lake Victoria Zone creating possible food insecurity.

Cassava is an important staple food for over 200 million people in Africa,
and it provides over 50 per cent of their carbohydrate intake. It does not
require costly inputs like fertilizers and provides food, fuel, and
vegetables. An IITA survey conducted in 2009 revealed that the 2 whitefly
diseases which originated from south eastern Uganda cause the loss of 90
per cent of cassava yields with an annual damage of over USD 1 billion.

"The Bemisia whitefly has continued to threaten new areas of cassava
production in Africa, especially in Tanzania, where Kagera, Mwanza, Mara,
Kigoma, and the Coast regions are critically affected," said James Legg,
IITA. "With the ongoing control project we intensify efforts to search for
and test the effectiveness of natural enemies as part of an integrated
disease management strategy."

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease (CBSD) is caused by _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_).
Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown, corky
necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy
even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 per cent
have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 per
cent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and strains
in the genus _Begomovirus_, which seem to be associated with it in
different areas of Africa. Co-infections as well as genetic recombination
between strains have also been reported. Recombinant strains can be
particularly virulent, and a new more virulent strain of CMD has been
reported recently from West Africa (ProMED-mail post 20090423.1528).
Symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants.

CBSV is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_. CMD viruses
are also spread by whitefly vectors, and at least one of them (_African
cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has been found in an alternative host
(soybean) suggesting that CMD viruses may have a wider host range as
reservoirs and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Both diseases are
also spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings and are considered a
threat to the food security of the whole of sub-Saharan Africa.

CMD has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops
throughout the region. Crop varieties resistant to different CMD strains
were developed for local use, which have alleviated the problem in some
areas but in others are being wiped out by CBSD. Crop varieties resistant
to CBSD are also being developed and managing both diseases simultaneously
by resistance breeding is being attempted (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463).
However, the involvement of a number of different viruses able to mutate
independently represents a particular challenge to the development of
resistant cultivars.

The best option for simultaneous disease management of CMD and CBSD appears
to be an integrated approach including pathogen exclusion, removal of
infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector
control. The whitefly vectors are a serious pest of cassava and other crops
in themselves, thus the biocontrol programme described above may result in
wide ranging benefits for the region and beyond.
