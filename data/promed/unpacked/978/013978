Conservationists are calling on the public to help efforts to track
the spread of a bird disease that has taken hold in garden birds in
recent years, with great tits particularly badly hit by the lesions it
causes.

In 2006, scientists confirmed the 1st case of avian pox in a British
great tit -- before then, the virus had been confined to birds in
Scandinavia, Austria, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Last year [2010],
the pox virus reached Wytham Woods in Oxfordshire, which contains a
population of great tits that have been monitored by scientists since
1947, the longest running study of its kind in the world.

"We were very concerned when we first detected this disease," said Ben
Sheldon of the Edward Grey Institute at the University of Oxford.
"We're using our detailed observations to try to understand how this
new form of pox affects survival and reproductive success."

Avian pox leads to warty, tumour-like growths on birds, particularly
around the eyes and beak. It is known to have mild effects on a wide
range of British birds such as the dunnock, house sparrow, starling,
and the wood pigeon. But things are worse for great tits.

"When we see this infection in great tits, the lesions can be a lot
more severe than in other species," said Becki Lawson, a wildlife vet
at the Zoological Society of London. "[The lesions] can be very large,
most common on the head, but they can occur on different areas of the
body. It seems not uncommon for multiple birds to be affected in any
one incident."

No one knows whether the infections are fatal but the lesions can
interfere with the bird's ability to see or fly, which means they are
more likely to fall prey to predators.

The virus can spread via insect bites or direct contact between birds.
It can also be spread through indirect contact via places where birds
congregate such as perches or bird feeders in gardens. According to
Lawson, the virus is "is persistent in the environment for weeks or,
even, months."

Lawson is working with the researchers at Oxford to isolate and
sequence the genes of the avian pox virus, to work out whether or not
it is the same strain that affects birds in central Europe.

In the meanwhile, she recommends that anyone with bird tables or
feeders keep these areas disinfected. "We can't give medicine to
free-ranging birds," she said. "We'd always recommend that people give
particular attention to good hygiene at feeding stations to prevent
the cycle of transmission of any particular disease agent that could
occur there."

Sightings of birds displaying symptoms of avian pox should be reported
to the RSPB [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds] Wildlife
Enquiries Unit on 01767 693690 or reported online.
