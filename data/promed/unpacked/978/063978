The Governor has directed the implementation of a joint campaign of the Office of Health and Optimization and localities to combat (dengue/chikungunya) in the Villages of Sharhab, Alrona, Taiz (Governorate) who have complained of the disease "almkrvs" said the Director of Health: recorded 36 cases ere recorded up to Thursday [27 Sep 2012]. [In Yemen, they use the word "almkrvs," bone-breaker, as the local expression for chikungunya virus infections. The term for dengue is actually "damal Dank." - Corr.SB]

Local residents said that dozens of families have been hit by chikungunya disease "almkrvs," (bone-breaker) in the Directorate Sharhab Alrona in Taiz, demanding the governor of Taiz give guidance to the Office of Health and Epidemiological Surveillance and to rapidly disembark field and medical teams to treat the injured.

The population call chikungunya virus infections "almkrvs," which spread 2 weeks ago in a lot of villages which lack government health centers.

A spokesman told News Yemen that workers in the health sector in the region to were reporting a transmissible disease similar to "dengue fever and malaria," where the sick patients movements are paralyzed and they can not get up.

He said patients in Mamedan and Amuallamh villages and its neighboring villages have symptoms that are "severe pain in the joints, have combined symptoms, in addition to severe headache, fever, and fatigue and muscle pain and other symptoms."

The Sheikh Qurashi circuit 54 said, in a press statement, that dengue [chikungunya?] fever has swept many areas and the numbers of casualties continue to rise and the poor sanitary conditions in the district and poverty contributed greatly to the spread of the disease where it is difficult for citizens to find even a Band-Aid [adhesive plaster] in the health units in addition [to the fact that] areas city of Taiz are infested, [presumably with mosquitos. - Corr.SB], which makes people succumb to the disease.

He expressed rising fears that the disease epidemic was not being contained and is continuing to spread as health authorities in the province have not yet done their duty.

The Director General of the Office of Health and Population in Taiz, Dr. Abdul Nasser, said that dengue [chikungunya?] cases [had been reported] in the province of Taiz since 1994, noting that the official cases registered up to last Thursday reached 36 cases and compared to last year is very modest.

The Director General issued directives of the governor of the province Shawki for a massive implementation of a joint campaign of the Office of Health and the Office of optimization and directorates city leadership starting on Tuesday to fight dengue fever in the city.

[Although the word "almkrvs" is the local term for chikungunya virus infections, it is possible that dengue virus is also circulating there. There have been several previous outbreaks of dengue in Yemen, some relatively recently (June 2012, see ProMED archive no. 20120704.1189075).

It will be helpful to know if laboratory tests have confirmed chikungunya virus as the etiological agent in this outbreak, or if a mixed chikungunya-dengue outbreak is occurring. - Mod.TY
