Oyster herpesvirus
------------------
Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV1, mu-var) has been found in Japanese oysters in
the Oosterschelde. The infection has been revealed in the framework of a
monitoring program for early detection of the herpes virus.

The virus is one of the reasons for the emergence of an oyster disease
which may cause high mortality of Pacific oysters. To what extent other
factors contribute to mortality is not yet known. The oyster herpesvirus
disease does not pose risk to food safety and public health.

The monitoring program for the virus has been put into operation following
the application of measures, addressing the spread of the virus, by the
European Union (EU) earlier in 2010. These EU-published measures provided
member states with the legal tools to take early action even if the disease
was not known to be present within their boundaries.

During the summer of 2010, the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) sampled
young Japanese oysters at 3 locations in the Oosterschelde and 3 places in
the Grevelingenmeer. The tests show that the herpes virus is present in
Pacific oysters in the Oosterschelde. The results of the samples from
Grevelingenmeer are expected next week [week of 13-17 Sep 2010].

During the sampling, no increased mortality was observed among the oysters;
this is still the situation at present.

This is the 1st time that the oyster herpesvirus is found in Dutch waters.
It is not clear how long the virus has already been present in the
Oosterschelde, since no earlier tests have been performed.

An exceptionally high mortality of juvenile oysters was observed In France
during the summer of 2008. The mortality seemed to be partly due to the
involvement of the Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) mu-var. This oyster disease
can cause a mortality rate between 15 and 90 per cent. There seems to be a
link between high mortality and water temperature. In the summer of 2009,
the virus was also detected in Ireland and the UK. Italy has also reported
the presence of the virus without increased mortality among young oysters.

The disease is not notifiable nor liable to official, compulsory control
measures, but seems to be an emerging disease. Oysters from areas where the
virus occurs and from areas where control measures have been applied, are
not allowed introduction into areas where early monitoring is applied. They
are, however, allowed to be distributed for human consumption since no
public health hazard is involved.

[This agent is not (yet) included among OIE's listed aquatic diseases; at
present notified and handled as an emerging disease. Netherlands follows
reports of its spread in France, UK and Ireland.

Both waterbodies Oosterschelde and Grevelingenmeer are situated within the
province Zeeland in south-west Netherlands; see map at
