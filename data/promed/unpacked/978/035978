From: Louisa Chapman <lec3@CIDDAS1.EM.CDC.GOV>
There is a national network for organ transplantation:
The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) operates the national Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and the national Scientific
Registry of Transplant Recipients, serving both as a contractor for the
federal government and as a private non-profit corporation. Additional
information about UNOS, the scientific registry, or organ donations can be
obtained from UNOS, 1100 Boulders Parkway, Suite 500, P.O. Box 13770,
Richmond, Virginia 23225-8770.

[Thanks very much to Louisa for sending this information. Obviously, the
purview of ProMED-mail does not comprise information about organ banks. We
posted the original request for information as more of a public service than
anything else. However, notwithstanding concerns about transmission of
viruses by xenotransplantation, we are cutting this string. -- Mod CHC]
