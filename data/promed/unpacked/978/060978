Discrepancies in estimates of postvaccinial encephalitis risk?
-----------------------------------------------------------
I was immunised against smallpox once at 3 months of age and have been
following this discussion on immunity against smallpox with some interest.
I have also been reading the chapter on Smallpox and Vaccinia vaccines in
Plotkin SA and Orenstein WA (editors). Vaccines, 3rd edition, Saunders,
1999. I am sure many ProMED-mail subscribers will be familiar with this text.
Page 83, chapter 6 of this book (Henderson DA and Moss B) has a table (6-3)
entitled: Complications per 1 million smallpox vaccinations in the United
States during 1968. In this table, the frequency of 'postvaccinial
encephalitis' (PVE) ranges from 6.5 per million at age 1 year to
2.2/million at ages 1-4 years to 3.2/million at ages 5-9 years.
Converting Professor M Dietrich's figures [see ProMED-mail Wed 21 Nov 2001:
Smallpox, diluted vaccine trial (03) 20011121.2850 to the same denominator
would suggest that children aged 1-3 years would experience PVE with a
frequency of 100 per million (= 1: 10 000), ages 4-5 years 1538/million (=
1: 650), and ages 11-14 years 8333/million (= 1: 120).
There are 2 differences in these figures. First, is the direction of the
trend of PVE incidence related to age? In Dietrich's figures, the incidence
of PVE rises with age, whereas Henderson and Moss indicate a decreased
incidence with age. Secondly, Dietrich's figures for the incidence of PVE
are 10-1000 times greater than those quoted by Henderson and Moss.
Perhaps Professors Dietrich, Henderson, and Moss might like to account for
the discrepancies in these figures, as this will be pertinent for those who
would be considering taking part in the diluted vaccine trial, as well as
any others who may be offered smallpox vaccination with the existing 'old'
smallpox vaccine stocks.

Detailed data on complications are described in the book: Vasile Tudor, Ion
Strati. Smallpox. Cholera. Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England: ABACUS Press, 1977.
This book reviews smallpox cases in Europe between 1961 and 1970. Moreover
imported smallpox cases have been mentioned in 1972 in Germany and in
Yugoslavia. The importation in Yugoslavia was accompanied by mass
vaccination of about 18 million people. Perhaps theauthorities in
Yugoslavia could be approached for first hand information on the
complications experienced during this mass vaccination. Concerning
persistent immunity, I remember seeing an imported case in Heidelberg
Germany, an elderly woman who had had two successful vaccinations in childhood.
