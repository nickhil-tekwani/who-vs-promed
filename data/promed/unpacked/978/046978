An outbreak of hepatitis A in Kentucky, centered in Jefferson County, has spread to more than 100 people, a significant increase in a state that typically sees about 20 cases per year.

Confirmed cases have continued to grow since the outbreak was declared in November 2017, when there were 19 cases in Louisville. At the time, officials said common risk factors included homelessness or drug use. Since then, at least 2 employees in the food service industry have been added to the city's list of victims, and more than 20 cases identified in Southern Indiana prompted the closure of at least one school district's campus, which includes 3 Henryville schools.

There are more than 140 cases in Louisville. Jefferson County is ground zero for the highly contagious liver infection, with more than 130 of the state's cases and the 1st death linked to the virus. There are typically 4 or fewer Louisville cases of hepatitis A in an entire year, according to a spokesman for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health. But officials said Friday, 16 Mar 2018, there are 143 confirmed cases in Jefferson County, up from 120 the week before, and it's possible the outbreak still may not have crested.

The city health spokesman, Dave Langdon, told Courier Journal that more than 5700 people, mostly those considered at highest risk, have been vaccinated across the city since the outbreak began late last year [2017].

It spread across the river to Indiana to Clark county, where Clark County's health officer Dr. Eric Yazel said on Friday, 16 Mar 2018, that the county has 25 hepatitis A cases, with 2 more that are pending. Of those, most have been connected to the Louisville outbreak, which makes sense, given the "migration of population" between the 2 regions, Yazel said. "It's almost like one big general outbreak in Kentuckiana," he said, adding that the county is treating the number of cases with the highest level of precaution.

Several cases were confirmed among jail inmates, as well as among 2 workers at Henryville Elementary School, the health department announced on Thursday, 15 Mar 2018. West Clark Community Schools' Henryville campus was closed Fri 16 Mar 2018 as a health precaution, the district said. That campus includes Henryville's elementary school and junior and senior high schools. School is expected to resume as scheduled on Mon 19 Mar 2018, according to a letter sent home by the district.

Health officials have focused on vaccinating targeted populations, primarily people living in close quarters like in a jail or at a homeless shelter, Yazel said. Since the 1st cases began to appear in early December 2017, more than 500 vaccinations have been administered in Clark County.

Yazel recommends anyone who interacts with a large amount of people, such as those in the food industry, to get vaccinated. And anyone with symptoms is advised to stay home to prevent spreading the virus.

Floyd County did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday [16 Mar 2018].

Since November of 2017, Indiana has confirmed 37 cases statewide, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Health said on Friday, 16 Mar 2018. Of those, 14 people reported visiting Kentucky before their illness onset, spokeswoman Megan Wade-Taxter wrote in an email.

The hepatitis A cases in the Clark County jail were considered to be an outbreak, she said, but there has not been an outbreak declared for Clark County or Indiana.

Across the country, outbreaks have been identified in California, Michigan, Wyoming and Utah. Some cases have been identified in the food service industry. An employee at the Kroger store on Dixie Highway was diagnosed earlier this month [March 2018], prompting an alert from the store warning customers to look out for possible symptoms. Roughly a week later, city health officials said a former employee of the Denny's restaurant in St. Matthews had also been diagnosed, after having potentially exposed customers to the virus.

This isn't the city's 1st time dealing with an outbreak. An outbreak tore through the Louisville area in 1988, killing one and infecting more than 200 others. A study of the outbreak published in the American Journal of Public Health in 1990 found that in nearly 3 out of every 4 cases, the victims ate at one of 3 Louisville restaurants. It did not identify the eateries. The outbreak was later traced back to produce that had been contaminated before it was distributed to restaurants, the 1st known contamination of its kind in the USA, the report stated. All of those restaurants had purchased produce from the same distributors.

Louisville officials urge people to consider getting the vaccine, which is covered by most insurance plans and offered at Kroger and Walgreen pharmacies.

[Unlike the older outbreak discussed in this posting where the at-risk population was primarily restaurant customers, control of this outbreak will require a change in the paradigm for hepatitis A prevention.

As was done in San Diego county in California, directly addressing sanitation and dealing appropriately with the homeless community is needed along with an aggressive immunization program of the at-risk cohort. This is a population that is generally substantially underserved by political interests as they do not represent a voting block. - Mod.LL
