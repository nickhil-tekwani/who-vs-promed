An asymptomatic cow in Germany was, upon slaughter, found to have a very rare form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), says a notice today [17 Jan 2014] from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

The 10 year old animal was from Oder-Spree district, Brandenburg county [state], in north eastern Germany. As part of the German targeted BSE ("mad cow" disease) surveillance system, Western blot testing was done at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute on samples from the cow and found to be positive for L-type BSE. This type is atypical and generally not associated with consumption of BSE-infected feed.

The animal never entered the food supply chain so posed no danger to human health, the report said. Epidemiologic investigation found that 5 offspring of the cow had already been slaughtered; the remaining 2 offspring, still at the farm of origin, were slaughtered and destroyed.

Tracing of cattle born on the farm from one year before through one year after the infected cow's birth identified 5 animals that were subsequently destroyed.

[The official OIE "immediate notification/final report" on the said case, submitted 17 Jan 2014, is available at http://tinyurl.com/porpe3m; it includes a map and the following epidemiological comment:

"As part of the German targeted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance system, a case of BSE classified as atypical (L-type) was identified in a cow at slaughter. An epidemiological investigation of the event was conducted. The summary of the event is as follows: The cow was slaughtered at the age of 10 years and 5 months without clinical signs of disease. Results from immunoblot tests at the National Reference Laboratory (Friedrich-Loeffler Institute) confirmed the animal positive for atypical BSE of the L-type, a very rare form of the disease not generally associated with an animal consuming infected feed. The animal's carcass was destroyed. The identified animal did not enter food supply channels, and so at no time did it present any risk to human health. The epidemiological investigation identified 7 offspring cattle, 5 of which were already slaughtered and 2 of which were still on the farm of origin and have been killed and destroyed. The tracing of the bovines born on the farm from one year before until one year after the birth of the identified cow revealed 5 bovines which have subsequently been killed and destroyed. The OIE does not recognize an atypical form of BSE as a distinct entity for the purpose of its international standards; therefore, it is not mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which does not distinguish between different forms of BSE."

Reportedly, the previous occurrence of BSE in Germany took place on 22 Jun 2009; the current outbreak is declared as "resolved." The number of OIE-reported outbreaks in Germany, since 2000 (when the 1st case in an autochthonous animal was reported) was the following: 2000 (7), 2001 (125), 2002 (106), 2003 (54), 2004 (65), 2005 (32), 2006 (10), 2007 (4), 2008 (2) and 2009 (2).

According to the opinion of EU's Scientific Steering Committee (2002), BSE was "possibly" present in Germany since 1980, and "likely" present since 1988 (http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/ssc/out243_en.pdf).

Germany's official BSE status, according to OIE's criteria, is currently recognised as "controlled BSE risk"; it shares this status with 26 other countries. This means that Germany has undertaken the required measures to prevent BSE and maintains the BSE surveillance as prescribed by the OIE. Its final goal will be to attain the status of "negligible BSE risk," currently shared by 25 member countries. The lists of countries with official status are available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/ and presented on a map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/js/images/bse/BSE_Europe_ENG.gif.

Reports on atypical BSE cases, indicating possible agent strain variation, have become available since 2003 from several countries. Most such cases were identified through active surveillance of non-suspect populations using rapid PrP immunodetection methods. So far, several dozen such cases have been recognised that differ in their molecular profiles by Western immunoblotting from those typically found in the epidemic. An interesting common feature is that most of these variant characteristics originate from older cattle. Initial bioassay data support the hypothesis that these isolates are biologically distinct from classical BSE. It is not known whether atypical cases have any relevance to forms of human prion diseases. At present, these atypical cases appear as 2 distinct types classified by the molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrPres protein band relative to that of classical BSE. One type is of a higher molecular mass (H-type) and the other shows a lower molecular mass (L-type). L-type BSE cases in cattle have been diagnosed in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Poland. Additional data and references are available in OIE's manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.06_BSE.pdf.
