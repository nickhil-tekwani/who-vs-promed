Russia: Fatal Human Rabies Case in the Krasnodarsk Region
--------------------------------------------------
According to data from the local Epidemiological Surveillance Centre a
fatal human case of rabies has been recorded in the village of Chereshnya
in the Adlersk District. The victim was a woman who was bitten by a
domestic dog. Her 2 sons and 2 grandsons were bitten at the same time, when
the dog was being fed. All 5 were referred to a Medical Emergency Unit,
where a course of treatment was initiated and the 1st injection was
administered. However none of the 5 family members returned to complete the
course of injections.
On 8th Dec 2004, the woman sought medical assistance and was admitted to
the Infectious Disease Department of the Adler Hospital, where rabies
infection was diagnosed. The patient died on 9 Dec 2004. The clinical
diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by pathology investigations at the
Krasnodarsk Regiona Veterinary Virology Laboratory. However samples taken
from the dog suspected to be the source of the infection were negative by
laboratory testing, and it could not be confirmed that the dog was source
of the virus.

[This report highlights that treatment of suspected rabies infection by
post-exposure prophylaxis requires completion of a full course of
injections and that a single administration of vaccine is unlikely to
achieve protection. In this incident, however, only one of the 5 members
bitten by the dog succumbed to rabies. This fact, combined with the failure
to detect virus in the dog, suggests that this animal may not have been
rabid and that the source of the infection could have been another animal.
