Leaf blight, sheath rot diseases affect fields
----------------------------------------------
Spread of bacterial leaf blight (BLB) and sheath rot diseases in rice fields has become a matter of concern for thousands of farmers in Bogra district [Rajshahi Division]. In different areas paddy fields are attacked by BLB and sheath rot diseases.

Varieties of BR-11, BR-49, Sharna, and Ranjit types of paddy are more affected while BR-32 and BR-39 Pajjam fields have remained relatively safe. Following suggestions from field level agriculture officers, farmers are spraying anti-fungus medicine, but more croplands have been attacked by the diseases.

According to DAE (Department of Agriculture Extension), at least 150 hectares [371 acres] of paddy land in the district were attacked by BLB and sheath rot diseases, but a farmer said the affected area would be much larger. Agriculture officers are monitoring the fields.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and blight lesions (for severe strains), which may also affect panicles. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers) and use of resistant crop varieties. The related _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.

Sheath rot of rice is caused by the fungus _Sarocladium oryzae_, which can also affect maize, pearl millet, sorghum and a range of grasses. It causes reddish-brown discolouration of the flag leaf sheath and distortion of panicles. Panicles may fail to emerge fully and grain may not fill. Yield losses of up to 85 percent have been reported. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides.
