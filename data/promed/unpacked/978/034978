A case of equine infectious anaemia [EIA] has officially been confirmed in a horse from a holding in Hagen-Grinden (county of Verden [an der Aller, Lower Saxony]). The viral disease, which can infect horses, donkeys, and mules, is a notifiable animal disease. The veterinary authorities of the district have established a restricted area around the village of Hagen-Grinden. The affected animal has already been killed, and all susceptible animals in the restricted area have been examined, as per the relevant Animal Disease Regulation. According to the veterinary authorities additional restrictions are in force in the restricted area.

"Equine infectious anaemia, although widespread worldwide, is very rare in Germany," explains Dr Peter Rojem, county veterinarian of Verden county. The virus can not be transmitted to humans. Only equines are susceptible to this viral disease, according to Dr Rojem.

Viral transmission is mainly through blood-sucking insects like horse flies and biting flies. Other means of transmission, such as transmission between animals, are very rare. Therefore, in this case, according to the assessment of the official veterinarian, in all probability, no further spread of the disease is to be expected. All horses in the same holding tested negative.

Diseased animals only show general symptoms, Dr Rojem continues. These include pale colour of mucous membranes, weakness, loss of weight, fever, loss of appetite as well as miscarriages and erratic movements. Animals can also show no symptoms and thus can act as undetected sources of infection. The disease is incurable. A therapy or vaccination is neither possible nor permitted.

All horses and other equines in the restricted area -- within a radius of about 1 kilometre [0.6 mi] around the affected holding -- are now to be investigated clinically and serologically for the viral disease. The holdings affected have been informed. In addition, there are further restrictions laid down in the published emergency measures of the county of Verden. Thus, all equines in the area have to be housed. The animals can not be moved from the restricted area without authorization from the veterinary authorities. In addition, equine exhibitions and events in the restricted area are prohibited.

The veterinary authority advises horse owners to protect their horses from blood sucking insects by appropriate means. "A lifting of the restrictions is only possible after 3 months, preceded by re-examination of all horses in the restricted area (with negative results)," emphasizes Dr Rojem.

[The previous EIA outbreak in Germany (Bavaria) was reported by Germany to the OIE in January 2017 (20170119.4777963); earlier cases had been recorded during 2015. Subscribers are referred to the following commentary by Mod.CRD, as included in the said post:

"Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family Retroviridae, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology, and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result.

"Antibody response usually persists and antibody-positive animals, older than 6-8 months, are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf)

Between December 2014 and December 2015, 7 outbreaks of EIA were reported in Germany. These outbreaks were located in the provinces of Saxony (3) and Bavaria (4). A total of 13 cases were diagnosed from a susceptible population of 160 animals (equidae). All affected animals (cases) were destroyed. The event was resolved on November 2015. See the final report, dated 17 Dec 2015, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019368_20151218_125041.pdf.

EIA virus is not considered a risk for human health".
