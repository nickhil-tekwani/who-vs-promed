Seven residents in the village of Pervomaisk in Buryatia's Kyakhta district
bordering on Mongolia had to be taken to hospital with symptoms resembling
those of anthrax. One of them, a 62-year-old farmer, died in the hospital.
The final diagnosis was not established. Sanitary inspectors and
veterinarians are now working in Pervomaisk. An incidence of anthrax had
earlier been registered here in 1968 and loss of cattle was reported
recently. For all that, specialists say that final conclusions about the
latest incident can only be drawn after a thorough examination of all
evidence.

[Though the disease occurs widely in Russia, it is not common to get
reports from so far east. I would remind members that the Russian programme
depends on humans as sentinels and therefore the true extent of the problem
is obscure. - MHJ
