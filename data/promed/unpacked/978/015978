Australia: Number of Dengue Cases in Queensland Continues to Rise
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of the mosquito-borne disease dengue fever,
in Cairns [north Queensland], has risen to 160 [from 120 on Mon 24 Mar
2003]. Authorities in the northern Queensland city are stretching their
resources to try and stop the potentially fatal infection from spreading. A
number of suburbs in inner-Cairns and the city's northern beaches are
affected by the outbreak.
Health officials are continuing to go door-to-door to advise residents to
clean up mosquito breeding sites and encourage them to wear protective
clothing and insect repellent.

Australia: Further Increase in Dengue Fever Cases in Northern Queensland
----------------------------------------------------
There has been a further large increase in the number of confirmed dengue
fever cases in far north Queensland. Another 20 Cairns residents are
confirmed with the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease, bringing the
count to 200 [see above: one week ago the total was 120. - Mod.CP].
It has been just over a month since the first reported cases of dengue
fever were detected in suburban Cairns, and while Queensland health
authorities had hoped for a quick containment of the outbreak, numbers
continue to rise. The Tropical Public Health Unit's Dr Ross Sparkes says
the outbreak has largely been contained in several inner-city suburbs.
Dr Sparkes says it is likely more residents will become infected until the
breeding sites are successfully eradicated.

Dengue fever outbreak spreads in New Caledonia
--------------------------------------------
An epidemic of dengue fever in New Caledonia has spread, now reaching the
outer Loyalty Islands, with an estimated 520 cases reported last week.
The epidemic started in the capital Noumea and its surroundings, as well as
small towns in the North of the main island Grande Terre. New Caledonia was
badly hit by cyclone Erica on 14 Mar 2003, increasing the risks of disease.
Health authorities have renewed calls for the population to be vigilant,
especially for dengue fever.

Dengue fever warning in Palau
-----------------------
The Palau Ministry of Health is urging people to keep their environment
clean to prevent the spread of dengue fever after 4 people were diagnosed
with the disease.
Health officials say while there is no epidemic in Palau it has informed
the public, because the incidents are not concentrated in any particular
area and there is a chance for the disease to spread.
Authorities are urging the public to conduct mosquito patrols and make sure
that insect breeding sites are destroyed.
