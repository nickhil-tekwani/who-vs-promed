The widespread mortality observed recently among hippos in Uganda (220 plus
reported to date; see: Anthrax, wildlife - Uganda (NE): susp.
20041209.3263) may be the result of the communal scavenging or
"cannibalism" of carcasses of anthrax-killed hippos by other hippos. This
hypothesis appears to be supported by the apparent absence, until quite
recently, of any contemporaneous reports of anthrax deaths among buffalo or
other common wildlife host species (ProMed-mail 20041209.3263).
I reported the first published scientific records of hippo carnivory and
scavenging in 1996, both of which involved hippos consuming meat from
scavenged impala carcasses and one of which involved a communal feeding
episode (Dudley 1996). Following the publication of these records, I was
informed of an instance of hippo cannibalism from Lake Malawi (S.K.
Eltrinhgham, personal communication) and 2 instances from Tanzania of
hippos consuming scavenged wildebeest carcasses (R.D. Estes, personal
communication) (Dudley 1998 a,b). I have also seen video footage from the
Luangua Valley of a hippo eating the gut contents and/or internal organs of
a dead buffalo, which appears significant in light of the commentator's
report of a previous extensive outbreak of anthrax among hippos in this
same region about 7 years ago (ProMed-mail 20041001.2710).
In light of these factors, I offer the hypothesis that the widespread
proliferation of anthrax outbreaks among hippos in the recent outbreak in
Uganda may potentially be related to the documented but seldom recognized
or reported phenomenon of hippo carnivory and cannibalism.

[We are grateful to Joe for his comments on this not frequently reported
aspect of hippos. How this habit affects the anthrax risks for other
species is intriguing. Informed comments are welcomed. - Mod.MHJ]
