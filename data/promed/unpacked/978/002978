[ProMED-mail has received the following relevant information from Dr Lee Dong-Wool from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. - Mod.CP]

"It is my great pleasure to send you a message because your timely, comprehensive information about numerous outbreaks from all over the world has been very beneficial for us. Recently, I have noted concern about the presence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in my country.

As you may know the Korean CDC/Korean NIH confirmed a 2nd case of SFTS in Korea on 23 May 2013 (see ProMED-mail Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea (03): conf 20130529.1744411). However, the 3rd suspected case mentioned in the ProMED-mail report, has proved to be negative by RT-PCR analysis. We did report back and are waiting for a final decision from the clinician who suspected that case as SFTS.

As of Tue 28 May 2013, the Korean CDC has reported 47 cases from the clinics; among these, 2 cases were confirmed and 27 cases were negative by RT-PCR. Furthermore, there are 2 additional highly suspected cases of SFTS (one each in Jeju and Gyoungbuk provinces) and a final decision will be made in the following week.

Your information has always been useful for us to know what is happening with infectious diseases in the world. I appreciate your prime efforts for the strengthening of emerging infectious diseases surveillance [and of awareness of the threat they pose]. I hope this mail will be helpful in providing you with a better analysis of the situation."
