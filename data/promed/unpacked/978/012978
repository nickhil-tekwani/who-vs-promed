Internal rot of capsicums and chillies is a major ongoing issue for Australian growers, typically those in warm, humid growing areas. It affects both field and greenhouse grown fruit, especially if humidity is not well controlled. The disease generally affects the seed inside the fruit rather than the edible portion.

Although infection is believed to occur at flowering, the disease usually does not develop until the capsicum/ chilli starts to ripen, with spread most rapid after harvest. As the disease cannot be detected from the outside, infected fruit can be sent to market. This can lead to consignments being downgraded or destroyed, as well as affecting consumer confidence and purchases.

Several different fungi can cause the disease, including species of _Fusarium_ and _Alternaria_. However, it is unclear which is/are the main organism(s) responsible for this disease in Australia. [To] identify the causal organism(s) and develop management techniques to both prevent infection and minimise the risk of sending unacceptable fruit to market, affected capsicums and chillies [are needed].

[Internal fruit rot of capsicum crops is considered an increasing problem worldwide, particularly in glasshouse cultivation. An incidence of up to 40 percent has been reported in some crops. Some yield losses occur at the production stage and vary between crops and seasons. However, since infections generally do not become obvious until harvest or during postharvest storage, most of the loss for growers is rejection of whole batches of produce by the trade.

Fungal species of _Alternaria_, _Fusarium_, _Botrytis_ and _Colletotrichum_ (anthracnose), as well as occasionally also soft rot bacteria (such as _Pectobacterium_ spp.) have been reported in association with these fruit rots in different areas. The pathogens enter the host by infection of the flowers and do not move from fruit to fruit. They establish themselves inside developing fruits, including stalk, base and pulp, or around the seeds. Disease development is favoured by high humidity and warm temperatures, such as are present in glasshouses.

Generally, these pathogens can be spread with contaminated plant material (including crop debris, transplants, seeds), by mechanical means (including insect and human activities), wind, water and rain. Some weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management may include use of certified clean propagation material, fungicides, crop rotation and use of cultivars with reduced
susceptibility. Biocontrol with _Trichoderma_ has been shown to be promising for some of the fungi.

However, at present there is no effective control method for capsicum internal fruit rots that is suitable for growers. The research project reported above will provide information on which pathogens are involved and which factors lead to high disease incidence in Australia. The project will thus enable the design of specific management strategies for these scenarios, but it will also contribute to the scientific knowledge about the pathogens overall.
