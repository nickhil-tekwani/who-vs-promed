All cooling towers in the affected area have been disinfected. [There have been] no new illnesses related to the outbreak since 3 Aug [2015], longer than the 2-week incubation period of Legionnaires' disease.

The New York City Health Department's Public Health Laboratory, in close coordination with the State's Wadsworth Center Laboratory and the CDC, today announced that they had identified the source of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in the South Bronx and declared the outbreak over. After extensive sampling of cooling towers and testing of _Legionella_ bacteria, the laboratories have matched the _Legionella_ strain found in the Opera House Hotel cooling tower with the strain found in patients.

Epidemiologic and environmental investigations by the Health Department further support the conclusion that this cooling tower was the source of the outbreak. The Health Department continues to investigate the circumstances that led this cooling tower to become the outbreak source; inadequate maintenance and inadequate levels of biocide may have contributed. The hotel has cooperated fully with all agencies involved in the investigation, has cleaned and disinfected its tower, and is working with the Health Department on long-term maintenance that is consistent with industry standards.

Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett was joined at the city's Public Health Laboratory by Dr. Jay Varma, Deputy Commissioner for Disease Control and the Incident Commander for this outbreak, and Dr. Jennifer Rakeman, Assistant Commissioner and Director of the City's Public Health Lab.

[The final number of cases in the South Bronx outbreak of Legionnaires' disease is "more than 120", including 12 deaths, since early July 2015 (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/nyregion/health-officials-declare-end-of-legionnaires-outbreak-in-the-bronx.html?_r=0). All cooling towers positive for _Legionella_ in the affected area have been disinfected, and no new cases have been reported since early August 2015.

A map of the South Bronx that shows the location of cases and positive cooling towers can be found at: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/nyregion/death-toll-from-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-bronx-rises-to-12.html.

Presumably the New York City Department of Health (DOH)'s news release is referring to genotyping, when it says that _Legionella_ isolates from the Opera House Hotel cooling tower "match" isolates from patients. The NYS DOH Wadsworth Center Laboratories in Albany, New York tested more than 100 samples from cooling towers in the Bronx, of which 6 cooling towers tested positive for _Legionella_ contamination, and the lab performed genotyping to determine whether the same strain of _Legionella_ that was present in a cooling tower was identical to the genotype of isolates from patients (https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-free-legionella-testing-eligible-buildings-across-new-york-state).

We are not told, however, the _Legionella_ species involved in the outbreak. Nor are we told: how many patients had _Legionella_ isolated from sputum; how many patients had the same _Legionella_ species isolated; how many patient isolates had the same genotype (a common source would be suggested for a cluster of patients having the same genotype); how many patient isolates' genotype matched the Opera House Hotel cooling tower isolate; what were the species of _Legionella_ isolated from the other "positive" cooling towers; and did the genotypes of _Legionella_ isolates from the other "positive" cooling towers match any clinical isolates. Information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
