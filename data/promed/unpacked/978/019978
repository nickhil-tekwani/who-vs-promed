2nd serological survey in migratory & resident birds in the Fish Lake
National Park/Rio Grande do Sul for detection of West Nile and other
viruses.
Francisco Anilton Alves Araujo - SVS/MS (Ministry of Health,
Brazil) et al. 2004
-----------------------------------------------
From 16-27 Nov 2003, during their North-South bird migration, shore
birds were captured and bled for West Nile Virus (WNV) serology, and
cloacal swabs were pooled and tested for virus isolation for
Newcastle disease and avian influenza viruses.
No evidence of the circulation of WNV was found by inoculation of infant mice
with 47 bird blood samples and 5 viscera. No antibodies to WNV, or to 19
other arboviruses, were detected in 131 bird sera tested by hemagglutination-
inhibition (HI). By the same HI test with the same antigens, 11 chicken, 8
domestic duck, and 4 horse sera were also negative.
172 cloacal swabs from 19 species of wild birds, and some vampire
bats _Desmodus rotundus_ [presumably caught in the same nets. -
Mod.JW], were combined into 9 pools (8-24 specimens per pool),
plus a pool from the 11 chickens and another from the 8 domestic
ducks. The domestic fowl, and the pool of bird swabs combined with
bat swabs, were all negative, but avian influenza viruses were
isolated from 4 pools of shore birds:
H2 strains from
- a pool of swabs from 29 birds of 5 species, including 2 migratory
_Sterna hirundo_ banded in the USA;
- a pool of swabs from 30 birds of 8 species.
H4 strains from:
- a pool of swabs from 24 birds of 4 species;
- a pool of swabs from 26 birds of 11 species.
All the positive pools contained a majority of swabs from 2 species
arriving from the USA: _Sterna hirundo_ and _Calidris fuscicollis_.

[15 haemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes of Influenza A
viruses have been isolated from birds; 6 (H) subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 &
H9) and 3 (N) subtypes (N1, N2 and N7) have been isolated in the past from
humans. - Mod.AS]
[This is probably typical of what to expect from migratory bird surveys on
the New World flyways. H2 has been isolated from humans on occasion, but not
H4 so far. A possible 16th H subtype from birds will shortly be described. -
