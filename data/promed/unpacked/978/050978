Increase in cases of ralstonia bacteremia associated with propofol in Australia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (TGA) is gathering information about cases with ralstonia bacteremia that are potentially related to administration of propofol.

A multijurisdictional investigation has identified 8 cases of ralstonia bacteremia with a common link to administration of propofol. The most recent Australian case was reported on 4 May 2014.

Investigations are ongoing. We look forward to hearing if colleagues in other countries have noticed any unusual increase in clinical isolations of ralstonia associated with propofol or other medical products or devices.

Health professionals, hospitals and health facilities are advised that batches of a widely used intravenous anaesthetic drug, propofol, may include some vials that have been contaminated with the bacteria _Ralstonia pickettii_. There have been reports of patients having developed sepsis following administration of 1 per cent propofol injection.

In consultation with the TGA, the Australian distributor of Provive MCT-LCT per cent (propofol 1 per cent) emulsion for injection in 20 ml vials (ARTG 162318), AFT Pharmaceuticals, has quarantined 2 batches due to potential contamination with _Ralstonia pickettii_. The affected batch numbers are:
A030906 (expiry date 08/15)
A030907 (expiry date 08/15).

At this time, no batches of any of the drugs listed below are subject to a recall.

As a precautionary measure, health professionals are advised, where possible, to avoid use of all sizes and all batches of the AFT-distributed Provive and Sandoz Propofol 1 per cent products as listed below pending further investigation into this issue:

ARTG: ARTG Label
118940: Claris Lifesciences Australia Pty Ltd PROVIVE 1 per cent propofol 1000mg/100mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
118938: Claris Lifesciences Australia Pty Ltd PROVIVE 1 per cent propofol 200mg/20mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
162319: PROVIVE MCT-LCT 1 per cent propofol 500mg/50mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
118939: Claris Lifesciences Australia Pty Ltd PROVIVE 1 per cent propofol 500mg/50mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
162320: PROVIVE MCT-LCT 1 per cent propofol 1000mg/100mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
162318: PROVIVE MCT-LCT 1 per cent propofol 200mg/20mL emulsion for injection vial (distributed by AFT)
148870: PROPOFOL SANDOZ propofol 200mg/20mL emulsion for injection vial
148872: PROPOFOL SANDOZ propofol 1000mg/100mL emulsion for injection vial
148871: PROPOFOL SANDOZ propofol 500mg/50mL emulsion for injection vial

Hospitals should consider seeking alternative sources of propofol 1 per cent to the drugs listed above. Where there are no suitable alternatives, health professionals should satisfy themselves that the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.

_Ralstonia pickettii_ are Gram negative bacteria. It may take several days for a blood culture to become positive and may be difficult for a laboratory to identify. Possible initial identifications include _Stenotrophomonas_, _Burkholderia_, and _Pseudomonas_ species of bacteria.

This medicine is only used in hospitals and certain health facilities. Hospitals and health facilities have been contacted and provided further information about this issue, including details of the quarantine process. If you have any questions or concerns about this issue, talk to your health professional.

TGA investigations
------------------
The TGA is working with state and territory health departments to gather further information regarding the reported cases of sepsis and to identify the specific organism(s) suspected of causing the infection. In particular, the TGA is investigating the strength of the evidence linking these propofol products with the reported cases of sepsis.

As part of these investigations, the TGA is testing samples of the affected batches for microbial quality. This testing includes performing sterility and bacterial endotoxin tests on the products. Results from the sterility testing will not be available for 2-3 weeks due to the prolonged incubation period for this test and the nature of the product. The bacterial endotoxin test is a quicker test, but is limited in that it only detects a component of some bacterial cells. Preliminary results from this test to date do not indicate the presence of bacterial endotoxin. The TGA is also carefully examining the manufacturing site data to identify relevant information.

Reporting problems
------------------
Consumers and health professionals are encouraged to report problems with medicines or vaccines. Your report will contribute to the TGA's monitoring of these products. The TGA cannot give advice about an individual's medical condition. You are strongly encouraged to talk with a health professional if you are concerned about a possible adverse event associated with a medicine or vaccine.

This is an update to the chief health officer alert dated 2 May 2014 for Suspected contamination of "Provive" propofol. A number of people across Australia have developed septicaemia due to _Ralstonia_ species with a common link of having been administered Provive propofol in April 2014. Further investigations are being undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to determine the cause of sepsis and the strength of evidence linking propofol products with reported cases.

The TGA recommendation to quarantine the 2 suspect batches of propofol remains. At this time, no batches of any of the drugs listed below are subject to a recall. Hospitals should quarantine stock of Provive and Sandoz propofol products and continue to seek alternatives to Provive and Sandoz propofol products until further notice. Maintain a high index of suspicion in all febrile patients following intravenous sedation or anaesthesia. Report any potential cases of sepsis following administration of Provive propofol to the TGA and the Department of Health.

_Ralstonia pickettii_ is a rare infection. It is a Gram negative organism that has been linked in the past to contamination of medical therapeutic agents. Concern was raised when this organism was identified in 3 South Australian patients who had procedures in April 2014. The only common exposure was the administration of Provive propofol during their procedures.

Five cases of septicaemia due to _Ralstonia_ species where Provive propofol was also administered were subsequently identified in Queensland (4) and Victoria (1). Additional cases of septicaemia due to _Ralstonia_ species have also been identified where there was no link to propofol administration.

The TGA is working with state and territory health departments to gather further information regarding the reported cases of sepsis and to identify the specific organism(s) suspected of causing the infection. In particular, the TGA is investigating the strength of the evidence linking these propofol products with the reported cases of sepsis.

As part of these investigations, the TGA is testing samples of the suspect batches for microbial quality. This testing includes performing sterility and bacterial endotoxin tests on the products. Results from the sterility testing will not be available for 2-3 weeks due to the prolonged incubation period for this test and the nature of the product. The TGA is also carefully examining the manufacturing site data to identify relevant information.

All patients undergoing anaesthesia or sedation involving the suspected batches of propofol are potentially at risk. Affected persons have developed rapid onset of fever and signs of septicaemia following medical procedures involving the suspected batches of propofol. Some have required admission to intensive care.

Medical practitioners should avoid using the following batches of propofol: Provive MCT-LCT 1 per cent 20 ml vials, batches A030906 Exp. 08/15, and A030907 Exp. 08/15 because of the potential risk of septicaemia. As a precaution it is recommended that all practitioners avoid using all Provive propofol products. Because the same manufacturer and supplier are used by Sandoz, clinicians should also avoid the use of Sandoz propofol products. Hospitals should seek alternatives to these brands.

Sandoz and Provive propofol products should only be used where there is no suitable alternative and consideration is given to the benefit relative to the risk to the patient.

Hospitals and other treatment facilities should check their stocks of propofol for the identified products and quarantine these immediately.

Maintain a high index of suspicion in all febrile patients following intravenous sedation or anaesthesia.

For any suspected case, consider the following actions: take blood cultures; check whether there was an exposure to a product of concern; seek advice from an Infectious Diseases physician. If you become aware of any potential cases of sepsis following administration of Provive propofol, contact the TGA at <adr.reports@tga.gov.au> or on 1800 044 114. Notify suspected cases immediately to the Communicable Disease Prevention and Control section at the Department of Health on 1300 651 160.

[Propofol is a short-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic/amnestic agent that is used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is approved for use in more than 50 countries, and generic versions are available.

Although it may contain antimicrobial agents (EDTA, sodium metabisulfite, or benzyl alcohol), propofol is a soybean oil emulsion that can still support the rapid growth of microorganisms (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm125817.htm). Microbial contamination, however, may not be readily appreciated because its intravenous preparation has a milky highly opaque appearance.

In 1995, an outbreak that involved 62 patients with post-operative infections caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Candida albicans_, _Moraxella osloensis_, _Enterobacter agglomerans_, or _Serratia marcescens_ at 7 hospitals in 4 states over a several year period was traced to contaminated propofol (http://www.aulaindice.com/curso_infecciones_asociadas/pdf/P21_contaminacion_propofol.pdf). In 2007, the US FDA cited several clusters of patients who experienced chills, fever, and body aches shortly after receiving propofol for sedation or general anesthesia and noted that some facilities where the propofol was administered used single-patient use vials of propofol for more than one patient.

The FDA recommended that healthcare professionals who administer propofol carefully follow the recommendations in the product labeling: To minimize the potential for bacterial contamination when using propofol for general anesthesia or procedural sedation, both the vial and prefilled syringe formulations must be used on only one patient; administration must commence immediately after the vial or syringe has been opened; and administration from a single vial or syringe must be completed within six hours of opening; ICU sedation with propofol administered directly from a vial must be limited to only one patient, must commence immediately on opening the vial, and must be completed within 12 hours of opening the vial to minimize the risk of product contamination.

In 2009, lots of propofol were recalled in the US because of contamination with bacterial endotoxin after 41 propofol-treated patients were reported to have experienced postoperative fever, chills, and other flu-like symptoms (http://www.medpagetoday.com/ProductAlert/Prescriptions/15134). In 2010, sepsis due to _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Serratia marcescens, which developed in 7 patients in the Netherlands following relatively minor surgical procedures, was attributed to contaminated propofol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170564 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20692067).

ProMED-mail previously posted a report of nosocomial transmission of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus that involved reuse of syringes to re-dose patients, which contaminated a single-use vial of propofol that was used for multiple subsequent patients undergoing endoscopy (see Hepatitis B & C, physician-related cluster - USA 20100713.2350).

_Ralstonia pickettii_ (formerly called _Pseudomonas pickettii_ or _Burkholderia pickettii_) are nonfermentative Gram negative rod-shaped bacteria that grow well in moist environments such as soils, river and lakes. (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/5/1281.full). They are emerging nosocomial pathogens, causing infection in compromised hosts, which have been attributed to contaminated solutions such as water, saline, and sterile drugs. These solutions are usually contaminated when the product is manufactured, due to the fact that _R. pickettii_ have the ability to pass through 0.2 micron filters that are used to sterilize medicinal products (http://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/doc/propor-lr-micron-pes-filters-0001). Infections include bacteremia/septicemia, meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16337309). - Mod.ML
