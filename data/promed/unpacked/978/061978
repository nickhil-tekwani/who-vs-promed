[The monthly update includes earlier, accumulated information addressing MERS CoV in humans and animals. Information added or changed since the previous update (27 Sep 2017) appears in red. The following excerpts are the new/added (red) text of items addressing MERS-CoV in animals. - Mod.AS]

1. Countries with published animal findings (serology and/or virology):

Burkina Faso (newly added) [see comment].

2. Recent publications:

This research discusses the role of camels in the evolution of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis was undertaken on 219 camel and human MERS-CoV genome sequences available in GenBank. It showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade A and B, respectively, with clade A further divided into lineage A1 (3 human strains) and lineage A2 (2 camel strains), and clade B divided into lineages B1 to B6 (each containing both human and camel strains). Recombination analysis showed potential recombination events in 5 strains from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia [The abstract included also the following: "The time of the most recent common ancestor of all MERS-CoV was dated to approximately 2010." - Mod.AS].

Cross-sectional study of MERS-CoV-specific RNA and antibodies in animals that have had contact with MERS patients in Saudi Arabia. J Infect Public Health. 2017 Oct 6. pii: S1876-0341(17)30257-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jiph.2017.09.022. [Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993171].

The study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia during the last 3 years (2014-2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected and examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 10 MERS-CoV camel isolates was performed. The findings of this study indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoV and an important source of human infection with MERS.

[According to the above update, Burkina Faso has been added to the list of countries with published animal findings (serology and/or virology). The other countries in the said FAO list are: Spain (Canary Islands), Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), Tunisia, United Arab Emirates.

The information on MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in Burkina Faso was included in a recent paper dealing with Morocco, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia (Ref 1). Its abstract included the following:

"To identify risk factors for MERS-CoV infection in camels bred in diverse conditions in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Morocco, blood samples and nasal swabs were sampled in February-March 2015. A relatively high MERS-CoV RNA rate was detected in Ethiopia (up to 15.7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 8.2-28.0), followed by Burkina Faso (up to 12.2 percent; 95 percent CI: 7-20.4) and Morocco (up to 7.6 percent; 95 percent CI: 1.9-26.1). The RNA detection rate was higher in camels bred for milk or meat than in camels for transport (p = 0.01) as well as in younger camels (p = 0.06). High seropositivity rates (up to 100 percent; 95 percent CI: 100-100 and 99.4 percent; 95 percent CI: 95.4-99.9) were found in Morocco and Ethiopia, followed by Burkina Faso (up to 84.6 percent; 95 percent CI: 77.2-89.9). Seropositivity rates were higher in large/medium herds (51 camels or more) than small herds (p = 0.061), in camels raised for meat or milk than for transport (p = 0.01), and in nomadic or sedentary herds than in herds with a mix of these lifestyles (p less than 0.005)."

The dromedary camel population of West African Burkina Faso (map at http://www.questconnect.org/images/westafricamap2.gif) is about 18 500 (FAO statistics, 2014). Burkina Faso borders on its north and east Mali and Niger, countries with considerable camel populations (see further).

Nearly 2/3 of the world's camel population are in the arid areas of Africa, particularly in East Africa, i.e. Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somalia holds the highest dromedary camel population with over 7 million head followed closely by Sudan (4.7 million), Kenya (2.9 million), Niger (1.7 million), Mauritania (1.4 million) and Mali (1.0 million).

According to ref 2, MERS-CoV genomes were detected in nasal swabs of dromedaries in UAE, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan and Qatar. MERS-CoV has not been reported so far by Israel; a confirmation of the said by Israeli authorities will be appreciated. In case affirmative, any available details, even partial/preliminary, including locations, dates, tests, results and the identity of the performing lab(s) will be appreciated.
