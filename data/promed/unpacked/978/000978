From: Martyn Edelsten <martyne@vet.ed.ac.uk>

The report of an outbreak of suspected anthrax in the Afar region of
Ethiopia reminds me of the sort of information which was circulating in
ProMED-mail two to three years ago, following the heavy rains in the Horn
of Africa. There was a lot of speculation about possible causes of
mortality in man and animals based on the limited information available.
Anthrax was mentioned several times but later discounted. Rift Valley fever
was eventually attributed as the most important disease present.
The point I would like to make is that, it should not be necessary to
speculate about anthrax for very long in such situations i.e. where
multiple deaths in animals and man have been reported and preliminary
investigations have obviously been carried out. It should be possible to
confirm or refute a suspicion of anthrax within a few minutes, by
examination of blood or tissue smears taken near the point of death or post
mortem. All you need is some Giemsa or equivalent stain and a basic
microscope. Such facilities must surely be available in the area (there was
a reference to a mission hospital being involved). If smears from several
cases are negative, one can be pretty certain that it is not anthrax, The
focus then turns to other diseases, which may not be so easy to confirm.
In the current outbreak, it would be very informative to know what the
results of basic tests for anthrax were. Negative results can be as
informative in the early stages of these investigations as positive results.

[Martyn is right of course. Few diseases are as easy to diagnose as anthrax
using a blood smear, stains, and a field microscope. Unfortunately few
veterinarians or field veterinary services seem to have a microscope or
Giemsa or Loeffler stains any more. Would any member belonging to Medicins
sans Frontier, who are working in this area, care to comment on the present
situation in Afar and on the confirmation or otherwise of the extensive
deaths described there?

One should also point out, as Martyn has indicated, that RVF follows rains
as it is a mosquito borne infection with some 20 species of mosquito
identified as possible vectors; in that part of Africa _Aedes caballus_,
_Ae. lineatopennis_, and _Culex theileri_ have been identified as vectors.
News and TV reports indicate that the area is suffering from a severe
drought. - Mod.MHJ
