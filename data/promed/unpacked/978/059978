Cryptosporidium strikes 57 people
--------------------------------------------
Nearly 60 people have been struck down by an Ulster water-borne outbreak, it
emerged today. Health officials say tests confirm a number of people living
in different parts of Belfast have an infection caused by the
cryptosporidium parasite.
A joint probe between the Eastern Health Board, environmental health
departments and the Water Service is already under way. And yesterday Health
Minister, Bairbre de Brun, announced the establishment of an 'outbreak
control team' to investigate the rise.
New figures show there have been 57 confirmed cases since the end of
February [2000. But the source remains a mystery. A health board spokesman
said: "This is a higher figure than might normally occur at this time of
year. Unlike the outbreak in September last year [2000, the people who have
become ill do not live within a localised geographic or water distribution
(area)."
In September [2000 around 121 people were infected and thousands living in
areas including Lisburn, Poleglass and Dunmurry were affected by
restrictions. Health officials are advising those most susceptible to
infection, such as chemotherapy and transplant patients or those with
"severely impaired immunity", to boil their water.
Regional Development Minister, Gregory Campbell, said: "I recognise that the
public water supply must be investigated, as well as other possible sources
such as swimming pools, food and contact with farm animals. I have therefore
instructed my officials to continue to provide all possible help and
assistance to the board."
The Water Service has tested water supply and to date all the results have
been satisfactory. It will also investigate the water treatment and
distribution system. "The protection of public health remains my first
priority and we will do everything we can to help," he added. "Customers can
be assured water remains safe to use and drink in the normal way."
_Cryptosporidium_ is a parasite found in man and animals which can be
transmitted by water supplies. It causes illness and is potentially fatal in
the elderly, very young and those in poor health. It can take up to 12 days
to incubate before someone shows symptoms of illness. That means the total
number of confirmed cases may [yet rise.
Health officials are urging people to minimise the risk of becoming infected
by "good personal hygiene" such as washing hands before preparing food.

[Cryptosporidium is a recurrent problem in areas where the source of the
drinking water is surface water. A can be seen prom previous ProMED reports
on outbreaks in the UK of cryptosporidosis, the infections occurs at regular
intervals. - Mod.EP
