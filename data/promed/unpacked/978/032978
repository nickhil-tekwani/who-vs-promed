Indiana resident is state's 2nd rabies death in 50 years
--------------------------------------------------------
State health officials say a southern Indiana resident is the 1st
person to die of rabies in the state since 2006 -- and only the 2nd
human case overall since 1959.

The victim was from Clark County and had not reported any exposures
of concern. Dr James Howell says it usually takes about 1 to 3 months
for a victim to show signs of the disease. Once that happens, his or
her prognosis is usually fatal.

Testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates
the source of the Clark County infection was a bat.

Rabies is a virus that attacks the brain and nervous system. It is
estimated 55 000 people die worldwide from rabies each year.

[This report does not identify the species of bat responsible for
transmission of rabies virus in this case. Previously, on 30 Sep
2006, a 10-year-old girl in Indiana was bitten by a bat and
subsequently died on 2 Nov 2006, despite treatment by the Wisconsin
protocol. This was only the 2nd death from rabies virus infection in
Indiana since 1959.

After genetic sequencing of amplicons obtained from the patient's
skin and saliva, on 14 Oct 2006, the infecting agent was identified
as a rabies virus variant associated with the silver-haired bat,
_Lasionycteris noctivagans_ (for details see MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly
Rep 20 Apr 2007; 56(15); 361-5; available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a1.htm>.)

It may be that the same species of bat was responsible for the
transmission of rabies virus in the current case. However, several
species of insectivorous bats are able to transmit rabies virus in
North America. An exhaustive and up-to-date account of bat rabies in
North America and worldwide has been prepared by the USGS National
Wildlife Health Center: Bat Rabies and Other Lyssavirus Infections.
