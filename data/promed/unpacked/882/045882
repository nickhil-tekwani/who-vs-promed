In the neighborhood of Santa Maria de Gracia, Murcia, Spain, 151 people
have been affected by pneumonia, 120 of whom are hospitalized, with 2 in
the Intensive Care Unit. A 65-year-old man from the same area has died of
pneumonia and the final diagnosis is still pending. The first cases were
detected last week.
[A representative of the local health authority, Francisco Marques, said
to the press that _Legionella pneumophila_ was found in 53 out of 96 cases
analyzed. Refrigeration towers and public [water? sources are being
inspected for the presence of the bacteria. Tap water has been analyzed and
found safe to drink. Since 1990, 54 outbreaks of legionellosis have been
detected in Spain, affecting a total of 805 people, and 1358 sporadic cases
have been confirmed since 1997. In the last 5 years more than a dozen
outbreaks have been detected throughout Spain.
Since 1999, 4 outbreaks have affected 160 people in Alcoy, and the number
of cases continues to rise. The local health authority stated that there
are multiple sources of infection and blames the extent of the epidemic on
the generation of aerosols.
In the year 2000 [alone Girona had 32 cases, 3 of whom died. Barcelona
[had 48 [cases with one [mortality. Vigo [had 30 with 4 dead and Alcala
de Henares 249 with 11 dead.
This year cases have been diagnosed in Zaragoza (3 cases in March);
Valencia (1 case in February); Sagunto, Valencia (1 case in February);
Elche, Alicante (1 case in February) and Navarra (2 in January).
