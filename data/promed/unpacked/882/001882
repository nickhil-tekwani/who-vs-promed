A highly contagious African swine fever [ASF] virus has been detected in the luggage of a traveler from Shanghai at Tokyo's Haneda airport, the farm ministry said Friday [9 Nov 2018].

Pork-filled dumplings brought by the traveler on 14 Oct 2018 have tested positive for the virus, becoming the 2nd case of the virus brought to Japan from overseas.

The disease was reported in China in August [2018], while no domestic infections in Japan have been reported so far.

ASF is regarded as more lethal than [classical] swine fever, also known as hog cholera, and there is no effective vaccine to protect pigs from the deadly disease.

According to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, the dumplings were homemade and uncooked. Both African and classical swine fevers pose no direct threat to human health.

In September [2018], hog cholera infection was confirmed among domestic pigs in Japan for the 1st time in 26 years, in the central Japan city of Gifu.

It is unlikely that food infected with the ASF virus will cause an outbreak unless pigs are fed with infected food.

[This is the 2nd reported case of ASF-contaminated pork products introduced by air travelers from China into Japan. The 1st case involved a traveler from Beijing arriving on 1 Oct 2018 at a Hokkaido airport, with about 1.5 kg [3.3 lb] of sausages that were confiscated and tested. The sausages were found to be ASF contaminated, as published about 3 weeks later.

Japan experienced in September 2018 the reoccurrence -- after an absence of 26 years -- of another porcine viral disease, namely classical swine fever (CSF). The introduced virus infected wild boars as well as one single pig farm in Gifu. It was identified as CSF virus strain genotype 2, subgenotype 2.1, found closely related to strains Mongolia/2014a and China/2015. It can be speculated that the virus was introduced in contaminated pork product(s) that found their way to wild boar, which were the source of infection on a farm. Nine wild boars were found within a 10 km [6.2 mi] radius of the affected farm: 7 of them live-captured and 2 found dead. The outbreak on the farm was eradicated by stamping out, disinfection, and movement restrictions in a 3 km [about 1.9. mi] radius. There was no spread to other farms; 28 days after the completion of full implementation of control measures, namely on 19 Oct 2018, the movement restrictions were lifted. The local government of Gifu prefecture confirmed all of the cases as CSF positive by PCR.

Summary of the wild boar surveillance (included in Japan's follow-up report no. 4, dated 9 Oct 2018): Gifu prefecture has been conducting CSF testing of dead/captured wild boars since 13 Sep 2018. As of 9 Oct 2018, 130 wild boars had been tested, of which 19 were found CSF positive and the rest (111) negative. In the other 29 prefectures, 68 wild boars were tested, and all were found to be CSF negative.

The CSF event may be viewed as a drill for an unfortunate future introduction of ASF virus, most likely by contaminated pork products, and indicative for the possible role of wild boar in its epidemiology. Swill feeding is not widely used in Japan, while its use is liable to heat treatment. According to our information, any byproducts and former foodstuffs containing animal origin protein must undergo heat treatment of at least 30 minutes at [70 deg C/158 deg F] or 3 minutes or more at [80 deg C/176 deg F].

On 4 Oct 2018, Japan's Journal of Veterinary Medical Science (published by the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science) released an advance online publication of the paper "A rapid risk assessment of African swine fever introduction and spread in Japan based on expert opinions" (Ref 1). The abstract follows:

"A rapid risk assessment was conducted using a questionnaire composed of 10 questions asking experts in African swine fever (ASF) to identify and rank the potential risk factors associated with the introduction and spread of ASF in Japan. The experts participating in this risk assessment considered illegal food import, followed by transport routes and foreign workers, to be the most relevant pathway of ASF introduction into Japan. Kanto and Kyushu were identified as the most likely regions for ASF introduction. All experts agreed that China is the most likely source of ASF introduction into Japan. Most Japanese experts were of the view that the risk of ASF spread, if introduced into Japan, would be low, while foreign experts considered the risk to be moderate or high. Most experts answered that wild boars would play an important role in the persistence of ASF if the disease were to spread in Japan."
