Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------
[The following updated figures have been extracted from the Resumen
Epidemiologico file accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus
Activity in Mexico.
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls> - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 9 Dec 2004, the cumulative total of human tests carried out in
Mexico remains at 387, and no additional seropositive individuals have been
detected: i.e. in total, 387 individuals resident in 29 of the 32 states
have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection; 386 were
seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of Sonora
exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - Equines
--------------------------
As of Thu 9 Dec 2004, a total of 3523 horses from 31 (reduced by one) of
the 32 states had been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of
these animals, 2500 were seronegative and 1023 (29 percent) were
seropositive. All the seropositive animals were asymptomatic. These figures
represent an additional 129 animals tested since Thu 2 Dec 2004, 172 of
which were seropositive.
Cumulative totals - Birds
--------------------------
As of Thu 3 Dec 2004, the number of birds tested remains unchanged at 4940
(given wrongly as 44 940 previously) since the update of Thu 4 Nov 2004.
These birds were collected from 8 of the 32 states and have been tested for
evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds, 4750 were
seronegative and 188 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic),
and one case in the state of Sonora, and one case in the state of Baja
California, exhibited signs of disease. (Initially, both birds appear to
have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive birds were
detected in the states of Baja California, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro,
Sonora, and Yucatan.

Equine Cases of West Nile Virus Infection in 2004
-------------------------------------------------
Details of the numbers and distribution of equine cases in the United
States during 2004 up to 10 Dec 2004 can be obtained by accessing the
APHIS-USDA map: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/wnv/map2004.html>.
As of 10 Dec 2004, the total number of equine cases recorded in the United
States in 2004 is 1341. This represents an increase of 36 cases since the
previous total updated on 18 Nov 2004.
California heads the list with 536 cases (41 percent of the total),
followed by Texas with 115 cases, Arizona with 113, Nevada with 86,
Louisiana with 46, Mississippi with 42 and the remainder with 32 or fewer
cases.
[The following 12 states have not reported cases in 2004: Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. - Mod.CP]

Louisiana: West Nile Virus-infected Bird Found at Latest Recorded Date
---------------------------------------------------
In the latest-ever case yet, health officials this week pinpointed a
cardinal in Iberia Parish with "a lot of the West Nile virus" in its
system, Glenn Stokes of Mosquito Control Contractors said on Wed 22 Dec
2004. And for the first time, Stokes, a [professional] medical
entomologist, labeled the mosquito-borne West Nile virus "endemic", meaning
it is here to stay year-round, though humans are becoming less susceptible.
"We have fewer deaths and fewer human cases, but that's because there is
immunity that is being conferred to the general population and birds," he
said. "Birds become immune for life. People become immune for life."
Birds are the natural reservoir of West Nile virus on a global scale,
Stokes said. Louisiana's total count for the year is just less than what
occurred last year about this time, when officials reported 117 cases. But
what worries officials about the cardinal's positive test for West Nile
virus is that this is also the latest the potentially fatal virus, which
first hit Acadiana in 2002, has been found. "One time it was an occasional
case every month, and now it's every week, depending on how hard you look
for it," Stokes said. "By endemic we mean it is embedded in the environment
and is here to stay as a recurring disease." An epidemic, on the other
hand, is "an explosive spread" of a disease. A West Nile epidemic occurred
in Louisiana in 2002, he said, as well as up the Mississippi (River) fly-way.
When St. Louis encephalitis was diagnosed in 1999, officials would start
looking for it from June through October. Now, that disease, equine
encephalitis and West Nile all will have to be an ongoing concern. West
Nile, a new [cause of] mosquito-borne encephalitis diseases, emanated from
New York. Other states are finding a similar entrenchment of West Nile,
Stokes said.
In the latest case from Iberia Parish, 4 wild birds -- a robin, a cedar
waxwing, a blue jay and a cardinal -- were brought in on 13 Dec 2004. All
had died for no apparent reason. The one that tested positive, the
cardinal, was from the center of the city in Hilltop Circle. The cold snap
expected for tonight and the next few days does not kill mosquitoes, it
just sends them into hiding, Stokes said. "The myth is that cold weather
kills them," he said. "It does not." When temperatures go below 50,
mosquitoes' [flight] muscles won't work, which is why most people associate
flying insects with summer months. This is a continuing saga and we're
learning more and more," Stokes said.
Lafayette's 1st human West Nile case in 2 years was reported to the state
Department of Health and Hospitals earlier this month. 7 people, ages
ranging 63 to 88, have died from West Nile in Louisiana this year. The
disease, spread to humans through mosquito bites, usually affects older
people. Stokes' company has a contract to spray for the disease in
Lafayette, St. Mary and Iberia parishes. Also, Stokes said he spoke to St.
Martin Parish President Guy Cormier, whom Stokes said is looking to begin
spraying again early next year.
