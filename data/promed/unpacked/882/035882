Authorities from the [Panama] Ministry of Health (MINSA) confirmed the death of a 55-year-old patient from [a] hantavirus [infection] in Herrera province.

The victim resided on a farm in Paris, Parita district, and was hospitalized this past 6 Dec [2014] in the Cecilio Castillero Hospital in Chitre, and was later taken on 8 Dec [2014] to the Santo Tomas Hospital, where she was in intensive care and died yesterday afternoon [9 Dec 2014].

MINSA reported that this afternoon, personnel from the Vectors [unit] of Herrera Regional [Health] will go to the place where the patient resided [presumably to carry out epidemiological investigations].

[This is the same patient that was reported by ProMED-mail on 10 Dec 2014 (archive no. 20141210.3025600) as having been hospitalized in intensive care in the Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City. Unfortunately, she died there. In that report, the Herrera Regional Health Director, Alcibiades Dominguez, confirmed that the patient remained with a guarded prognosis and added that [field] investigations were being carried out and [rodent] traps placed.

Although not specified in the report above or the previous one, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama. The number of reported cases of Choclo virus infection in Los Santos province continues to increase, and now there are 2 cases in Herrera province counting this one. The Azuero region is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg and in the report at the above URL.

Authorities of the Los Santos provincial Ministry of Health confirmed a new positive case of [a] hantavirus [infection], acquired in Canas, in Tonosi [district].

The patient is a 41-year-old woman who is in stable condition, and currently is not intubated [mechanical respiration - Mod.TY], and now she is recuperating in a ward in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas.

The patient was admitted this past 10 Jan [2014, or 10 Dec 2014?] after having presented with the symptoms [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?] at the rural hospital in Tonosi.

[The date of 10 Jan 2014 for the patient's hospital admission must be incorrect. It is difficult to imagine that she has been hospitalized for 11 months with a Choclo virus infection. Los Santos province has reported the most Choclo virus infections this year (2014). The virus is endemic there in the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_). - Mod.TY]
