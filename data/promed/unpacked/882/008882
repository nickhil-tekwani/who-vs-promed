Health experts say there are more cases of hepatitis A in the state. The Louisiana Department of Health now has the count at 575. Livingston Parish has the most cases ranging from 121 to 240. One death has been reported so far in Louisiana.

Hepatitis A is a contagious viral liver infection easily spread through close contact with an infected person.

There are vaccines to combat the infection. You can get one at your doctor's office or parish health unit. The Louisiana Department of Health has a list of resources for anyone with questions about hepatitis A.

The number of Hepatitis A cases in Muskingum County has reached 50 since the 1st local case was reported in November [2018], according to the Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department.

The Ohio Department of Health [ODOH] declared a statewide community outbreak of the disease in June 2018 after observing an increase in hepatitis A cases. Since [5 Jan 2018] the number of cases in Ohio has reached 3340, as of [30 Sep 2019] according to ODOH data, with 16 deaths related to the outbreak.

Hepatitis A is a liver disease that spreads when a person ingests fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts, according to ODOH. Common ways the disease is spread include close contact with an infected person, or contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by the stool of an infected person. Symptoms of the disease include nausea, fever, abdominal pain, fatigue and jaundice. People with the disease can experience mild illness lasting a few weeks to severe illness lasting several months.

Muskingum County ranks 20th in number of cases in the state, despite ranking 31st in population. Jack Butterfield, director of the local health department, said there isn't one particular reason Muskingum County is experiencing a slightly higher than average rate of cases.

Butterfield said infected individuals will experience typical symptoms of an intestinal virus before the primary indicator of hepatitis A -- a yellowing of the skin called jaundice -- occurs. Infected individuals will be contagious for about two weeks prior to experiencing jaundice, meaning infected individuals could spread the disease without knowing. Once jaundice sets in, contagiousness drops off dramatically, according to Butterfield.

"The cat's already out of the bag," he said. "But, in general, you don't return to school or return to work until the jaundice is resolving."

Common disease prevention measures such as hand washing and safe sex measures can help prevent contracting or spreading hepatitis A, but the best preventative measure, Butterfield said, is getting vaccinated. He said those interested in receiving the vaccine should first check with their primary care provider and local pharmacies.

The local health department also accepts appointments to provide the vaccine, which Butterfield said costs USD 85 and is covered by most insurances. For those uninsured, there's a funding program that brings the cost down to USD 30. The vaccine comes in 2 phases, and the 2nd phase should be received between 1 to 6 months after the 1st, Butterfield added.

The health department also provides the vaccine to at-risk groups, including visiting the jail to offer the vaccine to inmates. People who are homeless, use drugs, are or were recently incarcerated, men who have sex with men and those with chronic liver disease are at a higher risk of being infected with hepatitis A.

There is no anti-viral agent for hepatitis A, Butterfield said, so only the symptoms, not the disease itself, are treated upon discovery of the illness. Staying hydrated, getting rest, and maintaining a nutritious diet can help fight the symptoms of hepatitis A. Those with severe vomiting or diarrhea associated with the disease may seek additional medication for those symptoms, Butterfield said.

According to Butterfield, the state has seen a decrease in the number of new cases over recent months, likely due to increased awareness and attention to preventative measures.

"The most important and effective preventive measure is vaccination," he said. "And that vaccine is available for everyone."

The number of cases reported from Louisiana in [1] above is 30 additional cases than the CDC report posted on 23 Sep 2019 (Hepatitis A - USA (34): CDC 20190923.6689957), while Ohio state health department reported 3340 cases as of 30 Sep 2019.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable, communicable disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is usually transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or consumption of contaminated food or water.

The hepatitis A vaccine offers excellent protection against HAV. The vaccine is safe and highly effective. Vaccination consists of 2 doses of vaccine (shots) spaced 6-12 months apart. Protection starts 1-2 weeks after the first dose of vaccine, and lasts for 20 years to life after 2 doses.

However, the following preventive measures are recommended:
- good personal hygiene and proper sanitation help prevent the spread of the HAV virus. Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, and before preparing, serving, or eating food (alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill the hepatitis A virus);
- people who have hepatitis A should not be preparing or serving food, or caring for the elderly or for young children, until at least 2 weeks have passed since the 1st sign of hepatitis A illness;
- boiling or cooking food and drinks for at least 1 minute to 185 deg F (85 deg C) inactivates HAV. Foods and drinks heated to this temperature and for this length of time do not transmit HAV infection unless they become contaminated after heating. Travelers can lower their risk of hepatitis A (and other food-borne illnesses) in developing countries by drinking only water that has been boiled or chemically purified, by eating only foods that have been properly heated, and by avoiding fruits or vegetables that are not peeled or prepared by the traveler personally;
- adequate chlorination of water inactivates HAV.
