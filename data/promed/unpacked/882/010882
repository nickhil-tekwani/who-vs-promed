The demand for camel meat has decreased in Saudi Arabia since news
spread about the recent deaths of hundreds of camels, the Saudi
online daily Arab News reported. The reason behind the camels' death
has so far not been revealed, but it is suspected that they have died
from eating poisonous fodder.
Butchers selling camel meat and restaurants have expressed concern
that people were increasingly uninterested in buying camel meat, a
popular dish in the Kingdom. "I used to like it and I even used to
buy it daily. Now, however, I prefer to stay away from it to protect
my family's health," Sa'id Asiri, a Saudi citizen, told Arab News.
"Following the news, customers are no longer willing to buy camel
liver," says Abu Muhammad, who owns a shop specializing in camel
meat. Abu Muhammad blames the media, which according to him, "has
exaggerated the whole thing and frightened people" off buying camel products.

[Blaming the media will not remedy the marketing problem. If, more
than 2 weeks after the start of the mass-mortality in camels its
etiology remains obscure, the loss of appetite for camel meat is
justified, to say the least. Accomplished epidemiological and
toxicological investigation and the publication of the results by the
competent authorities, are the recommended means to pacify worried
consumers. And, one might add, to protect public and animal health. - Mod.AS]
