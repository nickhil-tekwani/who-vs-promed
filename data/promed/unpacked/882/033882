The [Brazilian] Ministry of Agriculture confirmed yesterday [31 Oct
2006] the occurrence of Newcastle disease in 46 poultry in Lambari
D'Oeste, in the southeast of Mato Grosso state. The suspected
outbreak was notified on 15 Aug 2006. Samples were sent to the
National Livestock Laboratory in Campinas (Sao Paulo state). The
pathogenicity index was 1.7, which is above the 0.7 limit established
by the World Animal Health Organization (OIE). [One wonders why the
long delay in lab diagnosis. - Mod.JW]
The outbreak in July 2006 in Rio Grande do Sul state resulted in a
ban on poultry imports by several countries, causing a drop in
exports of 8 percent for the first 6 months of 2006 compared with the
same period in 2005.
An outbreak is suspected in Jaraguari, Mato Grosso do Sul state, [in
October 2006], while other outbreaks have been reported from
Mosqueiro Island, near the mouth of the Amazon, in Para state, in
July 2006, and in the industrial district of Manaus, Amazonas state,
in August 2006.
To contain the Mato Grosso outbreak, 3km & 7km protection zones have
been established, and the transport of poultry and their products has
been restricted. Cleanup and disinfection is being done [presumably
following culling. - Mod.JW].
From January-September 2006 Mato Grosso state produced 35 671 tons
of poultry, corresponding to 1.8 percent of the total produced by
Brazil. But an industry source said "A focus of Newcastle disease is
bad for the export trade, because in Europe, clients see [only] that
there is Newcastle in Brazil, not [just] in Mato Grosso."

[This was only recently reported to the OIE. The delay in laboratory
testing is of concern, since early confirmation allows for more rapid
measures for controlling this easily transmitted disease. - Mod.TG]
