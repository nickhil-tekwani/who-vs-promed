Anthrax fears in northern provinces
-----------------------------------
Some mountainous northern provinces including Lai Chau, Dien Bien, and
Ha Giang have reported cases of the anthrax disease in recent months.

The Department of Preventive Medicines in Lai Chau has reported 25
anthrax cases in the districts of Than Uyen and Tam Duong. One 3 year
old toddler contracted the infection while one resident succumbed to
the disease.

People believe that the cause of the disease is exposure to infected
goats, cattle, sheep, and horses or by consuming products related to
them. Medical workers fret that it is difficult to eradicate the
disease because residents' have a nasty habit of exposing themselves
directly to infected ruminants during slaughter.

According to deputy health minister Trinh Quan Huan, anthrax can
infect humans in 3 ways. The commonest is through the skin, which
causes ugly sores that usually go away without treatment.

Dead carcasses of animals left to putrefy in open contaminated areas
can be a source of anthrax infestation. Carcasses need to be buried to
avoid the spread of the virus to live animals and subsequently to
humans.

[At a best guess the total number of cases in the area is now in
excess of 53 human cases; the previous report on 8 Aug 2011 had the
Lai Chau total at 12 cases. For a map showing the 3 affected
