Japan: New Measles Strain Strikes High School Students
-------------------------------------------------------
A group of mainly junior high school pupils have been confirmed as the
first large-scale outbreak of a lethal [no fatalities are mentioned in this
report. - Mod.CP] strain of measles, according to the National Center for
Contagious Diseases. Over 100 people were struck by the H-1 type measles in
February and March 2002. It is a rare strain of the disease that [appeared]
in Hong Kong some 3 years ago. Compounding fears about the strain, a large
swathe of those afflicted this year had been immunized against measles,
but the vaccination's effects had weakened over time.
"A new type of (measles) virus arose just as the immunity (provided by
vaccination) was weakening, causing the large-scale outbreak," a center
spokesman said. "People should actively pursue vaccination and be prepared
to be vaccinated again following a certain period of time." Ibaraki
Prefectural Government officials said that the new strain of measles was
detected in 109 people aged from a few months to 62. The large majority of
those afflicted, 78, were junior high school pupils. Of 86 pupils, a number
that includes those only suspected of having contracted the disease, 61 had
been vaccinated for the measles.
Center officials said that Japan is usually afflicted by 2 types of
measles, the D3 strain and D5 strain. However, they learned the strain that
broke out in Kitaibaraki was of type H1. Measles vaccinations are usually
performed somewhere between 12 and 90 months after birth. However, center
officials said that only about 80 percent of people undergo measles
vaccination. Recently, vaccinations have also developed a tendency to
weaken in effect over time. Much debate over health issues has been devoted
to repeat immunization. Some pupils affected by the outbreak of the new
measles virus had been vaccinated, but their symptoms were not as harsh as
those who had not been immunized.
Measles causes fever and rashes to break out, with severe cases leading to
encephalitis or pneumonia. The effects can often be greater if contracted
by an adult. Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare statistics show that of
the 35 302 reported cases of measles in Japan in 2001, those over 18
accounted for 925 instances. Of the 21 people who died through measles in
2001, 10 were 18 or over.

[Wild-type measles viruses have been divided into 8 distinct genetic groups
(clades) according to the nucleotide sequences of their hemagglutinin and
nucleoprotein genes, with approximately 7 percent nucleotide variability
between the most distantly related viruses. There are 8 lineages or clades
designated A through H, and these are further subdivided into 21 genotypes.
Most lineages have worldwide distribution, but some have more limited
circulation. Wild-type viruses from China were found to be genetically
distinct and comprised the new clade of viruses, clade H. Liffick et al.
(Virus Res 2001 Sep;77(1):81-7) reported genetic characterization of
contemporary wild-type measles viruses from Vietnam and the People's
Republic of China and identified 2 genotypes within clade H. The Vietnamese
viruses differed from all of the Chinese viruses by at least 3.5 and 2.5
percent at the nucleotide level for the N and H genes, respectively. These
data indicated that clade H should be divided into 2 genotypes, with the
Chinese viruses placed in genotype H1 and the Vietnamese viruses in
genotype H2. The outbreak in Japan has been attributed to H1 type virus and
probably represents recent importation from China and subsequent spread due
to inadequate vaccine coverage. - Mod.CP]
