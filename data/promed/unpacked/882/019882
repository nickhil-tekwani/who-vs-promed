It would be interesting to know how these _Neospora_ abortion storms were diagnosed. Being vertically transmitted organisms, PCR on the fetus and serology on the dams only indicate the contact with the agent and, for PCR, the presence of the organism in the fetus. We also wonder if the fetuses were evaluated for the presence of BVDV [Bovine viral diarrhea virus], which in the past was present in aborted fetuses with _Neospora_.

The gold standard remains the complete histologic evaluation of the fetus to detect the suggestive and pathognomonic lesions within fetal brain, heart, skeletal muscle, tongue; often associated with nephritis, hepatitis and placentitis.

[Information on the techniques applied in Wales for the diagnosis of the described _Neospora_ abortions in cattle, as requested by Prof Del Piero, will be appreciated.

The following comments have been received from Prof Eugene Pipano, DVM, PhD, Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University, Israel:

1. If _Neospora caninum_ parasites are detected in the aborted fetuses they cannot be considered as commensal organism. _Neospora_ tachyzoites multiplying in the fetus always cause some degree of damage. The question remains whether the abortions were caused by _Neospora_ alone or by the concurrent effect of _Neospora_ and the BVD virus. Histopathological examination may contribute to the answer.

2. The statement: " ..._Neospora_ does not harm dogs..." is inexact. _Neospora caninum_ may cause in dogs neurological symptoms (paresis, paralysis, ataxia) myositis and numerous dermal cysts containing bradyzoites.

Drs. Del Piero and Pipano are gratefully acknowledged for their comments.

The following data on _Neospora_ control schemes in dairy farms, as applied in some countries, were presented in a 2016 review paper (Ref 1; references omitted).

1. Netherlands:
Approximately 4000 dairy farmers participate in a control programme that consists of regular quarterly bulk milk screening, serological investigation of the aborting dams, and progressive culling of seropositive cows. In herds with negative bulk milk tests and no abortion problems, testing of purchased stock is advised. If the bulk milk tests are negative but there are abortion cases, heifer calves of seropositive dams are tested and removed from the breeding stock if positive. In herds with positive bulk milk tests, individual testing of a representative sample of the herd (where there is no evidence of _N. caninum_ abortion cases) or the whole herd (if over 60 percent of aborting cows test seropositive) is undertaken to assess the within-herd seroprevalence. Herd-specific measures are adopted depending on within-herd seroprevalence and individual management choices.

2. Switzerland:
Bovine neosporosis is a notifiable disease subject to surveillance. Although veterinary diagnostic laboratories have an obligation to report any _N. caninum_ serological or molecular test conducted and its outcome, there is no national control program. When diagnosis of _N. caninum_ infection is confirmed in aborted foetuses and serologically in dams, serological testing of the whole herd is conducted, and selective breeding of _N. caninum_ seronegative animals is generally advised.

3. Israel:
No national control programme for bovine neosporosis. The Veterinary Services recommend serological testing of replacement stock before purchase. IFAT is routinely carried out although, in aborting animals, IgM titres are also measured. Given the high seroprevalence in dairy herds (about 40 percent), vaccination with live _N. caninum_ tachyzoites is currently being investigated as a possible option for controlling the impact of the disease.

4. UK and Ireland:
The self-regulatory body for cattle health schemes added bovine neosporosis to the panel of non-statutory diseases of cattle whose control programs have been standardised to obtain high health certifications (https://www.checs.co.uk/diseases/neospora/). In member herds, a representative number of cows are sampled and serologically tested to assess infection at the herd level. In herds with _N. caninum_-seropositive animals, all female breeding animals are progressively tested and positive animals removed. In the case of abortion, the aborting cows and their cohorts are sampled and the seropositives removed. Added replacement cattle are also tested and are considered potentially infected until they test negative twice in proximity of 2 calvings. Biosecurity requirements to prevent horizontal transmission must also be fulfilled.
