Bulgarian veterinary health authorities reported on Friday [23 Feb
2007] an outbreak of swine fever in the southeast of the country, and
said they were preparing to slaughter 142 pigs to prevent the spread
of the disease.
The disease was detected Thursday [22 Feb 2007] in a farm in the
village of Tenevo, local veterinary chief, Krasimir Dyulgerov, told
state BTA news agency. He added that on Friday 23 Feb 2007,
authorities began slaughtering all the farm's pigs to prevent the
disease from spreading further.
This is the 2nd [outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF)] reported in
Bulgaria this year [2007] [see comment]. In January 2007, authorities
slaughtered some 164 infected pigs at a farm in the town of Smyadovo
in the northeast.
Bulgaria and neighbouring Romania -- both of which joined the
European Union in 2007 -- are currently banned from exporting live
pigs, pork, and other pig products to EU countries.
