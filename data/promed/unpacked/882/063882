A total of 6 H7N9 influenza infections were reported in 2 Chinese provinces and the city of Shanghai today [17 Jan 2014], keeping the volume of new cases within striking distance of peak activity the country saw during the outbreak's 1st wave last spring [2013]. China's National Health and Family Planning Commission today addressed the quickly rising number of H7N9 cases, especially since the 1st of the year [2014], according a report today from Xinhua, the state news agency. It said 28 cases have been reported so far. The cases are scattered, and so far no mutations have been identified that signal a threat to human health, the commission said in a statement. It added that the virus is still spreading from birds to humans and that the chance of a large-scale outbreak is slim. However, it said the cases are likely to continue rising, alongside the increase in poultry trade to meet the demand for Spring Festival celebrations.

Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) addressed 4 of the cases in a statement today [17 Jan 2014], based on information it received from mainland health officials. The patients include a 54 year old man from Shanghai and 3 men from Zhejiang province, ages 54, 62, and 66. No details were available, other than that the 4 patients are hospitalised.

Meanwhile, Fujian province reported 2 more cases, according to statements in Chinese from provincial health authorities that were translated by and posted on the Avian Flu Diary infectious disease blog. The patients are a 38 year old woman from Quanzhou who is hospitalized in a critical condition in Jinjiang and a 54 year old man who is hospitalized in critical condition in Fuzhou.

In addition, another possible H7N9 case from Zhejiang province was flagged by analysts at the FluTrackers infectious disease message board, based on their translations of Chinese-language media reports. According to the group's translation, the patient is a 35 year old man from the city of Cixi who is hospitalized in Ningbo. He had been exposed to poultry before he got sick.

Today's confirmed case announcements lift the H7N9 outbreak total to 194 infections, including 53 deaths.

In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided more details on 4 cases that were originally reported by China on [15 Jan 2014]. All the patients are middle-aged adult men who got sick the 1st week of January and are hospitalized in critical condition. Two of them -- a 35 year old from Shanghai and a 55 year old from Guangdong province -- had been exposed to poultry before becoming ill.

WHO today [17 Jan 2014] also released recommendations on antiviral prophylaxis for close contacts of confirmed H7N9 patients and those who have had high-risk exposure to poultry or contaminated environments. The group said the guidance is part of a larger working group effort to develop standards on the clinical management of flu, and it is releasing the H7N9 part early.

People who have unprotected close contact with a patient with a confirmed H7N9 infection or were exposed to poultry, live poultry markets, or other environments contaminated with the virus should be monitored for 7 days after the last known exposure. If a patient experiences a fever or respiratory symptoms, clinicians should immediately begin empiric treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor for 5 days, WHO said. Clinicians should also collect a respiratory sample for H7N9 testing. Routine post-exposure prophylaxis isn't recommended for asymptomatic patients unless they had substantial unprotected or prolonged exposure to a patient with an H7N9 infection and are at higher risk for complications. WHO's routine prophylaxis recommendation also extends to unprotected health workers, especially those who conduct aerosol-generating procedures. The guidance is similar to prophylaxis recommendations released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in September [2013], which also call for a tiered approach based on risk, but suggest that contacts be monitored for 10 days. CDC's document is geared toward preventing further spread of the virus in the event of a case detected in the United States.
