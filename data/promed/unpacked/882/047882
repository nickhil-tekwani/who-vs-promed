Hong Kong SAR: precautionary slaughter of H5-type virus infected birds
-------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong authorities have slaughtered 8300 chickens from one farm after
some of its birds died of avian influenza, which in 1997 caused the death
of 6 people. The Ministry of Agriculture reported today that the decision
had been made after 40 chickens were found dead in a farm in the New
Territories, on the border with mainland China.
The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department confirmed that
laboratory tests showed that the H5 virus caused the death of some of the
birds. Health authorities said, however, that further tests are required in
order to determine whether the birds were infected by the H5N1 virus, a
variant of H5 that may affect humans.
Over the past months, several cases of avian influenza have been registered
in Hong Kong. In order to prevent an outbreak of the disease, more than 10
000 birds that were being sold in several markets were slaughtered.
In 2001, the authorities ordered the slaughter of 1.2 million birds to
prevent the dissemination of the virus, which the following year was
concentrated on several farms. This last outbreak resulted in the
establishment of the first program of chicken vaccination in farms and the
slaughter of close to 950 000 birds.

[The authorities are adopting a precautionary strategy to preempt the
possible reintroduction into Hong Kong of an H5N1 influenza virus similar
to the virus which was transmitted to (but did not spread among) humans.
The reality of this risk is difficult to assess. A recent survey of the
influenza virus gene pool present in a poultry market in central China over
a period of 16 months and published in the current issue of Virology (Liu
et al. Virology 2003; 305: 267-75) revealed extensive genetic and antigenic
heterogeneity -- but an apparent absence of H5-type viruses. - Mod.CP
It would be useful to know whether the affected farm had been vaccinated. -
