Alert for whitefly, thrips and virus diseases
---------------------------------------------
Almeria's vegetable crops are being heavily attacked by whiteflies, thrips, and viruses. COAG [Coordinadora de Organizaciones de Agricultores y Ganaderos/Coordinator for Agricultural and Livestock Organizations] has issued a call for growers "to provide reports on losses and crop damage. The high temperatures at the moment are creating ideal conditions for pests and diseases."

"Many producers are being forced to destroy their crops totally or partially because of the viruses, which has resulted in losses. It is crucial for producers to enforce extreme hygiene in affected greenhouses to prevent the diseases and pests from spreading to nearby farms," they say.

[Whitefly and thrips species are vectors of some of the most economically damaging viruses of vegetable (and other) crops worldwide. Whitefly transmitted viruses include species in the genera _Begomovirus_ (such as members of the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades) and _Crinivirus_ (such as tomato chlorosis or infectious chlorosis viruses), while species of, for example, _Tospovirus_ (tomato spotted wilt group) are thrips transmitted. Whiteflies and thrips are also serious crop pests in their own right.

If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Control of these viruses is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of the vectors. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, phytosanitation (as mentioned above), and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

Whitefly or thrips transmitted viruses reported previously in southern Spain include the begomoviruses _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ and _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_, the tospovirus _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, and others (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
