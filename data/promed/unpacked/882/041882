In an update today [7 Jan 2019], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 7 new cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), bringing the total for 2018 to 193 confirmed cases, the most of any year since the CDC began tracking the mysterious illness in 2014.

To date, 39 states have recorded cases, a number that has not changed since the CDC's previous update on [31 Dec 2018]. Texas has reported the most cases, 25, followed by Colorado (16), and Ohio (13). 3 states -- Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington -- have recorded 10 cases. Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have each confirmed 9 cases.

AFM affects mostly children and follows a seasonal pattern, with activity spiking every other year in the fall. 2014 saw 120 cases, followed by 22 in 2015, 149 in 2016, and 35 in 2017.

More than 90 percent of patients report mild respiratory symptoms before AFM symptom onset, which typically involves limb weakness and paralysis.

The CDC has yet to establish a definitive cause for the 2018 cases, but some previous cases have been connected to enterovirus infections.
