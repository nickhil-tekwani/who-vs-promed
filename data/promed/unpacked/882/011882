Hantaviruses have been associated with 2 serious human diseases:
haemorrhagic fever involving he kidneys [haemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome - HFRS] and haemorrhagic fever involving the lungs
[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - HPS]. So far there has been no
report of such diseases in India.

[New findings indicate] the possible presence of hantavirus infection
in the human population of India, presenting both as asymptomatic and
symptomatic infections, a team of scientists led by S Chandy from the
Department of Clinical Virology, Christian Medical College (CMC),
Vellore, has stated. The team tested 152 patients, suffering from
fever, for antibodies against hantavirus during the period July 2002
to September 2003 in CMC. Of these, 23 (14.7 per cent), were positive.

In contrast, only 5.7 per cent of healthy blood donors tested were
positive, scientists reported in the Indian Journal of Medical
Research. "This is a significant study. Though the infection appears
mild, who knows there may be cases of severe infections also," Anoop
Misra, Professor, Department of Medicine, AIIMS, said. "But this is
not confirmatory, as antibodies can cross-react...It should be
followed up by molecular biology studies or definitive evidence," he said.

The natural reservoirs of hantaviruses are small rodents, and
transmission to man is believed to occur via aerosolised animal
excretions. The worldwide distribution of rodents known to harbour
hantaviruses suggests great disease-causing potential, the current
study said. The average time between contact with the virus and the
onset of illness is 2-3 weeks.

A virus belonging to the same family. [Hantaviruses are classified as
a separate genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_, and are
among the most serious pathogens in the family. - Mod.CP].

_Thottapalayam virus_ [which has been assigned to the genus
_Hantavirus_] was isolated from the spleen of a shrew in July 1964 in
Vellore. Subsequently there have been no [other reports of]
hantavirus infections in India, the team said.

In 1950-1953, thousands of UN military personnel were infected with
hantavirus, showing kidney infection, during the Korean war. This
infection was associated with 5-10 per cent mortality. In 1993, a
different strain of the virus was shown to be related to flu-like
infection in US with 50 per cent mortality, DA Gadkari from National
Institute of Virology said in the same journal.

[The evidence for hantavirus infection in the human population in
India described above appears to be entirely serological. The
relevance of such data is difficult to assess in the absence of
information on the identity of the test antigen(s) and the antibody
titres observed. The report does not indicate whether seroconversion
was observed in any of the patients with febrile symptoms, a
necessary observation in linking serological data with disease.
Hantaviruses are undoubtedly present in South Asia, but an
association with human disease remains conjectural. Although
Thottapalayam virus, the only hantavirus isolated in India so far, is
related phylogenetically to Hantaan virus -- the etiologic agent of
Korean haemorrhagic fever -- it is a distinct virus species and not
known to have any association with human disease. Nevertheless, the
search for hantavirus-related disease in India should be pursued. - Mod.CP]
