Dragon fruit growers in Ilocos Norte are concerned about increasing infections in their plantations with fruit diseases, threatening their harvest. The diseases include anthracnose, caused by a number of _Colletotrichum_ species, as well as fruit canker, caused by the fungus _Neoscytalidium dimidiatum_.

Anthracnose is one of the major diseases of the crop, damaging stems, flowers, and fruits. Canker kills the branches and weakens the plant until the infected area breaks off. Both are causing severe blemishes to the fruits and can greatly affect production.

[Dragon fruit (also called pitaya, strawberry pear) is the common name for several cactus species and hybrids, mostly of the genus _Hylocereus_, but also _Stenocereus_ and some other related genera. These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an important fruit crop in these regions because of their high nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp colours are planted commercially. Few pathogens are known to affect the crops, but disease management is especially difficult since dragon fruit is propagated by cuttings, which may spread any pathogens.

Canker
------
In addition to the canker caused by the fungus _Neoscytalidium dimidiatum_ mentioned above, a stem canker associated with the fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was also reported in _H. polyrhizus_ which forced some farmers to abandon cultivation in Bangladesh (ProMED post 20220310.8701908). The disease has spread since then in the region. It is unclear from the story above whether any diagnostic procedures were used to distinguish which of the potential canker fungi are causing this specific outbreak.

It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts to these fungi. As with many fungi, they can be spread with contaminated materials locally or long distance dispersal of spores. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough.

Anthracnose
-----------
Fungi in the genera _Colletotrichum_ or _Glomerella_ have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops. The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on plant debris which can serve as a pathogen reservoir. Spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities), with wind and water. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions during the onset of flowering and early stages of seed/fruit development. Control of anthracnose usually centers on crop cultivar resistance and/or diligent fungicide programmes, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce environmental moisture.
