Abstract
During an outbreak of sheep anthrax in Basilicata, southern Italy, the owner of a flock located about 3 km away from the affected farm developed skin lesions attributable to cutaneous anthrax. The DNA extracted from the human scabs confirmed the diagnosis, and a 15-loci multiple locus variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) following single-nucleotide repeat (SNR) analysis yielded the same genotype as that found in the dead sheep. The breeder, who had not had contact with infected or dead animals, reported having been stung by gadflies [Tabanid flies].

[If anyone doubts that haemorrphagic (biting) flies can transmit anthrax, they should read this paper. And interestingly, the affected person scratched the initial lesion and thereby generated 2 more skin lesions on his arm. This was preliminarily reported in 2012; see 20120831.1275554.

While cutaneous lesions are infrequent now in humans, back in the 19th century, when we in Louisiana had significantly more livestock than we do now -- then, each sugar cane farm would have 100-200 mules, and the rice farmers ran cattle to graze their fields when fallow to reduce the weeds -- such fly-sourced lesions were 40-60 percent of the cutaneous anthrax in those days. - Mod.MHJ
