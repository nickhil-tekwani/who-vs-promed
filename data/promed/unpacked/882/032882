Malaria and other fevers are reporting to be raging in the agency area of Visakhapatnam district. Though the monsoon is yet reach its peak, malaria has spread like wildfire in the entire agency. For the 1st time after a decade, 3438 malaria cases have been registered [so far in 2015]. 1443 cases were registered during the corresponding period in 2014.

The tribal population is over 620 000 in the Visakhapatnam agency spread over 11 mandals [districts]. The spread of malaria and other fevers during the monsoon season is creating panic in the agency. Usually the Medical and Health Department initiates several measures to control diseases. However, this year the number of cases has shot up and a large number of students too have contracted seasonal fevers.

The officials were claiming that the 1st phase of spraying the chemical Malathion to kill mosquitoes was completed at all the tribal hamlets in the agency. But the malaria cases have increased in all the habitations, Narasinga Rao said, wondering if the Malathion spray was really done.

"After reopening of the schools post-summer vacation, students have been suffering from fevers. The government should also set up special medical camps for schoolchildren," he said.

On the state of medical services in the agency, the CPM said that there was a shortage of doctors and other staff in the primary health centres. There are only 15 pharmacists working in the entire agency against the sanctioned strength of 40, Narasinga Rao lamented. Many other medical and health posts remain vacant, he said and demanded the filling of all the vacant posts.

[According to the 2014 WHO World Malaria Report (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf) this area notifies between 0.1 and 1 confirmed malaria cases per year per 1000 population. The article above talks about malaria and "other fevers," which are not specified, and it is not stated whether the case number refers to confirmed or suspected cases.

Nevertheless, the number of malaria cases is much higher compared to last year. The report again demonstrates that malaria is common in India and probably also underlines the fact that there is substantial underreporting.
