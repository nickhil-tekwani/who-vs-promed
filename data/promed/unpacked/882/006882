Re: ProMED-mail Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds (08): S.
Korea 20101229.4584
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In reference to the posting today [29 Dec 2010] on the latest reports
on HPAI H5N1 in South Korea, I believe that the species involved in
the recent incident (ProMED mail no. 20101229.4584) are actually
Baikal teal (_Anas formosa_), and not spectacled eider (_Somateria
fischeri_). The error appears to have arisen through an inexact
translation.

South Korea is a vitally important wintering ground for Baikal teal, a
species currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN [International
Union for Conservation of Nature]
(<http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/141530/0>).
The species has been increasing in recent years, but it's habit of
gathering in very dense flocks numbering in the hundreds of thousands
during the winter period places populations at risk of pathogens such
as HPAI. Should a virulent pathogen be introduced to one of the large
wintering flocks, very heavy losses would not be unexpected.

In conservation terms, the report from South Korea is not dissimilar
to the death last week [week of 20 Dec 2010] of a hooded crane with
HPAI at Izumi [Kagoshima, Japan; see ProMED-mail no. 20101227.4562].
This site is of international importance to cranes, with upward of 70
percent of the world population of hooded crane, and up to
approximately 50 percent of the world's white-naped crane population
congregating to take advantage of artificial food sources. While
artificial feeding can be immensely important to some threatened
species, these well-intentioned measures can also have unintended
consequences such as increased vulnerability to disease or other
catastrophic events.

The recent wild bird cases and outbreaks in both Japan and South Korea
have been very intriguing. It may be notable that the May 2010
outbreak in Sukhbaatar, Mongolia occurred over 1000 km [620 mi]
further east than all previous Mongolian outbreaks (in 2005, 2006, and
2009), placing it well within the flyway that passes south to the
Korean peninsula and Japan. The sequence data from recent outbreaks
will be particularly interesting in determining relatedness of the
wild bird isolates in these areas, and determining any linkages or
whether a new spillover into wild birds is underway.

The continued isolation of clade 2.3.2 viruses among wild birds in
Asia from 2007/08 through 2010, coupled with the occurrence of wild
bird outbreaks in areas largely free from poultry (such as Mongolia)
does support the case for wild birds playing a role in the maintenance
of HPAI H5N1. However, it is also worth noting that to date only 2
strains (clades 2.2. and 2.3.2) have been consistently isolated from
wild birds, indicating that they do not play a prominent role in the
evolution of the virus, and presence is reliant on occasional
spillover from domestic sources.

Best wishes to all at ProMED, and keep up the good work in the new year!
