Avian influenza situation - WHO update 22
-----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 3 year old boy from the Tangerang
District, Banten Province, developed symptoms on 14 Oct [2007]. The case
has recovered.

The investigation found that there were poultry deaths in the case's
household prior to his onset of symptoms. The case was living in the same
district but had no contact with the previously confirmed 5 year old girl.

Of the 111 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 89 have been fatal.

[This is the official confirmation of the 11th human case of avian
influenza in Indonesia reported provisionally in ProMED-mail post "Avian
influenza, human (144): Indonesia 20071029.3512". Additional information
included in the WHO report is that the patient has recovered and that sick
domestic poultry were recently in the child's household prior to his
illness. There appears to be no known connection between this case and a 5
year old girl living in the same district, who died several days previously
as a result of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection.

Banten province, the location of Tangerang District, can be found on the
