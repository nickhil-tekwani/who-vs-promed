A suspected outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in poultry has
been found in France, the European Commission has confirmed.
The owner of an indoor turkey farm in the same region where the H5N1
virus was found in wild ducks last week alerted authorities to
abnormally high death rates in his flock of more than 11 000 birds.
The entire flock was slaughtered and other emergency containment
measures to isolate the area were triggered pending confirmation of
an H5N1 infection. Results are expected on Friday from French
laboratories and, if confirmed, the outbreak will mark the first time
the current bird flu scare has hit commercial poultry stocks.
A Commission statement said: "The Commission has been informed by the
French authorities of a strong suspicion of highly pathogenic avian
influenza on an indoor turkey farm in the department of Ain, near
Lyon. The farm is located close to where the H5N1 virus was detected
in wild ducks and falls within the protection zone that was set up in
response to that outbreak. All poultry on the infected farm have been
culled and rigorous bio-security measures, such as disinfection, are
being carried out."
The suspected outbreak was reported as Compassion in World Farming
called on EU governments to safeguard animal welfare and protect
organic producers facing a bird flu threat.
CIWF wants any poultry cull by EU governments to be carried out
"swiftly, efficiently and humanely" in the event of a bird flu
outbreak in Britain.
The organisation's Chief Executive Philip Lymbery commented: "The
spectre of avian flu poses a double threat to producers of free range
and organic chicken and eggs."
The concern was that the suspected outbreak in commercial poultry has
occurred in indoor, and not free-range birds.
France has been given clearance to start a limited vaccination
programme which the authorities said was necessary because the
nation's commercial poultry flocks are so extensive it is not
possible to take them all indoors.

[Results of the laboratory tests are expected tomorrow, 24 Feb 2006.
Culling a highly suspected flock without delay, prior to final
diagnosis, is a justified avian influenza control measure. The law
allows for full compensation in the event the diagnosis is not
confirmed. - Mod.AS]

A 2nd test on a German farm bird shows it did not have the deadly
H5N1 strain of bird flu, German officials said on Thursday.
A duck on a farm on the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen had initially
tested positive for the disease but a 2nd test by Germany's national
animal diseases institute was negative, the eastern German state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said.
A spokeswoman for the state said it was significant that the 2nd test
had proved negative, but a 3rd conclusive test was still awaited.
German Farm Minister Horst Seehofer criticised the handling of
Thursday's case, saying on German radio that authorities should only
announce bird flu cases after full conclusive testing had taken place.
The duck was from a farm with 106 other birds which had not been
scheduled for precautionary culling on the island.
Some 110 wild birds, 7 more than on Wednesday, have now tested
positive for bird flu since the disease first reached Germany on 14
Feb 2006, mostly on Ruegen. Migrating swans accounted for most of the
cases.
No EU farm birds have yet tested positive for the disease, but animal
and human health experts, including at the WHO and the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, say it is almost inevitable that
the virus will spread from wild birds to poultry flocks.
H5N1 is endemic in birds across parts of Asia.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Agriculture Minister Till Backhaus said on local radio
the farmer involved in the case had acted responsibly and reported the sick
bird immediately. Other animals [poultry?] on the farm were now being
slaughtered as a preventive measure.
The district council in Ruegen had been criticised for slow action in
responding to the disease before it handed responsibility to state
and federal authorities on Sunday night. The council had left dead
birds uncollected on beaches for several days.
The German army currently has 250 soldiers on Ruegen largely collecting dead
birds.

[3] Eurosurveillance update, worldwide
Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2006

Wild birds with highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected
in 2 more European Union countries; France (confirmed as H5N1) and
Slovakia (confirmed H5, futher results pending). The other European
Union (EU) countries where H5N1 has been detected are: Slovenia,
Italy, Greece, Austria, Hungary and Germany, in addition to the
accession countries Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey. The number of
infected wild birds found in the EU has so far been small, and there
is no evidence to date of spread to farmed poultry.[Suspected cases
in domestic fowl have been reported today -- 23 Feb 2006 -- from
Germany and France; final results are pending. - Mod.AS]
Affected EU member states are implementing strict protection and
surveillance zones around the locations where H5N1 infected wild birds
have been found. In addition to these measures, vaccination of
certain bird flocks in the Netherlands and France is being permitted.
These flocks will be subject to rigorous surveillance and control
requirements, such as movement restrictions and strict monitoring of
vaccinated populations to ensure no undetected outbreak of avian
influenza. There will also be conditions and limits on the trade of
vaccinated birds and their products.
Vaccination is being permitted in selected southern areas of France
that are believed to be at risk from avian influenza. The free-range
ducks and geese in this region are not easy to put indoors and are
therefore at risk of contact with wild birds that may be carrying the
virus. The vaccination programme will begin immediately and will
continue until 1 Apr 2006. Sentinel birds (unvaccinated control
birds) will be used as part of the monitoring for avian influenza.
Vaccinated poultry, their hatching eggs and day-old chicks cannot be
exported or moved to any third country, including countries in the
EU. There are strict conditions on the movement of vaccinated birds
within France. Fresh meat and meat products from vaccinated poultry
will be able to be sold in the EU, provided the strict conditions
have been complied with by the farm.
In the Netherlands, vaccination has been approved for hobby birds
(poultry kept by households for strictly personal use), as well as
free-range laying hens throughout the whole country as an alternative
to bringing birds indoors. Biosecurity measures are mandatory whether
the owners have vaccinated poultry or not. Vaccinated hobby poultry
will only be allowed to be moved to another vaccinated holding, and
only with permission from authorities. Meat and meat products from
hobby poultry are not permitted to be commercially traded anyway, so
no extra regulations are required.
For vaccinated free-range commercial poultry, there will be strict
limits on movements within the Netherlands, and a ban on movement to
any other countries. The Dutch plan contains mandatory surveillance
and control measures for vaccinated commercial poultry. Full
bio-security measures will be required. Eggs, meat and meat products
from vaccinated Dutch flocks will be permitted to be traded within
the EU, provided the farms and packagers have fully complied with the
strict regulations in place.
EU co-funding approved to control outbreaks in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------------
The European Commission has approved 8.35 million Euros for an
emergency grant to Turkey, to fund programmes to control avian
influenza there, with co-financing by the Turkish government. The
Commission grant has been made available for investments in
laboratory equipment, rapid tests, and safety equipment. This will
help improve animal disease surveillance, diagnostic testing and
rapid response capacity. There will also be a number of training and
simulation exercises organised by the Turkish Veterinary Services and
supported by the Commission.
Spread of avian influenza in Asia and Africa
--------------------------------------------
According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the
following countries outside Europe have also been newly affected:
Iraq, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Iran, Egypt and India.
In Azerbaijan, detection of the virus has coincided with die-offs of
domestic birds. In Egypt, outbreaks in domestic poultry have now been
confirmed in 10 governorates; deaths have also been reported in
exotic zoo birds. In Iraq, presence of the virus in birds was found
only after the country confirmed its first human case. In Nigeria, as
in India, the first cases were detected in large commercial poultry
farms, where the disease is highly visible and outbreaks are
difficult to miss. So far, Iraq is the only one of these countries to
report human cases.

The bird flu virus, which has been detected in parts of India, is
suspected to have reached the border areas of Pakistani Kashmir,
where thousands of chickens have reportedly died.
This was disclosed at a high-level meeting headed by Health Minister
Naseer Khan Thursday, reported Online news agency. He said thousands
of chickens had been found dead in various areas of Pakistani
Kashmir, including Dhadiyal and Mirpur.
He said investigating teams have been sent to the affected areas to
find out if the death of chickens was due to bird flu.
