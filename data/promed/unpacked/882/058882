Malta fever in Wadi el-Arayesh
------------------------------
50 people from Wadi el-Arayesh have been found to be infected with Malta
fever following the consumption of goat cheese and meat.
Scores of infected people have been hospitalized in [the Lebanese town of]
Zahle. A physician, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that laboratory
investigations have revealed infection, in 50 persons, from Wadi
el-Arayesh. He expressed concern about the attempt to conceal a serious
health hazard.
As Almustaqbal has discovered, clinical signs initially appeared 2 days
ago. This information has not been made public due to an attempt of a
cheese producer, in Wadi el-Arayesh, to conceal the incident.

[_Brucella melitensis_, the causative agent of brucellosis in sheep and
goats, and, of Malta fever in humans, is endemic throughout all countries
in the Mediterranean basin. Lebanon reported, during 2003, 13 outbreaks in
sheep and goats, but, it may be assumed that, as in most countries in the
region, many cases remain undiagnosed. _B. melitensis_ is the cause of
abortions and infertility in small ruminants, with subsequent serious
economical losses. The bacterium may infect cattle subclinically, exposing
farmers and milk consumers to infection; this has been clearly demonstrated
in Egypt and Israel within the framework of a trilateral regional
animal-health research project (TAHRP). Additional information can be seen
at <http://www.moag.gov.il/brunet/public.html> - Mod.AS].
