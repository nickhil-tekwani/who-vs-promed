RABIES, HUMAN - UK EX PHILIPPINES

A 55-year-old patient who had been previously bitten by a dog while
visiting the Philippines was admitted to hospital in the UK on 30 April
2001 and kept in an isolation ward. [ProMED-mail has learned that it has
been reported in the press that the patient has succumbed to the rabies
infection. - Man. Ed. DS]
On Thursday 3 May 2001, saliva and 2 skin biopsies (wound site and nape of
the neck) were received from the London hospital where the patient was
being treated for rabies. Using a hemi-nested PCR, positive results were
obtained from these samples. On Saturday 5 May 2001, the virus isolate was
identified as classical rabies virus (genotype 1) by analyzing a 350 bp
region of the nucleoprotein gene. In addition, molecular epidemiological
analysis confirmed that the sequence most closely aligned with other Asian
isolates.
Saliva samples were inoculated into mice on Thu 3 May 2001. Although the
mouse inoculation test is a 21-day test, one mouse died on 9 May 2001 (day
6) after showing typical encephalitic signs. Brain material from the dead
mouse proved positive for rabies by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT).

[Dr. Fooks, we are grateful for your official report. - Mod.TG]
[ProMED-mail does not normally post on cases of rabies in endemic areas or
in travelers from endemic areas. In this case, however, we are pleased to
have received the very specific information provided by Dr. Fooks, which is
not available in the lay press. - Man. Ed. DS]
