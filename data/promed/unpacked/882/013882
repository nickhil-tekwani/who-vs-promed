------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry for the delay to share lab results since the sample took longer time to reach our centre for testing. Out of 13 stool samples received, 2 samples were [of] inadequate/poor quality to process. _Aeromonas hydrophila_ was isolated from 5 samples and _Salmonella_ species from one sample. The rest [had] no growth.

[Our thanks to Dr Wangchuk for this information.

In that half the human faecal samples had little or no growth suggests to me that their samples were obtained after these people had taken antibiotics. Always a problem. So at this point, the initial clinical diagnosis of anthrax was not confirmed, which supports the wider diagnosis of "food poisoning". - Mod.MHJ
