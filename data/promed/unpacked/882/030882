Farm cordoned off after cow death
Tests showed farms in NI were not source of outbreak
------------------------------------------
A farm in mid-Ulster remains sealed off after a cow died from signs similar
to Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). Department of Agriculture veterinarians
are trying to establish the cause of death of the cow. An 8-kilometre
exclusion zone was placed around the farm on Friday.
On Friday, Agriculture Minister Brid Rodgers said it was purely a
precautionary measure as it was thought the animal died from a condition
known as malignant catarrh.
She said preliminary tests for FMD had proved negative and none of the
other animals in the herd had shown indications of the disease. [However
Malignant catarrh, is contagious to other animals. - Mod.TG Brid Rodgers
is hopeful province will prove clear of the FMD disease.

Meanwhile, Pat Toal from the Department of Agriculture said the public
must be aware of the part they can play in preventing the spread of the
FMD in Northern Ireland.
Mr Toal said: "We are asking for the voluntary cessation of livestock
markets and any other events involving gatherings of animals or people on
farms.
"We want farmers to adopt a fortress attitude, in other words, no
visitors other than essential visitors on the farm.
On Friday, tests confirmed farms in Northern Ireland were not the source
of the outbreak in England.
Mrs Rodgers said tests by her department on 3 farms which supplied pigs
to the Essex abattoir, where the disease was first detected, had found no
trace of the virus.
However, further tests are being carried out before the province can be
declared free of the disease, and it will be next week before these are
completed.
In the meantime, Mrs Rodgers has announced a ban on the export of
cattle, sheep and pigs to Great Britain. She has also announced a
suspension of livestock sales next week and urged limited movement
between farms, to reduce the risk of any infection spreading.
Countryside events planned for this weekend, including the Ulster Horse
Ploughing Championships near Gilford, County Down have also been
cancelled.
The lorry which transported pigs to the English abattoir and then
returned to the province with sheep, before going to the Republic of
Ireland, has been taken out of circulation.
But Mrs Rodgers said the European Commission ban on the export of animal
and dairy produce from the UK, would continue to apply to Northern
Ireland, until further notice.
The Irish Government, meanwhile, has banned the importation of all animal
products from the United Kingdom, including the province. Irish police
and customs officers are patrolling the border to enforce it.
There has not been an outbreak of FMD in Northern Ireland since 1941.
