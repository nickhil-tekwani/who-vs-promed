Two people with suspected symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were hospitalised at Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH), relevant officials told The Express Tribune on [Mon 5 Sep 2016]. [A 35-year-old] resident of Khaki village in Mansehra [District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] and [an 18-year-old] resident of Havelian tehsil [sub district] in Abbottabad, were hospitalised on [4 Sep 2016]. They had symptoms of CCHF and were kept in a separate ward, officials said.

They added a patient with similar symptoms died at the hospital 2 days back. [The 22-year-old] resident of Haripur district, was brought to the hospital with high-grade fever and bleeding from nose. He was treated at the hospital, but died on [3 Sep 2016]. However, a doctor, dealing with dengue cases, denied that he died of Congo fever, adding his blood sample tested negative for CCHF by Aga Khan Laboratory. He said [the man] could have been suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever. However, they were still waiting for reports from National Institute of Health, Islamabad to confirm the diagnosis.

He even denied that the 2 new patients, [the 35-year-old and the 18-year-old] could be suffering from CCHF as the ATH administration was waiting to receive their blood sample analysis for diagnosis. He said they both might have dengue fever, however, they were waiting for reports from NIH to confirm the diagnosis.

According to officials, more than 60 dengue cases were reported at ATH during August [2016], but there was not a single death reported so far and all the patients were discharged after their recovery. Earlier during May [2016], [a 41-year-old] butcher from Kotnajibullah village in Haripur died at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad. According to NIH report, he was tested positive for CCHF.

In September 2013, a butcher, and his 2 sons from Havelian, also died at PIMS [Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences]. They were also diagnosed as Congo positive, officials told The Express Tribune.

[A previous report in the same newspaper has mentioned the total number of cases from Balochistan province at 27 [Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (15): Balochistan 20160905.4465412].The reported cases seems to have similar course and age but the report did not clarify the hospital facility, and whether the CCHF diagnosis was lab confirmed. Correct information by province/region would be appreciated from the relevant public health officials. - Mod.UBA
