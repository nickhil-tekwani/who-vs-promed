Indonesia and Thailand: Suspected Avian Influenza Virus Cases
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand reported its 1st human bird-flu death this year [2005], and
Indonesia officials warned of a possible case of human-to-human
transmission, as concerns mount that the virus is surging through
Asia and Europe.
Thailand
--------
Thailand reported its 1st human bird-flu death this year [2005], and
Indonesia officials warned of a possible case of human-to-human
transmission, as concerns mount that the virus is surging through
Asia and Europe. The death in Thailand is the country's 13th from the
[H5N1 avian influenza virus], Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said
today [Thu 20 Oct 2005]. A suspected case in a father and son in
Indonesia may raise the possibility that the disease is spreading
between people there, Indonesia's health minister said. Cases in
birds have been reported this week in Taiwan, China, Russia, Turkey,
Romania and Greece. United Nations officials said yesterday that the
illness would be harder to control if it reaches Africa, where it may
mutate to a form more easily transmitted person to person.
In the new case in Thailand, the man's child has a fever and has been
sent to Bangkok for tests, Thaksin said. The man, who died 19 Oct
2005, lived in Panuamthuan district of Kanchanaburi, 150 km (94
miles) west of Bangkok. Thailand reported 12 human bird-flu deaths
last year [2004]. "The 2nd test on a dead person came out last night
and found that the man in Kanchanaburi province had died from the
bird flu," Thaksin said during his weekly televised press conference.
"He has a track record of contact with chickens. But don't panic, the
health minister this afternoon [Thu 20 Oct 2005] will go to the area
to supervise the cleaning." Health officials say people working with
birds are at a higher risk of contracting the illness. Cooked poultry
products aren't a risk, according to Professor Peter Openshaw, the
section head of respiratory infection at the National Heart and Lung
Institute at London's Imperial College.
Thailand is forecast to be Asia's biggest chicken meat exporter this
year [2005] by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, selling 270 000
metric tons overseas. Thailand exports cooked chicken products since
its 2 biggest export markets, Japan and the European Union, banned
raw poultry from the kingdom when it 1st confirmed bird flu in
January 2004. The EU this month [October 2005] extended its ban for a
further 12 months, along with import restrictions on 10 other Asian
nations where bird flu has been detected. Belgium today [20 Oct 2005]
will urge the EU to build its own stockpile of Roche Holding AG and
GlaxosmithKline Plc's flu treatments, as concern mounts that small
countries may lack medicines should the deadly bird flu spread.
Health ministers of the 25-member EU are meeting in the U.K. today
[Thu 20 Oct 2005] to discuss how to react to the disease, which has
killed 60 people in Asia [61 if the Thai case described above is
confirmed]. Ministers may discuss the size of a stockpile, and
whether commission purchases should get priority over those of
individual nations, said Karim Ibourki, spokesman for Belgian Health
Minister Rudi Demotte, in a telephone interview.
Indonesia
----------
In Indonesia, tests are being done to see whether a father and the
son have avian influenza, Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said in
a phone interview. "They are both suspected cases," Supari said. "If
they are confirmed, it would be the 3rd cluster in Indonesia in which
blood-related people contracted bird flu. If the cases become more
widespread, human-to-human infection could be suspected."
Indonesia reported its 1st avian influenza cases in humans on 20 Jul
2005, after a man and his 2 daughters died from H5N1 virus
[infection]. The 2nd grouping was an 8-year-old boy who is healthy,
even as he tested positive for bird flu. He is the nephew of a
37-year-old woman who died from the same disease.
While the World Health Organization said in a statement last week
[2nd week October 2005] it has "no convincing evidence'' of sustained
human-to-human transmission, it suspects "limited transmission
between humans" in cases in Cambodia, Thailand and Viet Nam. In an
avian influenza report distributed to U.S. citizens living in Viet
Nam, the U.S. Embassy cited possible human-to-human infections in
Hong Kong in 1997, in the Netherlands in 2003, and in Thailand in 2004.

Indonesia: 2 suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza in Jakarta
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesian doctors said today [20 Oct 2005] they suspect a father and
son of having contracted bird flu, in a case that prompted warnings
of the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus. "2
adults, a man and his son, and an infant were admitted yesterday on
suspicion of having contracted the bird flu," Ilham Patu, a doctor at
the Sulianti Saroso hospital for infectious diseases in Jakarta, said today.
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said the father and son were the
3rd cluster of related people suspected of having contracted the bird
flu virus since the 1st case was discovered in Indonesia in June
2005. The 1st, a father and his 2 daughters, all died. In the 2nd
instance, a woman died, but her nephew survived and has since been
declared free from the virus. In the latest case, the infant was not
related to the father and son. "This is still a very limited number
of cluster cases, but if they become more widespread, human-to-human
infection could be suspected," Ms. Supari said. "It is just a worry
that has yet no base. What is certain is that we need to improve
environmental hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease at a
particular environment," she said.
Indonesia has confirmed 3 deaths from bird flu, based on local tests
and confirmation from World Health Organization (WHO) facilities in
Hong Kong. At least 6 more people have died of suspected cases of the
deadly H5N1 virus, but they are not officially listed as bird flu
victims. Indonesia has another 2 confirmed bird flu patients who are
still alive, while there have been more than 85 suspected cases [i.e.
5 confirmed cases, 3 deaths and more than 80 unconfirmed suspected
cases. - Mod.CP]

[In both Indonesia and Thailand, these new human cases of avian H5N1
influenza must rank as suspected cases until the local diagnoses are
confirmed by laboratory tests at the WHO-designated reference
laboratory in Hong Kong. If confirmed, the death of the Thai patient
would become the 61st fatality in East Asia. If the 2 Indonesia
suspected cases are confirmed, the number of human cases recorded in
Indonesian would increase to 7.
The above report states that: [Unnamed] health officials say people
working with birds are at a higher risk of contracting the illness.
In fact, it is one of the anomalous features of the avian influenza
outbreaks in East Asian countries that (according to WHO data) there
have been few or no cases of illness among the large number of people
working in commercial poultry enterprises. The human cases seem to
have been associated predominantly with the keeping of domestic
poultry and the preparation of food in the home. - Mod.CP]
