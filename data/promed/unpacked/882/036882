On 15 Nov 2006, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services
(MDHHS) was notified of a case of salmonellosis (a nationally
notifiable disease) in an employee of a facility that produced
poultry vaccine. When a 2nd case of salmonellosis in another employee
at the same facility was reported on 25 Nov 2007, MDHHS began an
outbreak investigation. Results of that investigation suggested that
21 employees of the facility became ill during a 1 month period from
exposure to a strain of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Enteritidis
that was used in vaccine production. Infection was thought to have
resulted from environmental contamination after the spill of a liquid
containing a high concentration of the organism. As a result, MDHHS
recommended that the facility improve its infection control
procedures to better protect workers. This outbreak highlights
occupational risks that can be associated with the manufacture of
veterinary biologics involving human pathogens.
The vaccine production facility is located in a town of approximately
8000 persons in central Maine, has 74 employees, and manufactures
viral and bacterial vaccines for poultry. The facility had been last
inspected in August 2005 by staff members of the USA Department of
Agriculture's (USDA's) Center for Veterinary Biologics, which
regulates animal vaccine production facilities. The facility
maintains stock cultures of 4 phage types of _S._ Enteritidis (8,
14B, 23, and 24) for vaccine production.
On 9 Nov 2006, a spill of approximately 1-1.5 liters [1-1.58 quarts]
of liquid occurred in the fermentation room of the production area of
the facility; the liquid contained 20 000 000 000 to 50 000 000 000
colony forming units per milliliter of _S._ Enteritidis phage type 8.
The room was unoccupied at the time the spill occurred. The worker
who was regularly assigned to this room reported finding liquid
overflowing onto the floor from the fermentation apparatus when he
entered the room, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g.,
biohazard suit, hat, booties, mask, and gloves). He cleaned up the
spill using a mop, a 5 percent bleach solution, and a commercial
disinfectant effective against the organism. The mop was autoclaved
before disposal in a room 30 feet away (room A) used for cleaning and
sterilizing laboratory supplies and equipment for vaccine production.
The facility did not have a written spill procedure or a spill
clean-up kit. On 15 Nov 2006, the worker who cleaned up the spill had
diarrhea of 1 day's duration. He did not miss work, seek medical
care, or submit a stool specimen for culture.
On 13 Dec 2006, a total of 67 (91 percent) of the 74 employees were
interviewed at the facility by MDHHS staff members using a standard
questionnaire. A case of diarrheal illness was defined as 3 or more
loose or watery stools in a 24 hour period since 1 Nov 2006. 21 (31
percent) of the 67 employees interviewed had illness that was
consistent with the case definition, with onset ranging from 8 Nov
2006 to 11 Dec 2006 (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]).
The employee with the earliest date of onset of illness was unable to
recall the exact day she became ill. When interviewed on 29 Nov 2007,
she reported becoming ill approximately 3 weeks earlier; therefore,
her illness onset date was recorded as 8 Nov 2006.
In addition to diarrhea, patients reported fatigue (86 percent),
cramps (86 percent), body aches (71 percent), nausea (62 percent),
headache (57 percent), chills (57 percent), fever (43 percent),
vomiting (43 percent), and blood in stool (29 percent); none of the
employees were hospitalized. No secondary cases in family members
were identified. 5 of 8 stool specimens from 8 patients submitted for
culture were positive for _S._ Enteritidis.
Among 33 workers in the production area, 18 (55 percent) had illness
consistent with the case definition, compared with 3 (9 percent) of
34 workers in other areas of the facility (relative risk: 6.2; 95
percent confidence interval = 2.0-19.0). When analysis was restricted
to workers in the production area, the strongest association with
illness was working in room A. 18 (69 percent) of 26 employees who
worked in room A (including those who did so intermittently) became
ill, compared with none of the 7 production-area workers who did not
work in room A (p=0.002). During multiple visits to the facility,
investigators noted inadequate handwashing and lack of personal
protective equipment. Aside from working in room A, none of the
exposures examined were significantly associated with illness.
On 30 Nov 2006, staff members collected 15 environmental swab
specimens from the production area; the swabs were processed by a
commercial laboratory used by the vaccine manufacturer. 19 additional
environmental swabs from room A were collected and processed by MDHHS
on 19 Dec 2006. All environmental swabs were negative for
_Salmonella_. 6 drinking water samples from 3 sites in the facility
were collected on 30 Nov 2006 and processed by MDHHS; all were tested
for _Escherichia coli_ as a marker for bacterial contamination. All
the samples were negative for _E. coli_. Testing of water samples for
_E. coli_ and fecal coliform also was conducted by the manufacturer;
the results were negative.
Isolates of _S._ Enteritidis from 4 patients and the 4 vaccine stock
cultures from the facility underwent pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) testing with two enzymes (XbaI and BlnI) by MDHHS and were
determined to be indistinguishable. Phage typing was then performed
on the isolates by the National Microbiology Laboratory of Canada in
collaboration with CDC. Isolates from all 4 patients were phage type
8, matching the phage type of the spilled stock culture.
PFGE and phage typing also were performed on all 7 _S._ Enteritidis
isolates from ill Maine residents with no connection to the
vaccine-production facility that were submitted to MDHHS during
Oct-Nov 2006. The isolates were from 4 of Maine's 16 counties; none
were from the county where the vaccine facility was located. All 7
isolates were indistinguishable from the phage type 8 isolates by
PFGE testing on the 1st enzyme (XbaI); 7 of the 7 isolates were
tested on the 2nd enzyme (BlnI), and all 5 matched the phage type 8
isolates. However, when phage typed, all 7 isolates were determined
to be phage type 13A.

Editorial Note:
---------------
Salmonella infections usually are acquired by eating contaminated
food; however, some outbreaks have been associated with environmental
contamination (1,2). Salmonella can survive in the environment for
months (3), and the incubation period is 6-72 hours (4). Although the
exact mechanism for infection of workers in this outbreak remains
unknown, environmental contamination of room A likely was the source
of the infection.
Workers might have become infected through hand-to-mouth activities
after touching contaminated surfaces in room A. This mode of
transmission is plausible because 1) the materials used in the
clean-up of the spill were processed in room A before disposal, 2)
the phage type of the organism among 4 ill employees (type 8) was the
same as that of the stock culture involved in the spill and different
from that of the 7 isolates from other cases (type 13A) reported in
Maine during the same approximate period, 3) a strong epidemiologic
association was determined between illness and working in room A, and
4) inadequate handwashing practices and lack of protective equipment
were noted in room A. Person-to-person transmission also might have
occurred because some persons continued to work at the facility while ill.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.
1st, staff members at the vaccine-production facility did not
document details of the spill that occurred on 9 Nov 2007 until 20
days later, which might have introduced recall bias. 2nd,
environmental specimens were not obtained until 3 weeks after the
spill had occurred; routine cleaning and disinfecting had occurred
during this interval. Finally, because of the clonal nature of _S.
Enteritidis, PFGE testing and phage typing alone might not be able to
provide definitive strain discrimination; additional typing methods
might be required (5).
MDHHS recommended that the facility improve hand-washing practices
among employees and, especially in room A, the use of protective
equipment, including gloves and (where splashes might occur) gowns
and face shields. MDHHS further recommended creation of procedures
for handling spills and routinely disinfecting work areas and advised
ill employees not to work until their symptoms resolved. Results of
the investigation were shared with USDA, the Maine Department of
Labor, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. USDA
reinspected the facility in January 2007 and began a follow-up visit
on 28 Aug 2007.

[The issues related to this cluster seem overtly clear. A laboratory
accident results in a spill, and an inadequately documented clean-up
together with poor infection control practices among the workers
resulted in the outbreak of cases. - Mod.LL]
