We had a non-pulmonary syndrome case of infection in a male, about
19-years-old, from the Rio Grande Valley, who had worked the potato
harvest in Kansas. He got sick on his way home and ended up in an
Amarillo Hospital. He thought he got exposed while unloading
potatoes, which, according to him, contained numerous rats picked up
during the mechanical harvest. The Kansas public health veterinarian
felt that he was exposed in the trailer park where he lived, because
at least one other case came from the same site.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Alexander for this interesting report. The
diagnosis presumably was established serologically, and it would be
interesting to know which tests were used and if a specific North
American hantavirus was implicated in this case. The report
illustrates the need to take good travel and work histories when
dealing with mobile patients. It would be interesting to know if any
follow-up rodent sampling was done, either at the patient's trailer
park or in the potato fields of Kansas. The report also makes one
wonder about the risk of agricultural products carrying hantaviruses
into the homes of consumers. - Mod.TY]
[Note that this is one of the small proportion of N. American
hantavirus infections that did not have pulmonary symptoms, thus
presenting more like the clinical cases seen in Europe which mainly
show renal symptoms. - Mod.JW]

A death from hantavirus has been reported in western North Dakota
-----------------------------------------------
The infected person was an adult who died in late December [2006],
said Kirby Kruger, a state Health Department disease specialist. He
refused to identify the person by name, age, gender or exact
location, but said the person was involved in cleaning outbuildings
that may have led to exposure to rodents that carry the hantavirus.
"What we understand about hantavirus is that these cases usually are
isolated cases," Kruger said. "The carrier of this virus is a small
rodent called the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_ - Mod.TY]. If
you have rodent infestations in the area where you live and work, you
are potentially at risk."
The case is the 9th case of hantavirus reported in North Dakota,
Kruger said; 2 deaths have been reported since 1993, including the
most recent case, he said, and officials determined that 3 earlier
deaths also were related to the disease. A case was reported in Grand
Forks County last year [2006], and the infected person survived.
People get the hantavirus after exposure to urine, saliva or feces
from infected rodents, health officials say. It is not considered
contagious [except for Andes hantavirus in South America, where
person-to-person transmission has been shown to occur. - Mod.TY]
"Generally speaking, the virus is excreted in the urine, saliva or
feces of infected mice and when people are cleaning or disturbing
areas where there is rodent infestation, it can get the virus into
the air and people breathe it in," Kruger said.
Early symptoms may be similar to the flu, but the victims rapidly
develop severe respiratory infection, he said. The risk may be higher
in rural areas, and residents should try to control rodents before
they start cleaning buildings, Kruger said. "1st, look at the
building and find out where the mice may be getting in --whether it's
your house or an outbuilding or workplace -- and start cleaning up
after that," he said.

[The hantavirus involved in this fatal case is presumably Sin Nombre
virus. It would be of interest to know how the etiology was confirmed
to be sure of which North American hantavirus was responsible. - Mod.TY]
