Farmers in Sarpang [Geylegphug] are losing chilli plants to a new disease, which is turning the plants yellow. This is an addition to pests like mites, aphids, and whitefly they have observed for the past 2 years. GS Rai, Agriculture Research and Development Centre (ARDC), said the yellowing disease is new in the region. "We isolated the pathogen from the infected plant for laboratory observation. We would be able to confirm the disease within 14 days."

The centre does not have a confirmatory facility for molecular analysis. The officials had visited 14 different fields. A farmer said the pest started to appear suddenly when the plants were ready for harvest. He said a similar disease hampered chilli production last year [2020].

Three hybrid varieties were introduced through fast-track evaluation. GS Rai said the same disease and pests were also observed in the local variety. "The disease is not because of the imported hybrid. Phytophthora infection on peppers was seen in Bhutan since 1995. Only yellowing of plant is the new disease observed this year [2021]."

[A large number of fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens are known to affect capsicum (including chilli varieties) and related solanaceous crops. The insect pests mentioned above are common vectors of viruses. Yellowing symptoms, as mentioned above, are very unspecific and may be caused by many different pathogens as well as insects or external factors or combinations of any of these. Reliable diagnosis is vital to provide management strategies but may be problematic within the country, considering the absence of molecular diagnostic facilities stated above. Diagnostic services are available internationally to receive samples for confirmation and may need to be used.
