Confirmation of soybean rust in South Africa [edited
--------------------------------------------
Soybean rust has now been found in South Africa, in KwaZulu-Natal, at at
least 2 sites, Karkloof and Merrivale. Both are moist regions, with
mistbelt conditions occuring frequently. Plants are in the pod stage, as
we go into late summer/autumn. Infection levels are high, resulting in an
effective defoliation of unsprayed plants. [All available aerial spraying
contractors are already contracted to spray [for control of grey leaf spot
of maize. [Crop losses this season could be quite severe.
I would expect the disease to spread to most of KwaZulu-Natal, as the
pathogen adapts from optimal to less than optimal environments, just as
_Cercospora zeae-maydis_ did, after it arrived here in 1989.

Confirmation of soybean rust in South Africa
--------------------------------------------
I wish to confirm the first observations of soyabean rust in South Africa.
The disease was first identified on soyabeans in the Vryheid area of
KwaZulu-Natal by Pannar Plant Pathologist Dr. Rickus Kloppers on 2 Mar
2001, and has subsequently been identified in other midland areas of the
Province. Most crops infected are in the podfill stage and varying levels
of yield loss can be expected.

[Many thanks to Mark Laing and Julian Ward for confirming the presence of
soybean rust in South Africa. Because of the shortage of aerial spray
operators, it is unfortunate that spraying fungicides is not possible. I
don't know which of the two crops, maize or soybean, is the more
economically important crop; perhaps some of our subscribers in South Africa
can comment on this point. - Mod.DH
