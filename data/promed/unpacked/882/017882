Authorities in western Sweden on Monday [15 Sep 2008] morning
discovered the latest in a series of cases of animals infected with
bluetongue disease at a farm in Halland.

The Swedish Board of Agriculture has identified 19 confirmed cases
since the 1st reports on Saturday [12 Sep 2008] of 2 infected animals
in a livestock herd on a farm 10 km outside the town of Halmstad.

The disease has been discovered in 12 head of cattle and 7 sheep on a
total of 6 farms in Halmstad municipality.

The Agriculture Board has implemented restrictive measures in a large
area around the farms.

1st, a 20-km radius restrictive area has been set up around the
affected farms, within which animals cannot be moved. By Tuesday [16
Sep 2008] evening, the Agriculture Board expects to have vaccinated a
total of 25 000 animals within this zone.

In addition, a 150-km radius protective area has also been created,
within which existing animals are free to move, but beyond which they
cannot be taken.

Bluetongue disease affects cattle, sheep, and goats, but not humans.
There is no danger in consuming meat and milk from affected animals.

[The spread of BTV-8 to Sweden has brought the number of
BTV8-infected countries in Europe to 10, including previously
infected Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, France,
Switzerland, Spain, the Czech Republic and Denmark.

On 15 Sep 2008, Hungary officially notified the OIE about the 1st
outbreak of BTV in its northeast; the serotyping was not yet
available. According to the included epidemiological comments, the
infection was most likely caused by cattle (legally) delivered from
France. For the notification, including a map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7334>.
It is not clear whether the cases are indicative of local circulation
of the virus or just of the detection of (previously) infected cattle
of French origin.

According to national Dutch and German sources cited by the submitter
of the above posting, the number of outbreaks during the 2008 BTV
season, was -- as of 15 Sep 2008 -- 33 in the Netherlands and 996
(since 1 Jul 2008) in Germany. The Dutch cases were concentrated in
the northeast, including 12 in cattle and 21 in sheep; see the map
and figures at
<http://www.vwa.nl/portal/page?_pageid=119,1640067&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_document_id=108779&p_node_id=387989&p_mode=BROWSE>.

The German outbreaks were more scattered geographically, peaking in
August 2008. Since 1 Jul 2008, there were a total of 996 outbreaks,
including 833 cattle farms, 156 sheep farms, one goat farm, 5 mixed
farms and one outbreak in wildlife; see at
