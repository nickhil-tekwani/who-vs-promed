Bangladesh: Military Mobilized to Assist Control of Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Bangladesh's military has been ordered to help civilian medics tackle an
outbreak of dengue fever that has so far left 35 people dead and nearly 3000
ill, an official said on Sun 25 Aug 2002. "The military would help in
containing the outbreak of dengue fever and also in keeping the city clean,"
the health ministry official said.The army medics would also set up
temporary camps if needed, he said. The order to enlist the aid of the
military came on Sat 24 Aug 2002 from Prime Minister Khaleda Zia at a
meeting with municipal officials.
Over the past 4 days in and outside the capital Dhaka, 3 more people have
died from the fever, while nearly 3000 have so far fallen ill across the
country since last month [July 2002], a health ministry control room
spokeswoman said. "At least 67 new cases were reported by midday (Sunday)
[25 Aug 2002] in Dhaka alone," she said.
The Bangladesh health ministry admits the number of dengue infections is on
the rise, but insists there is no reason to be alarmed. Doctors have blamed
the outbreak on a dry spell following days of rain, ideal conditions for
dengue-carrying mosquitoes to breed.
In 2000, Bangladesh announced a 5-year action plan to contain dengue fever
after 5551 people contracted the disease and 93 people died. A dengue outbre
ak last year [2002] claimed 44 lives.

Bangladesh: Dengue Death Toll in Dhaka Reaches 36
-------------------------------------------------
One person died from dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) while 141 people were
hospitalised with dengue and DHF in the city yesterday [26 Aug 2002]. A
47-year-old man died at the BIRDEM Hospital yesterday noon. He had been
admitted to the hospital the same day. This latest casualty ups the dengue
death toll so far to 36. The total number of people hospitalised stood at
3233 yesterday, according to the dengue control room.
Meanwhile, the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) has almost run out of
insecticide to kill the adult _Aedes_ mosquito, the vector of the disease.
According to sources at the DCC, the city authorities have asked all its 10
zones to purchase Malathion, an effective mosquito killer that has also been
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). "This insecticide is
cheap. One litre costs about 35 Takas against 355 Takas a litre [USD 0.62 vs
6.34] for quick-flying fogging fluid. And it is locally available. We have
decided to purchase the insecticide as the current stock will not last more
than a week," said a DCC official. "Malathion will be equally effective in
the mosquito control programme. We are now using about 3000 litres of
quick-flying fogging fluid a day," the official added.
Meanwhile, our Khulna Staff Correspondent reported yesterday that one person
died from DHF in Magura district, while 4 others were hospitalised in
Jessore General Hospital in the last 24 hours. The Khulna City Corporation
in the meantime has launched an anti-mosquito drive in the city.
Our northern region roving correspondent reports that at least one person
died in Chapai-nawabganj district and 15 others were hospitalised for DHF.
All of them were admitted to the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH)
during the past 10 days. The RMCH authorities have opened a 'dengue corner'
to facilitate treatment of dengue patients. Of the 15 affected, only 5 are
now undergoing treatment at the 'dengue corner' of the RMCH while the rest
have been shifted to Dhaka. In addition, 10 more persons were being treated
at different clinics in Rajshahi city.

Taiwan: Disease Spread Slowed in Kaohsiung City
-----------------------------------------------
The Heads of the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) and the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) jointly traveled to Kaohsiung
on Thu 22 Aug 2002 to show their concern about the campaign against dengue
fever there. DOH Minister Lee Ming-liang and EPA Administrator Hau Lung-pin
also joined with Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh in co-chairing a meeting
on the prevention of further spread of the mosquito-borne disease in
Kaohsiung County, Kaohsiung City & Pingtung County in southern Taiwan.
Quoting tallies compiled by the DOH's Center for Disease Control, Lee said
Kaohsiung County is the area hardest-hit by the disease, with 548 confirmed
cases so far; followed by Kaohsiung City, with 531 cases. Pingtung County
has 14 confirmed cases. As of Thursday morning [22 Aug 2002], there had been
1109 confirmed cases of dengue fever throughout the island. Kaohsiung
County, Kaohsiung City & Pingtung County jointly accounted for 1093 cases,
of which 20 were dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease with a 10-20 percent
fatality rate. The remaining cases were reported in various cities and
counties throughout the island.
"Latest tallies show that the spread of the disease has slowed in Kaohsiung
City, but has not abated in Kaohsiung County," Lee said, adding that the
greater Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas should continue various preventive
measures to avert any possible outbreak of an epidemic. As the spread of the
disease usually does not abate until after November, both Lee and Hau urged
relevant local government agencies to join forces with the private sector in
creating a living environment free of dengue-carrying mosquitoes.
In Taipei, a third dengue case was reported on Thu 22 Aug 2002. In an effort
to prevent the disease from further spreading in the city, the Taipei City
Government's health department began to conduct free blood tests for
passengers from southern Taiwan at the Taipei Railway Station [the same
day].
The city government has also continued its anti-dengue work, including
sterilizing ditches in various residential neighborhoods. [_Aedes_ do not
breed in ditches. - Mod.JW]

become the first dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) fatality in 2002. After 3
days of illness he was hospitalized last Saturday [24 Aug 2002] night and
died 2 hours later. The Ocotal hospital sees 2-3 DHF cases a week.
The Ministry of Health reported almost 1100 cases of dengue in 2002 in the
Department of Nueva Segovia, including 377 who have attended health units.
The other townships severely affected are Jicaro, Quilali, Jalapa, & Wiwili,
according to Dr Giovanni Roa, Departmental Director of Silais in Nueva

Cuba: 39 foci of mosquitoes found in Santos Suarez [Havana]
------------------------------------------------------
39 foci of _Aedes aegypti_ have been found in Santos Suarez, a district of
Havana. Sanitary brigades are fumigating the zone, and say that they will
be extending their activities beyond that district.
(By Armando Soler/)
[It is extremely difficult to eradicate _Aedes aegypti_, when it is
continually being reintroduced by human activity. It is indeed a good idea,
given the flight range of the mosquito (found to be several hundreds of
meters in Puerto Rico, sister island to Cuba), to extend fogging beyond the
immediate district where they were found. - Mod.JW]

Cuba: Dengue Fever Cases Imported from Guatemala and Venezuela
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Cuban doctor reports that several medical and paramedical personnel
returning from international missions in South America are hospitalized with
dengue fever in the Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana. The
main such missions are reported to be in Guatemala & Venezuela.

[This is not surprising, given that most Latin American countries are
suffering from dengue outbreaks at the present time. However, WHO reports
that Cuban health personnel are assisting with the current epidemic in El
Salvador, which has just reported a case of dengue type 4. If they should
return infected with this strain, & it should get out into the pockets of
_Aedes aegypti_ in Havana, Cuba will have a real problem, since it has not
previously experienced that serotype. - Mod.JW]

Mexico: 4 Dengue Fever Deaths Reported
-----------------------------------------
On Fri 31 Aug 2002 officials confirmed 24 cases of dengue and 2 of dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Mexico state, which borders Mexico City. Health
officials were spraying mosquito breeding grounds and said the measures
appeared to be keeping the painful disease away from Mexico City, a
metropolis of 18 million. So far, the mosquito-borne fever has remained in
rural Mexico. Last week, officials in Morelos state, on the southern border
of Mexico City, confirmed 13 cases of dengue and 2 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever.
Federal authorities reported that dengue has killed at least 4 people in
Mexico. The deaths occurred far from Mexico City. Dengue killed 2 women in
the southeastern state of Veracruz, another woman in the southern state of
Campeche, and an elderly man in the Pacific coast state of Colima. Health
officials estimate that nearly 3005 people across Mexico have contracted
non-life-threatening dengue since January 2002. Another 424 have been
treated for the hemorrhagic form.
