****************************

been caused by insufficient vaccination of cattle.

[Readers will remember that this all started with a report of an anthrax
carcass being cleared to go to a sausage factory. Obviously, back checking
has discovered other problems as prior reports had only a half-dozen people
sick. Certainly, if the cattle had been vaccinated they should not have
gone down with anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
