Due to a case of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, daycare [centres] in Sanikiluaq will remain closed "for the time being," Nunavut's chief public health officer said today [28 May 2020]. The public health advisory is intended to prevent the spread of this highly contagious infection within the Hudson Bay community of about 900, Dr Michael Patterson said during the Government of Nunavut's [GN] update on COVID-19 on Thursday [28 May 2020]. But "we do not think this represents a risk or a threat to any other communities in Nunavut", Patterson said.

Whooping cough can be spread easily from person to person, he said. "Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children," said Patterson. "For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq will remain closed for the time being." Normally the GN would not take this action, but the decision was based on the possible risk of infection, he said. Daycares in Nunavut are slated to reopen on 1 Jun 2020 as part of the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the territory. "If we open up the daycares and there is transmission of pertussis in Sanikiluaq, then we have exposed children to an increased risk of transmission and acquisition of pertussis," said Patterson. For children in daycares, Patterson said pertussis is "far more dangerous than COVID", so "that's the rationale for doing it the way we did".

As well, he recommended that everyone in Sanikiluaq continue social distancing, as they have been doing for COVID-19, "at least until we know if there are any other cases in Sanikiluaq". Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, which can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that often makes it hard to breathe. Nunavut has been hit by several outbreaks of whooping cough in recent years, with the most recent big outbreak taking place in 2017 (https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/65674whooping_cough_outbreak_over_say_nunavut_health_officials/).

Every year in Canada, there are 1 to 3 deaths due to whooping cough, mostly in babies under the age of 3 months who have not been immunized, according to Health Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/pertussis-whooping-cough/health-professionals.html).

An outbreak of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, continues in the Hudson Bay community of Sanikiluaq. Nunavut's Health Department said today [18 Jun 2020] that the status of Sanikiluaq's pertussis outbreak remains unchanged since a previous public health advisory about the outbreak on 8 Jun 2020.

The number of confirmed cases is still fewer than 5, the Health Department told Nunatsiaq News in an emailed statement. About 900 people live in Sanikiluaq. "Health staff have been conducting contact tracing and investigation of symptoms to determine if there are additional undetected cases of pertussis within the community," the department said. "Health staff has also been reviewing and updating pertussis vaccinations for community members."

Due to the outbreak, no daycare is open in Sanikiluaq, although others in Nunavut have reopened. But there are no other public health measures currently in place in Sanikiluaq that are "not otherwise implemented elsewhere".

You can learn more about whooping cough by reading the pertussis fact sheet available on the Department of Health's website (https://www.gov.nu.ca/sites/default/files/pertussis_fact_sheet_eng_2.pdf).
