Strains can mutate in patients with immune deficiencies who fight infections for months
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Among the 100 million people around the world who have battled coronavirus infections, scientists are turning to the case of a 45 year old COVID-19 patient in Boston to understand how the virus is able to outwit humans. During his 154 day illness -- one of the longest on record -- the patient's body became a crucible of riotous viral mutation. He offered the world one of the first sightings of a key mutation in the virus's spike protein that set off alarm bells when it was later found in strains in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.

In the [B.1.1.7 strain first identified in the UK], the genetic change known as N501Y is thought to help enhance the virus's transmissibility by about 50%. In the [strain first seen in South Africa, B.1.351], it may reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Tests of its effect on the [variant identified in Brazil] are still in progress.

The Boston patient is now being viewed as an important harbinger of the coronavirus's ability to spin off new and more dangerous versions of itself. Though he died [in] the summer [2020], the medical file he left behind is helping experts anticipate the emergence of new strains by focusing on the role of a growing population of patients with compromised immune systems who battle the virus for months.

Among the sickest of COVID-19 patients, this population of "long haulers" [patients with persistent infection] appears to play a key role in incubating new variants of the coronavirus, some of which could change the trajectory of the pandemic. The mutations that arose from this single patient are "a microcosm of the viral evolution we're seeing globally", said Dr Jonathan Z Li, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who treated him. "He showed us what could happen" when a germ with a knack for genetic shape-shifting stumbles upon conditions that reward it for doing so.

Indeed, situations in which patients can't clear a viral infection are "the worst possible scenario for developing mutations", said Dr Bruce Walker, an immunologist and founding director of the Ragon Institute in Boston. As weeks of illness turn into months, a virus copies itself millions of times. Each copy is an opportunity to make random mistakes. As it spins off new mutations, the virus may happen upon ones that help it resist medications, evade the immune system, and come back stronger.

SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has been an unpredictable adversary. The chance to witness its transformation in near-real time, and see where and how it mutates in a single host, can guide the design of vaccines and medications that don't lose their effectiveness over time, Walker said.

COVID-19 patients were just beginning to fill the beds of Brigham and Women's Hospital in the spring of 2020 when the Boston patient was first admitted. He had a fever, nausea, and a CT of his lungs that bore the hallmark "ground glass" appearance of the new disease, said Li, who was part of a team that detailed the man's case in the New England Journal of Medicine. [see Choi B, Choudhary MC, Regan J, et al. Persistence and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunocompromised host. N Engl J Med. 2020 Dec 3; 383(23): 2291-2293. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2031364. Epub 2020 Nov 11. PMID: 33176080; PMCID: PMC7673303; https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2031364. - Mod.MPP]

But COVID-19 was just one of his challenges. For 22 years, he suffered from a rare disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome, which caused his immune system to attack his own organs and spawn dangerous blood clots throughout his body. To keep his rogue immune system from killing him, the patient required an arsenal of immunosuppressive drugs. But in his fight against the coronavirus, those medicines kept the patient's punching arm tied behind his back.

The Boston patient tested positive for SARS-CoV2 infections 4 separate times over 22 weeks. He was admitted to the hospital 6 times, including stints in intensive care. Doctors treated him with 3 courses of the antiviral medication remdesivir and once with Regeneron's experimental cocktail of monoclonal antibodies.

Swabs taken from his nose and throat during his 2nd hospital stay provided the 1st hint of the virus' startling pace of genetic transformation: Compared with a sample taken during his 1st hospitalization, 11 letters in the coronavirus' 30 000-letter sequence had flipped, and 9 such nucleotides had dropped out.

His next trip to the hospital landed him in the intensive care unit. Tests revealed that 10 more letters in the virus' genetic code had changed and that one more had been deleted in a period of just 5 weeks. 3 weeks later, after he had seemed to recover, he tested positive again and was put on a mechanical ventilator to help him breathe. This time, researchers found 11 more letter changes and 24 more deletions in the virus's genome.

Scientists couldn't say whether the Boston patient was failing to kick the virus or whether it was changing so completely that his immune system couldn't recognize it. One thing was clear: More than half of the alterations occurred in a stretch of genetic code that dictates the structure of the virus' spike protein, the protuberance that latches onto human cells and initiates an infection. The virus' "receptor binding domain" -- essentially the key that picks the lock on a human cell -- accounts for only 2% of the virus' genetic code. But 38% of the mutations spun off during the Boston patient's prolonged illness were concentrated in just that spot.

In late December [2020], British scientists speculated that just such a scenario involving an immunocompromised patient somewhere in England may have spawned the mutations that distinguish the UK strain. Walker said he fears there are many more such patients out there, including people with untreated HIV infections. Immunocompromised by HIV, sick with COVID-19, and given drugs that reward SARS-CoV-2 for devising "escape" mutations, such people could become crucibles of viral mutation.

Scientists in South Africa share that anxiety. "In South Africa, the country with the world's biggest HIV epidemic, one concern has been the prolonged viral replication and intra-host evolution in the context of HIV infection," wrote the authors of a preliminary study that alerted the world to the new variant in early December [2020].

So far, there's no evidence that patients with HIV are more prone to long-lasting cases of COVID-19. And even if they were, a lengthy chain of immunocompromised patients probably would have been necessary to generate the numerous mutations that distinguish the South Africa strain, its discoverers said.

Scientists are still trying to understand how certain mutations like N501Y have cropped up in so many places at once. Has the mushrooming scale of the pandemic given the virus too many opportunities to alter itself? Or are these mutations arising in a small number of people, like the Boston patient, and then somehow hitching a ride around the world? Both factors are probably at work, and the longer and hotter the pandemic rages, the more chances the virus will have to devise random mutations.

The Boston patient shows why that can be so dangerous. In his case, the stretches of genetic code that were most prone to change affected structures that COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are designed to recognize. Now there are hints that the changes could undermine the value of those remedies.

Tulio de Oliveira, an infectious disease researcher at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, sees a pattern in which uncontrolled spread and long-haul infections work in tandem to fuel coronavirus mutations. Many of the places where new variants have been identified -- including South Africa, Britain, and California -- experienced 2 waves of outbreaks divided by just a few months. That, de Oliveira suspects, is no mere coincidence.

In the first wave, he said, the proliferation of infections gives the virus ample opportunity to take on genetic changes that may live on in bodies of immunocompromised patients. By the time a second wave begins, novel variants that were incubating in these long-haulers have also begun to circulate. When they encounter vast numbers of new hosts, the result is a fertile environment for strains to establish themselves -- if their genetic modifications confer some advantage.

The best way to prevent the emergence of more mutations is to both expand vaccinations and do more to protect people with compromised immune systems, De Oliveira said. "If we keep the virus around for a long time, we will be giving it more opportunities to outsmart us," he said.

[When viruses persist in a host as they may in "long haulers", mutations naturally occur as the virus replicates. These genetic changes may become the dominant virus if they outcompete the infecting virus due to the infecting virus' greater sensitivity to the circulating antibodies. - Mod.LK]

[2] Israel
[A] Israel: Pfizer 2nd dose
Date: Sun 31 Jan 2021

How effective is the vaccine's 2nd dose? Israel releases data
The numbers are better than Pfizer's test results.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The newest data from Israel's Ministry of Health shows that 473 people above the age of 60 fell ill after receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine out of 668 100, a rate of 0.066%. The result beats the already high 95% effectiveness rate reported by Pfizer and is in line with earlier ([Thu 28 Jan 2021]) results released by the Health Ministry of 0.04%.

Israel is receiving lots of vaccines after cutting a deal with Pfizer to share all its data with the pharmaceutical giant. The agreement is working out for Israel as 3 005 382 of its citizens have received the 1st dose and 1 728 625 the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Israel leads the world in vaccinating its population (34.3%). UAE is 2nd with 29% and 3rd is Britain with 12.3%.

The country nevertheless is struggling to control the spread of the disease. The Knesset is meeting on Monday [1 Feb 2021] to vote on raising fines for corona violations and extending the current lockdown. Both are likely to pass.

The fast spread of the disease despite a tight lockdown is said to be due to the mutations of the disease, particularly the UK variant [B.1.1.7]. Over the weekend, 5 more cases of the South African variant [B.1.351] were discovered in Israel. A senior Israeli health official said it may be more resistant to the vaccine. "There is some preliminary evidence to say that the effectiveness of the vaccine may be somewhat lower with [B.1.351]," she said.

Addressing the Davos World Economic Forum on Wednesday [27 Jan 2021], prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, "We're in an arms race... it's a race between mutation and vaccination."

The 3rd wave of coronavirus in Israel has also seen a higher proportion of serious cases. There are reports of pregnant women having complications with childbirth. At least 2 babies have died.

The police have also struggled with the Haredi population [ultra orthodox], which is resisting lockdown regulations, leading to clashes. Just on Sunday [31 Jan 2021], thousands of Haredim gathered at a prominent rabbi's funeral in violation of the lockdown.

[B] Israel: vaccination data
Date: Sun 31 Jan 2021 10:08 AM IST
Source: The Times of Israel [abridged, edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-3-million-receive-1st-vaccine-shot-but-covid-outbreak-still-raging/


Israel has administered a 1st vaccine dose to over 3 million of its 9.3 million citizens, the Health Ministry reported on Sunday [31 Jan 2021], as the country's inoculation campaign continues to lead the world in vaccinations per capita, even while it struggles to contain a 3rd outbreak of the virus despite a weeks-long national lockdown.

The data showed that the rate of vaccinations was the highest among those aged 70 to 79, with 92% of that age group having received a 1st dose and 79.9% also having been given a 2nd.

For Israelis over 90, 87.6% had received a 1st dose and 74.4% had received a 2nd. In the 80-89 age group, the figures were at 85% for the 1st dose and 72.8% for the 2nd; for 60-69-year-olds, 75% and 61.2%.

Figures also showed that 63.6% of 50-59 year olds had received a 1st dose of vaccine, 50.1% of 40-49 year olds, 27.9% of 30-39 year olds, and 22.1% of 20-29 year olds.

Israel's mass vaccination program kicked off by giving the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech shots to medical workers, those over the age of 60, and at-risk groups. As the drive has raced ahead the age limit has steadily dropped, going down to 35 this week. Vaccination has also already been opened to teachers of all ages and pregnant women. In addition, many vaccination centers have been offering shots to all who want them at the end of each day in order to prevent extra vaccine units, which must be used within a set amount of time, from going to waste.

The government has set a goal of inoculating the entire over-16 population by late March [2021].

At the same time as the ambitious vaccine drive pushes ahead, the Health Ministry also reported on Sunday [31 Jan 2021] that 10% of the 26 000 coronavirus tests carried out on Saturday [30 Jan 2021] had come back positive. There have now been a total of 640 644 coronavirus cases in the country, including 72 026 active cases. Of the 1814 people hospitalized with the virus, 1162 were defined as serious cases, with 383 in critical condition and 298 on ventilators.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, 4745 coronavirus patients have died, 23 of them on Saturday [30 Jan 2021]. More than 25% of Israel's total COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic have been registered this month [January 2021] alone.

According to Channel 12, health officials are considering a plan to begin reopening preschools and grades 1-3 next Sunday [7 Feb 2021].

[One of the main reasons Israel has been so successful in controlling COVID-19 is its vast public health infrastructure, which it developed through heavy public investment since the creation of the state about 70 years ago. It went into negotiations with the drug companies early in the pandemic [December 2020] proposing to be a "pilot country for the pharma companies [because it is] small and able to put together a massive vaccination program quickly and effectively." Brookings Israel (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/01/05/the-secret-sauce-behind-israels-successful-covid-19-vaccination-program/) struck an agreement with Pfizer to "exchange citizens' data for 10 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine, including a promise of shipments of 400 000-700 000 doses every week. Under this agreement, Israel will provide details to Pfizer (as well as the World Health Organization) about the age, gender, and medical history of those receiving the jab as well as its side effects and efficacy. No identifying information will be given in order to maintain some privacy. Once regulatory approval came in mid-December [2020] -- ahead of the EU -- Israel was waiting with its syringes out, making it worthwhile for Pfizer to remove the 1st vaccines from its production line to one of the 1st countries that would use them."

[Weekend reporting artifact is seen with a 32.3% drop in globally reported cases since Fri 28 Jan 2021, a 38.9% drop in reported deaths; at the country level, there was a 52.7% drop in reported cases by Brazil; a 49.4% drop by Argentina; a 49.1% drop in the Czech Republic, a 45.2% drop by Morocco; a 45.1% drop in Greece; a 35.8% drop by the USA; and a 34.4% drop by Germany.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (111 489), Brazil (27 756), and the UK (21 088) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9514 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 30 Jan to late 31 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, France (19 235), Russia (18 359), Mexico (15 337), Peru (12 364), Indonesia (12 001), India (11 528), and Italy (11 249). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 46 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 12.7% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases have dropped to just over 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 103.51 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.23 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting seen in some African countries and Western Pacific countries. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are having an impact on transmission. - Mod.MPP]
