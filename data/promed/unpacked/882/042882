[EMS (the Russian Emergency Situation Ministry) controls and monitors 155
dangerous infectious diseases. Below is a summary of current situation on
some of the dangerous infectious diseases in the country. Mod.NR]
In Privoljsko Uralsk region, 2 people have been preliminarily diagnosed
with the cutaneous form of anthrax. According to EMS, the source of the
infection was animal slaughter performed without veterinary
expertise. Because laboratory analysis did not confirm the diagnosis,
additional investigations and analysis are being carried out.

[This is all that is contained in the above newswire. But until we get
further details, one can point out that December outbreaks of livestock
anthrax in the northern latitudes are most frequently the result of
contaminated livestock feed, not grazing. Russia has an unfortunate recent
history of contaminated pig feed, and with only 2 cutaneous cases, only one
animal was being butchered without benefit of prior veterinary inspection.
Therefore until there is confirmation I suspect that the source was an
infected pig. - Mod.MHJ]
It is unclear from the above report the exact location of this
incident. In a prior posting, a report from the EMS Privoljsko Uralsk
region referred to an outbreak involving pigs in Ulyanovsk, located in the
Povolzhsky (South-central European) region of Russia. - Mod.MPP]
