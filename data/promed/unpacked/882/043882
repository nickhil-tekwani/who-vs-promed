Two people died, and 5 others are currently admitted at Rift Valley General Hospital after eating remains of a dead cow from Barut in Nakuru county. The cow is suspected to have died from anthrax.

The victims developed wounds and swellings before being rushed to the nearby clinic then later taken to a referral hospital. A parent, whose 6-year old-son was one of the admitted victims, said there are many cases of animals dying in the area. The residents always slaughter and eat the dead cows.

Jane Gishuhi, a nurse in charge of an isolation ward at the general hospital, said the victims brought in are now in stable condition. Gishuhi urged people not to eat any animals found dead.

[This, unfortunately, is an all too often series of events south of the Sahara, where dead animals are skinned and butchered. It is a result of rural poverty, and the absence in this report of any prior livestock vaccination status and veterinary response reflects an unfortunate state of affairs. A more complete report of events in Barut is awaited.
