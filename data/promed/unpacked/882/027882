[1] Questions remaining about COVID
Date: Tue 20 Apr 2021
Source: STAT [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/20/we-know-a-lot-about-covid-19-experts-have-many-more-questions/


Less than a year and a half ago, the world was blissfully, dangerously ignorant of the existence of a coronavirus that would soon turn life on Earth on its head.

In the 16 months since the SARS-CoV-2 virus burst into the global consciousness, we've learned much about this new health threat. People who contract the virus are infectious before they develop symptoms and are most infectious early in their illness. Getting the public to wear masks, even homemade ones, can reduce transmission. Vaccines can be developed, tested, and put into use within months. As they say, where there's a will, there's a way.

But many key questions about SARS-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19, continue to bedevil scientists.

STAT was curious which questions topped scientists' lists. So, we asked a bunch. More than 2 dozen virologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and evolutionary biologists shared with us their top question. (Some ... cheated, submitting several.)

There was surprising diversity in the questions, though many cluster around certain themes, such as the nature of immunity or the impact of viral variants. Knowing what scientists still want to learn shows us how far we've come -- and how far we have left to go to solve the mysteries of SARS-2 and COVID-19.

What accounts for the wide variety of human responses to this virus?
Some people who contract SARS-2 never know they're infected. Others have flulike symptoms -- some mild, some more debilitating. Some recover completely, others go on to suffer from the puzzling condition that's come to be known as long COVID. Some die.

What predisposes individuals to those various and varied outcomes? That's the question that perplexes Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security.

An obvious answer might be how much virus individuals are exposed to when they get infected. In other words, lots of virus equals more severe disease. But Rasmussen said animal studies don't show dose as being a factor here. Some preexisting health problems, like diabetes, seem to put people at higher risk of getting more severely ill, but even they don't explain all the variability. Some people without comorbidities, as they're called, become profoundly ill.

"To me, the data (and all the virus research I've ever done) suggests the host response is a major determinant, if not THE major determinant, of disease severity," Rasmussen wrote. She wants to know why some immune systems handle the virus with ease while others get swamped.

How much immunity is enough immunity?
Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, submitted only one question and it was very specific: He wants to know the exact measurements of antibodies needed to fend off asymptomatic COVID and symptomatic disease. "I guess you could say that I want to know which type of immune response indicates protection," said Krammer. "It is likely indicated by a single antibody titer for each of the types of protection."

Nahid Bhadelia, medical director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center, is also eager to quantify how much immunity is enough, so we can determine who is protected and who needs to have their immunity boosted. "We do this for measles now, for example -- if there is an exposure, we check antibodies," said Bhadelia.

Sarah Cobey, associate professor of viral ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago, thinks the issue might be more complicated. In her view, beyond specific antibody levels, physiological factors that vary from individual to individual are probably also part of the equation. "It would be nice to know exactly what we should measure and how to interpret it," she said.

This could be among the factors that help explain why there's so much variability in people's susceptibility to the virus, and the severity of disease they experience if they contract it. "Knowing how well a partially immune population could transmit the virus at any time could dramatically improve forecasting and the potential for effective policy responses," Cobey added.

How often will reinfections happen and what will they be like?
So far, the vast majority of people who contracted COVID haven't caught it again. If this coronavirus is like its cousins -- 4 human coronaviruses that cause colds -- reinfections will occur. How often will they happen? Will they be milder? What's the impact of the variants -- viruses that have acquired significant mutations -- on reinfections, asked Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute.

Paul Bieniasz, head of the laboratory of retrovirology at Rockefeller University, has similar questions. "Are we headed for a situation akin to what occurs with the seasonal coronaviruses where the virus and reinfection is common but associated with only mild disease, with periodic reinfection providing boosts to immunity?" he asked. "Alternatively, will infection in those with waning immunity be associated with an unacceptable disease burden, necessitating a constant ongoing battle, with updated vaccines to keep viral prevalence and disease low?"

Put another way, how long will immunity last?
Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, would like to know how long immunity lasts -- immunity after infection and after vaccination. Knowing this would allow for better use of scarce vaccines, she suggested.

Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, also listed this as her question, noting that the answers will tell us how achievable herd immunity is, and whether and when vaccine booster shots will be needed. "It could be that protection against infection is comparatively short-lived, but protection against severe disease is longer lasting," Dean said. "It could be that vaccine-induced protection has a different durability than infection-induced protection."

- How are viral variants going to impact the battle against COVID-19?
- What is long COVID, who is at risk of developing it, and can it be prevented?
- What's the deal with COVID and kids?
- How big a role do asymptomatically infected people actually play in SARS-2 transmission?
- What does the future hold for SARS-2, evolutionarily and otherwise?
- Can we figure out who might become a superspreader?
- Can we learn more [and] quicker from the study of the genetic sequences of SARS-2 viruses?
- The impact of the nonpharmaceutical interventions?
- The differences between SARS-2 and its older cousin, SARS-1?
- Last but not least: Where did SARS-2 come from?

[2] Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)

Abstract
--------
Background: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCov-19 rarely causes vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) that -- like autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia -- is mediated by platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies.

Methods: We investigated vaccine, PF4, and VITT patient-derived anti-PF4 antibody interactions using dynamic light scattering, 3D-super-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze vaccine composition. We investigated the mechanism for early post-vaccine inflammatory reactions as potential co-stimulant for anti-PF4 immune response. Finally, we evaluated VITT antibodies for inducing release of procoagulant DNA-containing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and measured DNase activity in VITT patient serum.

Results: Biophysical analyses showed formation of complexes between PF4 and vaccine constituents, including virus proteins that were recognized by VITT antibodies. EDTA, a vaccine constituent, increased microvascular leakage in mice, allowing for circulation of virus- and virus-producing cell culture-derived proteins. Antibodies in normal sera cross-reacted with human proteins in the vaccine and likely contribute to commonly observed acute ChAdOx1 nCov-19 post-vaccination inflammatory reactions. Polyphosphates and DNA enhanced PF4-dependent platelet activation by VITT antibodies. In the presence of platelets, PF4 enhanced VITT antibody-driven procoagulant NET formation, while DNase activity was reduced in VITT sera, with granulocyte-rich cerebral vein thrombosis observed in a VITT patient.

Conclusions: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine constituents (i) form antigenic complexes with PF4, (ii) EDTA increases microvascular permeability, and (iii) vaccine components cause acute inflammatory reactions. Antigen formation in a proinflammatory milieu offers an explanation for anti-PF4 antibody production. High-titer anti-PF4 antibodies activate platelets and induce neutrophil activation and NET formation, fueling the VITT prothrombotic response.

[3] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

An analysis of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use at 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in the greater Paris area during France's 1st COVID-19 wave reveal that 90-day survival was strongly linked to a hospital's earlier experience with the procedure. Investigators from France detailed their findings yesterday [19 Apr 2021] in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

During France's 1st surge, clinicians in Paris organized ECMO indications and pooled resources, which consisted of 6 mobile ECMO teams to cover the region. For the study, the group looked at the outcomes of all 302 COVID-19 patients who received ECMO from 8 Mar-3 Jun 2020, finding a survival rate of 46%.

The most common causes of death were multiorgan failure and septic shock. Factors independently associated with increased 90-day survival included treatment in centers that managed at least 30 ECMO cases a year. Others were shorter time between intubation and ECMO, younger age, and patients' higher pre-ECMO renal score. Investigators didn't see a difference between patients who had mobile or on-site ECMO.

In a related commentary, experts from the Netherlands and Germany wrote that the low survival rate in relative young people without severe underlying conditions is sobering and suggests that lung failure from SARS-CoV-2 is worse compared with other acute respiratory diseases. They also noted that ECMO complications in COVID-19 patients, especially intracranial hemorrhage and ventilator-associated pneumonia, was striking compared with other ECMO populations.

They conclude that regional cooperation like what occurred in Paris will continue to be needed, along with continued analysis of how to improve critical care treatment of the sickest patients. "Selection of appropriate patients remains highly important, especially in times of crisis when equipment might become scarce. Younger age, shorter time from intubation to ECMO, and absence of renal failure can improve outcomes."

Summary
Background: In the Ile-de-France region (henceforth termed Greater Paris), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was considered early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report ECMO network organisation and outcomes during the 1st wave of the pandemic.

Methods: In this multicentre cohort study, we present an analysis of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe ARDS requiring ECMO who were admitted to 17 Greater Paris intensive care units between 8 Mar 2020 and 3 Jun 2020. Central regulation for ECMO indications and pooling of resources were organised for the Greater Paris intensive care units, with 6 mobile ECMO teams available for the region. Details of complications (including ECMO-related complications, renal replacement therapy, and pulmonary embolism), clinical outcomes, survival status at 90 days after ECMO initiation, and causes of death are reported. Multivariable analysis was used to identify pre-ECMO variables independently associated with 90-day survival after ECMO.

Findings: The 302 patients included who underwent ECMO had a median age of 52 years (IQR 45-58) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II of 40 (31-56), and 235 (78%) of whom were men. 165 (55%) were transferred after cannulation by a mobile ECMO team. Before ECMO, 285 (94%) patients were prone positioned, median driving pressure was 18 cm H2O (14-21), and median ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen was 61 mm Hg (IQR 54-70). During ECMO, 115 (43%) of 270 patients had a major bleeding event, 27 of whom had intracranial haemorrhage; 130 (43%) of 301 patients received renal replacement therapy; and 53 (18%) of 294 had a pulmonary embolism. 138 (46%) patients were alive 90 days after ECMO. The most common causes of death were multiorgan failure (53 [18%] patients) and septic shock (47 [16%] patients). Shorter time between intubation and ECMO (odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.99] per day decrease), younger age (2.89 [1.41-5.93] for less than or equal to 48 years and 2.01 [1.01-3.99] for 49-56 years vs greater than or equal to 57 years), higher pre-ECMO renal component of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0.67, 0.55-0.83 per point increase), and treatment in centres managing at least 30 venovenous ECMO cases annually (2.98 [1.46-6.04]) were independently associated with improved 90-day survival. There was no significant difference in survival between patients who had mobile and on-site ECMO initiation.

Interpretation: Beyond associations with similar factors to those reported on ECMO for non-COVID-19 ARDS, 90-day survival among ECMO-assisted patients with COVID-19 was strongly associated with a centre's experience in venovenous ECMO during the previous year. Early ECMO management in centres with a high venovenous ECMO case volume should be advocated, by applying centralisation and regulation of ECMO indications, which should also help to prevent a shortage of resources.

Comment:
Ref. Lorusso R, Mueller T: COVID-19 and ECMO: a call for close cooperation and more investigation. Published: 19 Apr 2021; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00128-4.

...A survival of less than 50% in patients without severe comorbidities and an average age of 52 years, who need ECMO due to an acute viral respiratory infection, is sobering. The results contrast strongly with the findings from the EOLIA trial in 2018, which reported a 60-day survival of 65% in the ECMO group.

Notably, ECMO indications and management in the current study were largely derived from EOLIA. Thus, the question arises whether lung failure due to SARS-CoV-2 is worse compared with acute respiratory distress of other origins. It probably is. 1st, there is no effective treatment against the virus, and therapy is largely supportive, while waiting for the immune response of the body. 2nd, the number of serious complications during ECMO therapy of this well-documented COVID-19 cohort is substantially higher compared with data from EOLIA. The difference in intracranial haemorrhage is striking (27 [12%] of 223 patients with data vs 2% in EOLIA), and ventilator-associated pneumonia was very common (257 [85%] of 301 patients vs 39% in EOLIA). The incidence of pulmonary embolism is not reported in EOLIA but was diagnosed in 53 (18%) of 294 patients in the current study, which possibly missed a relevant number because of unavailable CT scans. Due to the hypercoagulability previously observed in COVID-19, the authors decided a priori to follow a more enhanced anticoagulation protocol with a goal of activated partial thromboplastin time of 60-75 s (compared with 40-55 s in EOLIA). It remains unknown whether this or a virus-induced endothelial injury could have caused the high frequency of intracranial haemorrhage, as confirmed in other series.

The unparalleled high incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia might be due to a prolonged time on ECMO (a median of 17 days for survivors) or to an acquired immune paralysis by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the cardiocirculatory involvement in patients with COVID-19 and its impact on the final outcome is still far from being clearly understood, and not reported by Lebreton and colleagues.

Is progress possible in this cohort of critically ill patients in the future? Again, it probably is. 1st, Lebreton and colleagues' study suggests several important considerations. Selection of appropriate patients remains highly important, especially in times of crisis when equipment might become scarce. Younger age, shorter time from intubation to ECMO, and absence of renal failure can improve outcomes. Also noteworthy is the observation that previous substantial experience of ICUs with venovenous ECMO (defined by the authors as at least 30 cases annually) was found to increase survival to 60%. Thus, centralisation of venovenous ECMO to dedicated high-volume expert units should be pursued, making mobile ECMO teams essential for realising this objective.

2nd, ventilatory management in the current study was derived from EOLIA. Although EOLIA is the best available randomised controlled trial on the use of ECMO versus protective conventional ventilation, it did not study the best mode of ventilation on ECMO. A driving pressure of 13 cm H2O and a respiratory frequency of 20 breaths per min, as observed in the current study, will still place substantial mechanical power on a severely injured lung. Further investigation into different modes of mechanical ventilation during ECMO is needed to analyse whether the often observed pronounced reduction of pulmonary compliance with diffuse alveolar damage and risk of fibrotic change can be lessened. Anticoagulation will need to be individualised and adapted to different stages of COVID-19. In addition, a positive preliminary experience of combined cardiorespiratory support, applied from the start of ECMO in these patients, is interesting and promising.

Finally, we do not know whether experience from the 1st wave can be transferred to the cases that follow. Almost all patients who now develop refractory respiratory failure have been pretreated with remdesivir and steroids and have often remained on high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation for extended periods of time. Not uncommonly, severe hypercapnia with stiff lungs has become a leading problem necessitating ECMO.

In conclusion, to be able to combat COVID-19 lung failure successfully in the future, continuing supraregional interdisciplinary cooperation will be needed, as shown convincingly in the Greater Paris area. Still, thorough ongoing investigations are required, and all the aforementioned aspects underline the clear need for more in-depth analysis of patient profiles, response to ECMO support, and, particularly, the careful assessment of treatment failures. Is the appalling death rate in this pandemic unavoidably due to overwhelming and unpreventable disease-related complications, or will optimised management and growing experience eventually overcome SARS-CoV-2? These questions remain to be answered.

[4] Obesity
Date: Tue 20 Apr 2021

Overweight and obese people are more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require supplementary oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation than healthy-weight peers, according to a new study in Diabetes Care that further spotlights these key risk factors.

But according to the study -- based on 7244 COVID-19 patients from 18 hospitals in 11 countries -- being overweight or obese was not associated with an increased risk of death.

Among the patients, 34.8% were overweight and 30.8% were obese. The 65.6% patients who were obese and overweight were more likely to require oxygen or noninvasive ventilatory support (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03-1.46) than patients with normal body mass indexes (BMIs).

There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74-1.04), the authors said.

The results were similar to patients who had diabetes. The authors said about 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. The authors suggested that obese and overweight patients may experience higher levels of inflammation and more shortness of breath.

"Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI, because patients with either overweight or obesity are at risk for severe COVID-19. Although reducing the current levels of overweight and obesity is unlikely in the short term to have an impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, doing so may contribute to reducing disease burden in future viral pandemics," the authors concluded.

Objective. Obesity is an established risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the contribution of overweight and/or diabetes remains unclear. In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI associated risk was increased among those with diabetes.

Research design and methods. We retrospectively extracted data from health-care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis.

Results. Among 7244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Conclusions. In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight, obesity, and diabetes were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support but were not associated with death. In patients with diabetes, the odds of severe COVID-19 were not increased above the BMI-associated risk.
