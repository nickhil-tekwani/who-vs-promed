[According to Azerbaijan's official report to the OIE, submitted 29 Jan
2008, "the affected population includes about 1200 houses with backyards. A
rise of temperature, anorexia, digestive troubles and bloody faeces were
observed." See the notification, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6730>.

Earlier (unofficial) information disclosed outbreaks of ASF in
Nogorno-Karabakh, a de facto independent republic, located in the South
Caucasus and officially part of the Republic of Azerbaijan, very close to
its border with Armenia.

According to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE; World
Organisation for Animal Health) ASF map (see at

zoom in to the Caucasus region), accessed 1 Feb 2008, the ASF outbreaks in
Abkhazia, Chechnya, and Azerbaijan are "continuing," while the disease in
Georgia, Armenia and Ajaria is "resolved". The epizootic started in April
2007 in Georgia, but was diagnosed and reported only in June 2007. Later,
it spread to neighbouring countries. This spread seems to continue. - Mod.AS]
