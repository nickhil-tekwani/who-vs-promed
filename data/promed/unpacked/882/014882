Public health authorities in the UK have issued a warning about a highly drug-resistant strain of a serious bacterial gut infection that can be contracted through sex, AIDSmap reports. Between March and November 2018, 17 cases of _Shigella_ dysentery with resistance to several 1st-line antimicrobials were detected. It appears that transmission is clustered among gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM). As many as 14 of the 17 UK cases involve men and 9 further cases have been identified in the USA, all involving MSM, AIDSmap reports.

Standard treatment with 1st line antimicrobials such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone may not be effective, though other oral antimicrobials will still work.

_Shigella_ causes severe, prolonged diarrhea and stomach cramps. It is transmitted by contact with very small amounts of human feces and can be passed on during certain sexual activities. Rimming, fingering, fisting, anal sex, handling sex toys after use in the anus and occasionally oral sex can all carry a risk. The bacterium may pass from fingers to the mouth, AIDSmap reports.

Symptoms typically occur within 3 days of exposure and include frequent diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours, stomach cramps, fever, vomiting, general weakness and tiredness. Shigellosis can be especially serious in HIV-positive individuals who have low CD4 counts.

The multi-drug resistant cases were identified between March and November 2018. A total of 8 of the cases were in London, but smaller numbers have also been diagnosed in all other UK regions.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
