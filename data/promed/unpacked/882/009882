The deadly hepatitis A outbreak in Louisville and other parts of Kentucky is now the worst in the nation. And the crisis hasn't crested. Statewide, at least 969 people have contracted the liver disease, state health officials confirmed [Wed 27 Jun 2018]. "It's the worst on record across the nation and in Kentucky," said Dr Jeff Howard, Kentucky Commissioner of Public Health.

Kentucky's confirmed cases have surpassed those in Michigan, which had 846 reported cases as of 20 Jun 2018, according to data from state health departments and the CDC. Kentucky's current outbreak already has targeted 4 times more victims than the state's last epidemic in 1988. Only one died then. The current crisis has killed 6. 3 of those deaths were in Louisville.

Louisville health officials confirmed 482 cases, said Dave Langdon, spokesman for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. That's the worst outbreak here in decades, he said. He couldn't confirm if it's the worst outbreak in the city's history. "Sharing a home, a cigarette, marijuana joint, a drink, or sex with someone who has the virus puts you at high risk," according an advisory on the city's website. The 8 other states that have reported outbreaks include: Indiana, California, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, Utah and West Virginia, CDC spokeswoman Donnica Smalls said.

The virus was first detected in Louisville last fall [2017] and mostly impacts drug users and adults who are homeless or people who work with them. It can be spread through contact with objects, surfaces, food, or drinks contaminated by feces or stool from an infected person.

About 10 percent of Louisville's victims weren't in a high-risk category. One example is a medical sales rep who was among Louisville's earliest victims. She was baffled by her diagnosis. She described missing work for 3 months due to virus symptoms that felt "1000 times worse than the flu." Dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea sent her to the hospital 3 times and she suffered tremors, joint and back pain, fatigue, and trouble forming sentences. She spoke with a local epidemiologist in November 2017, when there were just 20 local victims. She was diagnosed in October 2017 but believes she contracted the disease in late August or early September 2017 from one of the many restaurants she frequents.

Louisville and Kentucky health officials say they haven't found one confirmed case linked to a patron eating at a restaurant despite some restaurant workers contracting the virus. Regardless, many restaurant workers have been vaccinated as a precaution. "The risk of contamination is extremely low" if contaminated food-handlers wash their hands or wear gloves, Howard said.

CDC epidemiologists have been studying Kentucky's outbreak for months, with trips and calls to Louisville. "This is occurring in many, many states," Howard said, with Louisville considered one of the ground zeroes. "Most of our cases are linked to the San Diego-Utah outbreak."

He also said there have been cases in Kentucky of the same strain as some, but not all, of the cases in Indiana as well as cases in the Detroit, Michigan area and Arkansas.

Kentucky's drug epidemic has played a role in fueling the hepatitis A outbreak, with more than half of the state's cases linked to illicit drug use. Less than one percent of the Kentucky cases have been fatal, considered a low rate, Howard said.

That's not simply luck. Kentucky health officials identified the outbreak early and developed a plan of attack that included securing vaccines, notifying the public and the CDC and vaccinating people at homeless shelters and camps, needle exchange sites and at jails.

The 11 other counties reporting 5 or more cases are: Ballard, Grayson, Ohio, Rowan, Shelby, Whitley, Fayette, Powell, Lincoln, Grant, and Bourbon. State health officials are working to get them funding for vaccines and to coordinate with local jails and agencies providing services to people who are homeless or abusing drugs. The other deaths were in Ballard, Meade, and Greenup counties.

Rui Zhao, communicable disease supervisor for Louisville Metro's health department, said 63 percent of Jefferson County's victims reported illicit drug use, but that percentage is likely higher. "There's a lot of fear they will get in trouble. But if they tell us about drug use, we don't share that information with law enforcement," he said. Zhao also said people can be hesitant to share personal details such as sexual encounters between men, which is a risk factor. He cautioned residents who don't have these risk factors against feeling immune because the virus is "indiscriminate."

Some residents may wonder if they had the vaccine as a child and didn't know it. Dr Paul Schulz, infectious diseases specialist and system epidemiologist for Norton Healthcare, said that's unlikely unless they traveled abroad or were in a high-risk population. That's because the vaccine wasn't available until 1995 and wasn't added to the child immunization schedule until 1999, he said.

When Louisville suffered its last outbreak in 1988, more than 200 victims contracted the virus, including a Louisville firefighter. Contaminated lettuce on a ham sandwich from a downtown lunch spot that is no longer open caused him to miss 3 months of work. "I can remember laying in there in my bed when I was sickest, thinking, 'Gosh, I'm glad I don't have a gun in this house,' " he said. It took 3 more months of fatigue before he felt semi-normal.

The hepatitis A outbreak has reached a total of 34 confirmed cases in Nashville. The cases were reported and confirmed between December 2017 and 27 Jun 2018. Officials with the Metro Public Health Department said they continue to work with the Tennessee Department of Health as well as other Metro Departments and community organizations in response to the outbreak.

"Metro Public Health Department staff, working with multiple community partners, continues to plan additional opportunities to offer the hepatitis A vaccine to the at-risk communities," said Rachel Franklin, Interim Director of Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness. "This week we added 3 vaccination clinics to reach people experiencing homelessness. Our staff vaccinated nearly 200 among the at-risk group at last weekend's PRIDE Festival [23-24 Jun 2018] and we are planning additional locations to offer the vaccine in the coming weeks to reach the MSM [men who have sex with men] community."

The Health Department has worked with the Metropolitan Homelessness Commission staff on a hepatitis A vaccine campaign to reach the homeless. That initial vaccination effort began 18 Jun 2018 and will run through 6 Jul 2018.

Some 4000 diners may have been exposed to hepatitis A after a Hardee's restaurant employee in North Carolina contracted the infection.

The Mecklenburg County Public Health Department announced the county was experiencing an outbreak of hepatitis A on 6 Jun 2018 after 5 cases, beginning on 20 Apr 2018, were confirmed. Since the initial announcement, 5 additional cases of the viral infection have been confirmed.

Given that one of the cases was a Hardee's employee who handled food, Public Health Director Gibbie Harris encouraged anyone who dined at the Hardee's on Little Rock Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, between [13-23 Jun 2018] to get a vaccination. In order to be effective, the vaccine must be administered within 14 days of exposure, which poses a time crunch problem for anyone exposed on [13 Jun 2018], as the 14-day deadline came one day after the health department's press release.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies hepatitis A as highly contagious and explained it can be transmitted through food that comes in contact with someone who has the virus.

The Public Health Department is hosting a series of vaccination clinics throughout Charlotte for Hardee's customers who may have been exposed or residents who qualify as "high risk," including:
- those who are household members, caregivers, or have sexual contact with someone who is infected with hepatitis A;
- men who have sexual encounters with other men;
- those who use recreational drugs, whether injected or not;
- recent travel from countries where hepatitis A is common;
- homeless individuals who do not have easy access to handwashing facilities.

[This North Carolina incident is only one of many, many continuing reports of food service workers in the USA being diagnosed with hepatitis A. As quite large outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred and are occurring in a number of states including Michigan, California, Kentucky, Utah, and West Virginia and smaller ones in other states including Tennessee, North Carolina, and Ohio, spillover into the food service industry is occurring. Below are a selection of other reports of spillovers:

Papa John's employee in Mitchell diagnosed with hepatitis A

Universal immunization for HAV in childhood has not been functioning long enough, so most adults in the USA, especially if born in the USA, are susceptible to the virus. Other than for monetary reasons, it is not clear why policies are not in effect so that all food service workers are immunized against HAV. Healthcare workers are required to have influenza vaccine to protect our patients; why are we not protecting unsuspecting diners against HAV? - Mod.LL
