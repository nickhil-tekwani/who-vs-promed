Since April 2008, 552 persons infected with _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint have been
identified in 32 states and the District of Columbia. These were
identified because clinical laboratories in all states send
Salmonella strains from ill persons to their State public health
laboratory for characterization. The marked increase in reported ill
persons since the last update is not thought to be due to a large
number of new infections. The number of reported ill persons
increased mainly because some states improved surveillance in
response to this outbreak and because laboratory identification of
many previously submitted strains was completed.

In particular, the number of ill persons reported from Texas markedly
increased, and 2 new states, New Jersey and Rhode Island, reported
ill persons. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as
follows: Arkansas (3 persons), Arizona (29), California (8), Colorado
(4), Connecticut (4), Florida (1), Georgia (11), Idaho (3), Illinois
(34), Indiana (8), Kansas (9), Kentucky (1), Maryland (18), Michigan
(4), Missouri (10), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico
(73), New York (10), North Carolina (1), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (5),
Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (5), Rhode Island (2), Tennessee (4), Texas
(265), Utah (2), Virginia (20), Vermont (1), Washington (1),
Wisconsin (5), and the District of Columbia (1).

Among the 281 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 10 Jun 2008. Patients range in age from less
than 1 to 88 years; 49 percent are female. At least 53 persons were
hospitalized. No deaths have been officially attributed to this outbreak.

[Over the 2 days since the previous CDC update, there have been 217
more linked cases (more than half of them in Texas), 2 more states
involved and at least some cases beginning as late as 10 Jun 2008
(previous latest date was 5 days earlier. - Mod.LL]

There may be a break in the salmonella case: FDA inspectors headed
for farms in Florida and Mexico on Friday [20 Jun 2008], as new clues
emerge to the possible source of salmonella-tainted tomatoes that
have now sickened 552 people. The FDA wouldn't say where in Florida
and Mexico the hunt is centering. But officials stressed that the
clues don't necessarily mean that a particular farm will turn out to
be the culprit.

Investigators will pay special attention to big packing houses or
distribution warehouses that handle tomatoes from many farms and
where contamination could be spread, leading to what now appears to
be the nation's largest-ever salmonella outbreak from tomatoes.

"It does not mean definitively the contamination occurred on a farm
in Mexico or on a farm in Florida," said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's
food safety chief. "This is not just the farms that we're inspecting,
it's the whole distribution chain."

A surge of newly confirmed cases moved Friday's official count to 552
illnesses in 32 states, pushing the outbreak into record territory.
In 2004, government records show there were 3 separate
tomato-and-salmonella outbreaks that together totaled 561 illnesses,
the largest of which sickened 429 people. Most of the newly reported
cases were people who became sick in April or May but just completed
testing to prove they had the outbreak strain of salmonella.

But the latest victim got sick on 10 Jun 2008, meaning the outbreak
may not be over. And Texas is clearly its center, with a doubling of
known cases from 131 confirmed earlier in the week to 265 as of 20 Jun 2008.

"These 552 may actually represent several thousand illnesses in the
USA," cautioned Dr. Ian Williams of the CDC. Previous research shows
that for every case of salmonella reported to the government, 30 or
more people get sick but don't see a doctor or undergo confirmatory
testing, he noted.

The FDA already had said that central and southern Florida and parts
of Mexico were suspects because they supplied the vast majority of
tomatoes sold when the outbreak began in April 2008. (In contrast,
tomatoes currently being harvested in north Florida and Baja Mexico
have been cleared as safe to eat.) But Friday [20 Jun 2008] marked a
big step in the monthlong investigation. Investigators have been
tracking where the sick said they bought or ate tomatoes, and then
where those retailers or restaurants in turn bought them. After a lot
of frustrating dead ends, the probe finally yielded a set of clues --
a list of farms in Florida and Mexico that seem to have been at least
part of that supply -- plus records showing the packing houses and
other distribution stops between farm and point of sale.

"A tomato that made somebody sick in Vermont has come a long way,"
Acheson pointed out. "A lot of suppliers and warehouses have
potentially handled that tomato. ... It could be anywhere on that
distribution chain where all these tomatoes were together at one point."

So FDA inspectors, working together with Florida state officials and
Mexican regulators, will start at the farms and fan out to packing
sheds and beyond, in hopes of finding spots where tomatoes from the
farms of interest intersected. The FDA isn't aware of anyone in
Mexico infected with the same strain of salmonella that is causing
the outbreak, Acheson noted.

Investigators aren't stopping their interviews of the sick, in case
the latest clues don't pan out. Top of that list: Texas health
officials have alerted the FDA to a cluster of patients who appear to
have gotten sick from the same source, potentially offering a way to
narrow the hunt, Acheson said.
