RASH DISEASE, PHILIPPINE WORKERS - TAIWAN (02)
=============================
[see
Rash disease, Philippine workers - Taiwan 970303153609]
[ProMED-mail has received numerous messages regarding the fatal illness in
Filipino workers at a factory in Taiwan. Three of these messages are posted
below. As the original information we received was sketchy, it would be a
waste of further space and of the time of our readers to post more questions
without additional detailed information about this episode. Unless such
information is forthcoming, we will cut the string here. In retrospect, it
seems silly to have started this "conversation" in the first place. My
fault; I apologize. -- Mod CHC]

Although there is a dearth of data on this epidemic at the Philips plant in
Taiwan which affected Filipino workers only, I'd like to hazard a guess at
its pathophysiology.
Fever is the key, along with liver abnormalities. I suspect the workers have
somehow become exposed to an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation...leading to uncontolled metabolic activity without
generation of high energy substrates, and therefore fever. Arsenic, some tin
compounds, and aspirin are examples of poisons which have this action.
Uncouplers can cause liver problems, and lead to death. Rash can accompany
various toxins, and itch (probably due to deposition of bile acids in the
skin) frequently accompanies severe liver disease.
Possibly a combination of exposures affected the way the key toxin was
metabolized. Possibly Filipinos have a genetic predisposition which makes
them more susceptible to certain toxins. Has anyone done studies on the
patients' phase I and II hepatic detoxification?
One lab which does these studies is Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory,
Asheville, North Carolina. Email address is <cs@gsdl.com>, web page at
www.gdsl.com.
Obviously, toxicology studies are key, with a focus on heavy metals, although
a wide net should be cast, since many toxins which likely affect oxidative
phosphorylation have (I suspect) not yet been identified as having that
action on the molecular level.
My best wishes to the docs and scientists who will be sorting this out!

Do they have some description of this disease? Symptoms, physical findings?
