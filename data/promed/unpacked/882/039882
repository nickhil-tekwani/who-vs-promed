Health officials are investigating an increase in _E. coli_ infections throughout Utah. The spread of fecal bacteria might be coming from petting zoos, corn mazes, and farms that are popular this time of year.

Since 1 Oct 2018, 20 cases have been reported along the Wasatch Front and central and southwestern regions of the state. The caseload is higher than the usual 13 _E. coli_ infections reported to the Utah Department of Health the past 5 Octobers [2013-2017], according to Kenneth Davis, an epidemiologist with the health department. "An average of 113 (Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_) cases and 25 hospitalizations are reported each year in Utah," he said. "This increase in October [2018] is higher than normally expected." He said cases range in age from 10 months to 71 years, and 11 are younger than 18. Six people have been hospitalized, but no deaths due to the bacterial infection have been reported.

Several of the ill individuals, the health department reports, have visited places where they might have had contact with contaminated food or water, raw milk and cattle, or contact with the feces of infected people. "People visiting petting zoos and areas where cattle have been are at greater risk of contracting _E. coli_, especially if they are not practicing good hand hygiene," a health department release stated.

Symptoms of this type of _E. coli_ infection typically show up 3 to 4 days after exposure and include stomach cramps, vomiting and often bloody diarrhea. Conditions improve after about a week, but some infections can be more severe or even life-threatening, leading to kidney failure. Young children and the elderly are most at risk of serious illness, but the health department warns that even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill following _E. coli_ infection.

Proper hand-washing before and after food preparation, using the bathroom and changing diapers, or after touching animals or places where feces are present can help to reduce chances of getting and spreading the potentially harmful and incredibly contagious infection. The health department also cautions people with diarrhea to stay home from work or school, specifically food handlers, health care workers and child care providers. It also advises food safety, including cleaning, storing and cooking food properly, as well as avoiding unpasteurized dairy and juice products. It is also important to not swallow water where people sit, such as lakes, ponds, streams and swimming pools of any kind. There is no treatment [recommended] for this type of _E. coli_. Antimicrobials and anti-diarrheal medications could make symptoms more severe.

[It is important to understand that there are many different kinds of _E coli_. The organism is an important component of the human intestinal tract and can perform important functions helpful to its host. These strains can cause human infections if they "escape" from the usual location into the urinary tract, gall bladder, or abdominal cavity. They are also what are mentioned when a beach is closed for _E. coli_ contamination. In this circumstance, officials are measuring the organism or "coliforms" in the water to reflect human sewage contamination.

Additionally, there are some strains of _E coli_ that can produce toxins that can produce diarrhea, and much of so-called travelers' diarrhea is caused by these strains. All of these strains are human bacteria, not zoonotic organisms, that is, not spread from animal hosts. One _E coli_ group called Shiga toxin producing or enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ (EHEC) are zoonotic and are the type discussed in this post. Spread in a number of ways, including via undercooked ground beef, contaminated vegetables, and direct or direct contact with farm animals, EHEC can cause significant disease and even death. - Mod.LL
