["Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by_ B. abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_."

"Clinically, infection with _Brucella_ in animals is characterized by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis, and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions, or from tissues removed at post-mortem.

"_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures, and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions."

"Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _Brucella abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa, and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_."

"Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis, and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes. Hygromas, usually involving leg joints, are a common manifestation of brucellosis in some tropical countries and may be the only obvious indicator of infection; the hygroma fluid is often infected with _Brucella_."
