How many dairy sheep and dairy goats are there in the Netherlands?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
According to the 2009 data of the Dutch agricultural census, there
are 230 000 dairy goats in the Netherlands, distributed among 600
farms. About half of them keep more than 100 goats. Most of the goat
holdings are situated in the provinces Gelderland and Noord Brabant.
The number of dairy sheep is estimated to be about 10 000. There are
about 40 commercially operational, milk producing sheep farms.

Coutinho: alarm system for animal diseases
------------------------------------------
An alert system should be established, to detect dangerous infectious
diseases in cattle and other animals. This was said by infectious
disease fighter Roel Coutinho in an interview in this newspaper.

Due to the absence of such an alarm system, said Coutinho, new
infectious diseases remain invisible. Such diseases occur on farms
and threaten man as well. One example is the Q-fever, of which 6
people died this year.

Coutinho, Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control of
the RIVM [National Dutch Institute for Public Health and the
Environment], says this situation drives him to feel "powerless." "I
think there should be much more openness about what exactly happens
in the livestock industry." Due to the belated intervention in the Q
fever outbreak, 40 000 pregnant, including healthy, goats are
currently to be killed.

In the Netherlands, the risk that an animal disease will jump to
humans is considerable. There are many animals (119 million), the
contact between animals and humans is intense and the population
density is high.

The Ministry of Agriculture responded, saying that they have all
animal diseases "good in sight." A spokesman wonders "whether
Coutinho is indeed aware of the current state of affairs." The
ministry does not envisage a need for a change or improvement of the
existing systems.

Commission Vaarkamp-Ohl: Combination of anesthesia - euthanasia
recommended from animal welfare perspective
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The combination: 1st anesthesia, then euthanasia by an experienced
team of workers of the Food and Goods Authority in collaboration with
the private farm's veterinarian, seems the preferable mode for
culling of goats from a welfare perspective. This was proposed by the
Vaarkamp-Ohl committee, the welfare committee which has been
appointed to watch over the measures against Q fever and their
animal-welfare-wise responsible application. Their report on the 2nd
week of the culling has now been released.

During the 2nd week of the operation, the committee paid 2
unannounced inspections at culling locations in different regions. It
was found again that the workers treat the animals with respect and
caution. There is virtually no bleat to hear; escape nor anxiety
behavior of the animals were not observed. High sedative doses were
found to be most effective.

Re: Commentary in 'Q fever - Netherlands: monitoring - 20100103.0028'
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The human disease was recognised and 1st isolates were achieved in
guinea pigs, rats, and mice by Derrick in Brisbane, Queensland, in
1933-5 (reported in The Medical Journal of Australia in 1937). Burnet
was able to passage Derrick's isolates in mice in 1935 in Melbourne,
Victoria, and demonstrated rickettsial-like inclusions in spleens and
found it to be a filter-passing "virus" (also reported in MJA 1937).
Davis isolated the organism from ticks at Nine Mile Creek in Montana
in 1935 (reported in 1938). Cox passaged Davis' strain in yolk sacs
in 1938 at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana (reported in
1939). Dyer accidentaly infected himself with one of Cox' isolates in
1939 at the RML and later demonstrated cross-immunity between this
isolate and one of Burnet's strains.

Hence, Derrick isolated the 1st human strain 6 years before the next
human strain was isolated and 2 years before the 1st arthropod strain.

It is surprising, therefore, that the organism was not called
_Derrickia burnetii_.

[Subscribers interested in the deliberations leading to the decision
to name the Q fever pathogen _Coxiella burnetii_ are referred to the
article by Joseph e McDade (1990), "Naming of an organism", included
in chapter 1 'Historical aspects of Q fever' of the book 'Q fever.
Vol 1: the disease'. Ed Thomas Marrie. CRC Press. p 17.

For the convenience of those interested in the early history of the
disease and its pathogen, we copy herewith one of the several
available manuscripts: Byrne WR. Q fever. (1997). Chapter 26 In:
Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare (Sidell FR,
Takafugi ET, Franz DR, eds). Washington, DC:TMM Publications,
1997;523-537. This is a concise history; a comprehensive one is to be
found in the 1990 CRC book mentioned above.

History
-------
Q fever was 1st described in 1937 by Edward Derrick,(17) while he was
the Director of Microbiology and Pathology for the Queensland
(Australia) Health Department at Brisbane. In 1935, he was contacted
about a febrile illness that had been occurring among abattoir
workers in Brisbane. When routine blood cultures and serologic
testing did not reveal a diagnosis, Derrick suspected that he was
dealing with a new illness. He thoroughly described the clinical
characteristics and designated the disease Q (for query) fever.
Derricks laboratory investigation demonstrated that it was possible
to transmit the disease to animals by inoculating guinea pigs and
mice with the blood of humans suffering from acute Q fever. Although
Derrick had initially concluded that the infectious agent was a
virus, studies of a guinea pig liver emulsion sent to MacFarlane
Burnet in Melbourne subsequently indicated that the causative
organism was a rickettsia,(18) according to the terminology used at that time.

Interestingly, Derrick may not have been the 1st to transfer the
disease to laboratory animals. Hideyo Noguchi, working at the
Rockefeller Institute in New York City in 1925, may have passed _C
burnetii_ to guinea pigs from ticks that had been collected at Saw
Tooth Canyon by Ralph Parker at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in
Hamilton, Montana.(19) This agent, however, was ultimately lost in
animal passage.

About the same time that the investigations were being done in
Australia, Gordon Davis was studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever at
the Rocky Mountain Laboratory. He observed that a febrile illness
resulted when ticks collected from the area around the nearby Nine
Mile Creek were allowed to feed on guinea pigs.(20) The disease
produced in guinea pigs did not, however, resemble Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever. Herald Cox was subsequently able to characterize the
organism (then called the Nine Mile Agent) as similar to rickettsia
and to cultivate this organism in the yolk sac membrane of
embryonated hen eggs. (21) The relation of Q fever to the Nine Mile
Agent was established by Rolla Dyer, director of the National
Institutes of Health at the time, after the spleens of infected mice
were sent to him by Burnet. In an event that presaged the problems of
transmission of Q fever in laboratory workers, Dyer himself acquired
acute Q fever during a visit to Hamilton in 1938.(22)

The work of Ralph Parker, also at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory,
indicated that ticks are the reservoir of the Nine Mile Agent.
Derrick had also suspected tick transmission from a primary
reservoir, and from a secondary reservoir of domestic animals. The
significance of exposure to parturient animals was not, however,
recognized until 1950.

The causative agent of Q fever was ultimately designated _Coxiella
burnetii_ to recognize the outstanding contributions of both Cox and
Burnet to the isolation and characterization of this new pathogen.(23)
