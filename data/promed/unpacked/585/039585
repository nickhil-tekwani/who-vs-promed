People in Wallis and Futuna are being advised to take precautions
against the spread of dengue after 3 cases were confirmed in the
south of Wallis. The newspaper, Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes, said
several dozen suspected cases had been reported earlier in the week.
Travellers to the French territory are being advised to apply insect
repellents and to contact a doctor should they get a fever. Those
flying out to New Caledonia have been given brochures warning them
that any outbreak of a fever should be checked to determine whether
it is dengue fever. The same campaign softened the impact of earlier
dengue outbreaks in New Caledonia and French Polynesia.

Health authorities confirmed yesterday that the laboratory results
from a 39-year-old woman of the Embera indigenous people, a resident
of the San Miguelito district, had tested positive for dengue
hemorrhagic fever. Manuel Lobo, Health Director for the region of San
Miguelito, stated that the disease was confirmed yesterday morning
[Fri 18 Oct 2002] through testing by a second laboratory. According
to Lobo, the patient is in serious but stable condition and remains
hospitalized in the Metropolitan Hospital Complex. This is the second
case of dengue fever registered in the country this year. The first
case was detected last February, in the jurisdiction of Tocumen.
Lobo stated that breeding sites for the mosquito that transmits the
disease (_Aedes aegypti_) had been identified in the patient's home,
located in a community of the Valle de Urraca, in San Miguelito. As a
result, an area of 400 meters around the victim's home had been
sprayed, but, Lobo explained, this procedure only eliminates adult
mosquitoes, while the eggs and larvae remain in stagnant waters and
water stored in containers or other places inside the home. He added
that 42 percent of the foci of mosquito breeding sites are, in fact,
useful containers inside the home. Lobo stated that the mosquito
infestation index in San Miguelito is high, with an average index of
7.4 percent. The government has extended for another 3 months the
program by which 150 health workers were designated to search for
breeding sites and educate the area residents on the importance of
strict hygiene practices.
