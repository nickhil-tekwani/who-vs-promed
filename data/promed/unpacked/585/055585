An Indonesian woman who tested positive in preliminary tests for human bird
flu has died. The latest death, if confirmed, would push the country's
death toll from the disease to 76, the world's highest [according to
Indonesian Ministry of Health statistics; WHO has attributed only 63 human
deaths in Indonesia to avian influenza. - Mod.CP].
The 26 year old woman was 4 months pregnant with her 2nd child. She died at
a hospital in Medan, North Sumatra, early today [13 May 2007]. It is not
immediately clear whether she had been in close contact with infected
poultry, the main channel of human bird flu infections in Indonesia. She
began to show symptoms of bird flu infection 11 days ago, and was treated
[initially] at home, then moved to 2 different hospitals before she died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
has infected at least 282 people and killed around 170 of them [291
confirmed cases and 172 deaths according to the most recent figures
released on 11 Apr 2007 - Mod.CP] mostly in South East Asia, since the end
of 2003.

[The confirmed case totals and number of deaths given by the Indonesian
Ministry of Health and WHO continue to diverge. Resolution of this
discrepancy would be welcomed.
The death of this 26 year old woman and that of the 29 year old woman
described in ProMED-mail posting "Avian influenza, human (75): Indonesia
20070507.1476", are the 1st cases of human avian influenza to be reported
for almost 4 weeks. Both these victims lived in North Sumatra and were
treated in hospital in Medan. - Mod.CP]
