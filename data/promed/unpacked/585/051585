Horse virus death may be 1st in Nova Scotia
-------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia appears to have its 1st case of a mosquitoborne virus that is
almost always fatal to horses and in rare cases can kill people. A case of
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been confirmed in a horse in
south west Nova Scotia, an official with the provincial Department of
Agriculture said on Monday [28 Sep 2009].

Rob Kerr, a department veterinarian, said the horse was put down. "It was
acting oddly, according to the owner and the veterinarian," said Kerr. "It
wasn't drinking water. It had some slight tremors."

The virus cannot be spread directly from horse to horse. Mosquitoes pick up
the virus by feeding on infected birds, then pass it on when they feed on
the blood of horses. "There's a slight possibility it could be picked up
from the horse by mosquitoes and then spread to other animals, but that's
apparently very uncommon," said Kerr.

Veterinarian Brian Manuel said he saw the infected horse before it was
euthanized. "The mortality of this disease and its sudden onset, it is
terrifying to both horse owners and for veterinarians to have this, now, in
our region," he said.

Manuel said the sick horse's owner thought the animal was drunk from eating
apples in a nearby orchard. It was staggering at first, but soon worsened.
"This horse progressed rapidly to where it was on the ground and couldn't
get up on its hind end and [was] thrashing in the front end," Manuel said.
In the end, the horse could not lift its head, he said. Manuel said his
clinic is expecting 120 doses of a vaccine to be delivered on Tuesday [29
Sep 2009].

The virus is rare in humans and most people infected with it don't show any
signs. In severe cases, it can lead to headaches, fever and chills, and
even seizures and comas, according to the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Signs and symptoms usually appear up to 10 days after
someone is bitten by an infected mosquito.

CDC said about 6 human cases of the virus are reported annually in the US.
The State of New York has reported one death from the virus this year
[2009]. The virus is nearly always fatal to horses, CDC said.

Kerr said as far as he knows, this is the 1st case of eastern equine
encephalitis in the province. Results on another possible case are pending,
and he has heard of other horses in the area showing signs of the virus.
Kerr has alerted his counterparts in New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island. "We want to get the word out to veterinarians so that if they see
anything suspicious they can contact their veterinarian laboratories and we
can determine whether this is a very limited area involved or whether it's
more widespread than that," he said.

Kerr said one way to fight the virus is to try to control the mosquito
population. He said bug repellent, blankets, or fly hoods could be used to
keep the insects away from horses.

[If this is the 1st case in Nova Scotia, and it certainly appears to be the
1st case in 2009, then horse owners may never have vaccinated against the
virus. Let us hope the area is doing a major vaccination campaign. - Mod.TG
