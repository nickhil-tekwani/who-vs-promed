As of noon today, 12 Oct 2015, there have been a total of:
1254 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV, including
539 deaths,
703 recoveries, and
12 currently active cases.

In the past 24 hours, there have been a total of:
1 newly confirmed case,
0 newly reported deaths,
0 newly reported recoveries

[Reported case fatality rate 43.0 per cent]

Information on newly reported case: (1 cases)
- A 26-year-old expat female, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh, household contact of previously confirmed case.

[Transmission of the MERS-CoV continues in Saudi Arabia. After a 9 day lull in reporting there have been a total of 3 newly confirmed cases in the past 3 days, one each day (see MERS-CoV (139): Saudi Arabia 20151011.3708355 for information on the other 2 cases).

The map of Saudi Arabia showing the location of the case reported today (12 Oct 2015) is available at the source URL above.

According to the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV statistics pages, the distribution of reported cases (since June 2012) in descending order includes:
Primary cases (no history of contact with other known cases): 38 percent
Healthcare acquired cases (among patients): 33 percent
Household contacts: 13 percent
Healthcare acquired cases (among healthcare workers): 12 percent, and
Unclassified: 3 percent

Overall, 45 percent of cases are known healthcare acquired cases (including patients and healthcare workers) and 38 percent are currently classified as primary cases. It would be interesting to know the breakdown of primary cases in terms of percent with known camel contact vs percent with no known contact with camels or other laboratory confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [27 Sep 2015 and 1 Oct 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
A 38-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [21 Sep 2015] and, on [28 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on[ 30 Sep 2015]. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on [17 Sep 2015] (case no. 8, 15) and on [27 Aug 2015] (case no. 6).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1595 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 571 related deaths.

[This case was reported by the Saudi MOH on 1 Oct 2015, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition, and exposure to risk factors was currently under review.

As a highlight, there have now been 1595 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO since April 2012, including at least 571 related deaths.

Saudi Arabia continues to be the country reporting the most number of cases, followed by South Korea and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

In summary, gbblobally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1595 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 571 related deaths.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Jordan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On [7 Oct 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case
A 53-year-old male from Amman city developed symptoms on [26 Sep 2015] and sought health care at a hospital, where he was treated symptomatically and sent home. On [29 Sep 2015], as symptoms worsened, the patient returned to the hospital, where he was admitted to an isolation room. The patient was discharged on [1 Oct 2015]. On the same day, as his conditions did not improve, he visited a 2nd healthcare facility, where he was treated symptomatically and sent home. On [3 Oct 2015], as his condition deteriorated, the patient sought medical care and was admitted to a 3rd health care facility. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [6 Oct 2015]. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in ICU. He does not have comorbid conditions but is a smoker. The patient is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported to WHO on [21 Sep 2015] (see DON published on [1 Oct 2015] -- case no. 2). He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing.

[This report relates to the case described in MERS-CoV (138): Saudi Arabia, Jordan, post Hajj surveillance, RFI 20151009.3704734 and represents the 16th case reported by Jordan in 2015. It appears as though there is continued healthcare associated transmission of MERS-CoV in Jordan, although the report above does not mention whether this case's contact with the other laboratory confirmed case occurred in the healthcare environment or if he was a family or friend of the earlier laboratory confirmed case.

The history of this current case is not an unusual one of cases elsewhere in the world and may well contribute to continued transmission of the MERS-CoV in the healthcare environment -- he visited 3 healthcare facilities before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed, potentially infecting other individuals attending those healthcare facilities at the same time as his visits, and potentially the healthcare personnel who cared for him during those visits.

Control of MERS-CoV transmission will require a 2 pronged approach -- the 1st being prevention of primary infections (the zoonotic transmission of the virus -- still pending more in-depth understanding -- camels alone?, bats? other?). What human behaviors are associated with transmission of the virus from the animal hosts to humans? The 2nd approach will involve a more in-depth understanding of routes of transmission in the healthcare environment -- aerosolization of respiratory secretions, droplets, fomites.... and more importantly, early recognition of "suspected cases" with concomitant isolation and respiratory precautions. Easier said than done...
