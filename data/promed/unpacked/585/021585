Wed 13 Jul 2011
---------------
As of today, 13 Jul 2011, the cumulative number of STEC [Shiga toxin
producing _Escherichia coli_] O104:H4 cases in the EU/EEA is 3848.
This includes 763 HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] STEC cases and 3 085
non-HUS STEC cases. In total, 44 infected persons have died, of which
28 were HUS STEC cases and 16 were non-HUS STEC cases.

cases have been reported. Within the last 10 days (3-12 Jul 2011), 3
HUS STEC cases and 9 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill. The last known date
of illness onset in a patient with confirmed STEC O104 was 1 Jul 2011.
The last reported date of illness onset among all cases was 4 Jul
2011.

Thu 14 Jul 2011
---------------
As of today, 14 Jul 2011, the cumulative number of probable and
confirmed STEC cases in the EU/EEA is 3867. This includes 762 HUS STEC
cases and 3 105 non-HUS STEC cases. In total, 44 infected persons have
died, of which 28 were HUS STEC cases and 16 were non-HUS STEC cases.

In Germany, since the last update, 1 HUS STEC case has been excluded,
and 20 non-HUS STEC cases have been reported. Within the last 10 days
(4-13 July), 1 HUS STEC case and 8 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill. The
last known date of illness onset in a patient with confirmed STEC O104
was 7 Jul 2011. This was also the last reported date of illness onset
among all cases.

Wed 13 Jul: 1 / 8 / 9 / 44 (2 day gap)
Thu 14 Jul: 0 / 20 / 20 / 44

Total cases: 3867 with 44 deaths -- 1.14 per cent case fatality rate.
The new case definition resulted in lower total cases and deaths but
did not affect case fatality rate.

Suspected cases (Germany: 146 HUS STEC (7 deaths), France: 5 non-HUS
STEC) are not included.

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week.

Cases continue to be recognized more than 2 months after the initial
cases occurred.

No data are yet available regarding the use of certain antimicrobials
such as imipenem as an adjuvant treatment or whether the
anti-complement monoclonal antibody eculizumab has had a reproducible
clinical effect. - Mod.LL]

[2] ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment Update: asymptomatic infections found

[The initial part of the report can be found at the source URL above.
This includes a discussion of German and Germany related cases, as
well as secondary cases and the outbreak in France related to the
epidemic strain. References 1-6 are excluded in the list of citations
since they are not in the text per se that is posted. - Mod.LL]

The most significant development since 29 Jun 2011 relates to the
preliminary results of the screening of children and staff in a school
in Kreis Paderborn (Paderborn county), Germany, where 3 cases of HUS
STEC and 1 case of non-HUS STEC infection have been identified since
13 Jun 2011 and onwards [7].

In 22 of the 30 children tested (including the 3 HUS STEC cases, and
the non-HUS STEC case), the epidemic strain of _E. coli_ was isolated,
indicating a significant level of asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic
carriage of STEC infection was also found in 3 kitchen workers at the
school, in 4 guardians in 4 different child care centres in the
district, and in 3 staff members of a supplying catering company.
Further investigations of this cluster are ongoing [7].

ECDC threat assessment for the EU
---------------------------------
Several pieces of evidence link the outbreaks in Germany and France.
Apart from _E. coli_ O104:H4 being a very rarely isolated pathotype
from humans in Europe, and considering the clinical and
epidemiological similarities between the outbreaks in the 2 countries,
there is now microbiological evidence that the strains from both
outbreaks are indistinguishable [8].

Results from studies in France and Germany support the hypothesis
that seeds used for sprouting (distributed to local producers or
retail outlets) contained a level of _E. coli_ O104:H4 contamination,
ultimately leading to contaminated sprouts destined for human
consumption. Trace-back activities conducted by several EU Member
States also support this hypothesis. The EFSA technical report
published on 5 Jul 2011 concludes that a specific lot of fenugreek
seeds imported from Egypt is the most likely common link but that it
cannot be excluded that other lots may be implicated. The exact point
of contamination in the food chain has not been established but is
being considered to have occurred before importation [9].

Following this report, the European Commission on 5 Jul 2011 took the
decision to withdraw certain types of seeds imported from Egypt from
the market and temporarily ban the import of these products [10].
Regarding seeds already imported, trace-forward activities were
advised, as a large number of countries had received parts of the
suspected lot of fenugreek. As this is a complex and long operation,
there remains a reduced but existing risk connected to the consumption
of affected and sprouted seeds. Therefore, EFSA's advice remains valid
that consumers should not grow sprouts for their own consumption and
should not eat sprouts or sprouted seeds, unless these products are
cooked thoroughly [11].

A dramatic decrease in the number of new cases has been noted in
Germany in the last 14 days. The cluster in France seems to have been
a point-source foodborne outbreak with evidence for limited secondary
transmission. Although secondary STEC infections have been documented,
available data do currently not support a large occurrence of
secondary person-to-person transmission.

However, new cases and clusters are continuing to be reported despite
the identification of the most likely vehicle of contamination for the
outbreak related to Germany (sprouts) and the implementation of public
health measures to mitigate it. Such new cases and clusters are
expected to continue to occur due to incidental secondary
transmission, either through person-to-person transmission, through
other contaminated food vehicles, or due to contaminated seeds
remaining in circulation.

The evidence, especially from the cluster in a German school,
pointing at a substantial proportion of subclinical infections is the
main reason for concern at this stage. This may have an impact on the
epidemiology of the disease and the measures needed to prevent further
spread. The asymptomatic infections in 22 out of 30 children resulted
most likely from a foodborne transmission, rather than from
person-to-person transmission. A significant proportion of
asymptomatic carriers represent a risk for new foodborne outbreaks, in
particular if such asymptomatic contamination affects a food handler.

Considering the large number of summer festivals and mass gatherings
in the EU, with sometimes inadequate food hygiene standards, targeted
public health messages for such events could be of value to prevent
further spread. To complement public health measures regarding food
handling, information to the public should stress the need for proper
hand washing.

Certain characteristics of the strain remain unknown, which may
affect the future epidemiological picture in the EU. The estimated
median incubation period is 8 days, with a median of 5 days from the
onset of diarrhea to the development of HUS [12]. This incubation
period is longer than the classical incubation period of 3 to 8 days
for STEC infections. This may indicate a low infectious dose, which
may influence the likelihood of person-to-person and foodborne
transmissions by infected persons. However, so far person-to-person
transmission does not seem to have played an important role in the
transmission of the disease, and in particular no outbreak in
institutions such as day-care centres, schools, or nursing homes has
occurred through person-to-person transmission. Another important
factor in monitoring the future epidemiology is whether or not the
strain has established, or could establish, itself within an animal
reservoir.

Conclusions and recommendations
-------------------------------
The epidemiological picture of the STEC O104:H4 incidence in Europe
suggests a transition phase, from the main outbreak events in Germany
and France related to the infected seeds used for sprouting, towards a
future risk for new clusters or a continued incidence of sporadic
cases. Those can result from ongoing risk related to infected seeds
still on the market or in individual's households, from foodborne
transmission through new vehicles contaminated during food handling,
or through person-to-person transmission. It is therefore important to
further monitor the epidemiology of cases across Members States and
3rd countries and document likely modes of transmission and potential
vehicles of infection.

With this objective in mind, specific reporting of new cases
occurring at the EU level has been implemented as of 5 Jul 2011. Apart
from the multi-country monitoring of the situation, the results of
ongoing epidemiological studies in Germany and France will need to be
incorporated in future public health steering.

[3] Questions
Date: Wed 13 Jul 2011
Source: Roger Feldman <feldmanmail@aol.com> [edited]


While looking at fenugreek seeds, and their culinary and other uses,
it appears that there are some seeds which are used for specific
purposes, like false maple syrup, some seeds which have culinary uses,
like curry powder, and then, some seeds used for sprouting. If
somebody has contact with those who know about fenugreek seed
production, and the countries which produce them, and then know what
percent of production is used for sprouts, it would add something
useful for those of us who see seed packets on the shelves of garden
stores, or wonder which products (curry powder, and other mixed spice
powders, false maple syrup, and other things) use fenugreek seeds.

As a 2nd question, relating to the size of the infectious dose and
severity of disease, I wonder if the dose from sprouted fenugreek
seeds is massively greater than the dose of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in
undercooked hamburger patties. I only ask because people use the word
virulence as if the only variable involved is the organism. What if
seed-generated disease has a generally different magnitude of dose
than that found with other vehicles?
