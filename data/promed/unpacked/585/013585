Chronic wasting disease found in Black Hills
---------------------------
Chronic wasting disease -- long endemic to southeastern Wyoming and
northeastern Colorado -- has been found in the Black Hills region of
Wyoming for the first time, wildlife biologists say.
2 mule deer and 2 white-tailed deer in 4 northeastern Wyoming hunt areas
tested positive for the fatal brain malady during recent sampling efforts.
Wasting disease was also found in the Black Hills of South Dakota and in
northwestern Nebraska in 2001.
Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologists were not surprised by the new
findings and said it was only a matter of time before the disease spread
further north. "We have verified the disease in (Wyoming's) Black Hills ...
and we are actually surprised it took so long," said Joe Sandrini, Game and
Fish wildlife biologist in Newcastle. "We know there is a lot of
interchange among deer from Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska."
The deer collected in the hunt areas were initially suspected of another
disease known as bluetongue, a fatal illness spread by gnats that does not
affect humans. A bluetongue outbreak was expected in 2003 because of ideal
conditions for mud-loving insects, Sandrini said. Game and Fish is
considering collecting more deer for CWD testing in the Black Hills to
learn how the disease spreads, he said.
A similar effort is already underway statewide following a Game and Fish
Commission decision in September 2003 to expand CWD surveillance. The
department on Wednesday began taking samples from about 6000 deer and elk
killed by hunters across the state. "We're disappointed to find those
positives (in the Black Hills), but it's not a surprise," said Gregg
Arthur, acting Game and Fish Department director. "That's one of the
reasons -- based on the Colorado experience in 2002, when the state really
started to look for CWD on the West Slope and found it there -- that we
wanted to go statewide on our surveillance."
Chronic wasting disease attacks the brains of infected animals, causing
them to display abnormal behavior and eventually become emaciated and die.
There is no evidence that the disease can harm people. Researchers have
yet to discover how it is spread.
The malady has been found in wild deer or elk in Wyoming, Colorado,
Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, and Wisconsin. It has
also been found in captive herds in several other states.

[See last year's postings on CWD in Wyoming: 20 Nov 2002; "Chronic wasting
disease has been found in 2 mule deer shot by hunters in the Medicine Bow
Mountains and Sierra Madre, marking the 1st time the disease has been found
west of the Continental Divide in Wyoming." And on 28 Dec 2002: "In Carbon
County, a 3rd case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been confirmed, a
sign the wildlife malady may be spreading. The latest case involved a mule
deer shot by a hunter this fall between Laramie and Arlington, and south of
Interstate 80." - Mod.MHJ]
