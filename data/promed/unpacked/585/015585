Alerting Chinese citizens in Kazakhstan to take precautions against unknown pneumonia:
According to Kazakhstan media reports, the incidence of pneumonia in Atyrau Region, Aktobe, and Shymkent has significantly increased since mid-June 2020, [compared to] the same period [in 2019]. Up to today [9 Jul 2020], the 3 regions have had nearly 500 infections and more than 30 people are critically ill. In the 1st half of this year [2020], 1772 people died of pneumonia in Kazakhstan. In June [2020] alone, there were already 628 deaths, among which were Chinese citizens. The fatality rate of this illness is far higher than COVID-19. The Kazakhstan Ministry of Health and other agencies are now carrying out research on this pneumonia virus but do not yet have a definitive determination. China's embassy to Kazakhstan warns Chinese citizens in Kazakhstan to be mindful of this situation and pay increased attention to prevention to lower the risk of infection.

1. Pay close attention to information from the Kazakh government and Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan. Do not create, believe, or spread rumors.
2. Take protective measures and minimize outings, avoiding crowded areas. Pay attention to personal protection and hand hygiene, maintaining good hygiene and health habits. Wear masks when going out, wash hands frequently, disinfect frequently, and maintain ventilation.
3. If you develop symptoms, seek medical attention in a timely manner and inform your physician of your travel and contact history, actively supporting related investigations.

The Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan has warned of a deadly "unknown pneumonia" after the former Soviet republic reported a spike in pneumonia cases since June [2020]. While the Chinese embassy described the illness as an "unknown pneumonia", Kazakhstani officials and media have only said it is pneumonia. It was not clear why the Chinese embassy had described the illness as "unknown" or what information it had about the pneumonia. The embassy's website, citing local media reports, said the provinces of Atyrau and Aktobe and the city of Shymkent have reported significant spikes in pneumonia cases since the middle of June [2020].

Shymkent and the capital city of Atyrau are 1500 km (930 miles) apart, while the distance between the capital cities of Atyrau and Aktobe is 330 km (205 miles). Saule Kisikova, the health care department chief in the capital Nur-Sultan, told the news agency Kazinform: "Some 300 people diagnosed with pneumonia are being hospitalised every day." The agency also said there had been 1700 pneumonia cases nationwide in June [2020] -- more than 2 times the number in the same month last year [2019].

Kazakhstan announced a state of emergency on [6 Mar 2020] to tackle the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown was lifted on [11 May 2020], but restrictions and quarantine measures have been reimposed in some areas following the surge in pneumonia cases. Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a televised address on Wednesday [8 Jul 2020] that the situation was still serious and it was too early to relax restrictions. He added the country was "in fact facing the 2nd coronavirus wave coupled with a huge uptick in pneumonia cases", according to the Russian news agency Tass.

Late last month [Jun 2020] officials warned about the rise in pneumonia cases. Kisikova said that doctors were finding 600 people a day with pneumonia symptoms, compared with 80 a day before the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Singapore-based website CNA reported. "Every day, 350 to 400 patients are hospitalised in the city with either Covid-19 or pneumonia," she said.

Kazakhstan dismissed as incorrect on Friday [10 Jul 2020] a warning by China's embassy for its citizens to guard against an outbreak of pneumonia in the central Asian nation that it described as being more lethal than the coronavirus. In a statement late on Thursday [9 Jul 2020] on its official WeChat account, the Chinese embassy flagged a "significant increase" in cases in the Kazakh cities of Atyrau, Aktobe, and Shymkent since mid-June [2020].

On Friday [10 Jul 2020], however, Kazakhstan's healthcare ministry branded Chinese media reports based on the embassy statement as "fake news". The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal, and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organisation guidelines. "The information published by some Chinese media regarding a new kind of pneumonia in Kazakhstan is incorrect," the ministry said.

Kazakhstan, which imposed a 2nd lockdown this week to rein in the pandemic, has a tally of almost 55 000 COVID-19 infections, including 264 deaths. The number of new cases rose on Thursday [9 Jul 2020] to a daily record of 1962. On Tuesday [7 Jul 2020], state news agency Kazinform said the number of pneumonia cases "increased 2.2 times in June [2020] as compared to the same period of 2019".

It is unclear whether the pneumonia it referred to was caused by a virus related to coronavirus or a different strain. The Global Times tabloid run by China's People's Daily has said Kazakhstan's foreign ministry "did not respond to questions about the Chinese embassy's warning."

[Reviewing the media reports (of which there are many), the only source of information about this pneumonia "more lethal than COVID-19" is the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan. All other reports available for review mention that the announcement of this "outbreak" was made by the Chinese Embassy.

Interestingly there have been multiple media reports over the past few days mentioning that Kazakhstan doesn't have enough test kits for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, as well as the need for PPE, respirators, and medications. An unfortunately common occurrence when countries are overwhelmed by rapidly increasing cases of COVID-19 so that hospital beds are scarce, ICU beds even scarcer, and mortality increases due to the pandemic virus and due to an overwhelmed medical system in the country, in severely affected areas.

A media report mentioned that Russia will be sending a shipment of identified needs (as mentioned above) including PCR testing kits. What is not mentioned in any media reports I've seen is information on the testing supplies currently used in Kazakhstan, including the test's sensitivity and specificity to have some idea of possible range of false negative results which might explain a proportion of the above mentioned increase in pneumonia cases. Another possibility is an increase in coinfections with other respiratory pathogens including viral and bacterial pathogens which may result in increased mortality from the coinfection (see COVID-19 update (206): global, Singapore, China coinfect influenza, WHO 20200525.7373472 and COVID-19 update (03): China, global, Egypt, influenza surveillance, WHO 20200214.6991020).

More information on this event from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Atyrau borders on the Caspian Sea with the province bordering on the Russian Federation. Aktobe borders with Atyrau to its west and Shymkent is in the south central of Kazakhstan, bordering with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to its south.

[The 4 new confirmed cases in the last 24 hours were all imported and no cases were reported from Beijing.

There were 3 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 42 new cases. At the time of preparation of this report, the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong had not issued a press release on these cases. A media reported dated 9 Jul 2020 mentioned there was an increase in local cases (42) with 8 having a recent travel history. Most of the local cases were linked to clusters from restaurants, taxi drivers, and elderly care centres. Effective Saturday (11 Jul 2020), restaurants have to limit maximum capacity to 60%, and tables no more than 8 individuals, bars had to limit tables to 4, and Gyms, party rooms and karaoke bars limit to 8 at tables (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3092459/coronavirus-least-15-more-covid-19-cases-detected).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Hong Kong is dealing with increased transmission associated with lifting of restrictions.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 45 cases with 1 new death, compared with 50 cases and 2 new deaths in the previous day (8 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 87 consecutive days. There were 22 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (7), Daejeon (7), Gwangju (3), Gyeonggi (3), and Jeonnam (2), and 23 imported cases -- Gyeonggi (11), airport quarantine (4), Gyeongnam (3), Chungbuk (2), Seoul (1), Incheon (1), and Jeonnam (1). There were 9 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 6 provinces yesterday, 8 Jul 2020).

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/). The English language pages for notices 423 and 424 provide details on the 50 cases confirmed yesterday 8 Jul 2020 and updates on active clusters. (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030).

The overall impression hasn't changed: lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +229 cases and +12 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (8 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +193 cases and +15 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (119); Emilia-Romagna (29), Lazio (28), Piedmont (16), and Veneto (10), are the only provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 64 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 48 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman has reported the country's highest-ever fatalities caused by the novel coronavirus in 24 hours. Speaking in a press briefing on Thursday [9 Jul 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 221 patients have died of the virus in the past 24 hours, raising the overall death toll to 12 305. This is the biggest number of daily fatalities since the beginning of the outbreak in Iran. She also confirmed 2079 new cases of COVID-19 infection, increasing the total number of infections to 250 458.

The spokeswoman said 212 176 patients have so far recovered from COVID-19, but 3324 are still in severe conditions of the disease. She further stressed that so far 1 897 803 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

According to Lari, Khuzestan, West Azarbaijan, East Azarbaijan, Razavi Khorasan, Kurdistan, Ilam, Bushehr, Hormozgan, and Kermanshah provinces are still considered as "red zones". Tehran, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Golestan, Alborz, Kerman, Yazd, Sistan and Baluchestan, Hamadan, and Ardabil provinces are also in dangerous conditions, she added.

[As of 9 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 250 458, including 12 305 deaths, an increase of 2079 cases and 221 deaths since 8 Jul 2020. The number of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing. Another media report mentioned that the wearing of masks in covered public places is now mandatory in the country, and other restrictions for the seriously affected provinces are under consideration (https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/news-1/2020/7/9/iran-hits-record-one-day-virus-death-toll-of-221).

Takeaway message remains the same: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessarily leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths. And the need to re-implement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now, 3 219 999 including 135 822 deaths, an increase from 3 158 932 cases and 134 862 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 214 952 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 9 Jul 2020, (+382 since 8 Jul 2020) including 18 637 (+18 since 8 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4610 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Tennessee. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1605 to 11 394. In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona (surpassing Massachusetts), Massachusetts, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. A total of 42 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.9%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 15.1% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, although slowing down over the past 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% positive tests out of 40 045 940 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 12 387 405, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. Sobering is if one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (54.9%). A global total of 557 395 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5419 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, Peru, Chile, Spain, the UK, Mexico, and Iran at number 10. China is now number 23, having been surpassed by Argentina. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Russia, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Bangladesh. All countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3360 to 61 067.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region; unchanged for the past 8 days. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, 2 from the European region, and 1 each from the African and Western Pacific regions. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
