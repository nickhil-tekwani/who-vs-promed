Cassava disease hits Kibaale
----------------------------
Over 100 acres (40 ha) of cassava have been destroyed by disease in more
than 5 sub-counties in Kibaale district [Western Region]. Peter Sentayi,
the officer in charge of disease control, said he suspected the disease to
be brown streak disease, for which he had no immediate remedy. When it
occurs in a garden, it can damage over 95 per cent of the crops, Sentayi
explained. He said the outbreak was the first of its kind in Kibaale
district and was spreading fast.

[A farmer] said the disease had been spreading for 5 months but farmers had
not recognised it, thinking that a change in weather had caused the
blackening of the cassava leaves and stems. "Hunger is definitely looming."
Sentayi asked affected farmers to avoid spreading the disease further. He
urged them to be patient as his office consults the National Agriculture
Research Organisation for a remedy.

He asked farmers planning to plant cassava next season to search for
disease-resistant varieties. He said some improved cassava varieties had
not been attacked by the disease. He called for the adoption of modern
planting materials in order to ensure food security. Sentayi appealed to
farmers in areas where the disease has not been sited to be vigilant and
report any signs immediately.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease (CBSD) is caused by _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_). It is
considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a
major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem
necrosis, and yellow/brown, corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of
roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away.
Total crop losses of 20-80 per cent have been reported, and losses in
individual root weight of up to 70 per cent have been observed in
susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and is
spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management
includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free
seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but these measures may be
difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are
being developed for specific local requirements and are the best option for
CBSV control in the long term.

Outbreaks of CBSD were reported from Uganda in 2008 and 2007 (see posts
listed below).

The Central Region is considered the hardest hit, but reports have also
been received from the Eastern and Northern Regions earlier in 2009
(ProMED-mail post 20090416.1440).

From the item above it now appears that the Western Region is also
affected. New cassava varieties were bred in the country to combat cassava
mosaic disease (CMD; caused by several _Begomovirus_ species), which almost
wiped out national cassava production in the 1990s, but unfortunately most
of these varieties are now being destroyed by brown streak.
