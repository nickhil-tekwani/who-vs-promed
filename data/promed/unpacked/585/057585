[Now that the incidence in the UK of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease -- abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-
mail -- shows evidence of having peaked, or reached a plateau, the
Department of Health full table of definite and probable CJD deaths
and referrals will no longer be reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only
the monthly summary of variant CJD statistics will be posted unless
there is a substantial change in the situation. The full table updated
monthly can be accessed at the Department of Health website
(<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>).

The precise definitions of the terms deaths, definite cases,
probable vCJD cases, and the case definitions can be found by
accessing the Department of Health website or by reference to a
previous ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new
var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) - Mod.CP]


Monthly Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics as of
Mon 7 Jun 2004
-------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today issuing the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD),
the form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The latest
results (correct as at 7 Jun 2004) are the following:

Summary of vCJD cases:

Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 104
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological
confirmation): 37
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation
pending): 0
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above):
141

Living Cases:
Number of definite/probable vCJD cases still alive: 5

Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 146

The next table will be published by the Department of Health on
Mon 5 Jul 2004.

[These figures represent no net change in the total number of dead
and alive vCJD cases since May 2004. In fact, there has been no
net change in these figures over the previous 4 months, reflecting
the impression that the vCJD outbreak has now passed its peak
(but see part [3] below). As of 7 Jun 2004, according to the
Department of Health table of vCJD deaths
(<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>)
there have been only 2 deaths during the first 5 months of 2004,
compared with 18 deaths during [all] 2003 and the peak of 28
deaths in the year 2000. - Mod.CP]

Further Evidence that vCJD Incidence in the UK is in Decline
--------------------------------------------------------------
The quarterly analysis of vCJD incidence published on the United
Kingdom CJD surveillance unit website
(<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdq.htm>) shows that the incidence of
deaths since 1994 is consistent with an underlying trend that has
reached a peak and is now in decline. Previously, a model with a
rise to a plateau gave a similar fit to the data as the model with a
peak (1), however, with only the one case in the 1st quarter of
2004, this model no longer provides a good fit. As was first noted
[during 2003] (2,3) the data are not consistent with an exponentially
increasing underlying trend.

The text of this article is supplemented with a figure [not shown
here] that illustrates the quarterly deaths data with fitted trends
from the quadratic model and plateau model. The quadratic model
gives an estimate that a peak in deaths occurred in about
September 2000 and that the current incidence is 2.7 deaths per
quarter. Extrapolating this model gives a prediction of 8 deaths for
the 12 months to March 2005 (95 percent prediction interval of 3 to
15).

The interpretation of these results requires caution, as there may
be a long tail or more than one peak to the epidemic. There is also
the possibility of human-to-human spread through procedures such
a blood transfusions (4). Continued surveillance and research into
vCJD is therefore important to investigate these possibilities.

Scientist Suggest that about 3800 People in the UK Carry the vCJD
Prion
----------------------------------------------------
Just as concerns were abating, research published on Fri 21 May
2004 suggests that the human form of mad cow disease in Britain
could be more widespread than thought. Scientists have estimated
that 3800 people in Britain could be unwittingly carrying the prion
protein responsible for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD),
a fatal brain-wasting condition.

"Our findings need to be interpreted with caution, but cannot be
discounted," said David Hilton, of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth,
and lead author of the report published in The Journal of Pathology.

Hilton and scientists from the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh,
Scotland, and Imperial College in London studied 12 674 stored
appendix and tonsil samples removed during routine operations in
the late 1990s from people in their 20s. 3 showed evidence of
accumulation of the prion protein associated with vCJD. Based on
their findings, they came up with the 3800 figure. "There is still
much to learn about vCJD and the presence of the protein in these
tissue samples does not necessarily mean that those affected will
go on to develop vCJD," Hilton added.

The scientists stressed that only one of the 3 positive samples
showed a pattern of the prion accumulation similar to that seen in
known vCJD cases. The other 2 were different, so their
significance is uncertain. Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, of Imperial
College in London, said the figures are not in the alarmist range but
warrant further investigation to get to more accurate answers.
"They scream out at me that we still need better diagnostic tests,"
he said in an interview. "It is a relatively unusual condition but every
case is one more than you would want," he added.

Since vCJD was first detected and linked to eating meat
contaminated with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), in the mid-1990s, 141 people have died of
the illness, which is caused by prion brain proteins that transform
themselves into infectious agents. It is difficult for scientists to
predict how may people may get the illness or when it will peak
because of the long incubation period, which experts say can be
from 10-20 years or longer, and genetic factors that could
influence susceptibility to the illness. Previous estimates have
ranged from less than 100 to up to 50 000.

"Although the numbers of cases are currently in decline [see
preceding reports], the possibility of further rises cannot be
excluded," the researchers said in the report. They added that the
findings reinforce the importance of safety measures to reduce the
spread of vCJD through blood transfusions or surgical equipment.
Britain banned people who have had transfusions in the past 2
decades from donating blood after a report of what is thought to
have been the world's 1st case of vCJD caused by a blood
transfusion.

UK Firm Develops Test for Human 'Mad Cow' Disease
-------------------------------------------------
British diagnostics company Microsens has developed the 1st
blood test that can detect abnormal proteins that cause the human
version of "mad cow disease," the privately owned company said
on Wed 26 May 2004. The firm's Seprion technology can detect
abnormal prions, a type of protein, in the blood of patients with so-
called variant Creuzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), it said.

Although there have been relatively few deaths caused by eating
contaminated meat, recent research has suggested the disease
can lie dormant in the blood for years and that it can be passed on
in a blood transfusion. "With the recent publication of evidence
showing vCJD [prions] present in human tissue samples and the
ban of certain blood donors to avoid the risk of vCJD transmission,
there is an obvious need to accelerate the development of a vCJD
screening process in blood," Microsens Chief Scientific Officer
Stuart Wilson said in a statement. Microsens plans to expand its
research into the human blood test to include more samples.

It has already sold the rights to Seprion for use in a post-mortem
test for BSE in cattle to Idexx Laboratories Inc in the United States.
