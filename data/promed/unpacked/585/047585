Mumps in Ontario
----------------
There are now several mumps cases in Ontario. Given that the original
Nova Scotia outbreak was largely focussed on college students, it is
not surprising that the disease has spread to other provinces as
classes have ended and students are travelling back to their home towns.
CBS News reported in a Fri 4 May [2007] update that health officials
are considering a re-vaccination campaign for mumps. The province of
Nova Scotia and the Public Health Agency of Canada are looking at
re-immunizing people against mumps.
Nova Scotia has experienced 203 cases of mumps since February [2007],
including about 50 new cases that have surfaced since last week
[23-27 Apr 2007], public health officials said on Fri 4 May 2007. New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have also reported cases, mainly
among young adults in their 20s. Half a dozen cases of mumps have
spread as far as Ontario.
Mumps is a highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing,
sneezing, sharing drinks or kissing. Many of the cases spread through
downtown bars in Halifax and on the campus of Dalhousie University,
health officials said.
Since exams wrapped up about 2 weeks ago [20 Apr 2007], most students
have left campus and the disease seems to be receding, said Marla
Cranston, a Dalhousie spokeswoman. The province is talking about a
new immunization program for university-aged students and health-care
workers, said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of health with the
Nova Scotia health department. "Right now, we're going to start
discussion with the universities and the district health authorities
to figure out how to make this happen," Sarwal said, adding plans
should be in place by next week [7-11 May 2007].

Mumps outbreak enters Ontario from Maritimes
--------------------------------------------
Canada's mumps outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes and into
Ontario, with 3 confirmed and 5 suspected cases, officials confirmed
yesterday [4 May 2007].
In Nova Scotia, the centre of the outbreak, public health officials
admitted they are considering a catch-up vaccination campaign for
university students and health-care workers, several of whom have
become infected while caring for mumps cases. Previously, officials
in the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to
give a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to
young adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be
done in conjunction with other provinces and territories.
"Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're
still working with the other provinces and with the Public Health
Agency (of Canada)," said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of
health for the province. "But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take
some steps to protect Nova Scotians."
This week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to
203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions
in the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported
34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For
the 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central
Canada, a development public health officials had warned might occur
as the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their
homes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.
David Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and
Long-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the
Ottawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to
the Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5
suspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials
in the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who
have mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of
appetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva
glands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.
The Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February
[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;
the earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases
respectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.
Sarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were
vaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,
but received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine
was adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this
outbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't
protect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is
leaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.
"We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination
programs. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this
case is 2: university students and health-care workers," Sarwal said.
The vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to
stamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.
The incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University
dormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of
the virus among susceptible young adults.

[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases
among students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more
significantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central
Canada is noted. Catch-up vaccination of students and healthcare
workers is fast becoming a priority. - Mod.CP]
