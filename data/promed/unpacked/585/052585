In this outbreak, there has been only one animal [case] in the same area as in 2006. Precipitation is 155 percent of normal for the area from 1 Apr 2012, and it has started to heat up over the past couple of weeks.

Our standard disease response consists of vaccination and monitored carcass disposal.

There are no cattle graves, but there were 2 positive animals burnt on the same piece of property in 2006, one of which was a bull which had been missing for about 10 days prior to being burnt (surprisingly, not badly scavenged). The present case was a younger animal that had not been vaccinated.

[2006 was a disastrous year for Saskatchewan (SK) and Manitoba (MB). SK had 800 animals die. According to Brent Barrett: "It was a nerve-wracking summer for many cattle and bison producers in north-central, northeast and east-central Saskatchewan. 153 farms in 45 rural municipalities [RM] were quarantined due to anthrax. The worst anthrax outbreak on record in Saskatchewan killed 800 animals, including 493 cattle, 254 bison, 29 sheep, 13 white-tail deer, 6 horses, 3 swine, and 2 goats" [see 20060924.2728].

Kinistino, one of the 1st RMs to go down, suffered: "Kinistino: 23 premises: cattle 87, horses 4, swine 3, bison 3, sheep 6." [See Bob Allen, 20060912.2581] For a full published report on 2006, see 20101203.4339.

There would have been some ground contamination from the 2006 mildly scavenged bull, and the risk would have been hidden when the farm stock were vaccinated. Unfortunately, this young animal acted as a risk sentinel.

Our thanks to Alex for this information. Alex has, on Betty Althouse's retirement, inherited her CFIA responsibility for SK anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
