The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in the Czech Republic 3 years after the previous event. The outbreak affects a small poultry farm in Stepanov nad Svratkou, in the Vysocina Region. The virus was introduced by wild water birds. It is a highly pathogenic subtype of H5N8 virus, fatal to birds, but transmission to humans has not yet been reported.

The infected stock were 12 hens, 6 of which died within 2 days, and there were 3 ducks. Veterinary inspectors started their investigation and took precautionary measures immediately after the reporting by the breeder about the poultry deaths, and sent dead hens for examination to the State Veterinary Institute in Prague. The latter confirmed the highly pathogenic avian influenza in all 6 animals.

"My colleagues at the Ministry are ready to help affected farmers with compensation that they are legally entitled to. But most important now is to prevent further spread of infection, in particular by preventing contact between wild and domestic birds," said Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman.

"The remaining poultry on the farm will be euthanized; a 3-km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a surveillance zone of 10 km [6.2 mi] radius will be defined, and extraordinary veterinary measures will be declared there," said Zbynek Semerad, the Central Director of the State Veterinary Administration.

Emergency veterinary measures will restrict the movement of poultry to and from the zones and ban exhibitions or stock exchanges of poultry and birds that pose a high risk of spreading disease.

[The above event, located centrally in the Czech Republic (map at https://tinyurl.com/up2xcmj), brings the number of European countries affected by HPAI H5N8 since late 2019 to 5. The others are Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Most of the H5N8 HPAI events involve domestic poultry.

The last reported H5N8 HPAI outbreaks date back to April 2019 in Bulgaria, and no evidence of H5N8 HPAI infection in wild birds or poultry had been reported from the region since.

According to a recent FAO circular: "The epidemiological information and pattern of these recent H5N8 HPAI outbreaks suggest a likely role for wild birds in the dissemination of the virus across parts of Eastern Europe. Investigation of the Slovakia outbreak, which occurred in a backyard flock with no links to commercial poultry farms, strongly supports this hypothesis. Eastern Europe experienced unusual mild temperatures during the months of November and December 2019, with limited snow coverage. Consequently, wild birds in Europe may not have pursued their usual patterns of southwards movement, crossing the Mediterranean Basin.

European countries located at lower latitudes and short distances from the current outbreaks and with significant poultry production may be at higher risk for disease introduction over the coming months, depending on wild bird movements. In addition, poultry trade remains a major risk factor for disease spread amongst countries. Current regulatory frameworks in Europe with regards to poultry flock testing and poultry movement controls at country borders should be strictly enforced to mitigate this risk.

Genetic information on these H5N8 HPAI viruses is not yet publicly available. Information shared with FAO by the FAO/EU Reference Laboratory Avian Influenza in Padova, Italy (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie - IZSVe) indicates the current European viruses have close genetic identity (99.8-100% genetic similarity) and are related to clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses detected in Africa in 2018-19. Further investigations are continuing." - Mod.AS
