Inspectors from the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Service began
the process of culling some 4000 chickens and turkeys at Moshav Beit
Hanania on Friday [4 Jan 2008] in an effort to contain the bird flu
outbreak detected in a Binyamina kindergarten petting zoo.
The process, which is expected to be completed before Shabbat enters
[sundown],
will be carried out at a chicken coop belonging to the Muchersky
family, the only one located within a 2-mile (3-km) radius of the
kindergarten.
On Thursday [3 Jan 2008] some 200 chickens were culled in Binyamina.
The Agriculture Ministry said lab tests of samples taken from chicken
coops in the area were negative, but it will go ahead with the
culling as a safety measure against the spreading of the bird flu
virus. The chicken coop owners will be compensated, the ministry
added.
The chickens are killed by electrocution in less than a second, in
accordance with local animal rights regulations. Parrots and birds
will be beheaded or receive a lethal injection.
Once destroyed, the culled poultry will be buried in a pit dug
especially for that purpose.
A 4-year-old girl who attended the kindergarten was admitted to the
Hillel Jaffe Medical Center in Hadera Thursday [3 Jan 2008] with
flu-like symptoms. Lab results showed that she had not contracted the
bird-flu virus but was rather suffering from the Respiratory
Syncytial Virus [RSV], the most common cause of bronchiolitis and
pneumonia among young children.

A total of 8 people, including the kindergarten staff and
veterinarians who inspected the site, received preventive therapy.
Tests indicated that the children and their parents had not come into
contact with the birds.
In response, ministry officials culled suspect fowl at a kindergarten
complex in the town, to minimize the risk to humans. In addition, the
authorities banned moving animals within a 10-km (6-mi) radius of
Binyamina. Fowl within a 3-km (2-mi) radius were culled and buried.
The veterinary service has begun checking all poultry coops, petting
zoos and yard fowl in Binyamina and the farming communities in the
area under quarantine.
The Haifa district physician, Prof Shmuel Rishpon, praised the owner
of the kindergarten, Batya Ben Asher, for calling a veterinarian
instead of dumping the carcasses when chickens in a kindergarten fowl
corner died. The veterinarian, Dr Gilad Goldstein, suspected an
outbreak of Newcastle fowl disease or avian flu, so he sent samples of
the dead chickens to the Agriculture Ministry for examination.
Meanwhile, the Poultry Breeders Association demanded an immediate
increase of 25 percent in the monetary compensation for farmers,
should the state order mass culling.
The association's secretary, Yaakov Cohen, said the authorities were
forced Thursday [3 Jan 2008] to destroy a flock of egg-laying hens at
Moshav Beit Hanania, near Binyamina, but that the region does not
have large numbers of fowl, reducing the health hazard to humans. He
added that the outbreak's economic damage to farmers has not been
great, and that the risk of harm to Israel's poultry export business
is low.
Israel reported the outbreak of avian flu to the European Union and
World Health Organization (OIE), which praised it for acting
promptly, Cohen said.

[The daily "Yediot Aharonot" of 4 Jan 2008 included the following
information in its printed edition: "On Fri 28 Dec 2007, the
kindergartner, Batya Ben Asher, entered the birds' cage and found 3
dead chickens. She decided to contact the vet, explaining: "These
were 3 chickens received a week earlier from Kefar Nahum (probably,
should read Kefar Menachem), it seemed unusual and I decided not to
neglect it. We have many children in the kindergarten and I am
responsible for their well-being."
The information above, particularly an introduction of avians from
another location, deserves clarification. - Mod. AS]

[Dr Balicer's reminder is gratefully acknowledged; the 2nd paper,
mentioned by him, concluded: "Our article shows that irrespective of
political circumstances, the common threat of an emerging infectious
disease serves as an opportunity to bridge disputes and focus on
humanitarian and health matters for the common good of all bordering
countries".
The early detection and speedy eradication of the current minor
outbreak in a single pet-birds ("hobby") holding in Israel is
encouraging, demonstrating the value of contingency plans and their
meticulous application. This outbreak may also be seen as a sentinel
indicative of the H5N1 circulation within the region. HPAI (highly
pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 is known to be rife in at least 2
regional countries, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Sequencing of the Israeli
isolate may help in discovering the source of the outbreak.
(The moderator's commentary in ProMED-mail 20080103.0023, addressing
the 2006 outbreak, included the following sentence: "During the same
period, an FMD outbreak was detected on the other side of the Jordan
river, namely the Kingdom of Jordan". Obviously, "FMD" should have
read "HPAI"). - Mod.AS]

Bird flu has spread to another district in Bangladesh, forcing health
and veterinary workers to cull around 1500 birds, officials said on
Friday [4 Jan 2008].
The latest H5N1 infection was reported in Kurigram, 380 km (240
miles) north from the capital, said Salehuddin Khan, director of the
government's livestock department.
Bird flu was first reported near the capital in March last year
[2007] and has since spread mainly to northern districts, forcing
authorities to kill more than 300 000 chickens.
With the latest outbreak, 21 of Bangladesh's 64 districts have been
affected by the deadly virus.
There are around 150 000 poultry farms in Bangladesh, with an annual
turnover of USD 750 million, officials said.
About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated
with poultry farming, but so far there have been no cases of human
infection in the densely populated country, government and health
officials say.

China has reported an outbreak in poultry of the H5N1 strain of bird
flu in its far west Xinjiang region, Xinhua news agency said on
Friday [4 Jan 2008].
The 1st bird flu outbreak in the country since September [2007] came
about a month after the virus killed a 24-year-old man in the eastern
province of Jiangsu.
A total of 4850 poultry have died of the disease in Turpan city in
the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region since 29 Dec 2007, prompting
authorities there to cull another 29 383 birds, Xinhua said.
The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed the virus
as a subtype of the H5N1 strain on Thursday [3 Jan 2008], it said,
without specifying which kinds of poultry were infected.
"At present, the epidemic has been brought under effective control,"
Xinhua said.
With the world's biggest poultry population and hundreds of millions
of farmers raising birds in their backyards, China is seen as crucial
in the global fight against bird flu.
The Agriculture Ministry has warned of a "very high" possibility of
bird flu outbreaks in the country over winter and spring, when the
virus is at its most contagious.
A man died of the H5N1 strain in Jiangsu -- where no poultry outbreak
had been reported at the time -- on 2 Dec 2007, raising Chinese human
fatalities from the virus to 17 and infections to 27.
[The victim's] 52-year-old father was also infected and only
recovered after 3 weeks of treatment.
The rare case of 2 family members struck by the disease has drawn
urgent concern from health authorities, as humans almost always
contract H5N1 from infected birds.
Chinese officials said they had found no evidence that the virus in
the Jiangsu case has mutated into a new strain that jumps easily from
person to person.

[Similar reports have been received from Christian Griot, Jane
Pritchard, and Mary Marshall, who are kindly acknowledged.
The delay in officially reporting the described outbreak in Xinjiang
to the international organisations is rather concerning. China's last
follow-up report to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health),
which addressed the situation in Tibet, was submitted on 15 Sep 2007
(see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_fup_0000006213_20070917_155704.pdf>).
With the approaching Olympic games, improved transparency is indeed
anticipated.
