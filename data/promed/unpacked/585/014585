Testing Results at 28 Sep 2000
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/enceph.htm> [edited
Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 39 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 16 were negative and 19 are pending.
These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered.
New Jersey's 2 newest positive human cases include an 82-year-old Little
Falls man who died in mid September, and a 72-year-old Bayonne woman who is
home recovering. The Little Falls man is the first person with WNV to die
this year in the United States. He became ill 3 Sep 2000, and was admitted
to The Mountainside Hospital 3 days later. He died 14 Sep 2000. The
Bayonne woman was admitted to Bayonne Hospital 1 Sep 2000 and discharged 6
Sep 2000.
New Jersey's earlier human cases include a 43-year-old Jersey City man and a
54-year-old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park,
Bergen County.
Human testing for WNV is being conducted at the New Jersey Department of
Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory in
Trenton and at public health labs in other states. Testing results are sent
to the CDC for verification.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, 931 birds (930 crows and a cockatiel) found in 16 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Bergen (188), Burlington (6), Camden (3), Cape May (2), Essex (94),
Gloucester (2), Hudson (61), Hunterdon (3), Mercer (7), Middlesex (199),
Monmouth (139), Morris (33), Ocean (11), Passaic (69), Somerset (16) and
Union (98) Counties. The tests were conducted at the Department of Health
and Senior Services' lab in Trenton. A total of 1658 crows have been
accepted for testing this year.
Mosquito, House Sparrow & Sentinel Chicken Testing
Thirty-four mosquito pools collected in Bergen (19), Essex (1), Middlesex
(2), Monmouth (3), Passaic (7) and Sussex (2) Counties have tested positive
for the presence of WNV. In total, 13 885 mosquito pools from all 21
counties have been collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control
Unit and tested by the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the
CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken
flocks placed in all 21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture have all tested negative for the presence of WNV to date.
Horse Testing
Six horses from Atlantic (2), Cape May (1), Ocean (1) and Sussex (2)
Counties have tested positive for WNV. The tests were conducted by the New
Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and
were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
The 2 Sussex county horses and one of the Atlantic County horses were
newly confirmed since 9-21. Two are dead.

NYC Dept. of Health Press Release
http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press00/pr107928.html [edited
28 Sep 2000
Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that the New York
City Department of Health (NYCDOH), in collaboration with the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will conduct a survey on Staten
Island next week to determine the percentage of people on Staten Island who
may have been exposed to West Nile virus (WNV), as well as what may have put
those individuals at risk for infection. Dr. Cohen joined Staten Island
Borough President Guy V. Molinari, CDC West Nile Virus Coordinator Steven M.
Ostroff, M.D., and NYCDOH Assistant Commissioner for Communicable Diseases
Marcelle Layton, M.D., at Staten Island Borough Hall in making this
announcement.
Dr. Cohen said, "Over the next 2 to 3 weeks, beginning on 3 Oct 2000,
the Department of Health and the CDC will conduct door-to-door surveys of
households in several neighborhoods on Staten Island to help find out the
percentage of people in those areas who may have been exposed to West Nile
virus, and what may have put those people at risk for infection. Most human
infections have occurred on Staten Island, and by focusing on this borough,
we hope to get a better understanding of West Nile virus and its risk
factors for infection in New York City. This understanding will further
improve the effectiveness of mosquito-borne disease prevention and control
strategies for the future.
"Households will be selected at random, and participation in the survey is
voluntary and confidential. A small amount of blood will be collected from
those who agree to participate. We are asking residents of Staten Island to
roll up their sleeves to help us further understand this outbreak, and
hopefully minimize its impact next year in this and other communities. When
the survey is completed, we will present the findings first to Staten Island
residents. It may take several months to complete the testing of blood
samples and analysis of the information collected during the interviews. We
are working closely with local elected officials, non-governmental
organizations, and other community leaders to inform neighborhood residents
about the survey and to address possible questions and concerns. I would
like to thank Staten Island Borough President Molinari and the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention for their assistance and support in this
important public health effort," Dr. Cohen concluded.
Dr. Layton said, "This serosurvey is similar to the one conducted in a 3
square mile area of northern Queens last October, through which the Health
Department estimated that about 2.6 percent of persons age 5 years or
older in the surveyed area were infected with West Nile virus. We are hoping
to get more detailed information through this year's study to help determine
why certain people become infected with West Nile virus and others do not.
Test results will be given back to survey participants, as it will be
necessary to ask additional questions of persons who test positive for West
Nile virus this year, and possibly to get additional blood tests to
determine how recently they were infected."
During the survey activities, the NYCDOH will also concurrently trap wild
birds throughout Staten Island to test for West Nile virus among wild birds
during the survey period. A small amount of blood will be drawn from the
birds, which will then be tagged and released back into the wild.
To date, a total of 13 people have been diagnosed with WNV in New York City
in 2000. Nine of those people are Staten Island residents, all of whom have
been released from hospitals and are recovering. In addition, WNV has been
diagnosed in two Brooklyn residents and one Queens resident, all three of
whom are hospitalized, and also in a person who spends time in Brooklyn and
New Jersey, who has been released from the hospital.

More Evidence of West Nile Virus in Crows in Maryland
-----------------------------------------------------
Six more dead crows infected with West Nile Virus have been found in
Maryland, state officials said today. The birds, all found recently in
Baltimore city, bring to 9 the number of infected birds found in the
state within the last 3 weeks. Officials announced last week that 3
infected birds had been found earlier in the month, in Relay, Baltimore
County; in Columbia and in the Federal Hill section of Baltimore.
The state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said the latest birds were
turned in to its screening lab on Monday, and officially tested positive
today. Two birds were found in 1500 block of Greenmount Ave., and one each
in the 5500 block of Laurelton Ave., 1600 block of Northgate Road, the 1000
block of Argyle Ave., and the 3600 block of Dudley Ave., officials said.
The mosquito-borne virus has been transported up and down the East Coast
this year by infected migrating birds, though last week was its first
appearance in Maryland this year. One infected crow was found in Baltimore
last year.

West Nile Virus Found in Nine species of Mosquito
-------------------------------------------------
ALBANY: Research conducted by the state Health Department this summer has
found the potentially deadly West Nile virus in 9 of the 65 mosquito
species that live in New York, increasing the likelihood of human infection
and complicating how the problem will be tackled in 2001.
"When the number of mosquitoes infected rises, the number of people bitten
rises, and the number of possible people that can get sick rises," said
state Health Department spokeswoman Kristine Smith. When West Nile virus
turned up in New York again this year, health officials thought they were up
against one, maybe 2, mosquito species. While the various species differ
in where they breed, what they feed on and when their populations peak,
precautions such as ridding a property of standing water, wearing
long-sleeved clothing and using insect repellant are effective against all of
them.
Health experts admit that more mosquito species carrying the virus increases
the risk to people, but chances of contracting the virus are slim. Humans
contract it through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes get the
virus from feeding on a bird or mammal that has multiplied the virus it
received from an earlier mosquito bite.
Last year, all 16 mosquito pools that tested positive for West Nile virus
were the species _Culex pipiens_, a mosquito that thrives in suburbs and
cities where it breeds in old tires, storm sewers and catch basins. But this
year, only 95 percent of the 290 mosquito pools were _Culex pipiens_, a
number that suggests that this species is still the primary vector, but that
there are secondary carriers. The 8 other species breed in everything
from treeholes to swamps, and some prefer taking blood from mammals over
birds, which may explain why the virus was detected this year in birds [ !
as well as bats, raccoons, chipmunks, horses and domestic rabbits. "The
larvicide and pesticide spraying conducted this summer would have killed off
the larvae and adults of all mosquitoes it contacted, but with the new
species the state may have to rethink where -- and when -- to apply mosquito
controls", said state wildlife pathologist Ward Stone.
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer said the cost of fighting New York's
West Nile virus outbreak is expected to top $30 million, making the state's
campaign against the virus the most expensive in the nation. This year
alone, states have spent $60 million on surveillance, prevention, control
and public health efforts to combat the virus, but New York -- spending
$16.9 million to date -- will account for half of that total by the end of
the year, Schumer reported.
The New York senator's accounting of the cost of combating the
mosquito-borne virus came on the same day that New Jersey Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman announced the first death this year from West Nile
encephalitis. The 82-year-old man died from the disease on 14 Sep 2000. In
1999, the disease killed 7 in New York.

Bald Eagle Survives West Nile Virus Scare
------------------------------------------
ALBANY: A bald eagle has narrowly escaped death from what is most likely
West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne illness that has claimed the lives of
hundreds of birds throughout the state this year, including 49 species that
are at risk of becoming endangered The bald eagle -- which is listed as a
threatened species likely to become endangered -- is expected to be released
back into [within the next few days.
While blood tests have yet to confirm whether the eagle contracted West Nile
virus or was sickened by pesticide or rat poison -- two other common
culprits in the deaths of birds of prey -- veterinarians who nursed the
raptor back to health suspect West Nile virus. The adult male bald eagle,
which weighs 7 pounds and has a 4 1/2-foot wing span, was barely able to
stand and was suffering from seizures [when found. A band on its ankle
indicated it had flown here from Delaware.
"We don't know specifically with the bald eagle how vulnerable they are to
(West Nile virus) because this would be the first one we've seen," said Ed
Becker, a veterinarian at the Animal Hospital in Guilderland, where all of
New York's injured endangered species are taken for rehabilitation. "We know
that with other birds that if you treat them for encephalitis, half of them
will get better," he added. After days of being fed intravenous fluids and
medication for the life-threatening inflammation of the brain that can
develop after being bitten by a West Nile-infected mosquito, the eagle
[appears now to be on the road to recovery.
