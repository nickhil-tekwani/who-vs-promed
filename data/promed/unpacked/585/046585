Canada has banned importation of Brazilian beef on the grounds Brazil has
not provided the necessary information that it is BSE-free. The decision
was announced in the Canadian parliament by the Health Minister, Alan Rock.
It was stated Argentina, Uruguay, USA, Australia and New Zealand have
provided information showing themselves free of BSE, but Brazil has not.
In reply, the Brazilian secretary of Defesa Agropecuaria (livestock), Luiz
Carlos Oliveira, said Brazil has provided the information.

Herbert Wohn, the president of the German Veterinary College has reported
at a Congress in Fulda that the Institute of Viral Diseases of Tubingen
(Germany) has detected prions in milk substitutes of maternal milk used to
feed calves.
This product contained animal fat, bone meal, vegetarian meal, and
vitamins, and is used to feed newborn calves instead of maternal milk. This
works out [to be] cheaper than using maternal milk and allows the cow to be
milked for human consumption.
Dr. Whon has stated until 1997 the animal fat used in these products was
only heated up to 80 degrees [centigrade ?], an insufficient temperature to
neutralize the prion agent and new cases infected through this source could
therefore be possible until 2003. Spain only changed the industrial process
in 1988.
This scientific finding sheds new light on the case of the cow confirmed
BSE-positive 3 Jan 2001 in Zamora (Spain) belonging to one of the best
farms in the region. The farmer stressed to the press he only gave milk
substitutes and concentrates to his cows until the age of 4 to 5 months and
then mixed his own food from brought-in corn, soy, lucerne [alfalfa], beet
root and mineral supplementation.

Majority of Spanish Farmers Infringe BSE Guidelines
---------------------------------------------
MADRID: Spanish police have registered more than 2000 violations of
European Union (EU) regulations introduced to help fight BSE or so-called
mad cow disease in 3000 spot checks. The infringements were so serious in a
dozen cases criminal proceedings were instituted and 7 arrests were made.
More than 1500 members of a special squad of the Guardia Civil started
checking farms, abattoirs, incinerators, transport companies, feed
manufacturers and other meat-processing plants last December [2000]. The
squad, which is responsible to the environmental protection division of the
police, investigated for 6 weeks whether the plants are observing the EU
regulations on tackling the disease.
The results of the initially-limited campaign were so horrifying the
director-general of the Guardia Civil, Santiago Lopez Valdivielso,
immediately extended the investigational order. A time limit on the
controls is no longer planned. Lopez said most of the facilities inspected
had not adhered to the rules and some had become conspicuous as a result of
several infringements of the EU standards.
A spokesman for the environmental protection department pointed out the
number of registered infringements and crimes did not decline but increased
continuously towards the end of the campaign. The spokesman said violations
of both EU rules and standards decreed by the Spanish government were
manifold: farmers even forged the certificates of origin of their cattle.
The officers found tons and tons of animal feed containing bone meal
throughout the country; animal carcasses were not buried in keeping with
regulations; and abattoir waste ended up on rubbish-heaps. In view of this
blatantly deplorable state of affairs, agriculture minister Miguel Arias
Canete and health minister Celia Villalobos have decoded on [proposed?] new
measures against the disease, in agreement with regional governments.
The state now wants to buy up all animal feed containing meat. In order to
halt the collapse of the beef market, the authorities intend to buy large
quantities of cattle. It was also agreed dead cattle would be allowed to be
buried in exceptional cases.

ROME - At least 100 countries are at risk from mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy), the head of the United Nations' (UN) world food
body said on Wednesday. "FAO estimates between 1986-96 up to today,
meat-and-bone meal (MBM) from Europe was exported to more than 100
countries," Jacques Diouf, director-general of the Rome-based UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO), told Reuters.
"Around 100 countries imported live cattle. Some countries also re-exported
MBM to third countries," Diouf said in a written answer to Reuters'
questions about BSE.
"All countries which have imported cattle or MBM originating from Western
Europe, during and since the 1980s, can therefore be considered at risk
from the disease," Diouf added.
"Regions having imported sizeable quantities of meat meal from the UK
during and since the 1980s include the Near East, Eastern Europe and Asia,"
he said.
He said the least likely risks were in Latin America, Australia and New
Zealand because of the nature of their industries, systems of production
and sources of MBM.

HONGKONG -- Hong Kong denied public hospitals had used British blood
products contaminated with the human form of mad-cow disease. A statement
released by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority confirmed "public hospitals
have neither imported nor used the immunoglobulin concerned."
This announcement follows claims by the Singapore government that 3 vials
of a blood product from donors suffering from Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease
(vCJD) -- a human form of the brain-wasting Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BCE) or mad-cow disease -- had been delivered to the territory.
The Singapore health ministry said in a statement the Hong Kong-based
Inchcape JHD had received the shipment, not Inchcape in Singapore. Inchcape
is a diversified British-controlled group with operations across Asia.
Bio Products Laboratory (BPL), a branch of Britain's National Health
Service, had earlier confirmed the sale to Singapore based on documentation
procedures linking a blood donor's name to the product made.
Each vial is given a batch number and the country to which it is sent is
recorded.

MUSCAT - Oman yesterday strongly refuted foreign Press reports it had
imported possibly contaminated blood or blood derivatives. A Health
Ministry spokesman said the Sultanate had stopped importing blood since
1991 and entirely depended on local donations to meets its requirements.
He added the ministry had the necessary laboratory facilities in place to
ensure the safety of blood and blood products. The spokesman said the
company from which the blood products were allegedly imported was not
registered with the ministry and "was never dealt with in this matter."

China to Test its Cattle for Mad Cow Disease
---------------------------------------------
BEIJING: China will check imported cattle and domestic cows fed on meat and
bone meal (MBM) from abroad for mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE), state media said.
The investigation, to be carried out on hundreds of imported cattle, their
offspring, and a "huge number" of domestic cows fed with foreign-made MBM,
will ascertain whether these animals have symptoms of BSE, the China Daily
said.
Ministry of agriculture official Zhao Weining told the paper although there
were no reported cases of BSE and its human version, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD), in China, a survey of cattle was still necessary to gauge
the health of China's cows.
"There is a very slim chance BSE will become an epidemic in China," said
Zhao, director of the ministry's animal quarantine management division,
quoting the findings of a "BSE risk analysis" conducted by the quarantine
institute last year.
Zhao refused to say how many cows would be tested, but said the number of
cows fed with imported feed were "not a lot" compared the total number of
cows in China. He said China had banned the use of ground-up cattle and
sheep carcasses in cattle feed since 1992, saying only a few cows fed with
such animal feed were still living.
Public concern and international research linked the spread of the
brain-wasting disease to cattle imports and bone meal convinced the
government to conduct the investigation, he said. "If any of the cows are
found to have signs such as nervousness or twitching and are cleared of
other diseases, the cases will immediately be reported to the ministry,"
Zhao told China Daily.
China had banned imports of cattle and cattle products from BSE-infected
countries since 1990 and stopped the imports of cattle and cattle products,
including cattle feed made from ground-up carcasses, from all countries in
the European Union on 1 Jan 2001.
A nationwide cattle survey carried out in line with international practice
is necessary to get an accurate picture of the health situation of cows in
China, said an expert from China's national BSE test center in Qingdao,
northern Shandong province. He said China might have imported cows, cattle
products or bone meal from some countries before the disease was found
there, the unidentified expert told China Daily.
In another development, the Beijing administration for exit/entry
inspection and quarantine announced it was setting up China's first BSE
control laboratory in the Chinese capital. The laboratory will provide
convincing proof to the world Chinese cattle and beef are safe, making
exports of Chinese animals and their products more attractive, he said.
