The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has announced the second
detection this season of potato wart disease [PWD] in Prince Edward Island
(PEI), following an earlier announcement of the first discovery on 4 Sep 2002.
The newly discovered infected field is located about 15-20 km east of the
field where PWD was detected and announced yesterday. The CFIA is
conducting an in-depth investigation of both recent findings, in
cooperation with the PEI provincial government and the PEI Potato Board.
The CFIA is currently working under the terms of the 3 year Canada/US work
plan. Only potatoes determined to be free of PWD will be certified as
eligible to be shipped domestically or to the United States.
The latest finding of PWD was made during a routine CFIA post-harvest field
inspection as required under the work plan. Potatoes from both of the
affected fields were being harvested for processing only.
During the past 2 years 11 600 soil samples were analyzed, 8400 inspections
were conducted, and over 7000 fields have been declared free of PWD.
Officials from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) are planning to
visit PEI early next week to assess the situation.

[The fact that a second instance of PWD has occurred in PEI certainly
suggests that there has been spread of the pathogen _Synchytrium
endobioticum_, which affects potato tuber initials and tubers. Thick-walled
winter sporangia which form in infected potato tissues are released when
tissues decompose. These sporangia can be found as deep as 50 cm below the
soil surface and can remain viable for at least 30 years. Spread of these
sporangia occurs primarily by movement of infected seed tubers, by infested
soil adhering to tubers, and by movement of soil. The following reference
