PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2010 (05)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human population
of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated previously as vCJD or
CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been decided to broaden the scope
of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to include other prion-related
diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of CJD: sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial, and GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are
included also since they may have some relevance to the incidence and
etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

In this update:
[1] UK: National CJD Surveillance Unit - monthly statistics as of 3 May
2010 - no new vCJD cases
[2] France: Institut de Veille Sanitaire - monthly statistics as of 30 Apr
2010 - no new vCJD cases
[3] Australia: vCJD case suspected

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases remains 168. A
total of 4 definite/probable patients are still alive so that the total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases is now 172. So far, only one
fatality has been recorded in 2010.

Although 3 new deaths due to vCJD were recorded in 2009 and one death so
far in 2010, the overall picture is still consistent with the view that the
vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28
in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in
2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, and one so
far in 2010.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK so far in the year 2010
-------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 4 months or 2010, there have been 47 referrals, 19 fatal
cases of sporadic CJD, one fatal case of vCJD, and none of familial CJD,
iatrogenic CJD, or GSS.

During the 1st 4 months of 2010, there were 616 referrals, 16 confirmed
cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial CJD, and no cases of iatrogenic
CJD or vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD has now been recorded in
France since records began in 1992. There was 1 case in 1996, 1 in 2000, 1
in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in 2007, 2 in 2009,
and none so far in 2010.

The 25 confirmed cases comprise 13 females and 12 males. All 25 are now
deceased. Their median age is 37 (between 19 and 58). 7 were resident in
the Ile-de-France and 18 in the provinces. All the identified cases have
been Met-Met homozygotes. No risk factor has been identified. One of the 25
had made frequent visits to the United Kingdom.

[3] Australia: vCJD case suspected

Fears mad cow disease may have killed Australian woman
------------------------------------------------------
Mad cow disease [that is, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] may have
claimed the life of an Australian woman. Health officials are testing her
body for the illness that sparked a global scare in the 1990s.

North Sydney Central Coast Area Health confirmed yesterday [13 Apr 2010]
that the remains of the woman, who died at Gosford Hospital last week [week
of 5 Apr 2010], had been sent to Sydney University to test for CJD
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). There are 2 main types of the untreatable
disease -- classic CJD and variant CJD, commonly referred to as the human
equivalent of the mad cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy].

Because the woman had not travelled overseas in recent years, health
officials believe it is more likely she died from classic CJD. Classic CJD
is a rare degenerative disease triggered by mutations within a person's
brain and is not spread by people. It can be genetic and in most countries,
including Australia, descendants of CJD victims are prohibited from
donating blood.

Variant CJD (vCJD) emerged in the UK in the 1990s and is linked to the
consumption of meat products from cattle infected with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), more commonly known as mad cow disease. It is a
separate disease even though many of the symptoms, including the early and
rapid onset of dementia, blindness, loss of balance, and muscle spasm, are
similar.

According to the National CJD Registry in Melbourne, there have been 395
confirmed cases of classic CJD in the past 40 years. There have been no
confirmed cases of variant CJD or human mad cow disease in Australia.
"Central Coast Health Service has confirmed that testing for
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is being conducted on a patient who recently died
in Gosford Hospital," an area health spokeswoman said." The results of the
tests are not yet known."

The results are expected to take some time because of the process involved
with removing the brain and preparing it for various tests.

[There is no compelling reason to believe that this Australian case is
anything other than sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The suggestion of
vCJD appears to reside in the supposition that the deceased patient may
have travelled abroad where she could have been exposed to vCJD infection.
The outcome of the diagnostic analysis is awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
