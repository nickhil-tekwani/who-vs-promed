Influenza - Update 124
----------------------
Summary: The winter influenza season is now under way in parts of the
Northern Hemisphere. North America is seeing increases of
influenza-like illness (ILI) now above baseline levels in parts of
Canada and the United States of America (US) associated primarily with
influenza viruses A(H3N2) and type B.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) has been
experiencing a surge in both mild and severe cases for the last 3
weeks which has not yet peaked and is primarily associated with
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus and to a lesser extent influenza type B.
The pattern of illness associated with H1N1 (2009) virus infection in
the UK is similar to last season primarily affecting young adults,
particularly those with underlying chronic illness or pregnancy
although a number have had no known risk factors.

On the European continent, the Middle East and in northern Asia rates
of influenza-like illness are low but recent increases have been noted
in some areas. In tropical regions, very little activity is noted in
most of the world, however Sri Lanka has reported a marked increase in
the number of both mild and severe cases related to H1N1 (2009) virus,
including 22 deaths. As in the UK, the deaths in Sri Lanka have been
predominantly in people under the age of 60 years and most have had
preexisting medical conditions.
No significant influenza transmission has been reported in Southern
Hemisphere temperate regions. Notably, the large majority of viruses
that have been characterized from North America and the UK have been
antigenically similar to those contained in the current trivalent
influenza vaccine. WHO continues to recommend vaccination for those at
high risk of complications, where it is available, and early treatment
of those at high risk or with severe or rapidly deteriorating disease.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
-------------
The US and Canada both continue to experience increases in all
indicators of influenza activity. Consultation rates for influenza-
like illness (ILI) are still below the epidemic threshold in the US
nationally; however, several south eastern states have crossed the
threshold and are reporting high rates of ILI.

In Canada, the highest levels of ILI activity are currently being
reported in the eastern and central provinces. Rates of death related
to pneumonia and influenza in the US were noted to be below the
epidemic threshold. Nationally, more than 15 percent of clinical
specimens tested in the US and Canada are now positive for an
influenza virus; which is increased in both countries over the
previous week. In the US, influenza type A viruses account for about
56 percent of virus detections and influenza type B, 44 percent. In
contrast, 99 percent of influenza viruses in Canada are type A. In
both countries, of the influenza A viruses that have been sub-typed,
about 90 percent have been H3N2 with influenza H1N1 (2009) accounting
for the other 10 percent.

All influenza viruses that have been characterized in the US and
Canada are antigenically related to the viruses that make up the
current vaccine, including the H3N2, H1N1, and type B viruses. Data
from Canada indicates that the age distribution of severe H1N1 cases
is somewhat younger than those associated with H3N2 virus, with H1N1
continuing to predominantly affect younger adults and children and
H3N2 being more evenly distributed and causing severe disease in older
age groups.

Europe
------
The increase in ILI and severe respiratory disease noted in the UK in
recent weeks has not yet peaked. The UK reports that severe cases
related primarily to influenza H1N1 (2009) continue to occur and a
total of 17 have now required Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation, a
form of advance respiratory support. The rate of reported "all-cause"
deaths in the UK passed the expected levels for this time of year in
week 49. Severe cases have been predominantly associated with H1N1
(2009), have been less than 65 y.o., and largely unvaccinated.

On the European continent, rates of respiratory disease are still
relatively low but the number of countries reporting influenza
detections and the rates of positivity in sentinel samples are
increasing. Of the 13 countries presenting calculated baseline
thresholds, France, Ireland, the Russian Federation and Ukraine
reported clinical consultation rates above their thresholds. Overall
in week 50/2010, 39 percent of sentinel samples tested positive for
influenza compared with 20 percent in the previous week. Of 465
samples positive for influenza virus, 318 (68 percent) were influenza
A and 147 (32 percent) were influenza B. Since week 40/2010, 161
influenza viruses have been characterized antigenically. The type A
viruses are all similar to those found in the current seasonal
vaccine: 90 were A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like; 15 A/Perth/16/2009
(H3N2)-like.

However, the type B viruses were mixed: 5 were B/Florida/4/2006-like
(B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 51 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/
Victoria/2/87 lineage). The influenza B virus in the vaccine is
Brisbane-like. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also circulating
and 14 countries reported detections during week 50.

Middle East
-----------
The Islamic Republic of Iran has noted a sharp increase in H1N1 (2009)
detections in the past week with smaller numbers of influenza type B.
Oman, which has reported increases in influenza virus detections for
the past 3 to 4 weeks, continues to detect predominantly H1N1 (2009)
with lower numbers of type B. Algeria has detected primarily influenza
type B in recent weeks.

Asia
----
ILI rates are beginning to increase in the temperate countries of Asia
as well. Mongolia has noted a sharp increase in the proportion of
outpatients with ILI in sentinel clinics, which crossed the epidemic
threshold 2 to 3 weeks ago. China has noted slight increases recently
in the northern part of the country, where 18 percent of specimens
tested have been positive for influenza virus. In both countries,
influenza A (H3N2) virus has been the predominant virus detected with
China also reporting smaller numbers of influenza type B. The Republic
of Korea and Japan have also noted low level but increasing rates of
ILI. In Republic of Korea 35 percent of specimens tested were positive
for influenza virus in week 50. H1N1 (2009) is the predominant virus
circulating in both countries although in Japan this represents a
shift from recent weeks in which H3N2 virus was more commonly detected.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in the tropical areas of the Americas is quite low
with only sporadic activity being reported in most countries.
Previously noted influenza A (H3N2) transmission in Paraguay and
Bolivia has decreased to near baseline levels. In tropical Asia, Sri
Lanka has experienced a marked increase in influenza cases in the last
3 to 4 weeks almost entirely associated with influenza H1N1 (2009)
virus with small numbers of influenza type B. Sri Lanka reports that
22 influenza related deaths have occurred so far this season, only 3
of which were in individuals 60 years of age or older.

Limited data from Viet Nam indicates community transmission of
influenza there as well, predominantly influenza type B, but the
remainder of southern Asia including India, Bangladesh, Thailand,
Cambodia, Singapore, China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
Southern China and Chinese Taipei report very little or no influenza
activity. The small numbers of viruses detected in these areas have
been a mixture of all 3 circulating types.

Data from the tropical areas of Africa are limited but indicate that
no active transmission is occurring in Western Africa and continuing
transmission of H1N1 (2009) in central Africa as evidenced by
detections of the virus in Cameroon. In Eastern Africa, Kenya and
Madagascar both report ongoing transmission of H3N2 virus with
occasional detections of influenza type B and A(H1N1) 2009.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The influenza season has ended in the temperate countries of the
southern hemisphere and no appreciable community transmission is being
reported from any of the countries monitored there.

[The good news is that the majority of the viruses that have been
characterized throughout the northern hemisphere have been
antigenically similar to those contained in the current trivalent
influenza vaccine. Hopefully this situation will continue into 2011. -
