The number of mushroom poisonings in Belgorod oblast has grown up to 41
cases during the last month. Most of the cases were of moderate severity.
The poisonings occurred after eating mushrooms of _Tricholoma_, _Russule_,
_Suillus_ and _Armillaria mellea_ species. Some people were not sure what
type of mushrooms they ate.

[The ability to distinguish poisonous from non-poisonous varieties of
mushrooms is quite difficult. If you intend to hunt for edible mushrooms
perhaps going with a trained mycologist would be wise. - Mod.TG]

Since the beginning of this year [2010], 15 people in Odessa oblast became
sick with mushroom poisoning, including 4 children. One of the poisoned
adult cases died. The number of cases in Odessa puts the region in the 3rd
place across all Ukraine. The number of mushroom poisoning cases in Ukraine
was 136 this year [2010], which included 11 children and 15 adult
fatalities. The largest number of poisoning cases occurred in Vinnitsa
oblast (26), then in Donetsk oblast (18).

The Ministry of Health reported that about 80 species of mushrooms in
Ukraine are potentially dangerous for health, and 20 out of them are even
dangerous for life. Most of the cases occurred due to consumption of death
caps, which are being mistaken for champignons or russules.

Edible mushrooms may cause poisonings as well, when they are not correctly
processed or when they accumulate different contaminants, especially along
the roads. The death cap does not grow in some regions of Ukraine, for
example in the south. However, the poisonings occur mostly in the southern
regions.

[It is interesting that the death cap does not grow in the southern region
of the Ukraine, yet that is where most of the poisonings occurred.
Supposedly then, the poisonings resulted from some mushroom other than the
death cap. - Mod.TG]

Eight people in Lugansk oblast became sick with mushroom poisoning this
year [2010] according to a report from the Ministry of Health. These cases
included one child and one fatality. It is worth noting that there were no
mushroom poisoning cases in Lugansk oblast last year [2009].

[If there were no cases last year [2009], then were there fewer mushrooms?
Were weather conditions more conducive for mushroom growth this year, or
were fewer people hunting mushrooms? Or is there a community education
program on proper identification of mushrooms? These are interesting
statistics. - Mod.TG]

There were 10 mushroom poisoning cases in Ivanovo-Frankovo oblast from
death caps this year [2010]. It is notable that 7 of these cases, including
one child, were registered during the last week. These incidents are
remarkable because there were no mushroom poisoning cases in this region
last year [2009], and there was only one case during the year before the last.

Seven people in Vinnitsa oblast became sick with mushroom poisoning within
a day. Most of these cases were not related to each other. All the patients
have been hospitalized. Overall, 52 people in the region suffered from
mushroom poisoning so far this year [2010], including 8 children.

Specialists distinguish 3 peaks in mushroom poisoning morbidity in the
region. The 1st is during the spring, which is at a low level, followed by
an autumn burst of morbidity. During the winter time, people become sick
from preserved mushrooms.

It is possible to fall sick after eating mushrooms that are considered edible.

The regional surveillance authorities announced that 90 percent of
morbidity in the region occurred during the month of October. There were
114 mushroom poisoning cases in 2009, 18 of which led to fatal outcomes.
This year [2010], only 8 cases have been registered, including one child
fatality. This is much less than during last year, the specialists say;
however, the worst may still be yet to come, since the rainy weather, which
is expected during the 10-15 Oct 2010 time frame, may result in mushroom
flourishing and new poisoning cases.

[While there are many mushroom poisoning cases, it does appear the weather
plays a role in how the mushrooms flourish. Hopefully, some community
education is involved to further reduce the incidents of poisoning. - Mod.TG]
