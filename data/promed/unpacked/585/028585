Mildew wiping out poppy crops
-----------------------------
A fungal disease, a systemic form of downy mildew, is causing entire paddock losses in poppy growing regions across Tasmania. Downy mildew stunts plant growth, yellows the leaves and has spores that can travel hundreds of kilometres in the air.

Poppy Growers Tasmania president Glynn Williams says that while mildew has been in Tasmania for over a decade, it's behaving differently this season. The presence of the disease has sparked a coordinated, industry-wide response, [including] the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, companies, the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, and Poppy Growers Tasmania. The island state grows almost half the world's supply of opium poppies.

Growers are saying that some crop varieties could be write-offs and commonly used fungicides have proved ineffective in preventing the mildew, because of its systemic nature. Previously, the mildew is thought to have been non-systemic.

Tasmanian Primary Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff says it's a concern to have a strain of downy mildew not responding to normal control measures. He has praised the industry response to the problem in the poppy industry and hopes the urgent research initiative will resolve the issue.

Jarrod Ritchie, poppy processor TPI Enterprises, says, "Up to a quarter of some crops could be affected, but it's too soon to put a figure on losses."

[Different varieties of poppy (_Papaver somniferum_) are grown to produce poppy seed (as edible seeds or for oil extraction) or as a source of alkaloids. Downy mildew caused, in different areas, by either _Peronospora arborescens_ or _P. cristata_ is one of the most economically serious diseases of the crop worldwide. Infections can develop either locally (via plant surfaces, mostly by air borne spores) or systemically (through the vascular system, for example via infected seed). Symptoms may include spots, necrosis and distortion of leaves, failure of flower development, stunting, and collapse of plants. The disease is favoured by humid conditions, especially wet leaves.

The spores can be spread up to hundreds of kilometers by air currents in viable conditions; within a crop spread occurs mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungi survive between crops on infected plant material or volunteer or alternate weed hosts. Disease management may include cultural measures and phytosanitation, but downy mildews are mainly controlled with fungicides. Resistant poppy varieties are being developed.

From the report above it is not clear if the problem is thought to have been caused by a new fungicide resistant strain, or whether fungicides are not effective because these are systemic infections. It is also not clear why systemic infection is thought to have replaced the previously reported non-systemic disease; this could also be due to a different, more virulent fungal strain, or perhaps infected seed of the affected varieties. It will be important to clarify these questions by the research programme mentioned above in order to be able to devise effective downy mildew management strategies for the local situation.
