A mysterious flesh-eating disease has spread to more parts of Melbourne, with several cases identified in Pascoe Vale South and Strathmore in the city's north. Victoria's deputy chief health officer of communicable disease, Associate Professor Deborah Friedman, said the risk of acquiring Buruli ulcer in these suburbs was considered low, although they were now recognised as potential areas of risk.

The flesh-eating Buruli ulcer has emerged in Melbourne's inner north-west from Victoria's coastline but it is not the first time city residents have been infected. Buruli ulcer has long been associated with coastal Victoria but was first identified in inland Melbourne - in Essendon, Moonee Ponds and Brunswick West - early last year [2021]. Friedman said genetic analysis of bacteria isolated from the new cases suggested a "common source of infection in the area" with the cases in 2021.

The potential source has not been established, although the bacteria were isolated from the faeces of a local possum, the Department of Health said. Scientists have said that ringtail and brushtail possums are probably key carriers, and mosquitoes likely play a part in carrying _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, the bacteria that causes the ulcer, from marsupials to humans.

In a health advisory to health professionals and residents of Pascoe Vale South and Strathmore, Friedman said there was increasing evidence that mosquitoes played a role in transmission, so reducing mosquito-breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites were important prevention measures.

"Early diagnosis is critical to prevent skin and tissue loss," she said. A lesion can be mistaken for an insect bite, and over time can develop into a destructive skin ulcer which is known as Buruli or Bairnsdale ulcer.

People are being urged to cover their bodies while working outside, reduce areas where water can pool and wash and cover scratches received while working outside.

The highest risk areas for Buruli ulcer are Rye, Sorrento, Blairgowrie and Tootgarook on the Mornington Peninsula. Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads, Point Lonsdale and Queenscliff on the Bellarine Peninsula, along with bayside suburbs Frankston and Seaford, are considered moderate risk.

Victorian cases are reported throughout the year, but typically peak from June to November, the department said. There have been 39 cases so far this year [2022].

Victorian health authorities issued an advisory on [Wed 4 May 2022] after cases of Buruli ulcer were detected in Pascoe Vale South and neighbouring Strathmore. The discovery has expanded the inner-Melbourne area of interest for the skin infection, which has previously been found in 3 neighbouring suburbs.

Research has suggested a common source of infection in the area. Buruli ulcer is caused by a bacterium that leads to lesions, usually on the arms or legs. It can look like an insect bite and usually shows up as a slowly developing painless nodule or raised bump on the skin. Sometimes it can be itchy and over weeks can grow into a destructive skin ulcer.

The bacterium produces a toxin that affects the immune system while continuing to damage tissue. Since the ulcer gets bigger with time, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to minimise skin loss and tissue damage. If left untreated, surgery may be needed.

There's increasing evidence mosquitoes play a role in its spread, so authorities advise reducing mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are important prevention measures.

Experts say the risk of acquiring Buruli ulcer in inner Melbourne is low, although the geographic spread of cases has widened. The disease was found in nearby Essendon, Moonee Ponds and Brunswick in February 2021 - the first time a non-coastal area in Victoria was branded a potential area of risk.

The potential source of these cases was not established, although the bacteria were isolated from the faeces of a local possum. The disease does not spread from person to person and there is no evidence it spreads from possums directly to humans. The disease can occur at any age, but notifications in Victoria are highest in people aged 60 years and over. In Victoria, case reporting peaks between June and November each year. Buruli ulcer must be notified to the health department within 5 days of diagnosis.

[The news reports above say that the incidence of Buruli ulcer is spreading in northern communities surrounding the city of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria, being reported in areas where it has not previously been seen, including Pascoe Vale South and neighboring Strathmore. A map showing the location of these communities can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strathmore+VIC+3041,+Australia.

The Bellarine, on the west, and Mornington, on the east, are peninsulas that surround Port Phillip Bay, on which the city of Melbourne is located. A narrow inlet, called the Rip, 3.5 km (2.1 mi) wide, separates the 2 peninsulas at the entrance to the bay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rip). The Mornington Peninsula includes small towns on its western shorelines that are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula). Most of the Bellarine Peninsula is a part of the city of Greater Geelong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula). Melbourne, located between the 2 peninsulas, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and is the 2nd most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne).

Buruli ulcer (also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer in Australia) is a chronic debilitating skin and soft tissue infection with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. It initially presents as a nodule or large painless area of induration or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face.

It is caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which needs a temperature between 29-33 C [84.2-91.4 F] and a low (2.5%) oxygen concentration to grow in vitro (http://jcm.asm.org/content/36/11/3420.full). The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone -- which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress without pain or fever. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.

Although the exact mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is still unknown, _M. ulcerans_ is thought to be acquired from the environment, and this organism has been found in the feces of possums in Buruli ulcer-endemic areas of Victoria (ProMED post: Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, possum feces 20140913.2771412), where mosquitoes may be vectors (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001305). _M. ulcerans_ is not thought to be transmitted person-to-person (ProMED post: Buruli ulcer - Liberia (02): (BG) comment, RFI 20141028.2908743).

About 2000 Buruli ulcer cases per year are reported worldwide, most commonly from the tropical regions of West or Central Africa. In Australia, most cases are reported from the southeastern state of Victoria, the only non-tropical part of the world where Buruli ulcer is detected.
