Diphtheria has surfaced again in the district, with a 10 year old boy from Parassala who was admitted to SAT Hospital with suspected diphtheria or tonsillitis and tested positive for diphtheria. This is the 2nd case of diphtheria in the district this year [2019], after a 21 year old college student from Kattakada tested positive for the disease in January [2019]. The boy, who was admitted to SAT on 22 May [2019], has recovered well without any complications and is due for discharge in a day or 2.

SAT Hospital superintendent A Santhoshkumar said that the child appeared to have completed the primary immunisation but had not been given the booster dose of DT (diphtheria tetanus) vaccine at 5 years [of age]. "The child did not develop any complications, probably because of the protection afforded by the primary immunisation. However, this case just goes to show that a booster vaccination at appropriate ages is equally important for complete protection against the disease. The primary immunity can wane over time," Dr Santhoshkumar said.

In the case of diphtheria, apart from the booster dose at 5 years [of age], the TT (tetanus toxoid) vaccination at 10 years has now been replaced by Td (Tetanus diphtheria) vaccine as part of the national policy, as diphtheria seemed to be surfacing in older adults in recent years following an epidemiological age shift.

The boy has been administered the diphtheria anti-toxin, while all family members or contacts would be administered erythromycin for 10 days as well as the Td vaccine as prophylaxis, as diphtheria is a highly contagious airborne infection. Health officials said that preventive and control measures had been initiated in the locality and that local epidemiological investigations would be carried out.

Meanwhile, in a press release, the district health administration has appealed to all parents to take special care to ensure that children are fully immunised as per the vaccination schedule to prevent the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

There are 25 children in the district who remain totally unimmunised, while another 325 have been only partially immunised. This year [2019] so far, the district has reported 2 cases of diphtheria, 216 cases of measles, 11 cases of pertussis, and 51 cases of mumps, the press release said.

[Parassala is a town with a population of 33 556 in 2001 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parassala) and located 34 km [21 mi] south east of the city of Thiruvananthapuram https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Parassala,+Kerala,+India/Thiruvananthapuram,+Kerala,+India). Thiruvananthapuram, the capital and most populous city (population 957 730 in 2011) in the Indian state of Kerala, is located on the west coast near the extreme south of the mainland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram). A map showing the location of Thiruvananthapuram can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thiruvananthapuram,+Kerala,+India.

Diphtheria is caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram positive bacillus. _C. diphtheriae_ causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils, where an adherent pseudomembrane forms, which may result in respiratory obstruction. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). The overall case fatality rate for diphtheria is 5-10% but is higher (up to 20%) among persons younger than 5 and older than 40 years of age.

Close contacts, especially household contacts, should receive a diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, and antibiotics, such as benzathine penicillin G or a 7-10-day course of oral erythromycin. - Mod.ML
