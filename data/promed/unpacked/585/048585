[According to the Israeli Veterinary Services statistics, there are more
than 600 000 sheep in Israel, kept in more than 5000 flocks/units. Scrapie
was diagnosed for the 1st time in Israel in October 1993, in a flock of
crossbred sheep in the township Shefaram (Lower Galilee). The entire flock,
counting 113 head, was destroyed. Three years later, in October and
December 1996, 5 clinically scrapie-suspected sheep were observed in 3
small holdings in the same township. These flocks included a total of 71
sheep of all age groups. Stamping out was completed by the destruction of
all the sheep. All animals were autopsied for brain histopathology. The
Kimron Veterinary Institute summarized the findings in the different age
groups as follows:
<1 / 1-2 / 2-3 / 3-4 / >4/ total
25(0)* / 13(1) / 16(8) / 14(5) / 3(0) / 71(14)
(*in brackets -- animals with typical scrapie brain histology).
It concluded that in the said 3 sheep holdings, 30.4 per cent of the sheep,
older than one year, had brain scrapie changes without demonstrating
(clear) clinical symptoms.
The disease was diagnosed again in 2002, when 2 sheep flocks in northern
Israel, one including Assaf sheep and the other one Merino and Dorper
crossbred sheep, were found affected (one case in each flock). All 810
animals in both flocks were destroyed while epidemiological studies could
not follow any possible common sources.
It will be interesting to note the breed of the sheep in the currently
affected flock in Maayya (central Israel). - Mod.AS

Database) includes a map of the outbreak locations. - CopyEd.MJ]
