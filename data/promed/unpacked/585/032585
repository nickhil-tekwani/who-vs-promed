Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Saint Denis, Saint Denis, Saint Denis, Reunion
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 May 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / 7 / 1 / 0 / 7 / 0
Affected population: The bee epidemiological surveillance network detected the presence of Varroa destructor in an apiary located in Saint-Denis. The national reference laboratory (ANSES, Sofia Antipolis) confirmed the identification of _Varroa spp._ on [9 May 2017].

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 14.29 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: As this parasite is exotic in Reunion, emergency measures were applied as of [5 May 2017], even before laboratory confirmation. Hive movements are forbidden all across the territory. A 5 km [approx. 3.1 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi] surveillance zone were implemented around the outbreak. Within those zones, all apiaries are being checked and any infested apiary will be destroyed. A campaign for checking any hive on the whole territory is being performed at the same time.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone , surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, disinfestations, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
ANSES national reference laboratory, Sofia Antipolis (National laboratory) / bees / parasitological examination / 9 May 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.2.7 "Varroosis of honey bees (Infection of honey bees with _Varroa spp._)" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.07_VARROOSIS.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"The mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_) is a parasite of adult bees and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin between the abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can sometimes be found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites steadily increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of infestation can first be recognised. The life span of the mite depends on temperature and humidity but, in practice, it can be said to last from some days to a few months."
