This an update on the mysterious horse disease in Iceland issued by the
Chief Veterinary Officer.
***
April 6th 1998.
UPDATE ON A DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY IN HORSES IN ICELAND.
1. ETIOLOGY.
In spite of extensive investigation in Iceland, Sweden and elsewhere, the
causal agent of this disease has not yet been discovered, but it is
believed to be a virus.
1.1. Serology.
Paired sera from acute and convalescence cases have been tested against the
following agents with negative results: Equine influenza A1, Equine
influenza A2(Borlange), Equine influenza A2(Soderala), Equine arteritis
virus, rhinovirus 1 and 2, African horse sickness, reovirus 1, 2 and 3,
equine herpes virus 1,2,3 and 4, adenovirus, rotavirus, parainfluenza 3,
Berne virus, equine infectious anaemia virus. _Erlichia equi_ and _Erlichia
risticii_, negative.
1.2. Virus isolation/identification.

PCR for Equine herpes virus, pestivirus and Equine arteritis virus in
leucocytes ... negative.
Equine influenza virus isolation from faeces, leucocytes and nose swabs ...
negative.
Search for virus in faeces by electron microscopy ... negative.
2. EPIDEMIOLOGY.
2.1. Horses are the only species affected. Morbidity is very high and most
likely almost 100%, but the disease is so mild in many cases that it may go
unnoticed in outside herds. Mortality is very low or between 0.1 - 0.2% as
some 50 horses have died out of ca. 40,000 affected. The number of horses in
Iceland is believed to be ca. 80,000.
2.2. Distribution.
The disease is believed to have started in the Reykjavik area with the first
cases identified in mid February. On the 27th of February a regulation was
passed banning all movement of horses in the whole of Iceland. However, some
spread had by then already taken place to stables in the area and to
Akranes, a town north of Reykjavik, and to two farms in Arnessysla county
east of Reykjavik, which has now lead to widespread dissemination to most of
the farms in that county and to Rangarvallasysla county, next to the east.
2.3. Transmission.
The causal agent is believed to be a virus and it seems to spread both by
direct contact between horses and with movement of people between stables.
Spread has occurred between horses being kept outside on farms without the
above mode of transmission. Therefore windborne spread is suspected. Also
suspicion has fallen on flocks of small birds flying between these farms and
eating seeds from the hay being fed to the horses outside.

3. CLINICAL SIGNS.
3.1. Clinical findings.
Incubation time is from 2 to 8 days. Most horses seem only mildly affected
with slightly elevated temperature and some degree of listlessness.
However, some horses have temperatures up to 42Â°C and go off their feed for
couple of days. Severe leucopenia is seen in some cases. Very few get
complications with severe colic and some have diarrhea. No abnormal signs
are seen from the respiratory system. In most cases the disease is over in
two to three days and riding horses are usually back to normal training in a
week to ten days. Some older mares that are kept outside and are suckling a
foal and sometimes also in foal get eclampsia. Some respond to i.v.
injections of calcium and glucose solutions, but some die or may have to be
put down.
3.2. Post Mortem findings.
The most predominant feature on autopsy is swelling of the mucosa in the
small intestines and histology shows some atrophy of the intestinal villi
and thickening of the endothelium of small blood vessels. In some cases the
kidneys are also swollen, but this could be due to secondary bacterial
infections.
4. DIAGNOSIS.
On clinical signs, often only on elevated temperature and listlessness in a
number of horses in the same stable or a herd.
5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.
Early cases were mistaken for Listeriosis, commonly seen at this time of
year, but usually affecting only one or two horses at the same time.
6. CONTROL.
A total ban on all movement of horses between stables and farms was issued
on the 27th of February and export was stopped from the same time and has
remained in force. Another regulation was passed on the 18th of March
defining infected areas and placing restrictions on movement of horses in
and out of these areas, but allowing movement inside them. Requirements for
disinfection of transport vehicles was also made. Furthermore areas of high
risks were defined surrounding the infected areas. In many cases areas and
boundaries have been defined according to the 50 year old system of dividing
Iceland into areas to control Scrapie and Paratuberculosis in sheep. The
regulation has been amended but these restrictions have to a large extent
prevented further spread due to movement of horses and people.
The enclosed map shows these affected areas and that most of Iceland is
still free of this horse disease. [Unfortunately, not supplied. MHJ
7. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.
All efforts are being made to discover the infectious agent. The possibility
exists that this may be a virus common to horses in Europe. Several cases
are known where Icelandic horses exported to Europe get various "flue like"
conditions after contact with horses there, in some cases not unlike the one
described above, but that does not seem to have been investigated in full.
It is possible that an accidental transport to Iceland of this unknown virus
may then be the cause of this disease due to the almost total lack of
immunity to viruses in Icelandic horses.
