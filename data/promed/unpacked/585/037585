Study identifies virulence markers in hard-to-eliminate virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
Marek's disease virus is ubiquitous in poultry, and recent research indicates highly virulent strains can persist for years on farms.

On one Iowa farm, for example, strains collected in 2011 and 2013 were closely related to an isolate that caused disease in 1999, according to a scientific article. That article, "Identification of Marek's disease virus genes associated with virulence of US strains," was published [11 Jun 2019] in the Journal of General Virology [see below].

Researchers with the Department of Agriculture and Michigan State University analyzed genetic sequences from 70 strains of Marek's disease virus and identified sequences connected with virulence. Similarities among strains collected years apart indicate the virus is difficult to eradicate once established on a farm, according to the article and an announcement from the USDA Agricultural Research Service [ARS].

Marek's disease can be deadly to unvaccinated poultry. Vaccination prevents life-threatening tumors, but it doesn't stop virus replication, the article states. The virus's persistence in poultry may be related to a rise in virulence of the strains found in commercial flocks over the past 40 years, the article states.

But the article and announcement indicate the researchers found no recent increases in virulence. One of the authors, Dr John R Dunn of the ARS, said in the announcement that current farm practices and vaccination strategies may be reducing persistence of the virus in barns and selection pressure.

The Merck Veterinary Manual entry on Marek's disease in poultry, authored by Dr Dunn, states Marek's disease is in chicken flocks worldwide.

"Every flock, except for those maintained under strict pathogen-free conditions, is presumed to be infected," the entry states. "Although clinical disease is not always apparent in infected flocks, a subclinical decrease in growth rate and egg production may be economically important."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marek's disease virus (MDV) is the most well-cited example of vaccine-driven virulence evolution. MDV induces a lymphoproliferative disease in chickens, which is currently controlled by widespread vaccination of flocks. Unfortunately, Marek's disease (MD) vaccines, while effective in preventing tumours, do not prevent viral replication and mutation, which has been hypothesized as the major driving force for increased MDV virulence of field strains during the past 40â€‰years in US commercial flocks. To limit future virulence increases, there is interest in characterizing MDV strain genomes collected over the years and associating genetic variations with variation in virulence. In this study, we characterized 70 MDV genomes with known virulence by complete or targeted DNA sequencing, and identified genetic variants that showed association with virulence. Our results revealed a number of MDV genes as would be expected for a complex trait. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear separation of strains that varied by virulence. Interestingly, high virulence isolates from the same farms persisted over years despite eradication attempts, which has implications on control efforts. Given the growing ability to bioengineer the MDV genome, it should be feasible to experimentally test whether these individual variants influence virulence markers alone or combinations. Once validated, these markers may provide an alternative to live bird testing for evaluating virulence of new MDV field strains.

[While most research is focused, understandably, on our commercial production birds and the toll this disease can take on production, it is probably much harder on the small back yard producer whose flocks may be small and the eggs may or may not be sold locally but only consumed by families.

Understanding different strains of this disease may help diagnostic labs as well as veterinarians be aware of subtle differences. - Mod.TG]
