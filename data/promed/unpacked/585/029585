The WHO/PAHO Epidemiological Alert posted on ProMED-mail on Thu 17 Oct 2013 is a useful reminder indeed of hantavirus infections occurring in the Americas but should be completed and even corrected in a few points as follows:

1. Brazil has not been mentioned, despite being the most endemic New World country for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), with, until now, over 1600 cases registered -- that is, more than half of the total of cases reported so far in the Americas.

According to the National System of Disease Notification (SINAN) in Brazil, 1486 cases were registered from 2001 through 2011. Hantavirus serotypes very typical for Brazil include _Araraquara virus_, carried by_Necromys lasiurus_, and _Juquitiba virus_, carried by _Olygoryzomys nigripes_. Moreover, the very 1st (1993) serologically confirmed clinical cases of hantavirus infection in the whole New World originated also from Brazil (Recife region), but were "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome" (HFRS) cases, with fever, myalgiae, renal involvement (acute kidney injury or AKI), and thrombocytopenia [decrease of platelets in blood]. Because of these clinical presentations, and because of a high degree of exposure to wild rats after local floods, leptospirosis was originally suspected but not lab-confirmed (Lancet 1993;341: 50). Finally, the 1st Seoul virus (SEOV) infection, confirmed by highly specific plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT), was also confirmed in Brazil, again in an HFRS case from Belem, 1st considered as being leptospirosis (Am J Trop Med Hyg 1999;61:316-317).

2. In the USA, the 1st locally acquired cases of HFRS caused by SEOV were not confirmed in 2008 but much earlier. In fact, and as specified even in the title, "3 domestic cases of HFRS in the USA" were confirmed by PRNT already in the early 1990s as being SEOV, again after wild rat exposure. After a long shelf-life, these North American HFRS series, with typical AKI and thrombocytopenia, were eventually published in Nephron 1994;68:48-51 -- that is, almost concomitant with the earliest clinical HPS description (N Engl J Med. 1994;330:949-955).

3. Although now seemingly forgotten, it is not so surprising that the very 1st hantavirus cases in the Americas were discovered as being caused by SEOV, an Old World hantavirus isolated already in 1982. SEOV is the only global hantaviral pathogen, spread by the only cosmopolite rodent, the wild rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), present everywhere. The very 1st (1982) American rodents demonstrated to be hantavirus-positive were, thus in fact, Old World rodents, namely wild wharf rats in Philadelphia, PA, and Houston, TX (NEJM 1982;307:624). Consequently, the 1st (1984) pathogenic hantavirus isolated in the entire Americas was an SEOV obtained from a wild rat caught in Philadelphia, and called _Girard Point virus_ (Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1984;33,992-998). Further SEOV isolations followed in 1985 from feral rats caught in New Orleans (_Tchoupitoulas virus_) and in Brazil (_Belem virus_), and ultimately in 1987 in Baltimore, MD (_Baltimore virus_). The 3 1st domestic cases of HFRS in the USA were due to a _Baltimore virus_ infection.

When, admittedly, American SEOV does not cause big epidemics like in China, where, yearly, thousands of SEOV cases are registered, isolated SEOV HFRS cases almost certainly go nowadays unrecognized or are misdiagnosed, probably as often as leptospirosis, due to the very similar clinical presentation (fever, myalgiae, AKI and thrombocytopenia) and the frequent history of prior rat exposure.

4. In all forms of hantaviral renal participation (including _Andes virus_ (ANDV) and even _Sin Nombre virus_ (SNV)), initial and often heavy proteinuria [the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine] is far more frequent and outspoken than renal function impairment. Temporary endothelial dysfunction and capillary hyperpermeability resulting in (very) protein-rich fluid loss from the vascular compartment are common to all hantavirus infections (HFRS and HPS), and there is no reason why the renal endothelium should form an exception in American cases. For instance, early proteinuria is present in 100 per cent of South American HPS caused by ANDV. ANDV-HPS cases now form the brink of all American HPS cases together. Therefore, it can only be regretted that the WHO, CDC Atlanta, and other official agencies did not simply include proteinuria among their admission criteria for "HPS" as the easiest, quickest, and cheapest test for full assessment of this distinctive feature.

[ProMED-mail thanks Jan Clement for providing this important information that significantly fills in deficiencies in the PAHO/WHO report previously posted on 17 Oct 2013 (archive no. 20131021.2011824). The PAHO conclusions and recommendations remain valid, however: "Given increasing hantavirus infection cases in some countries of the region in 2012 and early 2013, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that member states continue efforts of detection, investigation, reporting, and case management for the prevention and control of infections caused by hantaviruses." - Mod.TY]
