Experiments in transmitting lethal anthrax by vector were published in:
Infect Immun (1987 Aug) 55(8): 1859-61. Stable flies and mosquitoes were
successful in transmitting lethal anthrax even after being held for 4 hours
before feeding on susceptible animals. Considering the anthrax outbreak in
Canada, we at Medical Corps think there may be another explanation besides
disturbed soil.

[I have had other suggestions along this line. However it is somewhat too
late for fly activity. Thanks to Gopi Nayar in Winnipeg, I was introduced
to Brendan O'Connor, who is in charge of the PDS veterinary diagnostic
laboratory in Saskatoon. It was his laboratory that diagnosed anthrax in
the cattle on this ranch near Watrous.
He tells me that it has been an extraordinarily long dry summer, and on the
affected ranch, the sloughs have dried out revealing the bones of dead
cattle. Van Ness commented many years ago how outbreaks of anthrax followed
a similar climate pattern and drying sloughs in California. Logically the
remaining graze would be in these sloughs attracting cattle, which would
get infected from spores in this now damp soil -- if the spores were in the
lower parts of the slough. Easy to speculate, harder to prove; but the only
explanation to hand at this time. - Mod.MHJ
