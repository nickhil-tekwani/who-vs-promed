Himachal Pradesh's apple crop infected by fungus
------------------------------------------------
Apple farmers in Himachal Pradesh are worried about their crop being
affected by the leaf drop disease this year [2008]. The "Marssonina"
disease is bound to have an adverse affect on apple production in
rural Shimla. The dropping of the leaves is because of an infection
caused by a fungus. The fungus mainly attacks densely forested
orchards, and moisture and humidity act as catalysts.

About 20 percent of the crop has already been damaged in the middle
and the higher belts. "All the leaves have fallen down. Most of the
orchards in the neighborhood are facing the problem," claimed Jagdish
Khimta, an apple grower. Though the apple growers in the Karali area
of Shimla are striving hard to save their crop by spraying with the
fungicides provided by the horticulture department, the effect has
been dismal. "Leaves are falling down, it is not stopping. We don't
know whether it is because of weather or there is some fault in the
fungicide," said Shivdayal Negi, another apple grower.

However, horticulturists are saying that the excessive rainfall this
year [2008] is the root cause of the disease. Due to rains, the
fungicide gets washed away. "This time the spray was ineffective
because of the heavy rains, and the attack has been more this time.
Where the orchards are in the open, there the attack is less," said
Gurdev Singh, director, Horticulture Government of Himachal Pradesh.

Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir are known as the "Apple Bowls of India."
Apple is the mainstay of the local economy with hundreds of rural
people earning their bread and butter from it. The main varieties of
commercially grown apples in India are Royal Delicious, Rich-A-Red,
Red Delicious, and Golden Delicious.

[Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon
mali_ (previously _Marssonina coronaria_) and has been found in North
America and some countries in Asia and Europe. In 2002, apple
production in Himachal Pradesh was severely affected by the disease,
and in India it has also been reported in Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh.

Infections first appear on mature leaves. Symptoms include spots on
leaves and fruit as well as severe premature leaf fall. In affected
orchards, apples nearing maturity are often seen hanging from
defoliated branches. MB affects size, colour, and quality of fruit
making the produce unsaleable. It also reduces fruit set in the
following season. The fungus is reported to survive between seasons
in fallen leaf litter, and spores are spread by mechanical means and
wind. MB development is favoured by humid conditions and multiple
cycles of infection may occur in one crop leading to severe
epidemics. All commercial Delicious cultivars are susceptible.
Disease management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural
techniques and fungicides.
