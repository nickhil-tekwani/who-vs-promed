There has been a major increase in the number of cases of whooping cough across San Diego County in 2013, up double from 2012's count, according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA). So far, 334 local cases of pertussis have been reported, including 12 new cases in local school districts. Compare that to 165 cases reported in San Diego County in 2012. According to the HHSA, the dozen new cases of whooping cough involved patients between the ages of 6 and 16. All but the one case involved patients with up-to-date immunizations.

Given the up-tick in pertussis cases, county public health officer Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH says it's important for locals to be up-to-date on their vaccines and booster shots. "It's likely that activity levels will remain elevated in the region," Wooten said.

In order to combat whooping cough, the CDC says children should get doses of the DtaP vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. The CDC also recommends that preteens and adults get a Tdap booster shot. Individuals without medical insurance can get the shot from a County Public Health Center at no cost.

Now, while cases of pertussis have doubled this year [2013], the HHSA says the current number of cases is much lower than the record-setting number reported in 2010. That year, a total of 1179 cases of whooping cough were reported across the county, 2 of which resulted in infant deaths. In 2011, the number declined substantially, with a total of 400 cases reported in San Diego County.

According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, 2012 was the state's largest outbreak of whooping cough since 1950. Doctors admit cases have been growing because the bacterium has spread to unvaccinated adults. It's that time of year when coughs and sniffles return, but it's what the cough sounds like that doctors say is a cause for concern. Whooping cough isn't just for kids anymore.

"Our older pertussis vaccines gave children a lot of side effects, local side effects, so they came out with a purified version. It's much safer, but the effect seems to wear off," said Dr. Steven Bowers of Memorial Health System. That means many adults are susceptible to whooping cough, even if you had a vaccine years ago. For those who keep up to date on vaccinations, you may be covered.

In 2012, Illinois reported more than 2000 whooping cough cases.

Schools in eastern Idaho's Marsh Valley district have closed for the winter break 2 days early after several students were diagnosed with whooping cough.

District Superintendent Marvin Hansen told The Idaho State Journal (http://bit.ly/SxHTxs) that the health department notified the school this week that there were as many as 7 confirmed cases of pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, in the district. To keep the infectious illness from spreading, schools closed on 19 Dec 2013. Students will return to class on 6 Jan 2014.

For the 2nd time in a month, a Lancaster County school district is experiencing an outbreak of whooping cough.

Pequea Valley School District has 4 confirmed cases of the illness, explained a letter written to parents and guardians from Superintendent Erik Orndorff, who could not be reached for comment on Saturday [21 Dec 2013]. The district's website, http://www.pvsd.k12.pa.us, includes a notice on the outbreak as well.

In November 2013, Penn Manor School District had 3 cases of the infection. The CDC website said there were 1945 confirmed cases of pertussis in Pennsylvania last year [2012] and 48 277 nationwide.

[5] Acellular vaccine non-protection issues

Acellular pertussis vaccines protected against disease but did not prevent infection and transmission, whereas whole-cell vaccines were more effective, according to findings from a primate model study published on 25 Nov 2013 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"There were 48 000 [pertussis] cases reported [in the USA] in 2012 despite high rates of vaccination," Anthony S. Fauci, MD, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news release. "This resurgence suggests a need for research into the causes behind the increase in infections and improved ways to prevent the disease from spreading." Factors underlying increased incidence of whooping cough may include diminished immunity from childhood pertussis vaccines, improved diagnostic testing, and increased reporting.

Findings of the present study may help explain rising USA rates of whooping cough and response to vaccination following replacement of whole-cell vaccines by acellular vaccines in the 1990s. The former contain killed but complete _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, whereas the latter use only selected portions of pertussis bacteria to stimulate the immune response. Despite concerns about adverse effects of whole-cell pertussis vaccines, they are still used in many other countries.

"Pertussis rates in the USA have been rising," write Jason M. Warfel from the Division of Bacterial, Parasitic and Allergenic Products, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA, and colleagues. "Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission."

To test this hypothesis, the investigators vaccinated infant baboons at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with acellular pertussis or whole-cell pertussis vaccines and challenged them with _B. pertussis_ at 7 months. For infected animals, the investigators quantified colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitored leukocytosis and symptoms. An unvaccinated control group contracted pertussis. Neither vaccinated group showed symptoms of pertussis, and both vaccinated groups had robust antibody responses.

Baboons immunized with whole-cell vaccine were bacteria-free within 3 weeks, but bacterial nasal colonization was present for up to 6 weeks in baboons that received the acellular vaccine as well as in those that were not vaccinated. Of even greater concern was that the pertussis bacteria were transmitted from baboons that received acellular vaccine to unvaccinated baboons.

"This study is critically important to understanding some of the reasons for the rising rates of pertussis and informing potential strategies to address this public health concern," Karen Midthun, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a news release. "This research is a valuable contribution and brings us one step closer to understanding the problem. We are optimistic that more research on pertussis will lead to the identification of new and improved methods for preventing the disease."

"While all groups possessed robust antibody responses, key differences in T-cell memory suggest that [acellular pertussis] vaccination induces a suboptimal immune response that is unable to prevent infection," the study authors write. "These data provide a plausible explanation for pertussis resurgence and suggest that attaining herd immunity will require the development of improved vaccination strategies that prevent _B. pertussis_ colonization and transmission."

[The manuscript discussed is Warfel JM, Zimmerman LI, Merkel TJ: Acellular pertussis vaccines protect against disease but fail to prevent infection and transmission in a nonhuman primate model. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA doi: 10.1073/pnas.1314688110:

"Significance:
Pertussis has reemerged as an important public health concern since current acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) replaced older whole-cell vaccines (wP). In this study, we show nonhuman primates vaccinated with aP were protected from severe symptoms but not infection and readily transmitted _Bordetella pertussis_ to contacts. Vaccination with wP and previous infection induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. While all groups possessed robust antibody responses, key differences in T-cell memory suggest that aP vaccination induces a suboptimal immune response that is unable to prevent infection. These data provide a plausible explanation for pertussis resurgence and suggest that attaining herd immunity will require the development of improved vaccination strategies that prevent _B. pertussis_ colonization and transmission.

Abstract:
Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterial pathogen _Bordetella pertussis_. Pertussis rates in the United States have been rising and reached a 50-year high of 42 000 cases in 2012. Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission. To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with _B.. pertussis_ at 7 months. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naive animals, and readily transmitted _B. pertussis_ to unvaccinated contacts. Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong _B. pertussis_- specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines."

More evidence continues to accumulate regarding issues revolving around the protective efficacy of the current acellular pertussis vaccines and the need for an improvement in the current product. - Mod.LL
