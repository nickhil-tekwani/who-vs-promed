An epidemic has struck the Tzukei Uvda base in the Negev, leaving 13
basic trainees from the Engineering Corps ill with pneumonia.
According to Army Radio, 7 of the soldiers were admitted for
treatment in hospitals, and 6 were released home. A female soldier
was listed in critical condition at Soroka Hospital in Beersheva.
"The soldier reached us in very critical condition, and her condition
is still life-threatening," said Doctor Motti Klein from Soroka
Hospital.
500 soldiers from the base were sent home in order to prevent a
spreading of the epidemic, and the Medical Corps in cooperation with
civilian medical services opened an investigation into the incident
to try to determine the source of the outbreak.
Initial findings reached with public health officials did not point
to environmental factors that could have caused the outbreak.

About 500 new Israel Defence Force (IDF) recruits at a base in
southern Israel were sent home after 13 of them contracted pneumonia
in recent weeks. The troops were sent home on Thu 29 Dec 2005, 2
weeks after several new recruits first complained about pneumonia
symptoms. According to the IDF, the soldiers complained of breathing
difficulties accompanied by fever. After being sent to the hospital
by military doctors, pneumonia was diagnosed. One of the female
soldiers who fell ill is currently hospitalized in the intensive care
unit in Be'er Sheva's Soroka hospital and is in serious condition.
Hospital officials said the soldier arrived there in critical
condition but her condition stabilized since then. Other troops are
doing better after receiving treatment and some of them were already
sent home.
Responding to a Ynet inquiry, the IDF Spokesperson's Office said an
investigation into the matter [has been] launched. The army said new
recruits were sent home for a limited time following consultations
with experts on infectious diseases. The soldiers will be monitored
by medical staff while at home. At this time, the reason for the
pneumonia outbreak is unclear.

[Respiratory illnesses cam be caused by a wide variety of organisms.
The information contained in these 2 reports is not sufficient to
suggest a specific diagnosis. The fact that most of the affected
recruits were discharged from hospital and sent home suggests that
their illness was not severe. Historically, adenovirus infections
have been associated with outbreaks of respiratory illness in
military recruits. Both live and inactivated vaccines have been
employed to contain outbreaks of respiratory illness in such
populations. An adenovirus type 4 vaccine and a triple type 4, 7 and
21 vaccine were employed with some degree of success [in the USA].
However, these vaccines are no longer in production, and there is
some evidence that outbreaks of adenovirus-associated illness
affecting military recruits are on the increase. Further information
would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
