DA prepares support program for hog industry amid Ebola Reston case
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Friday said it is working on a
support program to assist hog producers in farms where the Ebola Reston
virus had been detected. Agriculture Secretary Arthur Yap said incentives
will also be provided to other growers to encourage them to participate in
the concerted government program to stamp out the disease.

The planned program will include the acquisition of additional laboratory
kits needed to check the presence of the virus among swine and a support
package to help livestock growers whose infected hogs will be culled or
destroyed by quick-response government teams led by the DAs Bureau of
Animal Industry (BAI) to prevent the spread of the Reston disease among
animals.

This developed as executives of international health institutions such as
the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Office International des Epizooties
(OIE) or World Animal Health Organization commended secretaries Yap of the
DA and Francisco Duque of the Department of Health (DOH) for their
respective offices quick and appropriate action in containing the latest
resurfacing of the Reston virus, which was earlier detected in 2 swine
farms in certain parts of Luzon.

Officials of the DA and DOH along with these international health
institutions have pointed out Wednesday night that the Reston virus does
not pose a significant public health risk."

Duque and Yap said this particular strain of the Ebola virus has been shown
in the past to be non-pathogenic," which means it is not harmful to
humans. Authorities say the Reston virus is entirely different from the 3
other Ebola subtypes, which are all potentially fatal to humans. Unlike the
Zaire, Ivory Coast and Sudan strains, the Reston strain has not been found
to be fatal like the 3 other strains or to have caused illnesses to humans
in contact with the infected animals. It was first discovered in the
Philippines in 1989 among crab-eating macaques or monkeys then being
exported by the Laguna-based Ferlite Farms to the Hazleton Laboratories in
Reston, Virginia.

The WHO and OIE consider the presence of the Reston virus in the
Philippines as an "animal health issue and does not consider this a
significant public health concern at this time."

At the end of a 9-hour consultative meeting with livestock industry leaders
at the DA last Wednesday, WHO country representative to the Philippines Dr.
Soe Nyunt spoke on behalf of OIE and FAO in thanking Yap and Duque for
their efforts in immediately addressing the Reston issue.

The other experts present during the marathon meeting at the DA were
Anthony Hazzard, WHO regional adviser for Food Safety; Carolyn Anne
Coulombe, WHO technical officer (Risk Communications) Communicable Disease
Surveillance and Response; and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine
(RITM) director Remigio Olveda.

AGAP party-list Rep. Nicanor Briones, who represented the subsector of
small livestock stakeholders during the consultative meeting, also thanked
Yap, Duque and WHO officials for educating the public about the Reston
virus. "I would like to thank Secretary Duque and Secretary Yap and the
representatives of WHO for making this thing clear to the public so as not
to spook our consumers," Briones said.

Earlier, Yap said that after finding out the presence of the Reston virus
in the quarantined farms, 28 pig tissue samples taken from different
locations in 4 different periods ­ May, 4 and 26 June, and September ­ were
sent to Center Disease Control (CDC) Plum Island in the US for testing.
Only 6 samples were positive of the virus.

Additional samples sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine
(RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa, after these earlier tests were all found to
be free of the Reston virus.

WHO experts led by Dr Nyunt and Dr Julie Hall, team leader of its Emerging
Infectious Diseases Division, have confirmed during the 10 Dec 2008
consultative meeting at the DA that, based on historical evidence, the
Reston virus has been found to be non-pathogenic" and does not cause
illnesses to humans in the past.

Yap said the WHO has also declared that pork that is properly handled,
washed and cooked is safe for human consumption because heat from adequate
cooking kills viruses, including Reston. In fact, Hazzard told a press
briefing after the consultative meeting that consumers should be worried of
normal bacteria and not of the Reston virus when eating undercooked pork.
"I think that if you undercooked pork, you have much more to worry about
with the normal bacteria and normal parasites. Significantly more to worry
about than Reston," he said.

As a matter of precaution, Yap has called on the public to report sick
animals to their City and Provincial Veterinarians and to refrain from
buying meats from stalls without National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS)
certifications. Yap said that in general, meat from sick or already dead
animals "regardless of whatever viruses these animals had been infected
with" should never be eaten by people.

Yap and Duque, BAI Director Davinio Catbagan and Eric Tayag of the DOH
National Epidemiology Center along with the international health experts
met with officials of industry stakeholders like the National Federation of
Hog Farmers, the Philippine College of Swine Practitioners or PCSP,
Philippine Swine Producers Association, the Soro-soro Ibaba Development
Cooperative, and the partylist organization Agriculture Sector Alliance of
the Philippines (AGAP), to brief them on the official findings on the virus.

Yap pointed out that although no current reports of unusual illnesses nor
deaths in pigs have been reported, the DA and the DOH have engaged
stakeholders in the hog industry, local and international health and animal
experts, to assist the government in the pro-active eradication of this
virus" and in the interest of transparency in government.

Besides tissue samples taken from pigs in the affected areas, Yap said
tests were also done on the handlers in the farms where the virus
originated; and even the butchers in the slaughterhouses where the animals
were usually sent, as a precautionary measure. All the tests conducted on
human samples yielded negative results for the presence of the Reston
virus, he said.

Yap has ordered the BAI, together with the local government units (LGUs),
to continually test pigs in their localities. Hogs in farms that have
tested positive for the virus will be quarantined and will undergo a
comprehensive inventory.

All pigs found to be infected will be destroyed and disposed of properly,
Yap said. As a precautionary measure, Yap had also suspended all Philippine
pork exports until further notice.

[According to the above statement by Arthur Yap, agriculture secretary of
the Philippines, "no current reports of unusual illnesses nor deaths in
pigs have been reported". In such case, the problem might be an
incidentally detected subclinical infection of pigs. There are still many
questions to be attended, such as the reservoir of the virus from which
pigs got infected, the route of infection, incubation time preceding
viraemia in the pigs, the possible role of vertebrate and/or invertebrate
as vectors, etc. Ebola is not included in OIE's list of notifiable animal
diseases.

On Wed, 10 Dec 2008, Mr Davinio P Catbagan, chief veterinary officer,
Department of Agriculture, Office of the Director of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, Quezon City, Philippines, sent an "immediate notification" to the
OIE, reporting "unexpected increase in morbidity or mortality" allegedly
due to Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PPRS) virus. The
epidemiological comments, included in the said notification, are of
particular interest in relation to the Ebola event. (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7596>).
The full epidemiological commentary says:

"In the district of Sto Nino (Pandi municipality, Bulacan province), the
mortality was mostly observed in piglets. In the district of Pinagpanaan
(Talavera municipality, Nueva Ecija province), all animals were downers
with clinical signs suggestive of Porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome (PRRS)/Classical swine fever/Porcine circovirus type 2.

"The Philippines has experienced a sudden increase in mortalities in pigs
in the latter part of the second quarter of 2007 until the first quarter of
2008. The clinical signs exhibited by the diseased animals indicated
atypical infection, which can be attributed to more than one pathogen.

"Samples from the outbreaks were sent to the USDA Plum Island laboratory.
Results show that samples were positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and
atypical PRRS virus, which is 98 percent homologous to the atypical PRRS
virus isolated in China and Vietnam. With high morbidity and mortality
observed similar to China and Vietnam, it was concluded that these
outbreaks were most likely caused by atypical PRRS virus.

"The USDA Plum Island laboratory also reported to have isolated Reston
Ebola virus from swine samples. Although considered of negligible public
health importance, as indicated in the literatures and by the previous
incident in the Philippines in a monkey farm in early 1990s with no human
cases in spite of close contact with the monkeys, as a precautionary
measure the BAI-DA (Bureau of Animal Industry ­ Department of Agriculture)
and the DOH (Department of Health) immediately organised a team to
investigate the affected areas. Samples were collected from people and
animals in the affected areas. Serum samples from animal caretakers and
other people exposed to the animals were collected and tested at the
DOH-RITM (Department of Health - Research Institute for Tropical Medicine),
and all indicated negative results to Ebola-Reston antibodies. Results from
animals are still pending the arrival of kits for swine testing from CDC
Atlanta (Centers for disease control and prevention), which have committed
to send in the Philippines. All animals in the affected areas have been put
under strict quarantine. The BAI-DA and DOH team will continue to conduct
epidemiological investigation."

The inclusion of the above information, pertaining to Ebola infection, in
the PRRS Notification can be seen as a reflection of OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code attitude towards "emerging disease", defined as "a new
infection resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic
agent, a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or population,
or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the
first time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health".
From the above newswire it seems that the 3 mentioned international
organisations, namely the WHO, FAO and OIE, may have, as a precaution,
considered this (subclinical!) infection of pigs as having (potential?)
impact on animal or public health. This is in need of further
clarification. -Mod.AS]
