re: Cutaneous anthrax in Tamil Nadu
-----------------------------------
The case description and the animal disease are quite likely those of
Buffalopox, not at all like anthrax.

[I see no reason to question John's logical suggestion. I had been thinking
of "cow" pox but buffalo pox is more likely. How this man managed to milk
this cow with a tender and probably painful inflamed udder, whatever the
cause, beggars understanding. - Mod.MHJ]
