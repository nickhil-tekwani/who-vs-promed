----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Identification and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest (VOCs/VOIs) is essential to guide public health measures. We report the surveillance of VOCs circulating in Karachi during the pandemic between April 2021 and February 2022. We screened 2150 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples received at the AKUH Clinical Laboratories. VOC was identified using a PCR-based approach targeting lineage-specific mutations using commercially available assays. Of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples, 81.7% had VOC/VOI, while 18.3% were undetermined. Alpha variants were predominant at 82.5% and 40.3% of the cases in April and May 2021. Beta variants increased in May (29%) and June (42%) and then reduced to 6% by July [2021]. Gamma variant cases were at 14.5% and 9% in May and June [2021], respectively. Delta variants first detected in May, increased to comprise 66% of all variants by July, remaining dominant in August, September, October, and November 2021 at 88%, 91%, 91%, and 85%, respectively. Omicron (BA.1) variants emerged in December [2021], rising to 42% of cases with an increase to 81% by January 2022 and then reducing to 45% in February 2022. Delta variant prevalence was coincident with increased hospital admissions and mortality. The omicron variant surge was associated with increased daily infections but limited COVID-19 severity. We highlight the predominance of the VOCs identified through a rapid-PCR-based approach. As this is important to inform a public health response, we propose that a mutation targeted approach can be a rapid, lower-cost solution to aid tracking of known VOCs during pandemic waves.

Discussion
Our data shows that to date, Pakistan has experienced 5 different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1st wave of COVID-19 peaked in June 2020. The number of positive cases increased again in December 2020, contributing to the 2nd wave of the pandemic in the country. The country's 3rd wave peaked in May 2021 and was quickly followed up by the 4th wave toward the end of July 2021. The 5th wave of the pandemic peaked in January 2022, and it was associated with the highest number of daily infections since the start of the pandemic.

As with other countries (20, 21), we also note the lower number of deaths, in relation to the cases detected during the 5th wave, when omicron was the predominant VOC. A decoupling of the number of cases and the mortality during the omicron surge is documented (22).This reduced severity is likely a combination of increased pre-existing immunity, vaccine coverage, and the inherent properties of the virus. During the previous wave, approximately 30% of the population in Pakistan had received at least a single dose of the vaccine (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/pakistan#what-share-of-the-population-hasreceived-at-least-one-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccine, link last accessed 14 Apr 2022), which had increased to over 50% during the 5th wave. Booster doses had also been introduced, just prior to the fifth wave. On the other hand, the exact contribution of the inherent ability of the omicron variant to cause severe disease is still under investigation. It is postulated that this may be due to a lack of mutations at the ORF3a gene compared to the previous VOCs (23), though this is yet to be proven.

We have demonstrated that a PCR-based targeted approach can be used to monitor VOCs in a low-resource setting. However, this approach is unable to fully characterize multiple genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and study viral evolution (26). Furthermore, this method cannot identify minor and novel variants, and several strains were 'undetermined.'

A great advantage of the PCR targeted mutation approach is that it allows for the identification of variants in samples with relatively lower viral loads as compared with sequencing.

As cases of COVID-19 rise sharply throughout the region -- by 27.2% over the past week -- the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) director, Carissa F. Etienne, has called on countries to take action to increase surveillance, public health measures, and vaccination, and to make sure that health systems are prepared to cope with a potential influx of COVID-19 patients.

"Last week, our region reported more than 918 000 cases," the director said in a media briefing today [18 May 2022]. "COVID-19 hospitalizations increased in 18 countries, and admissions to intensive care units rose in 13 countries and territories."

Following a period of lower transmission, the PAHO director highlighted that many countries have abandoned public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing.

But with only 14 of the 51 countries and territories in the Americas reaching the World Health Organization (WHO) goal of 70% vaccination coverage, far too many people remain unprotected.

In some countries, vaccination coverage is particularly low among those at risk of severe disease, including the elderly, pregnant women, and people with preexisting conditions, she noted.

"Each country is only as protected as the most vulnerable in their population," Dr. Etienne said. "It is time to take stock of these numbers and act. COVID-19 is again on the rise in the Americas."

Despite having built "incredible networks for COVID testing and genomic surveillance" over the past 2 years, the PAHO director said that testing rates have steadily declined since January [2022].

"We must keep our eyes on the virus," she said, calling on countries to maintain and strengthen testing infrastructure and to ensure that in places where self-tests are available, results are reported to health authorities.

Countries must also maintain investments in ICU and hospital capacity so that services can be quickly scaled up to meet a potential surge in new infections, she added.

The PAHO director called on countries to be ready to reinstate public health measures in areas where cases spike, and to ensure that the most vulnerable groups are protected, particularly now that vaccine supplies are no longer a barrier.

"We have sufficient doses to cover those most at risk, and we have an obligation to do so," she said.

Turning to the COVID-19 situation in the region, the director noted that more than half of the new infections were reported in North America, where cases have been climbing for 7 weeks, driven by a surge in the United States.

In Central America, COVID-19 cases have increased by 80%, and cases have also spiked in countries across South America.

In the Caribbean, new infections have been on the rise for 5 consecutive weeks, with a 9.3% increase in cases and a 49% increase in deaths.

[B] Paxlovid

Some coronavirus-positive patients who have completed treatment of the anti-COVID drug Paxlovid are rebounding into illness, and experts are urging people to be cautious if they develop COVID-like symptoms again and become infectious.

The agency said that in the Paxlovid clinical trial, there have been some patients -- about 1-2% -- who tested negative and then became positive. The finding wasn't only in people who took Paxlovid; it also occurred in those who took the placebo.

But even if the rebound rate has remained unchanged, the number of people affected could seem far larger now based on wider use of the drug.

"If you have 20 000 people getting Paxlovid every day . . . even if it were only still 2%, that would mean 400 people are having rebound every day. So it is hard to know exactly how often it happens," Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-‚Å†19 response coordinator, said during a briefing Wednesday [18 May 2022].

However, he also noted that "the people who have that rebound are not getting particularly sick, are not ending up in the hospital."

"If the goal of this treatment, which it was, was to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, it is doing that incredibly well," he said.
