Hemophilia patients in Kashmir have contracted hepatitis C, allegedly due to lack of proper blood screening measures in the Valley's government hospitals.

About 34 hemophilia patients have allegedly contracted the virus, which can cause liver damage, due to lack of proper blood screening measures at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital (SMHS) and other hospitals in Kashmir. The patients, who required transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FPP), have allegedly been given infected plasma.

A 22-year-old, who is undergoing follow-up treatment at the SMHS hospital here, has been told that the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C will cost at least 170 000 rupees [USD 2800]. "The doctors told me that treatment will spread over 6 months. But I can't afford the cost," he said. He said the cost would be incurred upon "screening of disease to assess the viral load and on medicines."

Another patient said that he had been suffering from hemophilia since childhood and got the shock of his life recently when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C. This person, who runs a shop at Handwara in north Kashmir, said he can't afford the treatment for hepatitis C disease.

One more hemophilic patient said he went for the transfusion of FFP as the SMHS hospital was facing shortage of injections. "Due to non-availability of the factor 8 injections at SMHS, I went for the fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion. At the hospital, many of the patients were administered contaminated plasma, due to which they developed hepatitis C," he alleged, and added that at least 4 people have died in the past year [2013], allegedly after they contracted hepatitis C disease.

Medical Superintendent (MS) of the SMHS hospital Dr Nazir Chaudhary, however, said the hospital was earlier facing a shortage of funds to provide factor-8 and factor-9 injections to patients. "The problem has now been resolved. However, the government doesn't have the policy to provide free-of-cost treatment to patients," he said.

[This unfortunate event appears to be parallel to the famous Irish incident in which 704 Rh negative women who received an (in retrospect) HCV-contaminated (genotype 1b) anti-D immunoglobulin in an 18-month period between May 1977 to November 1978 were found to have evidence of active or previous infection with the [hepatitis C] virus when screened in the early 1990s. Like the above hemophiliac cohort, these were young individuals. Although chronic infection can occur in as many as 85 percent or more of those infected, this cohort appeared to have cleared the virus in 46 percent of the cases, and, 17 years after infection, of the 376 women studied, 49 percent had no evidence of fibrosis at all, and only 2 percent had cirrhosis, all of whom had a history of excessive alcohol intake.

Although it is possible that this particular virus was perhaps less likely to cause progressive liver disease, there are few parallel examples of this in the medical literature, where individuals are found to be infected by a lookback program rather than being discovered by having abnormal aminotransferase enzymes.
