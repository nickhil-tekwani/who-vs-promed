First report of _Xylella fastidiosa_ in avocado (_Persea americana_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the late 1990s, chlorotic mottling, marginal scorch, deformation of
leaves, defoliation, shortening of internodes, and branch dieback have been
observed in avocado trees (_Persea americana_) in Costa Rica. The symptoms
were not uniformly distributed in the trees (only some branches were
symptomatic) and resembled those of leaf scorch diseases caused by _Xylella
fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 List). In Costa Rica, _X. fastidiosa_ occurs on coffee
and citrus trees. From 2000 to 2004, 227 avocado trees were tested for the
presence of _X. fastidiosa_ (DAS-ELISA) and 188 were found positive.
Transmission studies and molecular tests (electron microscopy, PCR)
confirmed the presence of the bacterium in diseased trees. This is the 1st
report of _X. fastidiosa_ in avocado trees.

Bacterial leaf scorch of blueberry: a new disease caused by _Xylella
fastidiosa_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the last 5 years, a new disease initially described as 'yellow twig'
and then as 'bacterial leaf scorch' has been observed on blueberries
(_Vaccinium_ spp.) in the south of Georgia, USA. Initial symptoms are leaf
marginal chlorosis which then enlarges to the whole leaf. Early leaf fall
occurs, and thin, yellow twigs become apparent on some cultivars. Studies
carried out in 2006-2007 (ELISA, inoculation tests to verify Koch's
postulates) confirmed that the causal agent of 'bacterial leaf scorch' of
_Vaccinium_ is _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 List). Initial field surveys
conducted in summer 2007 showed that bacterial leaf scorch has the
potential to become a major threat to blueberry production in Georgia,
especially on highbush blueberry cultivars (hybrids of _V. corymbosum_, _V.
ashei_, _V. darrowi_). So far, little is known about the blueberry strain
of _X. fastidiosa_. In the field, the disease only causes problems in
southern highbush blueberry cultivars and it is not known whether it could
affect other types of _Vaccinium_ (in particular, _V. ashei_). It is
assumed that _X. fastidiosa_ is transmitted through propagation of infected
plants but this has not been demonstrated in _Vaccinium_. The role of
insect vectors also needs to be studied further. It is supposed that
_Homalodisca vitripennis_ which is abundant in the south of Georgia and
known to be a vector of peach phony and grapevine Pierce's disease, plays
an important role in disease spread. Further research will be carried out
to better understand the epidemiology of _X. fastidiosa_ in _Vaccinium_
crops and to develop control strategies.

[_X. fastidiosa_ is a Gram negative, xylem-limited fastidious plant
bacterium related to _Xanthomonas_ spp., which was described in 1987. The
pathogen clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and
death. It has been reported from a number of crop hosts causing very
serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of
almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of
citrus, leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander,
and other woody ornamentals, and lucerne dwarf. Latent infections of a
number of wild species have also been reported, and these can serve as
pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified
into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have
not been characterised and compared with each other yet. At least 3
subspecies, subsp. _piercei_, _multiplex_, and _pauca_, have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several
species of sharpshooters (_Carneocephala fulgida_, _Draeculacephala
minerva_, _Graphocephala atropunctata_, _Homalodisca coagulata_). It can
also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not
seedborne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore _X. f._
associated diseases. The pathogen has been reported mainly from the
Americas, but is also suspected in a few locations in Asia. Its occurrence
in Oceania is currently unknown. Both the bacterium and its main vectors
are of serious quarantine concern in Europe, Africa, and Australasia.
Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential
reservoir hosts and vector insects and includes use of clean planting and
grafting material, as well as vector control.

ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), DAS (double antibody
sandwich)-ELISA and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) are molecular methods
used widely today for specific and sensitive diagnosis and characterisation
of microorganisms. Koch's postulates were established by the early
microbiologist Robert Koch and require as proof of a microbial cause of a
disease that the putative microorganism can be isolated from symptomatic
host tissue, cultured in vitro and, when used to inoculate a healthy host,
will reproduce the same symptoms as in the original source host.
Modifications of these postulates have since been agreed on for types of
pathogens (for example phytoplasmas, viroids, prions, viruses) that cannot
be either purified or cultured in vitro or mechanically inoculated.
