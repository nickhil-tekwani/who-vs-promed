Health department officials sent a letter to parents at Spiller Elementary school letting them know that several children have a possible diagnosis of chickenpox. A health department spokesperson says the small number of cases does not constitute an outbreak.

Chickenpox can spread easily through the air and through chickenpox blisters.

The health department is encouraging parents to get their kids the chickenpox vaccine and if they notice symptoms of the virus, to use caution and keep their child away from school.

[Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the cause of chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster), and was once responsible for over 4 million infections in the United States annually. The development of a live attenuated VZV vaccine was initially viewed with extreme skepticism. Nonetheless, a VZV vaccine was developed in the 1970s by Takahashi and his colleagues in Japan and was eventually licensed in the US. It is now known to be one of the safest and most effective vaccines available and is administered worldwide. One aspect to its success in the United States is that the immunization rate in healthy children is now over 90 percent, which has likely led to a high degree of herd immunity. (excerpted from Shaw J, Gershon AA. Varicella Virus Vaccination in the United States. Viral Immunol. 2017 Nov 27. doi: 10.1089/vim.2017.0136. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173081

It is not stated whether these students had been vaccinated. Two doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox.
