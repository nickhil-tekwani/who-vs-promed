[The disease has spread regionally (see ProMED-mail archive list below), now entering Greece. These outbreaks of clinical lumpy skin disease (LSD) were located in Evros (Eastern Macedonia and Thrace administrative region), situated near the border with Turkey. Based on the available reports in the OIE database, in 2014 Turkey reported 799 outbreaks of the disease (see 2014 annual report at http://tinyurl.com/o3or23u) and from January to June 2015, 139 outbreaks were reported (see the 1st 6-monthly report for 2015 at http://tinyurl.com/o2wkgyz).

With the confirmation of LSD in Greece, Bulgaria activated its early warning system to try to prevent the disease from being introduced into its territory (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150821.3594571).

Evros is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. It borders Turkey to the east, across the river Evros, and it borders Bulgaria to the north and the northwest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evros_(regional_unit)).
