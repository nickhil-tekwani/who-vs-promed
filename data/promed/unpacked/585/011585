The National Ministry of Health confirms the 4th case of monkeypox in the country based on the positive result of the PCR test carried out by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INEI) of the National Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes (ANLIS). This case is a 45 year old man who lives in Godoy Cruz, Mendoza province, and who had traveled to Spain in the last 21 days.

The person began to present a fever greater than 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], swollen lymph nodes and vesicular rashes on [15 Jun 2022], the suspected case was reported on the [19 Jun 2022] and the samples were sent to the national reference laboratory with a positive PCR result on [21 Jun 2022] for monkeypox. At the moment, his state of health is good and he is complying with the corresponding isolation.

The 1st case of monkeypox in the country was confirmed on [27 May 2022] in a 40 year old man living in the province of Buenos Aires with a history of travel to Spain. That same day, the 2nd case of this disease was also confirmed in a 49 year old man, a resident of Spain, visiting the province of Buenos Aires and with no connection to the 1st case. The 3rd was confirmed on [9 Jun 2022] in a 36 year old citizen residing in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and with no travel history. To date, no secondary cases have been registered from the 4 confirmed cases.

South Africa's health minister Joe Phaahla said on Thursday [23 Jun 2022] that he had been notified by the country's laboratory services that they had confirmed the 1st monkeypox case in South Africa. The patient was a 30 year old male from Johannesburg who had no travel history, "meaning that this cannot be attributed to having been acquired outside South Africa," Phaahla told a news conference. A process of contact tracing was under way, he added.

Monkeypox is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. It is endemic in parts of Africa, but not South Africa.

Kwara State government on Thursday [23 Jun 2022] confirmed the 1st case of monkeypox in the state. The state commissioner for health, Dr Raji Razak, who confirmed the presence of monkey disease in a statement he personally signed, said a 29 year old driver resident in Gbugbu in Edu Local Government Area of the state was discovered to have contracted the disease. The commissioner said the driver had been placed on admission at a government hospital while members of his household were on surveillance.

"Kwara State Ministry of Health wishes to confirm the 1st case of monkeypox in the state. This follows rigorous efforts of the surveillance and response team that had been activated since the index case was reported in the country in March 2022. The 1st confirmed case in Kwara State involves a 29 year old Nigerian driver who developed symptoms of fever, generalised rash, and weakness in the last 2 weeks and had been under our surveillance. There were contacts with the wife and 4 neighbours with similar symptoms where he lives at Gbugbu in Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State. All of which have been resolved by the health team.

"The patient has been on admission in the last 1 week because of suspicion of monkeypox. He has also been under strict monitoring by the surveillance and clinical team. Currently, the patient is improving and stable in the ward.

"The government's team has similarly begun health facility and community case search/contact tracing. The team will also intensify continuous public and community sensitization on the disease and its symptoms for public education and control," the commissioner said.

Razak also said there was an ongoing training and retraining of health workers to strengthen the response of the state government to the development, adding "the Ministry of Health is also notifying the appropriate agencies, especially the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, of the development. Members of the public are implored to step up efforts at personal and community hygiene as we work together to fight this disease."

[A monkeypox (MPX] case in Nigeria is not surprising. Nigeria is endemic for MPX virus and cases have occurred there sporadically. The above report states that the wife and 4 neighbors had similar symptoms but that "all of which have been resolved by the health team" and presumably discarded as MPX cases. This report does underscore the reality that MPX cases occur in several African countries but are often disregarded as of lesser importance than those occurring currently in the industrialized world. Control of MPX requires that it be addressed globally and endemic African countries cannot be ignored. - Mod.TY]

A man who recently returned from Germany has been diagnosed with monkeypox, in the 1st confirmed case of the viral disease in Taiwan, the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Friday [24 Jun 2022].

On [20 Jun 2022], 4 days after the man returned to Taiwan, he developed symptoms that included a fever, sore throat, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes in the groin, and a skin rash, the CDC said in a statement. Over the next 2 days, he sought medical attention, and his case was reported to the CDC as a possible monkeypox infection. On Friday [24 Jun 2022], his test came back positive for the disease, marking the 1st confirmed case of monkeypox in Taiwan, the CDC said.

The man, who had been studying in Germany, is now quarantined in hospital, and health authorities are conducting contact tracing, the CDC said. So far, 19 people have been listed as close contacts, including 10 medical workers and 2 of the patient's relatives, and their health is being monitored, CDC deputy director-general Chuang Jen-hsaing (莊人祥) told reporters on Friday afternoon [24 Jun 2022].

The CDC will notify the World Health Organization (WHO) of Taiwan's 1st recorded case of monkeypox, Chuang said. On Thursday [23 Jun 2022], the CDC officially designated monkeypox as a category 2 communicable disease, citing the global spread of the viral disease. The designation means that physicians are now required to report confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox to the CDC within 24 hours. Other category 2 communicable diseases in Taiwan include dengue fever, Zika fever, typhoid fever, measles, and Chikungunya.

The CDC also said on Thursday [23 Jun 2022] that it had ruled out a suspected monkeypox case involving a man in his 60s, which was reported last week.

The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, which can spread through close contact with an infected animal or person, and transmission occurs through direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs, body fluids, or materials contaminated with the virus.

Since the 1st reports of monkeypox infections in the United Kingdom in mid-May [2022], at least 3598 cases have been confirmed in 50 countries around the world, mostly in Europe and the Americas, according to the CDC. Taiwan has become the 3rd Asian country in which the disease has been confirmed, following Singapore and South Korea, the CDC said.

[7] Emergency consideration
Date: Thu 23 Jun 2022

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-23/african-scientists-criticise-who-over-monkeypox-declaration/101179034


The World Health Organization (WHO) will soon decide whether to declare monkeypox a global health emergency, stirring criticism from leading African scientists who say it has been a crisis in their region for years. The deliberations and scrutiny of the WHO's response to the outbreak follow concerns over how the UN agency and governments worldwide handled COVID-19 in early 2020.

Monkeypox does not spread nearly as easily as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and there are vaccines and treatments available unlike for the coronavirus when it emerged. But it has still raised alarm. The case count from the current outbreak outside of Africa has topped 3000 in more than 40 countries, according to a Reuters tally -- largely among men who have sex with men -- since it was 1st reported in May [2022].

The viral disease, which causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions, is endemic in parts of Africa. The continent has registered just over 1500 suspected cases since the start of 2022, of which 66 have been fatal, according to official data.

"When a disease affects developing countries, it is not an emergency. It only becomes an emergency when developed countries are affected," said Emmanuel Nakoune, acting director of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, the Central African Republic, who is running a trial of a monkeypox treatment. However, Professor Nakoune said if the WHO declared a "public health emergency of international concern" -- its highest level of alarm -- it would still be an important step. "If there is the political will to share equitably the means of response between developed and developing countries ... each country will be able to benefit," he said.

WHO has said it is working on a mechanism for sharing treatments and vaccines.

The emergency committee meeting considering the ruling includes experts from the most-affected regions, who have also consulted with scientists including Professor Nakoune. They will make a recommendation to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who makes the ultimate decision over whether to call the emergency. The step mainly functions to sound the alarm, and can prompt further guidance from the organisation, as well as focus attention among member states.

Most experts agree monkeypox technically meets the criteria for the WHO definition of an emergency. It is a sudden and unusual event spreading internationally, and requires cross-country co-operation.

But the WHO is in a precarious position after COVID-19, according to Clare Wenham, a global health assistant professor at the London School of Economics. If WHO declared an emergency and countries did not act, it could undermine the agency's role in controlling global disease, she said. "They're damned if they do and damned if they don't," she said.

[Because the monkeypox (MPX) cases that occur in several African countries are individual cases or small clusters that occur sporadically, they have garnered little international attention except when infected individuals travel from Africa to industrial countries and become ill there. If the WHO decision is made to deal with MPX in Africa, the challenge will be deciding what preventive measures to use. If vaccination is the main preventive method selected, deciding where, when and who to vaccinate will not be an easy one financially, logistically and socially. - Mod.TY]

[8] Local transmission

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there was evidence of local transmission of monkeypox, in addition to reports of cases where people had traveled abroad. The cases are mainly occurring in men who have sex with men, but women are also getting infected, CDC staff member Dr Agam Rao said at a panel meeting on Thursday [23 Jun 2022].

Monkeypox, a viral infection that causes skin lesions, is endemic in certain parts of Africa. But the current outbreak has hit countries where the virus does not usually spread, sparking concern.

CDC said there had also been reports of transmission among family members and close contacts. "We also heard worldwide about close contacts like close household members who for example shared bedding, towels, have acquired infection," Rao said. "So it is not just through close intimate contact that this is being spread."

The lesions associated with the present outbreak are also smaller than those typical of classic monkeypox, according to the public health agency.

CDC last month [May 2022] published guidelines recommending the use of Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Jynneos vaccine for laboratory personnel and other at-risk people, making another vaccine available in addition to Emergent BioSolutions' (EBS.N) ACAM2000.

Earlier on Thursday [23 Jun 2022], New York City opened a temporary clinic to administer the 2-dose Jynneos vaccine to eligible people who may have been exposed to monkeypox, including gay and bisexual men. While there have been cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis associated with ACAM2000, no such cases have been reported yet after the use of Jynneos, CDC said. There is a limited supply of Jynneos and the agency is considering how to best use the supplies, it said.
