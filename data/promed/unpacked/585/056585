Suspected case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Boende
---------------------------------------------------
A case of haemorrhagic fever has been reported in the Boende health
zone of Tshuapa District. The chief medical officer in the area, Dr.
Cesar Moyeli, believes that symptoms exhibited by a woman admitted to
a general hospital in the zone are consistent with those of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever.

Dr. Moyeli stated that: "After 2 days, the patient began to
experience haemorrhage: 1st from the genitalia, then from her eyes,
gums and even her ears. In addition red patches appeared on her skin.
Taken together these features suggested a diagnosis of haemorrhagic
fever. In order to avoid disseminating the infection, we informed the
family that, due to the danger of the illness, the body could not be
released to the family for normal burial. Instead the body was
disinfected and taken directly to the cemetery for burial. All
materials used in the care of the patient have been burnt and the
treatment room remains closed."

The patient died last Thursday [29 May 2008]. Clinical samples have
been taken and dispatched to to Kinshasa [the capital of Congo DR]
for virus identification. Meanwhile the family of the deceased and
all her known contacts will be kept under observation for a period of 3 weeks.
