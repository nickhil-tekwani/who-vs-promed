A person in England has been diagnosed with monkeypox, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.

The patient had recently travelled from Nigeria, which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to the UK, the UKHSA said.

The person is receiving care at the expert infectious disease unit at the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London.

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection which kills up to 1 in 10 of those infected but does not spread easily among people.

It is the 7th ever case of monkeypox in the UK and is the only case recorded since 2 patients were identified in North Wales in 2021.

The disease was first detected in the UK in 2018 after another traveller brought the virus back from Nigeria and it spread to 2 other people, including one NHS nurse who caught it from bed linen.

It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks but severe illness can occur in some individuals.

The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.

A Government spokesperson said that, as a precautionary measure, UKHSA experts are working closely with NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice.

Dr Colin Brown, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA, said: 'It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.

'We are working with NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSEI) to contact the individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice.

'UKHSA and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.'

Dr Nicholas Price, Director NHSE High Consequence Infection Diseases (airborne) Network and Consultant in Infectious Diseases at Guy's and St Thomas', said: 'The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas' Hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.

'This is a good example of the way that the High Consequence Infectious Diseases national network and UKHSA work closely together in responding swiftly and effectively to these sporadic cases.'

Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.

A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.

The 1st case of monkeypox in a human being was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has since been detected in a number of central and western African countries. Most cases are reported in the DRC and Nigeria.

In 2003, the disease was detected in the US when an outbreak occurred following the importation of rodents from [west] Africa.

The 1st cases were detected in the UK in 2018, when 3 people contracted the virus after a man travelled back from Nigeria including an NHS nurse who had been caring for a patient and blamed her PPE [personal protective equipment].

The incident meant more than 50 people were warned they had been exposed to the potentially deadly virus, however no other cases were recorded from that outbreak.

A further case was detected in London in December 2019 and another 2 cases were detected in North Wales in 2021. All cases were thought to have been caught by travellers who had been to Nigeria.

What is the Monkeypox virus and what are the risks and symptoms?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox -- often caught through handling monkeys -- is a rare viral disease that kills around 10% of people it strikes, according to figures. [It is more likely that the virus is acquired by handling infected rodents such as pouched rats and rope squirrels. - Mod.TY]

The virus responsible for the disease is found mainly in the tropical areas of west and central Africa.

Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958, with the 1st reported human case in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970. Human cases were recorded for the 1st time in the US in 2003 and the UK in September 2018.

It resides in wild animals but humans can catch it through direct contact with animals, such as handling monkeys, or eating inadequately cooked meat.

The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, or the eyes, nose or mouth.

It can pass between humans via droplets in the air, and by touching the skin of an infected individual, or touching objects contaminated by them.

Symptoms usually appear within 5 and 21 days of infection. These include a fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and fatigue.

The most obvious symptom is a rash, which usually appears on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. This then forms skin lesions that scab and fall off.

Monkeypox is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a few weeks without treatment. Yet, the disease can often prove fatal.

There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox infection, according to the World Health Organization.

[Cases of monkeypox have sporadically been imported from Nigeria such as the case reported above. We are not given the dates when the infected individual entered the UK or when the person was hospitalized. Monkeypox (MPX) cases have been reported in Nigeria since 2017, and transmission of the virus continues. The above case acquired the monkeypox virus infection there.

An 11 Jun 2021 report of monkeypox cases in Nigeria provides more detail, stating, "Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox. From September 2017 to May 2021, a total of 446 suspected monkeypox cases have been reported from 30 states. Of the reported cases, 199 (44.6%) have been confirmed in 18 states: Abia (3), Akwa Ibom (7), Anambra (2), Bayelsa (39), Benue (2), Cross River (13), Delta (22), Ebonyi (1), Edo (7), Ekiti (2), Enugu (4), FCT (5), Imo (8), Lagos (25), Nasarawa (2), Oyo (6), Plateau (3) and Rivers (48). A total of 8 deaths have also been recorded (CFR = 4.02%) in 6 states: Cross River (1), Edo (2), FCT (1), Imo (1), Lagos (2) and Rivers (1). In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported between January and May. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from 5 states: Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1), and no deaths were recorded (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/monkeypox-in-nigeria-and-drc-updates-84788/).

The question remains about the source of these recent infections and the case above. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrences of MPX cases can be expected.

A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently. Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced on 11 Jun 2021 that the company was recently engaged by Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to supply its IMVANEX smallpox vaccine in response to new cases of monkeypox in the UK. Even if a vaccine was available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge.
