The National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (SERNAPESCA) confirmed the presence of the variant HPR 7B of the ISA [Infectious salmon anemia] virus in a farming centre in the Region of Aisén.

The virus was found in a cage of Aldunate centre belonging to the company Cermaq Chile SA, located in ACS 33, in the Region of Aisén, within the framework of the ISA Surveillance and Control Program.

The case was detected last week [5 - 11 Dec 2016] by officials of the Service, who obtained verification samples, which were positive to the virus, being notified as a confirmed indeterminate virus. The samples were sequenced on Fri 9 Dec [2016], and the HPR 7B variant of the ISA virus was identified.

According to SERNAPESCA Aquaculture Deputy Director, Alicia Gallardo, an exhaustive follow-up is being carried out to the Aldunate farming centre to evaluate its evolution and the performance of a sanitary survey has been carried out in the ACS farming centres involved.

Likewise, it has been necessary to harvest the cage involved in the shortest time, which will start once the strict compliance with the biosecurity measures is verified, so as to safeguard the sanitary condition of the centres of the area. This procedure will be carried out under the supervision of the Service.

[ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmons (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.

An outbreak of ISA was reported earlier this year (April 2016) in the same region. - Mod.PMB
