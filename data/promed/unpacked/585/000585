Estrogen treatment linked to reduced COVID-19 mortality
-------------------------------------------------------
Women who received prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen within 6 months of a COVID-19 diagnosis had reduced mortality, according to a new study in Family Practice.

The findings, coupled with data on sex differences between male and female COVID-19 severity, suggests estrogen may have a protective role against the virus. [Hajira Dambha-Miller, William Hinton, Christopher R Wilcox, et al. Mortality in COVID-19 among women on hormone replacement therapy: a retrospective cohort study, Family Practice, 2022;, cmac041, https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmac041]

The study was based on medical records gathered from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care database. Researchers looked at women ages 18 and older who received prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy or combined oral contraceptive pill, which contains estrogen.

A total of 1 863 478 women from 465 general practices in England were included in the study. The main outcome was mortality among those with confirmed COVID-19 during the 1st 6 months of the pandemic in 2020.

Researchers found 5451 COVID-19 cases within the cohort. White women made up 64.5% of the case-patients, and the mean age was 59. There were 235 women with HRT prescriptions, and 171 with a prescription for oral contraceptives. Among women with oral contraceptive prescriptions, there was no reported events for all-cause mortality.

Among women with HRT prescriptions, there was a 78% reduction in all-cause mortality in COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.94).

The all-cause mortality risk in COVID-19 was higher among women who were older, underweight, from larger households, with hypertension, or on immunosuppressant therapies, the authors said.

The authors of the study said the findings were strong evidence for women prescribed HRT to stay on their medication after COVID-19 diagnosis. They also said the findings suggest estrogen products require further investigation as a treatment for the novel coronavirus. Notably, the study was conducted in the pre-vaccination era of the pandemic, and the authors said further research should continue to look at estrogen levels and COVID-19 severity. "This study supports the theory that estrogen may offer some protection against severe COVID-19," Christopher Wilcox, PhD, one of the paper's authors, said in a press release. "We hope that this study can provide reassurance to patients and clinicians that there is no indication to stop hormone replacement therapy because of the pandemic."

[From a press release at https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/952438, "...Men and women are equally susceptible to the infection. Men tend to have more severe infections, however, and have higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. A recent review of sex differences in COVID-19, using data from 38 countries, found mortality in men was 1.7 times higher than in women. Younger women or those with higher estrogen levels are less likely to experience COVID-19 complications.

...The reason for these sex differences is uncertain. Limited recent observational data suggest that estrogen may reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease.

...[The results] suggest that estrogen may well contribute a protective effect against COVID-19 severity. This may explain why fewer women compared to men have been hospitalized, admitted to intensive care, or died due to COVID-19 during the pandemic...." - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccine booster

CDC to consider FDA booster recommendation
------------------------------------------
In amending its earlier emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the FDA today [17 May 2022] authorized the use of a single booster in children ages 5 through 11 at least 5 months after completing the primary 2-dose series.

In a statement, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, MD, said though COVID-19 is typically less severe in children than adults, the omicron surge came with higher numbers of illnesses, hospitalizations, and long-term effects from the disease in youngsters. He added that vaccination is still a strong hedge against severe consequences, and he urged parents to ensure that kids get their primary series. [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-expands-eligibility-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-booster-dose]

Before the booster doses roll out in the 5 to 11 year age group, vaccine advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) need to make a formal recommendation. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is slated to meet on 19 May, presumably to consider the booster dose recommendation.

Last week, 93 000 more COVID-19 cases in children were reported, up 76% compared to 2 weeks ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said in its latest update. It added that cases in children have been on the rise for 5 weeks in a row. [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/]

WHO: 2nd boosters show benefits for risk groups
-----------------------------------------------
In an interim statement today [17 May 2022], the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization said a review of data from 7 studies suggests short-term benefits of an extra booster dose in some high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, those older than 60, and those with weakened immune systems. [https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2022-interim-statement-on-the-use-of-additional-booster-doses-of-emergency-use-listed-mrna-vaccines-against-covid-19]

The experts emphasized that the data are only available for mRNA vaccines and that there isn't much data on duration of protection and benefits for younger age-groups. SAGE members urged countries that are considering 2nd booster doses to balance financial considerations with the expected incremental benefits.

At media briefing today [17 May 2022], WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that, over the past week, COVID-19 cases have risen in 4 of the WHO regions. [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-covid-19-media-briefing--17-may-2022]

Cases have been rising in the Africa and the Americas over the past few weeks, but the WHO dashboard now reflects small rises in the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions. [https://covid19.who.int/]

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries -- USA (115 840), Germany (82 591), Taiwan (65 802), Spain (52 112), Australia (55 472), Italy (44 901), the UK (43 994), France (43 727), Argentina (33 989), South Korea (31 315), Japan (26 334), Brazil (10 726), and Switzerland (10 723) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2171 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 15 May 2022 to late 16 May 2022).

A total of 32 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 18 of the 32 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 0 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 24.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 18.6%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 26.3% increase in daily reported cases and a 35.4% increase in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.88 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 524.09 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.29 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
