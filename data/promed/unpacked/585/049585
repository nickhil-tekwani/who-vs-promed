Opening statement by Dr Vahid Majidi
[This is an institutional statement and should be read in full by those
interested. But in it, Majidi made the following remark]:
"First of all, let me dispel some frequently repeated erroneous
information. For example:
- There were no intentional additives combined with the _Bacillus
anthracis_ spores to make them any more dispersible.
- The purity of samples obtained from the 4 letters (Hart and Russell
Senate office, and NBC and New York post offices in New York) were
sufficiently different, which allowed us to conclude that at least 2
different _Bacillus anthracis_ batches were prepared from the original
RMR-1029. This indicates that aliquots of the RMR-1029 were removed and
cultured in at least 2 separate batches to produce the materials used in
the mailings."

They have worked for almost 7 years in secret. Most people did not know
that the work in Ray Goehner's materials characterization department at
Sandia National Laboratories was contributing important information to the
FBI's investigation of letters containing _Bacillus anthracis_, the spores
that cause the disease anthrax. The spores were mailed in the fall of 2001
to several news media offices and to 2 US senators. Five people were killed.

Sandia's work demonstrated to the FBI that the form of _Bacillus anthracis_
contained in those letters was not a weaponized form, a form of the
bacteria prepared to disperse more readily. The possibility of a weaponized
form was of great concern to investigators, says Joseph Michael, the
principal investigator for the project. This information was crucial in
ruling out state-sponsored terrorism.

In fall of 2001, the FBI considered how to best investigate the anthrax
letters. The agency convened 2 blue ribbon exploratory panels, and Sandia's
name came up during both panels for its expertise in electron and ion
microscopies and microanalysis over the range of length scales from
millimeters down to nanometers. The 1st spore material from the letters
arrived at Sandia in February of 2002.

Joseph Michael, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) lab owner Paul
Kotula, and a team of roughly a dozen others examined more than 200 samples
in those 6 and a half years. They received samples from the letter
delivered to the New York Post, to former senator Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), and
to senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). The samples looked different, in part
because of how the samples were prepared, which made examination initially
difficult.

"Initially, scanning electron microscopy [SEM] conducted at another
laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude
that the spores were a weaponized form, says Kotula. "The possible
misinterpretation of the SEM results arose because microanalysis in the SEM
is not a surface-sensitive tool," says Kotula. "Because a spore body can be
1.5 to 2 microns wide by one micron long, a SEM cannot localize the
elemental signal from whole spore bodies."

Using more sensitive transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Kotula and
Michael's research indicated that the silica in the spore samples was not
added artificially but was incorporated as a natural part of the spore
formation process. "The spores we examined," Kotula says, "lacked that
fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that they'd been weaponized."

Sandia's work was the 1st to actually link the spore material in the New
York Post, the Daschle and the Leahy letters. The elemental signatures and
the locations of these signatures, while not indicating intentional
weaponization, did show that the spores were indistinguishable and,
therefore, likely came from the same source. That conclusion was
corroborated a few years later by the DNA studies.

Michael was recently released from his nondisclosure agreement and flown to
Washington DC to participate in press conferences at FBI Headquarters along
with several members of research teams who'd been asked to examine other
aspects of the anthrax case. The FBI was pleased with Sandia's work, says
Michael.

[A useful background paper on Ames genomics]:
Matthew van Ert, et al Strain-Specific Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism
Assays for the _Bacillus anthracis_ Ames Strain. J Clin Microbiol 2007;
45(1): 47-53. Epub 2006 Nov 8.

"ABSTRACT: Highly precise diagnostics and forensic assays can be developed
through a combination of evolutionary analysis and the exhaustive
examination of genomic sequences. In _Bacillus anthracis_, whole-genome
sequencing efforts revealed ca. 3500 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
among 8 different strains, and evolutionary analysis provides the
identification of canonical SNPs. We have previously shown that SNPs are
highly evolutionarily stable, and the clonal nature of _B. anthracis_ makes
them ideal signatures for subtyping this pathogen. Here, we identified SNPs
that define the lineage of _B. anthracis_ that contains the Ames strain,
the strain used in the 2001 bioterrorist attacks in the United States.
Sequencing and real-time PCR were used to validate these SNPs across _B.
anthracis_ strains, including (i) 88 globally and genetically diverse
isolates; (ii) isolates that were shown to be genetic relatives of the Ames
strain by multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA); and
(iii) several different lab stocks of the Ames strain, including a clinical
isolate from the 2001 letter attack. Six SNPs were found to be highly
specific for the Ames strain; 4 on the chromosome, one on the pX01 plasmid,
and one on the pX02 plasmid. All 6 SNPs differentiated the _B. anthracis_
Ames strain from the 88 unique _B. anthracis_ strains, while 5 of the 6
separated Ames from its close genetic relatives. The use of these SNPs
coupled with real-time PCR allows specific and sensitive (<100 fg of
template DNA) identification of the Ames strain. This evolutionary and
genomics-based approach provides an effective means for the discovery of
strain-specific SNPs in _B. anthracis_."

[We are still left with the unanswered questions as to the chemical source
of the silica within the spores, how it was incorporated into the spore
contents, and what might be the reason for including it if it was not
accidental. Silica is not usually quoted as being in any bacillus culture
medium. All the benefits of silica quoted to date came from it being on the
outside of the spore and affecting the surface charge. The letter product
had no such silica particles.

To get particles to "fly" you need to stop them clumping into lumps which
drop within a few metres of release and you have neutralize the negative
charge on their surfaces. Normally this is done by various additives to the
spore mix, specifically nano particles of silica ... this looks like 'lint'
on the spores when viewed in an electron microscope. But the letter
products had no additives. The spores were naked. The excess silica was
incorporated into the structure of the spore somehow, probably during the
culture phase. - Mod.MHJ]
