Japan's Kagawa prefecture will cull 850 000 chickens at 2 poultry farms after the country detected a bird flu outbreak earlier this month [November 2020], the local government said in a statement on Friday [20 Nov 2020].

These will be the 6th and 7th [outbreaks] of the avian flu in western Kagawa prefecture and the biggest cull to be done at one time since the country's 1st bird flu outbreak [in poultry] was detected more than 2 years [ago], an official at the prefecture said.

Chickens at the 2 farms in Mitoyo city tested positive in a preliminary examination for avian influenza on Thursday [19 Nov 2020] after the farms had notified the prefectural government of an increase in the number of dead chickens. The local government said it has confirmed the infection was a highly pathogenic strain of H5 bird flu from genetic tests on Friday [20 Nov 2020].

The prefecture has already culled about 460 000 chickens for the past 4 [outbreaks], the official said.

Japan's last [sic] outbreak of bird flu occurred in January 2018, when 91 000 chickens at a farm in Sanuki city, also in Kagawa prefecture, were culled due to the H5N6 strain of bird flu, according to the agriculture ministry.

[Since submitting to the OIE on 6 Nov 2020 its immediate notification on the H5 avian influenza event that reportedly had started in the Kagawa prefecture on 4 Nov 2020 (20201109.7928569), Japan has submitted 3 follow-up reports, the most recent one on 18 Nov 2020. The causative agent was reported to be HPAI H5N8. Links to all said reports, addressing the 1st 5 outbreaks, and an interactive map presenting their locations as of 18 Nov 2020, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=36435.

The event's summary as of 18 Nov 2020 is as follows:
Total outbreaks = 5 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 478 000 / 2068 / 2068 / 475 932 / 0

Most likely, the 2 additional outbreaks addressed in the above media report are caused by the same HPAI H5N8 virus strain. The virus is suspected to have been introduced into Japan from the continent by migrating birds. - Mod.AS
