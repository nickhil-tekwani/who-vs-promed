Blue ear disease hits WC pigs
------------------------------
The movement of swine will be controlled in certain areas of the Western
Cape after a large commercial piggery in Klapmuts tested positive for blue
ear disease, said Agriculture MEC Cobus Dowry on Friday [1 Apr 2005].
Dowry said: "A movement control system would be implemented immediately in
the municipal areas of Drakenstein, Joostenburg, Philippi, Emfuleni and
Malmesbury. "This means all movements of pigs into and from these areas
requires a "red" cross permit issued by the state vet Boland or the SV
Malmesbury Offices."
Dowry said that the findings followed intensive investigation and
surveillance to try and determine the extent of the disease, diagnosed for
the first time in South Africa in April 2004, on the Cape Flats.
New cases were recently reported in the Wellington area after the
successful eradication of all diseased pigs in the 1st outbreak. Doctor
Gideon Bruckner, Western Cape director of veterinary services, said a
"science-based risk assessment" needed to be conducted to give guidance on
the future control of the disease.
He said an intensive eradication campaign would therefore not be initiated
now, but farmers in affected areas were being encouraged to have their pigs
slaughtered as soon as they reached a marketable age and weight.
"As an interim measure and complimentary to the permit system and
quarantine of positive farms, Pork Respiratory and Reproduction Syndrome
[PRRS] vaccine to vaccinate positive herds only will be imported and
administered under official control."
Bruckner said the main purpose of the vaccination of positive herds was to
reduce the risk of the spread of the disease to negative herds and to
protect all small- and large-scale farmers who were dependent on pig
farming as a source of income.
Dowry added that a temporary ban was already in place on the sale of live
pigs at auctions within the Boland and adjoining areas to limit the spread
of the disease. He confirmed that there was no danger of the disease
affecting humans, and urged pig farmers to ensure they only purchased swine
from farms with a proven clean health history.
Farmers were to embark on good hygiene management practices on their farms
to minimise the risk of disease introduction or spread of the disease. The
highly infectious disease attacked the respiratory and reproductive
systems, causing pregnant pigs to abort foetuses and coughing in younger pigs.
