The highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in an American white pelican and other birds across at least 4 counties. The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) confirmed a case in Clay County using the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa. The University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab confirmed positive birds in Pettis, Randolph and St. Charles counties.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly referred to as bird flu, was first confirmed 3 Mar 2022 in a poultry flock in Stoddard County and a backyard flock in Bates County 4 Mar 2022, according to MDC.

"Avian influenza viruses naturally occur in bird populations, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys," said Sherri Russell, MDC State Wildlife Veterinarian, via a news release. "We have been monitoring this strain since early January [2022], when it was detected in the eastern United States and Canada."

The virus spreads as birds along the North American flyways intermingle with infected birds from other parts of the world, according to MDC. Viruses are transmitted through fecal droppings, saliva and nasal droppings among birds.

"There is a risk for spillover from wild birds into domestic poultry and then back again from poultry to wild birds, resulting in further spread," MDC stated. MDC is working with the Missouri Department of Agriculture and other state and federal agencies to monitor the spread of the virus.

"Fortunately, avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern, although on rare occasions it has infected humans and other animals," Russell stated. "We recommend you avoid handling sick or dead birds, and to report sick or dead wild birds, especially waterfowl to MDC."

Look for signs of tremors, head tilting, lethargy, loss of coordination, inability to fly or walk properly, or standing upright. Wildlife Health staff are interested in reports of single waterfowl, raptor or avian scavengers. They are also interested in waterfowl or other waterbird deaths involving more than 5 birds where the cause of death is unknown.

Folks can report sick or dead birds by emailing <WildlifeHealth@mdc.mo.gov> or calling their local MDC office.

When it comes to hunting, MDC urges people to take "common sense precautions" when handling harvested birds in the field or at home. "They should be aware that it is possible to transport avian influenza viruses on boats, waders, or other equipment, especially if it isn't dry before moving it from one site to another," MDC stated. "Allowing hunting equipment to dry between outings will reduce this chance." Russell said poultry and wild game birds are safe to eat after being cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.

The 1st documented wild bird mortalities due to a highly infectious avian flu were confirmed by North Carolina natural resource agencies Wednesday [16 Mar 2022].

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has killed at least 4 wild birds in North Carolina. According to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, a redhead duck in Carteret County was among these birds and was observed with neurological signs consistent with bird flu before it was euthanized. The other birds were found in Dare, Hyde, and Wake counties.

In January [2022], the commission confirmed a positive test in a wild duck for bird flu in Hyde County, along with a 2nd positive test in South Carolina. According to a news release, these were the 1st wild birds in the United States to have that strain of bird flu since 2016.

This type of virus is considered low risk to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but can be dangerous to other birds including domestic poultry. The public is encouraged to report unusual wild bird behavior.

Wildlife experts in Florida have confirmed that avian influenza is present in Martin County. Savannah Steckler, a wildlife rehabilitator at the Treasure Coast Wildlife Center in Palm City, said a dead duck that was dropped off at the facility earlier this month [March 2022] had the virus. "We actually did have, I think, 2 or 3 positive cases coming back from ducks around the Martin County area," Steckler said.

Experts said this is an extremely infectious avian flu strain and can be deadly. "We do get it a little bit every year," Steckler said. "But not as bad as we're seeing it right now." Steckler said they have set up a quarantine area at the wildlife center where all new arrivals will be placed and tested before being moved to the general population.

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife, there is a low risk the avian flu can spread to humans. To prevent the spread of avian flu, the public should avoid handling sick or dead wildlife.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the findings of infected wild birds first in Nebraska and then in Missouri show that the virus is already moving westwards.

It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB
