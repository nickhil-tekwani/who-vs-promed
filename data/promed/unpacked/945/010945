The Venezuelan Government has already activated the health protocols
to ensure the prevention and comprehensive care of the horse herd in
different parts of the country and no cases of equine encephalitis
have been confirmed.

The assertion was made by the Venezuelan Minister of Agriculture and
Lands, Juan Carlos Loyo, during the inspection conducted on Sunday
[11 Jul 2010] at the Jose Felix Ribas Social Property Unit in the
municipality of Papelon, Portuguesa state.

Loyo reported that hundreds of technicians from the National
Institute of Integral Health (INSAI) are in the fields, evaluating
the health of horses, donkeys, and mules, taking samples, reviewing
symptoms and preparing vaccination plans necessary to avoid the
appearance of the virus.

The field samples are sent to the laboratories of the National
Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA) and in light of the
results are evaluated immunization plans. "In Venezuela there are
serious animal health care policies and our producers know it," he stressed.

"The last outbreak of equine encephalitis in Venezuela was registered
in 1995 and that was not a coincidence because the agricultural
health unit had been completely destroyed by the privatization," he recalled.

Loyo dismissed the existence of an epidemic in the national herd and
noted that the comprehensive health protocol is fully active, with
greater emphasis on the states of Bolivar, Guarico, Barinas, Cojedes,
Portuguesa, and Aragua.

[How very odd that media sources carried information reporting the
outbreak, with information from the appropriate seemingly government
source. Now it is being denied, from seemingly, government sources.
One has to wonder, if the reported cases are being covered up, or if
it was some sort of preparedness exercise. - Mod.TG]
