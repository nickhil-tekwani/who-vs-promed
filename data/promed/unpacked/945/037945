At least 10 children have died in various hospitals in Equatorial Guinea as
a result of a measles epidemic declared in the country 2 weeks ago,
according to EFE [News Agency] sources confirmed today [10 Nov 2008] by the
Health Ministry.

Although an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare declined to give
details, medical sources contacted by EFE said the epidemic is affecting
hundreds of children up to 9 years [of age] in several districts of the
mainland and in Malabo, capital of the country.

Reports of the NGO 'Family Care' claim that one in 6 children born in this
sub-Saharan country, which was a Spanish colony until 1968, dies before
reaching 2 years, because health [services] in rural communities are
limited to small first-aid clinics with minimal material.

The last known outbreak of measles in the country occurred in April 2001,
when more than 100 children lost their lives because in Equatorial Guinea
basic concepts of hygiene and disease prevention are still poorly
understood or misinterpreted by a large portion of the population.

Health officials have said 12 cases of measles have been reported
throughout South Warwickshire. The Health Protection Agency said 4 were
reported by Mon 3 Nov 2008, but this had now trebled.

The agency is urging parents whose children have not had the MMR (measles,
mumps, and rubella) jabs to contact their GPs [general practitioners] and
arrange to have them [vaccinated]. Spokeswoman Dr Huda Mohamed said measles
was an unpleasant illness, even in its mildest form. She added the national
target for immunisation was 95 per cent of all preschool children. In South
Warwickshire, 84 per cent of children under 5 have had the 2 full MMR jabs.
