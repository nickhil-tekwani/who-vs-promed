[The spatial spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and its long-term persistence in Asia since 1996 have resulted in avian influenza outbreaks across Eurasia and Africa and enormous economic losses in the poultry sector.

In Eastern Europe, there have been several wild bird incidents of HPAI H5N1. There are migratory linkages between breeding and moulting areas in northern Kazakhstan and southern Siberia, with nonbreeding areas in the Caspian, Black, and eastern Mediterranean Sea basins. There are frequent movements of wild waterfowl between Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea, Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean Sea basins during the autumn migration.
