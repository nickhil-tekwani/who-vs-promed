Poisoning hit Iraq minority community
-----------------------------
An estimated 400 Iraqis from the minority Muslim Yazid sect were poisoned
in northern Iraq, apparently from drinking water which was contaminated
deliberately.
Daily Taakhi, the newspaper of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, said dozens
of inhabitants in the town of Khanki, in the province of Dahouk, 550
kilometers (315 miles) north of Baghdad, were taken to hospital for severe
poisoning and many died Wednesday from dehydration.
The newspaper said that the poisoning appeared to be a terrorist act.
It said the incident occurred a few days after writings were found on walls
in the northern city of Mosul calling for the killing of Yazidis, who were
described as infidels.
Yazidis, estimated at only 10 000, follow an offshoot sect of Shiism and
consider themselves part of the Kurdish ethnicity. They mostly live in
towns and villages west of Mosul and north of the Kurdish province of Dahouk.
