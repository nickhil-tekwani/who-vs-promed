[1] Sierra Leone: 16-hour drive to nearest treatment center
Date: 26 Sep 2014

Dozens of very sick people sat on the floor in an empty university building in central Sierra Leone. They waited in filthy conditions. With the nearest treatment center a 16-hour drive away in Kailahun, there is no way to treat the sick, despite the likelihood they are infected with Ebola. According to Osman Bah, the Makeni government hospital director, Ebola cases have spiked in recent weeks.

"More than 100, 150 cases, because we have sent 56 patients to Kailahun," he said. "This morning [26 Sep 2014], we have had more than 100-110 patients."

This university complex is being used as a makeshift holding facility because the sick people have nowhere else to go. Highly contagious patients lie in the open. One woman sat on the floor, too sick to stand. Other victims huddled together on beds. One young child was laying alone. They waited and hoped for a space in the next ambulance.

Growing numbers of Ebola outbreak hotspots are emerging in new locations across the country. "We get phone calls every day from districts over the whole country, and those districts are absolutely overwhelmed," said Axelle Vandoornick, a medical field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.

There is no way of telling which patients are Ebola-positive. Despite this, they are kept together. "99 percent of the cases that we have isolated are positive for Ebola," said Bah, the medical director.

Medical staff at the containment center have little training or experience dealing with Ebola. Protective equipment is inadequate. One makeshift ward was empty. Beds were filthy. Pill packets sat among piles of clothes left by a departing patient.

25 confirmed Ebola patients left for Borders treatment center in Kailahun one recent night. Four died during the 16-hour journey. Doctors Without Borders' [MSF's] Vandoornick said numbers are increasing. "Every day we have ambulances arriving, and when we open the door, there are dead bodies inside the ambulance alongside non-cases, potentially," Vandoornick said. "So that is the 1st source of contamination."

When 2 new patients were brought in to the center, one young boy showed symptoms of Ebola. Despite the risk, his mother would not leave his side. "It's too much," said Karimo Konteh, an ambulance driver. "Every day, I pick up 10, 15, 14, 12 patients, everyday..." Vandoornick said some districts have no Ebola treatment facilities of their own.

"They don't have [enough] capacity of Ebola centers in their district, so basically, they are trying to send their patients to us," Vandoornick said.

Bah, the medical director, said he is not hopeful the situation will improve. "For now, the situation is not under control," he said. "We are hoping it will be better. But I am afraid, maybe it will get worse."

[2] Liberia: situation faced by health workers
Date: 26 Sep 2014
Source: WBUR, USA [edited]
http://www.wbur.org/2014/09/26/ebola-collapse-system


The chief medical officer at Partners In Health, Dr. Joia Mukherjee, was in Monrovia, Liberia, last week... WBUR's Sacha Pfeiffer spoke with Dr. Mukherjee and asked about reports of EVD deaths happening in the streets of some west African communities.

JM: You see that in isolated areas, maybe in one neighborhood of the city or maybe in one village. I mean, the city itself looks like a normal African city. It's bustling. People are going to work. They're in the market. So you don't see sickness everywhere you go, but there is a sense of foreboding. At every major public building and private building, such as a government hospital or a private hotel, there's a hand-washing station outside. No one is shaking hands; people will just bump elbows and stand at the requisite couple of meters away from one other. So you do see the presence of the fear and the infection control that people are trying to do, but you don't right now see this kind of rampant death.

SP: When you talked about infection control like hand-washing stations, is that accompanied by a lot of either billboards or public service announcements that get the word out that people need to try to follow certain protocols so it won't spread even more?

JM: Yes, there's a lot of public education campaigns going on, a lot of posters. When you use your cell phone, a message comes up about Ebola. Initially, there was a lack of acceptance about Ebola even being real, so a lot of the education is about that, but I think it's less about that now than just trying to instruct people on how to stay as safe as possible.

SP: Despite those measures, the virus is still spreading. What do you think it will take to stop that spread?

JM: I think part of the problem with public education campaigns in a very poor setting is less about people not understanding than about not having any alternative. So, for example, if you're a mother or a wife and your husband falls ill, you're going to take care of the person in your family. And if you were able to say, okay, there's a number I can call or a community member who can go alert an ambulance who will come and immediately take this person, you can limit infection. But right now, that mechanism to remove people from their homes or their communities as soon as they're sick is just not sufficient.

SP: We've heard many reports of people who go to hospitals for treatment and are turned away because they can't accommodate them. Is that happening in Liberia?

JM: Absolutely, absolutely. Every day. What's happening is the general collapse of the health care system because physicians and nurses and other health workers are staying home. They feel unprotected and unprepared to deal with this, and they are. They're correct. So one of the efforts of Partners In Health is going to be to try to do general health system strengthening and try to help [at] the district hospital level [so that] even before people walk in, the health workers have the proper protection; they have triage at the gate, can move people with suspect Ebola out of the general hospital environs to an Ebola treatment unit, and take in the people who need treatment for malaria or need treatment for an obstetrical emergency, because right now, it is very difficult for health workers to do their jobs. They're very afraid, and they're very, very unprotected for the threat.

SP: I understand that at the CDC-sponsored training you were doing this week, there was a session designed to "orient participants to the unstructured situation and empower them to refuse to do things they are not equipped or prepared to do or to work in [an] unsafe environment." Can you tell us more about what that means?

JM: Yeah, I mean, I think many of us physicians, nurses, we take an oath; we're very serious about our commitment to patients and to really care for them. But if you're not properly protected and someone is very sick with Ebola, particularly if they're vomiting or they're in the later stages where we know the excretion and the shedding of virus is very high, it is an extremely dangerous situation for the health care worker. And so it's not advisable to provide care until you're in the proper protective gear.

SP: So doctors need to be comfortable saying, "I cannot help you now because I don't have the proper equipment?"

JM: That's right. So if I saw a child, for example, in my normal life who was throwing up blood and unstable, I would rush in and try to stabilize that child. And what we're learning is you can't really do that with Ebola without putting on the proper protective gear lest you become infected. It's that infectious.

[3] USA: exposed doctor repatriated
Date: 27 Sep 2014 updated: 28 Sep 2014

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/nih-to-treat-american-aid-worker-with-ebola-111374.html


An American physician exposed to EVD while caring for patients in West Africa has arrived at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. The Associated Press reported on Sunday [28 Sep 2014] that the NIH had confirmed the doctor's arrival. NIH said on Saturday [27 Sep 2014] that the physician had been volunteering services at an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone. The individual was to be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for observation as well as enrolled in a research study.

"Out of an abundance of caution," the NIH announcement noted, the patient will be admitted to a "special clinical studies unit that is specifically designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists." Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed on Saturday [27 Sep 2014] that just because a person is exposed to the virus does not mean he or she will become infected with it.

Two U.S. hospitals have treated medical missionaries who fell ill with Ebola from West Africa, where the Ebola outbreak has now claimed nearly 3100 lives. Physician Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol recovered at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and were discharged in August [2014]. Physician Rick Sacra was just released from Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. All 3 were infected while stationed in Liberia. Another patient, who news reports have suggested could be a physician with the World Health Organization, remains a patient at the Emory hospital.

Earlier this month [September 2014], NIH launched one of the 1st clinical trials on an experimental Ebola vaccine. Fauci said on 17 Sep 2014 that half of the expected 20 volunteers had already received a dose with "no red flags" raised.

[4] New drugs

http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/27/national/science-health/fujifilm-says-french-ebola-patient-is-taking-its-avigan-drug


Fujifilm Corp. said that its influenza medicine Avigan is being given to an EVD patient at a French hospital along with another experimental drug, the latest treatments to be deployed in the global push to curtail the deadly virus.

The French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety asked for the drug, and the female patient has been given the combination since 19 Sep 2014, the Japanese company said in a statement on Fri [26 Sep 2014]... With no approved Ebola medicines, doctors and international agencies have been forced to test experimental drugs.

The Fujifilm treatment, also called Favipiravir, was discovered by Yousuke Furuta at the Toyama Chemical unit of Tokyo-based Fujifilm in 1998. It targets polymerase, an enzyme that viruses use to replicate inside the body, to stop the viruses from spreading. We're getting many requests from other countries, international organizations, and medical organizations as well," Fujifilm spokesman Takahiro Taguchi said. As Avigan is originally a flu drug, the company has the capability to produce the drug continuously and deal with a rapid increase in demand, he said. The company has enough stock for 20 000 Ebola patients.

Fujifilm's US partner, MediVector Inc. in Boston, is in talks with the Food and Drug Administration to submit an application to use the drug in humans for EVD, a US Department of Defense spokeswoman said in August [2014]. Favipiravir is in the final stages of human studies in the USA as a treatment for flu. A US late-stage trial of the treatment for flu is scheduled to be completed around next March [2015], the company said earlier this year [2014]. The medicine won Japanese approval in March [2014] for government stockpiling for pandemic flu. Fujifilm is running a trial and is in discussion with Japanese regulators to get marketing approval to sell it for seasonal influenza, Kouichi Yamada, senior operations manager of Fujifilm's drug products division, said in an interview in July 2014.

The French woman [a nurse] working for Doctors Without Borders [MSF] was repatriated from Liberia last week after she became infected, the French Health Ministry said on 17 Sep 2014. She's being treated at a military hospital in Saint-Mande, outside of Paris. Health Minister Marisol Touraine authorized the use of several experimental treatments for EVD patients, including Avigan, according to a French government decree published on 19 Sep 2014. Her situation is stable, and she's in good spirits, Touraine said in an interview on BFM TV.
