1. Event
On Wed 7 Mar 2018, health officials warned of an ongoing outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Eastern Lakes state [South Sudan]. According to local sources, 32 suspected cases of RVF and 4 associated deaths were reported in recent weeks.

Health officials are reportedly taking active measures to prevent a larger outbreak of the disease.

2. Context
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an animal-borne virus (_Phlebovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. RVF is usually transmitted to people through contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected domesticated and livestock animals (cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, etc.). Transmission can also occur via mosquitoes and other insects. Symptoms include high fever, back pain, and dizziness. When untreated, RVF can lead to severe ocular disease, vision loss, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. There is no vaccine available, and treatment is mostly limited to supportive care.

3. Advice
Individuals in in Eastern Lakes state are advised to take measures against ticks, such as by wearing covering clothing and using insect repellent. Avoid close contact with livestock animals or with infected individuals.

[Earlier postings on the current RVF event in South Sudan addressed primarily the disease in humans, as noted since early 2018, before cases in animals became known. On 8 Mar 2018, South Sudan's national Veterinary Services reported to the OIE about 8 cases in cattle out of 2000 susceptible animals; the start of the event was given as 11 Dec 2017. Information on the affected population included the following details: "There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed, and the number of mosquitoes increased. No mortalities in cattle have been reported. During the investigation, clinical signs consistent with Rift Valley fever were observed". Please see the complete OIE report and commentary by Mod.CRD in archive no. 20180309.5675819.

According to South Sudan's Ministry of Health's most recent RVF situation report (no. 8, published 16 Feb 2018; ref 1), human samples were submitted to Uganda's Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, where several were diagnosed positive for RVF. In addition, 21 samples collected from livestock were shipped to South Africa for laboratory testing. At the mentioned time of publication, their results were "pending". We will appreciate obtaining these results, in case available.

From a reliable source we have noted that RVF virus is currently suspected to be circulating in the endemic area of Senegal, causing clinical cases in small ruminants. Confirmation and additional details will be appreciated. The last confirmed RVF outbreaks in animals in Senegal occurred in October 2013 in Dakar region; cases were recorded in goats, cattle, and Dorcas gazelles (see 20140318.2341029, 20131018.2008030, and 20130924.1964250).

In East Africa, particularly in Kenya, the epidemiological patterns of RVF are different from those described in West Africa, particularly in Senegal. In Kenya, several RVF outbreaks have been linked to prolonged heavy rainfall, whereas in Senegal, outbreaks usually occur during years of normal or poor rainfall. The main East African RVFV vectors are regarded to be _Aedes ochraceus_ and _Ae. mcintoshi_, while in West Africa the main vectors are _Ae. vexans arabiensis_, _Ae. ochraceus_, and _Culex poicilipes_. (For the said and additional entomological information from Senegal, see a recent paper -- ref 2).

FAO issued an alert in mid-September 2017 to raise awareness about the risk of RVF vector amplification in Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. Non-endemic countries, such as Nigeria, Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Ghana, also showed wide areas at risk due to long, persistent heavy rains.

According to FAO's "Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin" no. 26, 2 zoonotic animal diseases were "representing a high or moderate risk to the food chain for the period January to March 2018": avian influenza and Rift Valley fever.

In several African and particularly in Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia) prevention of RVF is applied by animal vaccination.

Subscribers are referred to FAO's new manual on RVF surveillance (ref 3).
