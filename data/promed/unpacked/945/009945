From: "Dayton L. (Pat) Prouty D.V.M." <bandipur@pyramid3.net>

Dr. Oloungbo asks some interesting questions which perhaps require
sociologic considerations as well as medical.
If a society places a high value on certain traditions, some of which
encourage ongoing public health problems, it will be very difficult to
effect change.
Until a society has developed an infrastructure that is able to enforce
certain measures to ensure public health, they will be shackled by high
rates of infection compared to other countries.
Any country with a high incidence of canine rabies, whose people continue to
eat dogs, whose government will not or can not enforce control on the
transportation of dogs, and compulsory rabies vaccination, will absolutely
continue to have an unacceptable number of human losses to rabies.
I suspect that many of these countries have more pressing public health
needs than that caused by rabies. It must be hard to get excited about a few
dozen humans dying of rabies in a country where thousands die prematurely of
malnutrition or infectious disease.
Dr. Oloungbo needs to know that endemic canine rabies in the United States
was not gotten under control by a high-tech "local rabies-virus
variant-based vaccine", but by a very low-tech generic phenolized vaccine,
not unlike that developed by Dr. Louis Pasteur well over a hundred years
ago. We have had the technology that long. What is needed is public
education to effect social change and a willingness to accept enforcement of
procedures needed to protect. This often takes generations.
If we continue to live by old traditions, we must accept old mortality
rates.
