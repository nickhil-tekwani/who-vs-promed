Samples of raw fish [have been] tested and found to have traces of Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteria, the Ministry of Health (MOH), National Environment Agency (NEA) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) report.

This comes after the MOH launched an investigation into the link between GBS and raw fish after it saw an increase in cases of GBS [infection]. From [1 Jan to 30 Jun 2015], authorities received reports of 238 GBS cases from public hospitals. This is up from an average of 150 cases per year in the past 4 years. More than half the cases were over the age of 55, similar to previous years. Authorities earlier said there is no proven link between eating raw fish and serious GBS disease in healthy humans, but interim analysis of MOH's investigation on a limited number of identified cases found an association between the consumption of raw fish and GBS infections. More cases will need to be studied for a more definite conclusion, authorities noted.

NEA advises licensed food stall holders to temporarily stop the sales of raw fish dishes using song fish, also known as Asian bighead carp and toman fish, also known as snakehead fish, as a precautionary measure. Stall holders will also be reminded to adhere to high standards of personal hygiene and adopt proper food handling practices to prevent cross contamination and bacterial growth, the agencies stated.

Earlier, MOH had asked all hospitals to submit their case listings of patients with GBS infections for this year [2015] as part of its investigation. Doctors in the private sector were also asked to report new cases of GBS infection to MOH as well, to assist in its probe. Authorities added that GBS is a common bacterium found in the human gut and urinary tract of about 15 to 30 per cent of adults without causing disease. However, it may occasionally cause infection of the skin, joints, heart, and brain. GBS can be found in fish, but it does not pose an issue if the fish is well-cooked before consumption, MOH said.

Some GBS patients told Channel NewsAsia after consuming yusheng, their joints swelled to the point where they required surgery. While investigations are ongoing, vulnerable groups of people -- especially young children, pregnant women, or the elderly, or people with chronic illness such as diabetes -- should exercise caution by avoiding raw ready-to-eat food, authorities said.

[_Streptococcus agalactiae_ (also called group B streptococci or GBS) is an important cause of human infections. A prior ProMED-mail post (Strep. Group B - Singapore: foodborne susp. RFI 20150715.3513331) reported a possible outbreak of GBS infections in Singapore that was linked to consumption of GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers, where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger.

Group B streptococci are also found in other animals including cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, are usually biochemically, metabolically or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). Are the strains of GBS isolated from raw fish in Singapore similar to isolates of human or other animal origin?

Because GBS colonize the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts in healthy humans, it is possible that the strains isolated from raw fish in Singapore could be similar to strains of human origin if food handlers who were GBS carriers had contaminated the fish. If the contaminated fish had been allowed to stand at room temperature for several hours between preparation and consumption, the GBS on the fish that was subsequently eaten raw could have reached high bacterial counts. Also, it is important to know if any of the genotypes of GBS isolated from the raw fish in Singapore match the genotypes of clinical isolates.

More information from knowledgeable sources on the reported outbreak of GBS disease in Singapore would be greatly appreciated . - Mod.ML
