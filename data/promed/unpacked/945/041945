More than 100 people reported becoming sick after a "disturbing" salmonellosis outbreak linked to Ricardo's Cafe earlier in 2017, while the cause of another outbreak remains a mystery, ACT Health says. According to ACT Health's annual report, there were 90 cases of salmonellosis between January and March 2016 linked to 3 food outlets.

None of the food outlets have faced prosecution, but ACT Health said it would provide reports on all 3 cases to the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions. The biggest outbreak was associated with Ricardo's Cafe in Belconnen where 100 people reported suffering from gastroenteritis with 75 confirmed cases of salmonellosis. Of the confirmed cases 19 people were hospitalized, ACT Health said.

A 2nd outbreak of salmonellosis was also investigated about the same time with 4 confirmed salmonellosis infections from people who reported eating at Central Cafe in Gungahlin between 30 Jan 2017 and 2 Feb 2017. Both cafes were found to have flaws in their food handling processes and procedures and forced to temporarily close. Ricardo's Cafe's owner previously stated salmonellae had been found on a dish cloth and tea towel in the cafe. ACT Health said both cafes have been inspected since the outbreaks and found to be compliant.

A 3rd salmonellosis outbreak investigation was conducted in February and March 2017, with 11 cases where people ate at the same restaurant over a 5 week period. Several inspections of the premises did not identify any issues and the source of that outbreak remains unknown, ACT Health said. It declined to identify the food outlet given it was found to be compliant and could not be held responsible for the outbreak.

An ACT Health spokesman said any foodborne outbreak was taken seriously by the Health Protection Service. "As such, outbreaks with large numbers of cases are very concerning, and it is disturbing when an outbreak results in persons requiring hospitalization," the spokesman said. The spokesman said between 1 Jul 2015 and 30 Jun 2017, the Health Protection Service issued 15 prohibition orders under the Food Act 2001.

Associate professor Martyn Kirk, from ANU's College of Health and Medicine, said summer was a riskier time for salmonella outbreaks, when the bacteria was able to flourish. "That's a reasonably large outbreak associated with one food premises," he said. "Salmonella is one of the more severe causes of gastroenteritis. It can last up to a week and about one in 5 people might end up going to a hospital."

Dr Kirk said the food service industry had a responsibility to make sure it handled food safely and avoided high risk foods, such as raw eggs and improperly cured foods.

[There are a lot of potential sources of salmonellosis in the restaurant including eggs, dairy, fowl and meat that are served raw or undercooked or the transmission can be caused by problems with kitchen hygiene. - Mod.LL
