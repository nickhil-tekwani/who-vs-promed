A comment on Measles - Taiwan: alert 20110212.0483
------------------------------------------
Locally-acquired measles has been extremely rare in Taiwan and often
follows exposure to imported cases. For this patient, measles was
probably not on the top of the differential diagnoses, and the
patient was in the emergency room with no isolation for approximately
24 hours. In addition, Thu 3 Feb 2011 was the 2nd day of "Spring
Festival," when almost all clinics were closed for the holiday, and
all patients went straight to hospitals, flooding emergency rooms.
Both delayed isolation and increased number of patients in emergency
rooms resulted in the high number of exposed persons.

MMR coverage at school entry is over 95 percent in Taiwan.
