Indonesia: human H5N1 avian influenza death toll reaches 53
-----------------------------------------------
The Indonesian Health Ministry confirmed here on Sunday [15 Oct 2006] that
an 11 year old boy, who died on Saturday evening [14 Oct 2006], was
positively infected by avian influenza [virus], bringing the total death
from the disease to 53 out of 71 cases in the country.
Joko Susilo, an official in charge at the anti-bird-flu center here, told
Xinhua that the boy, from South Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, had
had contact with fowl. "He is positively infected," Joko said.
The total number of deaths from the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in
Indonesia has surpassed that for Viet Nam, making Indonesia the world's
hardest hit country by the virus. The huge territory, backyard-centered
farming and relatively [low] budget have hampered the country's authorities
in their fight against avian influenza.
