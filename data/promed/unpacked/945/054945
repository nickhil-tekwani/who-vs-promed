Criminal cases begun against 3 citizens for sale of anthrax meat
-----------------------------------------------
The session of the Extreme Anti-epidemic Commission (EAC) under the
Osh regional administration was passed on 18 Oct 2005 and was devoted
to preventive maintenance and the struggle against anthrax.
The head doctor of the regional sanitary epidemiological station
Abdimalik Parhanov made a report on the anthrax situation in the
region. 14 cases of anthrax were registered in the region for [the
1st] 9 months of 2005. Presently, land analysis and cattle checking
is being carried out in anthrax areas. [I think this means the
affected farms are being rechecked in relation to other possible
cases and present and historic foci. - Mod.MHJ]. Anthrax infected
people are being placed in hospitals and receive treatment.
This year's [2005] anthrax outbreak occurred in the Alai, Kara-Suu
and Uzgen regions of Osh Oblast. 3 inhabitants of Osh Oblast killed
their anthrax-infected cattle and sold [the meat] to people. It is
necessary to note that all sellers of infected meat knew about it and
consciously sold the meat for profit. Criminal cases have begun
against these 3 people.
At the present time, according to experts, there are 236 officially
registered anthrax areas in the Osh region. The head of the Osh
regional veterinary department, Islam Abdimomunov, noted that it is
necessary to disinfect these areas every year and that the state has
not allocated funds for such purpose for the past 2 years. Anthrax
pesthole can be preserved during hundred years. [An anthrax area may
remain infectious for 100 years. - Copyeditor MSP]
Now, according to the participants of EAC, the vaccination of cows is
being carried out on all pastures, reservoirs, fields and farms where
anthrax spores were found. 6000 animal vaccine doses and 5 tons of
chlorine will be brought from Bishkek, but it is obviously not
enough, participants in the session noted.
Additionally, it was found during the session that regional leaders
did not allot money in the budget for the struggle against dangerous diseases.
The EAC members decided to assemble on 10-11 Nov 2005 to discuss the situation.

[It is a hangover from the old Soviet control procedures to do annual
checks of all known cattle burial sites. Positivity, if and when
found, usually lasted some 5-6 years. It was noted that some sites,
though bacillus-positive, developed apathogenic strains of _Bacillus
anthracis_ towards the end of this period. Disinfecting positive
sites clearly has some value, but it is far more important to
vaccinate livestock annually. How long any positive cattle grave will
remain a risk is ill-recorded in spite of the decades of Russian
observations. I think that the reality is that most revert to being
negative in less than 10 years and only a special minority, with yet
to be defined characteristics, present any long term risk. If it were
otherwise, we would never see the end of this disease, considering
the thousands of past outbreaks. The reality is that when properly
controlled, it fades away. - Mod.MHJ]
