Information of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Mainland,
P.R. China: Follow up report No 3, 27 Feb 2004
--------------------------------------------------
Up to 26 Feb 2004, there are altogether 49 cases of the disease in 16
provinces (autonomous regions or municipalities), all of them [see
Table at URL above] confirmed by the National Avian Influenza
Reference Laboratory as subtype H5N1-caused HPAI.
The accumulated number of diseased birds is 144 800, out of which 127
900 have died. In accordance with the Law on Animal Epidemic
Prevention, the local governments in the above-mentioned places have
sealed off the infected areas, culled all the poultry in a 3-km
radius of the infected sites, and imposed compulsory vaccination on
the poultry in a 5-km radius of the infected sites. Up till now, the
culled poultry total is 7 961 400, while those that have received
compulsory vaccination number 10 211 800. [Details on the virus
strain used and other characteristics of the vaccines -- their
producers, and whether they are killed-inactivated or otherwise --
will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
At present, the disease in the above-said places is under control.
On 19 Feb 2004, the National Bird Flu Reference Laboratory confirmed
that the poultry deaths at Xigu District, Lanzhou City, Anning
District, Lanzhou City, Jingyuan County, Gansu Province was not
caused by the avian influenza virus.
Up to 27 Feb 2004, there are altogether 18 areas, where at least 21
days have elapsed after the last poultry culling took place and where
the quarantine restrictions have been lifted [see table 2 at URL
above].

[2] Japan 3rd outbreak
Date: Sun, 29 Feb 2004

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Poultry) in Japan
---------------------------------------------------
The situation in Japan regarding avian influenza changed over the weekend.
The 2 known outbreaks, one in Yamaguchi Prefecture [a layer flock,
reported 12 Jan 2004] and one in Oita Prefecture [a hobby flock,
reported 18 Feb 2004], were under control. Investigation of the
source of infection continues in the Oita case. National and local
authorities strongly and repeatedly advised farmers and citizens to
report immediately anything unusual in their birds, whether they were
pets or commercial flocks.
The markets were adapting, and the prices of chicken meat continued
to fall despite reduced imports. All seemed well until the evening of
26 Feb 2004, when an anonymous caller reported to authorities in
Kyoto Prefecture that 1000 chickens per day had been dying at a
commercial chicken farm in the town of Tamba. Inspection of the farm
the next morning confirmed the deaths, and preliminary tests were
positive for A H5 virus in the flock.
The president of the farm told NHK (the national public broadcasting
network) that the birds had begun to die in the hundreds on 18 Feb
2004. The numbers of deaths per day increased to 1000. He said that
they just seemed to get sleepy, and then they would lie down and soon
die. But he was not alarmed and had planned to report the situation
to the authorities on 27 Feb 2004.
The farm continued to ship meat and eggs from 18 Feb 2004 until the
authorities began their investigation. Eggs were shipped to 5
prefectures. Live chickens were shipped to Hyogo and Aichi
Prefectures. Meat was trans-shipped to numerous sites in Osaka. The
amount of meat reaching consumers was limited. Of the 12 kilograms
shipped to Osaka sites, 9.3 kilograms were recovered. Only 2.7
kilograms were sold to consumers at 2 stores. This is a remarkable
example of product tracing within 48 hours and an indication of the
amount of concern for food safety that exists in the nation.
Local authorities will continue to have public health nurses survey
residents in the area around the farm, although no one has reported
such illness. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has
broadcast repeated assurances to the public that there is no danger
in consuming the cooked products. The announcements stress that there
is not any historical record of humans being infected by eating
cooked poultry meat or eggs. But the trucks that travel from an
infected farm to slaughterhouses, warehouses, and shops are a
different matter. Animals taken to slaughterhouse/meat processing
plants such as the affected one in Hyogo Prefecture cannot be
processed instantly. Newly arrived animals tend to be held with
others for a short period of time. A spokesman for the plant in Hyogo
Prefecture indicated that all the meat from the 7000 birds received
from the farm in Tamba was in frozen storage, and would be destroyed
so it would never reach consumers.
But the chickens were alive when they arrived, and presumably were
able to infect other birds at the site. The live birds at the site
tested positive for avian influenza. Controls implemented at the
processing plant are similar to the ones under way at the Kyoto site.
At a press conference today, 29 Feb 2004, a spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Tokyo reported
that the causal agent was avian influenza virus subtype H5.
The origin of infection at the farm in Tamba is unknown at present
and is under investigation.
Control measures include:
- disinfection of the premises and access roads is in progress;
- culling of the flock is in progress;
- quarantine (30 km radius);
- investigation of wildlife reservoirs within a 3-km radius;
- screening;
- survey of all residences within a 10-km radius;
- recall of poultry products from the farm;
- access to the area is restricted and vehicles are disinfected;
- tracing of products shipped to five prefectures.
The cumulated number of diseased birds is not yet available, but all
200 000 birds will be culled.
There is a slight problem in the arrangements for disposal of the
dead birds, excreta, and food in the case in Tamba. Unlike the
Yamaguchi case (36 000 birds) where the infected material was buried
in a special trench dug on an adjacent parcel of land, the residents
of Tamba are objecting to a similar arrangement. The results of an
emergency town meeting held that the material should be buried on the
premises of the farm. Prefectural officials indicated that
negotiations would continue. Winter temperatures have returned, so
they might have a few days.

[Cherie McCown is acknowledged for this detailed report.
We have been updated by a listener that the Japanese Broadcasting
Corporation transmitted a confirmation by the Japanese government of
the 3rd bird flu case in Kyoto being -- like the first 2 outbreaks --
caused by HPAI H5N1. Official confirmation to the OIE is anticipated.
