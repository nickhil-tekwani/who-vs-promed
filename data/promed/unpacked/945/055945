Another 2 people have been found infected with anthrax at Faridpur
Upazila [subdistrict] in Pabna. The 2 women have been infected with
the disease, taking the toll to 12 in the upazila over the last 4
days, a health official confirmed on Thursday [2 Jun 2011]. Upazila
health officer Khalilur Rahman told reporters that these people were
identified as anthrax infected when they came to Faridpur Upazila
Health Complex for treatment. "The patients have been given necessary
treatments and advices," the physician added.

He said that an anthrax expert team from Dhaka came on Wednesday [1
Jun 2011] and left the upazila on Thursday after taking blood samples
from several areas and leaving specific suggestions to combat the
disease.

[I have heard from my ICDDR,B [International Centre for Diarrhoeal
Disease Research, Bangladesh] colleague in Dhaka, Dr Janhangir
Hossain, and I quote: "The [field investigation] team is not only from
IEDCR [Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research]. This is
a combined team of IEDCR and ICDDR,B personnel. Dr Apurba is seconded
to IEDCR from ICDDR,B. A combined team of epidemiologist, veterinarian
and anthropologist have investigated the outbreak. The team has
collected human samples, soil samples from slaughtering sites,
discarded sites of dead animals, buried sites of dead animal, and bone
samples if available."

We look forward to seeing what they discover. I suspect that IEDCR,
ICDDR,B, and the Bangladesh Livestock Service are going to have a busy
monsoon season. I wish them every success. - Mod.MHJ]
