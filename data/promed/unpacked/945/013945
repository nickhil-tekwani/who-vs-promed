US to ban slaughter of cattle too sick to walk
----------------------------------------------
Cattle too sick or injured to walk will be banned from entering US
slaughterhouses, the Agriculture Department (USDA) said on [Tue 20
May 2008] a change that comes months after the largest meat recall in
American history. The USDA said a total ban on so-called "downer"
cattle from the US food supply will help prevent the mistreatment of
animals and ensure meat safety. The rule will be expedited and should
be in place in a "matter of months."

Restrictions on downer cattle were adopted in early 2004 after the
1st case of US mad cow disease sparked Japan, Korea, and other
countries to ban US beef imports. The [present] recommendation for a
blanket ban on downer cattle came after a 60-day review, started by
USDA on [28 Feb 2008], of how meat plants operated and treated cattle.

Current USDA rules allow the slaughter and processing of some downer
cattle if they had passed inspection earlier. Still, packers are
required to alert USDA veterinarians in those cases so the cattle can
be reinspected before it is slaughtered for food. The Humane Society
of the United States, consumer groups, and Democratic lawmakers in
Congress have asked for the exemption to the downer ban to be closed.
Last month [April 2008], 3 major US meat industry groups endorsed a
total ban. Last year [2007], about 2700 of the 34 million cattle that
were slaughtered were reinspected under this exception. Just under
1000 were approved and allowed to enter the food supply.

The largest meat recall in US history occurred in February [2008]
after the Humane Society of the United States released a videotape
that showed workers forcing sick and injured cattle into a
slaughterhouse. Some 143 million pounds of meat, mostly beef from
Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co, in Chino, California, was recalled
after the tape raised allegations the plant did not follow rules on
downer cattle.

More changes could be on the way, USDA secretary Ed Schafer said.
USDA's inspector general Phyllis Fong is working on separate
investigation into the humane treatments of animals at slaughter
plants and USDA is still analyzing the results from its 60-day review.

[After a suitable interval secretary Schafer has bowed to the meat
industry and humane society demands. While I am sure we have not
heard the last of this, this thread is interrupted. If it were "cut"
it would be tempting fate and an unseen flood of related events
immediately demanding to be posted. - Mod.MHJ] [Secretary Ed
Schafer's statement is available at
