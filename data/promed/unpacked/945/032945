Tetanus on the rise in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia
-----------------------------------------------
MSF teams working in different locations in Aceh, Sumatra, are being
increasingly confronted with cases of tetanus, a potentially
life-threatening disease. They have already found 67 cases of the disease:
45 in Banda Aceh; 15 in Meulaboh; and 6 in Sigli. The numbers are rapidly
increasing. There is a high mortality rate of about 25 per cent.
People are becoming infected when they search for corpses or useful objects
in the rubble left by the tsunami. Wounds on their arms and legs can become
infected by the tetanus bacteria when they walk through the mud. Since the
disease has an incubation period of between 2 and 60 days, most cases are
only starting to show up now. The fear is that many more people will
develop the disease in days and weeks to come.
Today MSF teams started tetanus prevention work in the port of Banda Aceh.
A tent has been set up in Ulee Lhue, one of the most devastated areas of
town, to provide medical consultations, give dressings and to raise
awareness among the local population about tetanus, its risks, and how to
prevent it. During a rapid assessment done by the MSF team, 6 people who
were searching in the debris were checked for tetanus. All of them had
wounds on arms and/or legs and 3 of them had wounds that were infected.
"We will first work on prevention," explained Loris De Filippi, medical
coordinator for MSF in Aceh province. "We have set up a mobile clinic in
one of the areas where a lot of people are digging in the rubbish, and have
already started providing medical consultations and dressings for the
wounded. In the same place we will distribute protective clothing,
including 500 [pairs of] boots and 1500 gloves. We will use a car equipped
with megaphones to drive around the area and inform people about tetanus
and to explain how to prevent it. We will also treat the disease and start
giving vaccinations."
Because a vast area needs to be covered and many people are at risk, MSF
has asked other organizations to also start prevention activities. Since
the vaccination coverage is probably very low in Aceh, the population would
need a series of 3 tetanus injections to be fully protected for 10 years.
One vaccination will give them only partial immunity.
