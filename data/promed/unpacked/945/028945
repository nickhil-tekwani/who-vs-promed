Leaf blight and vascular wilt in maize and sorghum in Mexico
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Zea mays_ and _Sorghum bicolor_ are important crops for animal and
human nutrition worldwide. In the Central Highland Valley of Mexico,
both crops are extremely important, and research is aimed toward
increasing yield, disease resistance, and crop adaptation from 1900m
[6233 feet] to 2700m [8858 feet] elevation. In a 3-year field breeding
experiment (2004 to 2006), leaf blight and vascular wilt symptoms were
frequently observed in contiguous plots of maize and sorghum crops in
Montecillo, Mexico, and maize plots in Tecamac, Mexico.
To identify and characterize the causal agent of these symptoms,
isolations were conducted on leaves from areas where healthy and
diseased tissues converged. A total of 12 isolates were selected for
further characterization. Physiological and biochemical tests revealed
characteristics of _Pantoea agglomerans_. Further identification of
these isolates was accomplished by DNA analysis. In this analysis, a
total of 5 of the 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained by Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) and were grouped into the _P. agglomerans_ genetic
cluster. There was a 98 to 99 percent similarity of these sequences with
_P. agglomerans_ strain ATCC 27155.
Pathogenicity of the 12 isolates was confirmed by injecting inoculum
into stems of 3-week-old maize and sorghum seedlings in the greenhouse.
Also, seedlings were inoculated with water, nonpathogenic isolates of
_P. agglomerans_ from maize, and not inoculated as negative controls.
All test strains developed water-soaked lesions on juvenile leaves at 8
days post-inoculation and were followed by chlorotic to straw-colored
leaf streaks and then leaf blight symptoms at 3 weeks post-inoculation.
All negative control seedlings did not develop symptoms. In addition,
the 12 isolates were infiltrated into tobacco leaves that displayed a
hypersensitive response at 4 days. Isolates were reisolated, and the 16S
rRNA gene fragments were 100 percent similar to their original isolate
sequences.
_P. agglomerans_ has been reported to affect other crops, including
chinese taro in Brazil (2007), onion in the United States (2006) and
South Africa (1981), and pearl millet in Zimbabwe (1997); however, to
our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P. agglomerans_ associated
with leaf blight and vascular wilt symptoms in maize and sorghum in the
Central Highland Valley of Mexico.

[The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_ which
also comprises genera pathogenic to humans or animals. However, the
majority of its members are plant-associated. Species in the genus cause
a variety of diseases and can affect a number of crops. For example, _P.
stewartii_ causes Stewart's bacterial wilt on maize, an important
insect-borne disease in parts of the USA and Europe; a new disease on
maize, brown stalk rot, was recently reported to be caused by _P.
ananatis_ and an undescribed novel _Pantoea_ species; _P. citrea_ is the
causal agent of pink disease of pineapple; center rot of onion is caused
by _P. ananatis_; a bacterial blight of _Eucalyptus_ and a leaf blotch
disease of sudangrass have also been associated with _Pantoea_ species.
_P. agglomerans_ is widely distributed and the effect of different
strains on host plants can vary dramatically. There are strains which
cause plant diseases like the ones mentioned in the above report;
non-pathogenic strains which live as common epiphytes of many plant
species; strains which are reported to promote plant growth and have a
beneficial effect on yield for some cereals; and strains which are being
suggested as a biocontrol agent for fireblight of pome fruit, a serious
disease caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_. Occasionally, the
bacterium has also been reported from human tissues after plant-related
injuries.
