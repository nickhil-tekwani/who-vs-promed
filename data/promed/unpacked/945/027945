During Epidemiological Week (EW) 28 of 2010, the Ministry of Health
of Peru confirmed the 1st case of pneumonic plague in a 29 year old
patient from the district of Chocope, province of Ascope, department
La Libertad. The presence of buboes had not been identified in the
patient. Subsequently 3 more cases were registered. They were
confirmed by rapid test.

As of EW 30, 17 cases of plague have been reported; of these 4 are
pneumonic plague, 12 are bubonic plague and 1 was septicemic plague
which resulted in death. The onset of symptoms for the last pneumonic
case was 11 Jul 2010. During the investigations, 10 isolates of _Y.
pestis_ were isolated from humans, rodents and domestic cats.

The last plague outbreak reported in the province of Ascope occurred
in the locality of Santa Clara, in the district of Casa Grande
between August and September 2009. During the outbreak, 15 cases were
reported, of which 9 cases were confirmed by laboratory.

Among the current outbreak control measures carried out by the
national and local authorities of Peru are:
- Active search for contacts and secondary cases; beginning of
chemoprophylaxis use on the contacts;
- Strict monitoring of the implementation of biosafety measures by
the health workers;
- Strengthening of the laboratory network for collecting and
processing samples;
- Implementation of an environmental management program.
