USGS Issues Alert for Deadly Disease in Birds
-----------------------------------------------
A deadly bird disease, avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), is affecting
mallard ducks and coots on Woodlake in North Carolina; coots on Lake
Juliette in central Georgia; and coots, bald eagles and -- for the first
time -- a Canada goose on Strom Thurmond Lake on the border of South
Carolina and Georgia.
The disease has not previously been confirmed in Canada geese. Pathologists
at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) in Madison, Wisconsin
and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) at the
University of Georgia made the diagnoses.
The USGS today issued a Wildlife Health Alert to natural
resource/conservation agencies in order to provide and promote information
exchange about significant wildlife health threats in their geographic region.
While there is no evidence AVM can affect humans, the risk to humans is
unknown. People should avoid handling wildlife having died from unknown
causes, or do so with caution using waterproof gloves or an inverted
plastic bag. Hunters should avoid shooting wildlife exhibiting unusual
behavior, use waterproof gloves when dressing out game, and thoroughly cook
meat before eating.
Vacuolar myelinopathy is a nervous system lesion. In affected birds it
appears as open spaces in the white matter of the brain. Scientists have
determined the spaces are caused by separation of the myelin layers that
surround and protect the nerves. Affected birds may fly erratically or not
be able to fly at all. They may crash land, swim tipped to one side with
one or both legs or wings extended, or may be in the water on their back
with feet in the air.
On land, birds may stagger and have difficulty walking; they may fall over
and be unable to right themselves (appear intoxicated). Birds are usually
alert and may bite when handled even if unable to escape capture.
It remains unknown if the disease is "spreading" or if affected birds at
other locations are recognized because more people are aware of the
problem. All diagnostic, field and laboratory efforts indicate the cause is
most likely a chemical substance, either one naturally occurring or
manmade. It is unclear how the birds are exposed to the toxins.
Many agencies are continuing field, laboratory and research efforts to
determine the cause of the disease. USGS-NWHC is conducting research on AVM
using mallards and coots in a sentinel study for the disease in North
Carolina. So far, the study has confirmed the disease is site-specific,
i.e. the lakes where birds are dying are the sites of exposure.
Samples of water, vegetation, and sediments were immediately collected at
the locations where mallards were feeding. Feeding experiments are also
underway in an attempt to determine the route of exposure.
Wildlife managers are encouraged to observe coots, waterfowl and eagles and
report any sick birds to the National Wildlife Health Center at
608-270-2400 or the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at
706-542-1741. If any freshly dead birds are found, keep carcasses chilled
on ice or refrigerated, but not frozen, while you contact the above
agencies. For more information on AVM consult the USGS National Wildlife
Health Center website: <http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/nwhchome.html>
