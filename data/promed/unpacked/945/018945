On 16 Mar 2021, SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was detected for the 1st time in a dog and a cat from the same household in Texas, USA. This was a result of part of a study led by a researcher at Texas A&M University. According to Dr Sarah Hamer, a veterinarian and epidemiologist in the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) who serves as principal investigator for the COVID-19 & Pets study that uncovered the variant: "Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in animals in and around households and genetic investigations of the virus from infected pets are critically important for understanding the transmission and evolution of the virus as well as predicting what may happen next." (See ProMED-post 20210316.8251626)

The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals" (las updated in January 2021) https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/EN_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2.pdf.

"People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness.

"Animals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other animals and humans while infected."
