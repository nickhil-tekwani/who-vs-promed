Gujarat records 5th highest number of malaria cases in India
------------------------------------------------------------
If the figures given out by the directorate of national vectorborne
disease control program (NVBDCP) are to be believed then there were
just 14 malaria deaths in the state between January and October this
year [2011]. What may startle you is the fact that the Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation (AMC) alone has officially reported 59 malaria
deaths between January and September this year. One could figure what
other Gujarat cities and towns may have reported.

For some reason the state health department has been under-reporting
the total malaria cases and even deaths that have occurred in the
state. If there were 71 121 malaria positive cases in 2007, the state
health department has reported just a marginal increase of 76 088
malaria cases in the state this year.

This is contrary to the state government's earlier claims of 2011
being an 8-year peak in mosquito related illnesses. Even with these
suspected underreported figures Gujarat has clocked the 5th highest
number of malaria cases in the country this year. Also till October,
the state reported a 49.3 percent in malaria cases when compared to
the same period last year, while in the case of falciparum the state
has shown a 48.6 percent jump.

While looking at the state figures over the last 2 weeks -- that is
between 28 Nov 2011 and 11 Dec 2011 -- a total of 2475 confirmed
malaria cases were recorded. The number of falciparum cases registered
during the same period is 1524 cases. An alert was also issued within
the municipal corporation limits of Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara
along with districts like Dahod and Rajkot.

"As and when we receive lab confirmation for malaria or dengue we send
these figures to NVBDCP. There may be occasions where we may not have
send the weekly data at all to the centre. We will look into the
matter," a senior health department official said. "There has been an
overall decrease in vector borne diseases in the state. A few pockets
in the state are still infested with mosquito-related ailments. We
have alerted the respective district health officials," added the
official.

Malaria kills 6 in Raipur
-------------------------
Rising cases of malaria has set the alarm bell ringing in the state
capital with 6 deaths reported so far. The figure is likely to rise in
coming days with more than a dozen being tested positive.

The deceased all comes from Talnar village in Chindgarh block. "The
patients in the village approach quack before coming to us. By the
time they came to us their conditions were critical. The late
treatment explain their death," said Dr Ritendra Dev of Mekaj
Hospital.

Meanwhile, the municipal corporation has intensified its drive to
check mosquito breeding. Also, the state government has set up a
malaria control room that will work round the clock.
