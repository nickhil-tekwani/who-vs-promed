Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Apr 2018
Outbreaks status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 218 / 50 / 0 / 0 / 0

[Since the start of 2017, FMDV O/EA-3, an East-African virus strain, has caused at least 8 outbreaks in the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority (PA), of which 2 were in the Gaza strip (cattle, February 2017) and 6 in the West Bank (sheep and goats, May, June, December 2017). It also caused 2 outbreaks in cattle in Israel, the 1st one in a large dairy operation of Kibbutz Nir-Yitzhak, adjacent to the Gaza strip, February 2017 (map at https://goo.gl/maps/toXCLdq7gR32); the 2nd, June 2017, in a beef cattle herd in Ain al Sahila (Basma), central Israel, close to the northern demarcation line of the West Bank, about 33 km southwest of the current outbreak in Gazit (map at https://goo.gl/maps/egMJriCon7C2). Genotyping by the WRLFMD showed full similarity between the strains from the Gaza strip, the West bank and the 2 2017 outbreaks in Israel. The genotyping results from the West Bank are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2018/WRLFMD-2018-00004-Palestinian-AT-O-approved.pdf. The recent genotyping results from Israel (Ain al-Sahila) are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2018/WRLFMD-2018-00003-Israel-O-approved.pdf.

The same genetic similarity to the current strain from Gazit is likely but yet to be established.

It has been stated that additional information on the EA-3 strains from PA and Israel are expected to be published in the March 2018 issue of the Monthly Global FMD Situation Report of FAO/EUFMD. It remains to be seen whether this will include information on the matching rate between the regionally applied vaccine strains and the circulating EA-3 field strain. Such information is also of significance to the adjacent Kingdom of Jordan.

The vaccine strains included in the vaccines applied nationwide for the compulsory periodical vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats in Israel (2017/2018) were specified in an official circular dated 18 Sep 2017, available at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/mispo/pirsumim/2017/Documents/hisun%202017-8.pdf (although the explanatory text is Hebrew, the vaccine strains, serotypes O, A and Asia1, can be deciphered, in English).

FMDV O/EA-3 is known to be endemic in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, and Sudan. This virus has been circulating in Egypt at least since 2012. According to media reports, the disease was introduced into the Gaza strip in early 2017, from Egypt, by illegally imported livestock through tunnels between Sinai and the Gaza strip (see 20170316.4903671). - Mod.AS
