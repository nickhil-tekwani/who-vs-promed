[3] Colorado - 1st neuroinvasive case

Colorado: 1st case of West Nile virus related encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------
A woman in Weld County, Colorado was recently diagnosed with Colorado's 1st
case of West Nile encephalitis, the most severe consequence of West Nile
virus infection. County officials are worried, due to the fact that there
yet have been no [other] reports of the virus in Weld County in 2004, and,
there have been no West Nile-positive mosquito pools or birds.
West Nile encephalitis is the most serious manifestation of the virus, and,
can be fatal. Reports show that 5 people from Weld died from West Nile
virus infection in 2003. This year [2004], only 13 cases have shown up in
the state. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Colorado had the highest number of West Nile virus cases [in 2003]: 2947
out of the 9862 nationwide.
