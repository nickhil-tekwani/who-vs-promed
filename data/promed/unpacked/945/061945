The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health received notification today [10 Oct 2014] of a suspected case of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) affecting a 33-year-old woman.

The patient presented with dizziness, numbness of mouth, hands and feet, as well as headache, nausea, and abdominal pain about 45 minutes after consuming sea urchin at home on [3 Oct 2014]. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital on the same day and was subsequently admitted. She was discharged on [4 Oct 2014]. She has been in a stable condition all along.

Initial enquiries revealed that the frozen sea urchin was purchased from a food store in Fanling. Investigations by the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department are continuing.

Members of the public should seek medical advice immediately if they develop shellfish poisoning symptoms and save any leftovers for investigation and laboratory testing.

A spokesman for CHP said that PSP toxin was a natural toxin sometimes found in bi-valve shellfish.

It is heat-stable and cannot be destroyed through cooking.

He appealed to people to observe the following measures:
- Buy shellfish from reliable and licensed seafood shops;
- Remove the viscera, gonads and roe before cooking and discard any cooking liquid before consumption;
- Eat a smaller amount of shellfish in any one meal;
- When symptoms occur after consuming shellfish, seek medical advice immediately.

[Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States, but occurs in Asian Pacific waters as well often associated with algal blooms such as "red tide". Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins (saxitoxin and related compounds) are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, crustaceans, and even birds and marine mammals.

It is important to note that the shellfish affected by the toxins usually do not appear different. The toxin also has no taste or smell and is heat stable. Typical vehicles are clams (both hard and soft shell), oysters, mussels, and cockles. The liver of lobster (the tomalley) can also contain toxin.

Safe seafoods during toxic algal bloom include scallops (only the adductor muscle is safe), lobster (only the meat), crab (only the meat, properly cleaned), and shrimp. The observation in this posting that scallops were the vehicle of transmission strongly suggests that more than the adductor muscle was ingested or that the entire scallop was cooked, allowing the toxin to contaminate the cooking water and the muscle.

Within minutes to 10 hours of eating shellfish contaminated with PSP toxin, the lips will feel numb and tingling. The amount of toxin consumed will determine the severity and extent of symptom progression. The tingling can extend to the fingers and toes, eventually resulting in a loss of use of the arms and legs. Paralysis can progress to the muscles throughout the trunk of the body, including the chest and respiration. In severe cases of poisoning, death can occur in 2 to 25 hours after consumption. - Mod.LL
