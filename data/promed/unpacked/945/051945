China: 4th Case of Human Avian Influenza Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday [6 Dec 2005] night confirmed a new
human case of avian influenza infection in Ziyuan County of south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The patient is a 10-year-old female
student, who has been ill with fever and pneumonia since 23 Nov 2005, said
an MOH press release. The girl has been tested positive with the H5N1 virus
by the China Disease Prevention and Control Center, and she has been under
emergency treatment in the hospital. The girl has been confirmed to be
infected with avian influenza in accordance with the standards of the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese government.
People who have close contacts with the patient have been brought under
medical observation by local health departments. So far, no abnormalities
have been found among these people. The regional health department and the
MOH have sent expert teams to direct and coordinate disease prevention and
control in the area. Currently, experts are making further investigation
into the source of the avian influenza virus, since no avian influenza
cases had been reported in the county before.
In addition, the ministry has reported the case to the WHO, the country's
Hong Kong and Macao special administration regions and Taiwan, and some
foreign nations, the press release said. Previously, China reported 3 human
cases of bird flu and one suspicious case.
