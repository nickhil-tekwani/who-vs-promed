Three cases of infection of hepatitis C virus infection were detected among the medical staff of the National Cancer Institute Salah Azeiez in Tunis on Wednesday [25 Sep 2013] according to a source from the Ministry of Health.

"Two cases of infection with hepatitis C virus were detected there in a week, and a 3rd case was diagnosed yesterday [24 Sep 2013]. The 3 cases were identified by rapid test pending confirmation by a validation test conducted by L'Institute Pasteur," said the same source.

Results of validation tests are quite slow and require a period of one week to 10 days for completion. As a precautionary measure, a screening will be conducted, starting tomorrow, Thursday [26 Sep 2013], involving the entire staff of the Department of Medicine of the Institute Salah Azaeiz. The Department's medical staff and medical students are routinely vaccinated against hepatitis B. However, no vaccine is currently available worldwide for hepatitis C, a different form of the disease.
