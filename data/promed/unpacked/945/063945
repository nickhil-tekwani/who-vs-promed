Two people in Romania have been diagnosed with botulism, according to Agerpres, the country's news agency. This past weekend, a man went to hospital in the city of Arad and his wife was later diagnosed as being affected. They are believed to have eaten homemade [home-cured? - Mod.SH] ham. The news agency reported that there was no antitoxin available, so health officials had to get some from Moldova. Both patients remain under observation in hospital.

Botulism poisoning is a rare illness caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. A recent study analyzed the clinical and epidemiological data of patients diagnosed with botulism and hospitalized at one facility in Romania. Findings were published in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research. Overall, 48 patients with foodborne botulism were hospitalized between 2012 and 2018, which was more than one-third of the total number reported in Romania. The winter to spring period was when most cases were registered. The commonest source of botulism was consumption of homemade ham.

Anyone who has developed signs of botulism poisoning should immediately seek medical attention, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food. However, symptoms can begin as soon as 6 hours after or up to 10 days later," according to the CDC website.

The symptoms of botulism may include some or all of the following: double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, a thick-feeling tongue, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. People with botulism poisoning may not show all of these symptoms at once. These symptoms result from muscle paralysis caused by the toxin. If untreated, the disease may progress, and symptoms may worsen to cause paralysis of specific muscles, including those used in breathing and those in the arms, legs, and the body from the neck to the pelvis area.

[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile needle use in illicit drug users.

Many different foods when not prepared properly can be the reservoir for this intoxication, but the original descriptions were associated with meat, as here.

"At the end of the 18th century, there were documented outbreaks of 'sausage poisoning' in Wurttemberg, Southern Germany. The biggest one occurred in 1793 in Wildbad, where 13 people became ill (6 of whom died) after eating a locally produced blood sausage.

"The above incident motivated the German poet and district medical officer Justinus Kerner (1786-1862) to investigate the problem. Although he did not succeed in discovering the bacteria that caused it, he was the 1st to publish detailed and complete descriptions of food poisoning between 1817 and 1822. He described 230 cases, most of which were linked to the consumption of sausages. He called it 'sausage' or 'fatty' poison. The illness first became known as 'Kerner's desease,' Kerner being the man who signed the death certificates of those who ate contaminated sausage. In time it became known as 'botulism' after 'botulus,' the Latin word for sausage.

"Eighty years after Kerner's work, in 1895, a botulism outbreak affected 34 people. After a funeral dinner in the small Belgian village of Ellezelles, a group of local musicians consumed smoked ham. That led to the discovery of the pathogen _Clostridium botulinum_ by Emile Pierre van Ermengem, Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Ghent, who investigated the incident. Van Ermengen discovered that botulism was intoxication, not infection, and that the toxin was produced by a spore-forming obligate anaerobic bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_" (https://www.meatsandsausages.com/sausage-making/meat-safety/botulism).

Arad is the capital city of Arad County, situated in the regions of Crisana and Banat. The area can be found on a map in southwestern Romania at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arad,_Romania. - Mod.LL
