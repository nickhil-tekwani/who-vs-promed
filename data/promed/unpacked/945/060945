EXANTHEM & LYMPHANGITIS, BEETLE-DERIVED? - USA (ARKANSAS)

As an entomologist, I have speculated that a recent infection might be
related to pathogens associated with lesser mealworm beetles.
On Aug. 6 I developed a red rash on my feet and discovered a red streak
extending along a blood vessel from my ankle through a sore on my calf to
my groin. At the emergency room, the internist also found a red rash on my
torso, and I subsequently was hospitalized for an "exanthem ... and some
lymphangitis" until Aug. 8.
After returning from the hospital, I called my sister in Arkansas, whom I
had visited the previous week. She reported that her husband, Gerry, had
been to the doctor for treatment of a red rash that extended about 14
inches behind his knee and a similar rash on his wrist. Because of the
intense itching, Gerry had seen a physician on Aug. 7, receiving an
injection for an apparent allergic reaction. The physician was puzzled by
the rash because Gerry had no knowledge of recent exposure to poison ivy or
other potential allergens. I questioned Gerry about his rash and learned
that it also surrounded a sore on his leg.
The symptoms and timing of these two cases are similar enough to propose a
common cause and explanation based on the following incident.
While visiting my sister, she described an invasion of dozens of "bugs" in
their new home. Gerry had picked them up and discarded most of them,
leaving a few that I identified as the lesser mealworm beetle, _Alphitobius
diaperinus_, a common species associated with litter and spilled feed in
poultry houses. My sister confirmed my suspicion that the neighbors had
cleaned the litter from their houses during the previous week, which would
explain the dispersal of the beetles to her home.
A wide range of microorganisms including known pathogens have been isolated
from lesser mealworm beetles from poultry houses (e.g., De las Casas et al,
1972, Environmental Entomology 1: 27-30). Other studies have shown
pathogenic infections of poultry from eating lesser mealworms.
I have speculated that the "rashes" in these two cases resulted from
microbes that were obtained when Gerry and I handled the beetles and
subsequently scratched sores on our legs. Causality of the infections is
speculative because infective microorganisms were not identified from Gerry
or I and those on the dead beetles from my sister's house were identified
in our Insect Pathology lab only as _Bacillus_ sp. and gram negative cocci
(contamination of the dead beetles was not precluded).
It is a common occurrence for homes to be invaded by lesser mealworms
dispersing from poultry houses that are being cleaned. If the preceding
suggested mode of transmission is more than speculation, it is possible
that similar cases of infection in humans may occur where poultry
production is prevalent.
