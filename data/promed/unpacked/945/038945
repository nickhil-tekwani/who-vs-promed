According to the information from the physician in charge of the ICU
of Pskov city hospital the situation remains the same and there is no
improvement.
Currently there are 2 patients in the Unit with a diagnosis of toxic
hepatitis who were poisoned by illegal alcohol. The condition of a
30-year-old woman is critical. There are overall 123 patients with
the same diagnosis in different health-care institutions of Pskov.
According to doctors 3 patients have died during the last week. Since
the beginning of the "epidemic" there have been 9 fatal cases.
The treating doctors say that new patients are admitted every day;
the numbers of beds in hospital units have been increased. The
condition of the patients is usually moderate, but the treatment is
not effective. The physicians say that there is not enough
experience with this kind of pathology and expert consultations are necessary.
The 1st cases of intoxication with "surrogate" alcohol were admitted
to the hospital in Pskov at the beginning of September [2006]. The
first symptoms usually appear by the 10th day after ingestion and
include jaundice, because of the effect on the liver; other organ
systems are also involved. Even after improvement there are residual
signs lasting for a lifetime.

effects are very different. Methanol causes toxic hepatitis. - Mod.TG]
