This is regarding: PRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (23): Afghanistan (OZ) Archive Number: 20190401.6398265.

[The] comment about vaccine failure of OPV (5 doses) and the list of references are highly relevant and very much appreciated. Polio experts had not taken OPV failure as seriously as the problem really deserved. In India, OPV failure was a difficult problem to overcome, delaying elimination of wild polioviruses more than a decade after the target year of 2000. In 2002, failure in spite of 7 or more doses of OPV accounted for 15% of polio cases due to WPV type 1 and 25% of cases due to type 3. Thereafter, the frequency of such cases fluctuated from 52% to 62% (WPV type 1) and 29% to 64 % (WPV type 3) during 2004 to 2007.

While some experts have suggested that "competing infections for receptor sites" may explain why vaccine viruses fail to take, polioviruses use CD155 as receptor, and no other enteroviruses use it as their receptor. Alternate explanations are to be considered.

[Many thanks to Prof. T Jacob John for his comments and providing additional data on the impact of OPV vaccine failures on the polio eradication effort in India. In addition, raising doubts re: the "competing infections for receptor sites" is an important issue. When I was preparing the post (Poliomyelitis update (23): Afghanistan (OZ) 20190401.6398265), I had remembered many discussions regarding competing receptor sites, but found the paucity of studies confirming this theory curious.

Noteworthy is that India has recently celebrated the 5th anniversary of having been certified as polio free, with the last case of WPV confirmed in India in January 2011. - Mod.MPP
