[This report contains 2 separate occurrences of Brucellosis in cattle whose only commonality is that the reports are published on the same day. The 2 occurrences vary widely geographically, in the timing of the start of the outbreak and most importantly in the agent responsible varies in the 2 cases. The outbreak of _Brucella abortus_ in the northern part of the country near the border with Belgium started in March 2012 with import of new live animals. The 2nd outbreak beginning in April 2012 involved a single subclinical case of _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3 in a herd of 22 animals in the western part of France near to Italy. The cause of the outbreak in unknown.

Brucellosis in cattle is most commonly caused by _B. abortus_. _B. melitensis_ most often causes disease in sheep and goats. _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ can cause disease in cattle but these are unusual events when compared to infection with _B. abortus_. _B.ovis_ is also seen in sheep and goats but not humans. While disease syndromes vary, abortions, placentitis, epididymitis and orchitis are common features.

Humans are most commonly infected with _B. melitensis_ but disease due to _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, even _B. canis_ and species associated with marine mammals can occur.
