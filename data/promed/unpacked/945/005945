----------------------------------------------------------------------
I thank Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his report from the perspective of the Tropical Disease Hospital that is also the national [anti-rabies vaccine] ARV [anti-rabies vaccine] center in Nepal. As he stated there was no ERIG [equine rabies immunoglobulin] in Nepal for about 6 months and this I believe was due to "production problems in India" with Bharat Serum for ERIG. This shortage of ERIG was met by private travel clinic like the CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center that made HRIG [human rabies immune globulin] available to all referrals from the Sukraraj Hospital and from elsewhere in the country. It is usually lack of knowledge about needing rabies post exposure treatment that leads to death. Hence education is of utmost importance.

[Thanks to Dr Pandey for the backstory on the treatment problems in Nepal. She rightly points up the importance of public knowledge about rabies, dog bites, and the need to get proper treatment quickly. - Mod MHJ
