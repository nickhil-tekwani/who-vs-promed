A San Diego family is suing Petco [pet specialty retailer] after the death of their 10-year-old son from a bacterial infection they say he contracted from his pet rat.

Their attorney told the Associated Press on Tue 25 Feb 2014, that his firm is seeking an unspecified amount for the suffering endured by the family, whose son died 12 Jun 2013, hours after he was rushed to the hospital with severe stomach pains. The San Diego County medical examiner's office ruled that the cause of death was _Streptobacillus moniliformis_ infection, commonly known as rat bite fever, after exposure to an infected rat.

The retailer in a statement expressed its condolences. "We are deeply saddened by the family's tragic loss," Petco said in a statement. "The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously."

The boy's grandmother purchased the male rat because her only grandson wanted a mate for his female rat, the attorney said. The boy took the rat home 27 May 2013, and woke up the night of 11 Jun 2013 in severe pain with a fever and stomach problems. He was pale, lethargic, and could barely walk, according to the lawsuit. He died the next day.

The suit was not filed until now because attorneys were awaiting the lab results from the CDC, which tested the rat to confirm it was infected, the attorney said. The agency could not immediately confirm the results Tue 25 Feb 2014.

According to the CDC, people can contract rat bite fever from bites or scratches from infected rodents, such as rats, mice and gerbils, or even just by handling an animal with the disease without a bite or scratch. It can also be contracted by consuming food or drink contaminated with the bacteria. It is not spread from person to person. Antibiotics, such as penicillin, are highly effective at treating rat bite fever, and it is rarely fatal, according to the CDC.

The CDC says those at higher risk of contracting the illness are people with pet rats or who work with rats in laboratories or pet stores, or live in rat-infested buildings. The agency recommends that people who handle rats or clean their cages wear protective gloves, wash their hands regularly, and avoid touching their mouths with their hands after being in contact with rodents.

Petco also mentions preventive measures for rat bite fever in information it posts online and provides in stores. The company warns that all rats are potential carriers and that pregnant women, children under the age of 5, and people with weakened immune systems should contact their doctor before buying a rat and "should consider not having a rat as a pet."

Only about 200 cases of rat bite fever had been documented in the USA as of 2004, according to the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University. Scientists believe the disease may be underdiagnosed because it is hard to detect and responds to commonly used antibiotics. But the number of cases, they say, may be increasing, especially among children, with the growing popularity of rats as pets.

[Fatalities from rat bite fever are uncommon but do occur, as the editorial comment from an MMWR (see below) of fatal infection in adults attests.

This organism is part of the normal oral flora of the rat just as other potential human pathogens such as _Pasteurella multocida_ and _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ are part of the normal oral flora of cats and dogs respectively. Zoonoses from pets are a fact of life, whether from a rat, an iguana, a turtle, or a dog or cat.

The following is extracted from MMWR 2005; 53(51 & 52): 1198-202 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5351a2.htm) regarding fatalities with rat bite fever in adults:

Although rapidly fatal pediatric cases of RBF have been described previously (2,3), similar mortality among adults has not been reported. Mortality attributed to severe systemic complications (e.g., endocarditis, myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, or multiple organ failure) has been documented in certain adult patients (1,4). Both patients described in this report died within 12 hours of presentation, allowing little opportunity for assessment and treatment. These case reports demonstrate that infection with _S. moniliformis_ can cause fulminant sepsis and death in previously healthy adults. As a result, prevention of severe disease might depend on increasing the awareness of appropriate risk-reduction activities and possible symptoms of RBF among persons who have exposure to rats. Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications (1). Because rapid laboratory confirmation of infection with _S. moniliformis_ might not be possible, clinicians should consider initiating empiric therapy for patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history.

Clinicians should consider RBF in the differential diagnosis for unexplained febrile illness or sepsis in patients reporting rat exposure. Initial symptoms might be nonspecific, but a maculopapular rash and septic arthritis commonly develop (1,5). However, as demonstrated by the cases in this report, patients can have severe disease before the onset of typical symptoms. Despite its name, approximately 30 percent of patients with RBF do not report having been bitten or scratched by a rat (1,5). Risk factors for RBF include handling rats at home and in the workplace (e.g., laboratories or pet stores). RBF is rare in the USA, with only a few cases documented each year (1,6,7). However, because RBF is not a nationally notifiable disease, its actual incidence has not been well-described.

In the cases described here, diagnosis of RBF was delayed in part because of the inability to rapidly isolate or identify _S. moniliformis_. If infection with _S. moniliformis_ is suspected, specific media and incubation conditions should be used (8) (See Box at source URL above). In the absence of a positive culture, identification of pleomorphic Gram-negative bacilli in appropriate specimens might support a preliminary diagnosis (1). In the event of an unexplained death in a person with rat exposure, performing an autopsy might also be critical to identifying an etiology.

Because of the high prevalence of colonization and asymptomatic infection with _S. moniliformis_ among rodents, testing and treatment of rats is not practical. Disease prevention should center on risk reduction among persons with frequent rat exposure. Adherence to simple precautions while handling rats can reduce the risk for RBF and other potential rodent-borne zoonotic infections, wound infections, and injuries. Persons should wear gloves, practice regular hand washing, and avoid hand-to-mouth contact when handling rats or cleaning rat cages (1,9). If bitten by a rat, persons should promptly clean and disinfect the wound, seek medical attention, and report their exposure history. A tetanus toxoid booster should be administered if more than 10 years have lapsed since the last dose (9,10).

Clinicians should contact their state health departments for assistance with diagnosis of unexplained deaths or critical illnesses and cases or clusters of suspected RBF or other zoonotic infections. UNEX coordinates surveillance for unexplained deaths possibly attributed to infection throughout the United States. Cases are reported by a network of health departments, medical examiners/coroners, pathologists, and clinicians. Epidemiologic and clinical data are collected, and available clinical and pathologic specimens are obtained for reference and diagnostic testing at state, CDC, and other laboratories. State and local health departments may contact UNEX for assistance with the evaluation of unexplained deaths that occur in their jurisdictions.
