Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The disease is not reported in the country before; this explains its rapid spread from South Darfur to East Darfur state. As the result of investigation, report of clinical signs with respiratory disease in equine was received in April 2019. A total of 113 sera samples and 5 nasal swabs were collected from the 2 sites. A total of 107 were diagnosed as caused by equine influenza virus (antibody detection using haemagglutination inhibition test). The clinical signs varied between mild to severe with low mortality rate in the affected equine. No new cases were reported since [14 May 2019].

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; zoning; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results

["Equine inﬂuenza (EI) is a highly contagious though rarely fatal respiratory disease of horses, donkeys and mules and other equidae. The disease has been recorded throughout history, and when horses were the main draft animals, outbreaks of EI crippled the economy. Nowadays outbreaks still have a severe impact on the horse industry.

"EI is caused by 2 subtypes of inﬂuenza A viruses: H7N7 and H3N8, of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_. They are related to but distinct from the viruses that cause human and avian inﬂuenza.

"EI is a disease listed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and countries are obligated to report the occurrence of the disease according to the OIE Code.

"There is little risk to public health. In experimental settings the virus has shown the ability to infect humans, and a few people in contact with infected horses developed antibodies to equine inﬂuenza viruses, but no humans exposed to the virus have become ill."
