The World Food Programme (WFP) has for the 2nd time this year [2019] suspended the distribution of Super Cereal stocks across the country.

This comes after 33 people were last Thursday admitted to Palabek Health Centre, within Palabek Refugee Resettlement Camp in Lamwo District, after consuming the nutritious porridge.

The UN food agency has a mandate to fight hunger in famine-prone areas. It has supplied food to Karamoja Sub-region for more than 50 years.

In an 30 Aug 2019 statement issued by the WFP, which Daily Monitor has seen, the international agency has halted food distribution to allow investigations into possible food poisoning.

"With immediate effect, the WFP is suspending the distribution of Super Cereal (CSB) in all the nutrition's programmes in Uganda," reads the statement in part.

"This action is taken out of an abundance of caution while a case of potential food contamination/poisoning is investigated in Palabek settlement. The government and WFP are working closely together to determine whether there is a link between Super Cereal consumption and people falling sick. The suspension will remain in place until further notice," read the statement signed by Mr Ryan Anderson, the deputy country director, and officer-in-charge of WFP.

The agency impounded more than 21 000 tonnes of the product pending the outcome of safety tests.

Dr Charles Akia Oyo, the Lamwo District health director, confirmed 33 people were admitted after eating porridge flour.

"We admitted 33 people from Palabek settlement camp and we discharged them on Friday [30 Aug 2019?], and they are recovering," he said.

He added that others were still undergoing check-up at the health facility.

Dr Oyo said the flour WFP distributed was recalled for investigations. He said those admitted were vomiting and complained of stomach upsets.

"The situation is calm, and there is no cause for alarm because we have not received any new cases since Saturday [31 Aug 2019?]," he said.

Ms Brenda Akuruchet, the WFP public relations officer, said: "WFP is still working out what options are best and determining the best way forward to minimise the negative impact on activities," she said.

Mr John Komakech Ogwok, the Lamwo District chairperson, called upon government and WFP to investigate the root cause of the problem.

In March 2019, the agency suspended the distribution of Super Cereal and commenced investigations into the matter in Karamoja Sub-region following the death of 4 people in Napak and Amudat districts.

Nearly 300 others fell ill and were admitted to various health centres. Health workers said all patients presented symptoms of mental disorder after eating the flour.

[In March 2019, this same cereal caused problems. There were people with similar symptoms, but some of them died.

Similar clinical signs are mentioned in the previous foodborne illness situation.

The clinical signs described previously are somewhat general and could fit a number of contaminants. However, they are not a very good match to the contaminants found thus far. In fact, finding coliforms in the cereal/flour substance may result from a lack of hygiene by the workers or in the processing plant in general. Either way, it is a nauseating thought.

Alkaloids are mentioned [in the previous poisoning], specifically atropine. Tropane alkaloids are known to produce clinical signs including dilated eyes, flushed skin or a feverish feeling and are often associated with the inability to sweat.

The exact cause of the situation in March 2019 regarding Super Cereal has either not been found or has not been released publicly. However, there is an article from Food Safety News (https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/06/fda-and-cdc-helping-with-ugandan-outbreak-investigation/) regarding the March 2019 situation. The article is here:

5 Jun 2019
The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Food and Drug Agency (FDA) were helping to investigate the March [2019] situation:

"Two federal agencies in the United States are part of efforts to find the source of food poisoning in Uganda that led to 4 deaths.

The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration are involved in the investigation of the outbreak that occurred in March and April 2019.

The World Food Programme (WFP) previously reported that 3 people died and hundreds more were admitted to health centers in the Karamoja region of Northeast Uganda after eating Super Cereal, which had been distributed to prevent malnutrition. Symptoms included mental confusion, vomiting, headache, high fever, and abdominal pain.

The food came from a Turkish supplier, which has been suspended from local and international Super Cereal distribution pending results of the investigation. Super Cereal is corn or wheat blended with soya beans, fortified with vitamins and minerals, processed into flour and supplied in 25-kilogram bags.

It was established that all 296 people who fell ill had eaten porridge from one batch of specially fortified food called Super Cereal (also known as CSB+). However, lab testing so far has not found the causative agent.

The FDA detected traces of alkaloids, specifically atropine, but is yet to establish the levels of contamination and whether the alkaloids are synthetic or natural. More tests are being performed by the agency and results will be released at a later date, according to a statement from the Ugandan Ministry of Health.

Samples were collected from WFP warehouses, health facilities and the homes of patients to rule out the presence of mycotoxins, heavy metals, pesticides and microbial agents. Lab tests were complemented by an epidemiological review by the ministry of health and CDC and toxicologists from the United Kingdom who visited Karamoja to examine patients.

Representatives from the CDC are part of a task force which includes the Ugandan Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, World Health Organization (WHO), WFP and Ugandan National Bureau of Standards (UNBS).

Food testing results:
Of 18 samples tested by UNBS, one had aflatoxin B1 slightly higher than the acceptable limit and a few had low levels of yeast and mold, but levels were lower than those required to cause illness, according to the ministry of health statement. The government analytical laboratory also found one sample with slightly high aflatoxin B1 but these levels could not explain the acute symptoms of toxicity seen in patients.

Testing by the Ministry of Health central public health lab found Bacillus cereus twice and Salmonella once in three samples from a household. Contamination was not found in samples from the warehouse.

An Intertek lab in Mombasa detected coliforms in three samples. In the Johannesburg lab owned by the same company, one sample failed the aflatoxin B1 test, 3 were contaminated with _Bacillus cereus_, and 3 also had coliforms. FDA did not report any of these findings, but further analysis is ongoing.

UNBS and the Directorate of Government Analytical Laboratory (DGAL) boosted analytical capabilities through support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

"In the past, the lack of adequate diagnostic and analytical testing capacities limited our ability to minimize health risks to the public, including responding to outbreaks and emergencies and investigating suspected causes,'' said Deus Mubangizi, manager of the Testing Division at UNBS.

The IAEA supported expert missions, training courses and delivery of equipment such as radio receptor assays, isotope dependent liquid chromatographic and spectrometric tools, liquid chromatographic instruments, tools to help sample preparation and storage, and analytical material to ensure performance according to international standards.

The outbreak could have spread further or affected more consumers if stakeholders including the 2 laboratories had not been in a position to intervene, promptly," said Kepher Kuchana Kateu, director of DGAL.

The Ugandan Government and WFP suspended distribution of Super Cereal in the country from all suppliers. The United Nations agency started distributing foods of equal or higher nutritional value to vulnerable people.

Testing at the FDA showed Super Cereal from all suppliers other than the Turkish firm is safe to eat. The government has allowed WFP to resume Super Cereal distributions from the other suppliers.

The WFP previously said food supplies on hold around the world totaled more than 21 000 metric tons with an estimated replacement value of USD 22 million."

So, it appears an exact cause for the situation in March 2019 has not been found. It will be interesting to see whether the investigation this time focuses differently.

In the March 2019 situation, it was suggested the cereal may have been contaminated with Jimson weed or a _Datura_ species.

There are a number of species with slight differences in the shape of leaves or flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents, in slightly different proportions. Photos may be seen at http://www.wildflowersofontario.ca/jimsonweed1.jpg and http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/images/10292.jpg. The thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at http://i1.treknature.com/photos/11556/datura_metel04.jpg.

The memory tool for jimsonweed intoxication is "red as a beet, dry as a bone" (flushed, hot, red skin) and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in Wonderland, for its hallucinogenic properties). The seeds have been collected by addicts trying to get high because of their hallucinogenic properties. A variety of _Datura_ species are sold ground as herbs and have proven to be dangerous. So, while an extract or tincture of the boiled seeds may provide some hallucinogenic properties, it may also have fatal effects.

The plant contains a tropane alkaloid (a belladonna alkaloid). These alkaloids are similar to atropine and scopolamine. The plant contains 0.45 percent to 2.0 percent. Humans and frequently animals are affected by this plant.

The most common clinical signs are subnormal temperatures, mydriasis, restlessness, muscular twitching, convulsions, tachycardia, incoordination, and paralysis; death can result from respiratory paralysis.

Treatment usually includes activated charcoal to reduce gastric absorption of the toxin and physostigmine to reverse the effects of the toxin. However, in some cases gastric emptying may be necessary.

We will hold out hope the source of these causes of illnesses and death will be rapidly determined. - Mod.TG
