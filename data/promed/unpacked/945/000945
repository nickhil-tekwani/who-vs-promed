Bird flu detected in 2 wild duck corpses at Fukushima reservoir
---------------------------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu has been detected in the corpses of 2
migratory wild ducks found at a reservoir here [Koriyama, Fukushima],
prefectural authorities announced on 19 Jan 2011.

From [4 to 7 Jan 2011], the prefecture gathered 7 bird corpses from
the reservoir and sent them for testing at the National Institute for
Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture. 4 of the
corpses tested positive for Type-A influenza, and further
investigation at Hokkaido University in Sapporo found that 2 had the
highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu. The other corpses are still being
investigated.

The prefecture set up a response center on 19 Jan 2011, and on the
morning of 20 Jan 2011 began sending inspectors clad in protective
suits to 59 poultry farms in a 10-km [6.2-mile] radius area under
supervision that includes neighboring towns. The inspectors are
interviewing farmers, looking for signs of contagion such as changes
in the death or egg-laying rates of chickens, and checking that farms
have anti-contagion measures in place such as nets to keep out wild
birds and supplies of disinfectant on hand.

Furthermore, nearby roads are being disinfected to prevent possible
contagion from bird droppings, and inspectors are watching for any
bird corpses in the areas where the ducks migrate to. The reservoir
where the duck corpses were found has been disinfected, and the
prefecture is stepping up observation for wild birds in agricultural
water reservoirs in the city.

The reservoir where the duck corpses were found is located in an
urban area west of Koriyama Station. According to the Koriyama city
water department, the reservoir supplies water to around 22 000
homes. The department says the reservoir, treated with chlorine,
presents no danger to humans. Still, to ease the concerns of
citizens, it was decided to temporarily use water from nearby
Inawashiro lake in place of the reservoir.

The discovery of H5N1 bird flu in Koriyama is the 6th confirmed case
in the country since October of last year [2010] when it was detected
in duck droppings in Wakkanai, Hokkaido. Further cases were confirmed
in Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture, Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, Yonago,
Tottori Prefecture, and Izumi, Kagoshima Prefecture.
