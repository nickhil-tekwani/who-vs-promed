Federal Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme confirmed the discovery of 3 new cases of wild boar carrying African swine fever (ASF). They were discovered in a protected area in the Belgian province of Luxembourg. Further examination was conducted to confirm whether the wild boars were carriers of the virus. The University of Liege carried out the 1st tests on the carcasses, and according to the DEMNA (Department of the Study of the Natural and Agricultural Environment), the 3 new cases mentioned by Denis Ducarme this Saturday [15 Sep 2018] morning tested positive. The 3 carcasses, found in the same area of Etalle, are confirmed carriers of the virus, bringing to 5 the number of ASF-infected, dead wild boars.

While 3 new cases were discovered and confirmed this Saturday [15 Sep 2018], Rene Collin, the Walloon Agriculture Minister, said that swine fever, found Thursday [13 Sep 2018] in the province of Luxembourg, could "continue in the environment for up to 2 years, maybe even longer. But in the near future, the priority to deal with this crisis is extinction."

At the end of a meeting of 2 experts from the European Commission and members of the AFSCA [the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain], Rene Collin was very clear on this point. "We shall 1st harvest all the corpses, as far as possible, to avoid the spread of wild boar outside the cycle of infection." In the 1st step, most of the work will consist of defining the area as accurately as possible. This will be carried out by agents of the Department of Nature and Forests with help from hunters. Each case detected will be analyzed before it is destroyed.

In parallel with this, Rene Collin plans to take further restrictive measures regarding ASF circulation in the forest to limit its spread as much as possible, as well as the dispersion of wild boar. "I urge everyone to be very vigilant and not dare entering the forest in this zone unless it is necessary." AFSCA provided some of the best advice, which is to be sure to isolate pigs from wild boars and use double fencing.

[In an earlier posting (20180913.6027857) we stated that the most western outbreak of ASF in Europe, before the new Belgian event, was north Poland. This related to the disease in domestic pigs. As far as wild boar are concerned, the most western case was reported to the OIE from eastern Czech Republic: see OIE's ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/y899xbvf (click on central Europe and then zoom in).

For the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)'s assessment of the event in Belgium, dated 14 Sep 2018, see https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/740925/poa-asf-boar-belgium.pdf.

According to other media sources in Belgium, Agriculture Minister Ducarme also announced Saturday [15 Sep 2018] that an interministerial conference will be held next week "to enhance the exchange of information and strengthen collaboration between different entities." A meeting is already scheduled with the relevant European Commissioner for Monday [17 Sep 2018] at 11:30 CET. - Mod.AS
