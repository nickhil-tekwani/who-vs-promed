Leishmaniasis and tuberculosis increasing in Syria
--------------------------------------------------
Inevitably, disease is spreading among people whose immune systems have been weakened by hunger, in a city [Aleppo] where sanitation has broken down. Tuberculosis is ravaging some neighborhoods, and there have been hundreds of cases of leishmaniasis, a skin disease transmitted by sand flies, which are multiplying amid the heaps of uncollected trash, said Saad Wafai, who serves on the crisis committee of the Aleppo council.

At a small clinic in an abandoned shopping arcade -- set up by doctors driven out of a hospital destroyed in an air strike -- the number of patients has surged recently, to about 150 a day. For the 1st time, physician Izzat al-Mizyad said, most show up not with injuries from the war but infectious diseases, including hepatitis, respiratory infections and scabies.

[Leishmaniasis is transmitted by sand flies (_Phlebotomus_ spp.) and the incubation period can be weeks to months. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by _Leishmania tropica_ and 30 000 cases were reported in 2008 (Alvar J et al. and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671). Visceral leishmaniasis is rare but is found from Aleoppo and towards the Turkish border. The reservoir for _L.tropica_ is small rodents and for _L.infantium_ it is dogs.

It is no surprise that the incidence is increasing. Rodent and vector control activities most probably no longer exist and leishmania infected dogs are not captured and killed.

It it no surprise either that tuberculosis in on the increase. Syria was in 2009 estimated to have 26 (range 22-31) new cases of tuberculosis per 100 000 population (WHO World Tuberculosis Report 2012;
