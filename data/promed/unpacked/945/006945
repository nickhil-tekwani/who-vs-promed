The CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) have completed the investigation of the recently reported 4th vCJD case in the United States. It confirmed that the case was in a US citizen born outside the Americas and indicated that the patient's exposure to the BSE/vCJD agent most likely occurred before he moved to the United States; the patient had resided in Kuwait, Russia and Lebanon.

The completed investigation did not support the patient's having had extended travel to European countries, including the United Kingdom, or travel to Saudi Arabia. The specific overseas country where this patient's infection [could have] occurred is less clear, largely because the investigation did not definitely link him to a country where other known vCJD cases likely had been infected.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), 1st described in 1996 in the United Kingdom, is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans. It is believed to be caused by consumption of products from cows with the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow" disease). Worldwide, more than 220 variant CJD patients have been reported, with a majority of them in the United Kingdom (177 cases) and France (27 cases).

This case is the 4th to be reported in the United States. In each of the 3 previous cases, infection likely occurred outside the United States, including the United Kingdom (2 cases) and Saudi Arabia (1 case). The history of this 4th patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States. CDC assisted the Texas Department of State Health Services' (DSHS) investigation of this case and has continued to establish the patient's history, including the potential source of infection.

The classic form of CJD, which is not caused by the BSE agent, occurs worldwide, including in the United States. Annually, for every one million people in the United States, 1-2 develop classic CJD.

More information about variant CJD, including how it differs from classic CJD, is available in the Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Fact Sheet (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm).

[ProMED-mail thanks Terry Singeltary, Sr. for drawing attention to this updated report from the CDC and Texas Department of Health reasserting that the location of exposure of the US patient who died as a result of vCJD still remains unknown despite further investigation. No further information relevant to the location of victim's site of exposure has become available, and there is still no evidence suggesting that exposure occurred in Texas or elsewhere in the USA. - Mod.CP]

[But with such a rare condition, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence -- as has been shown by the sudden emergence of ebolavirus-Zaire in West Africa. I am not, of course, suggesting that vCJD could suddenly produce thousands of cases. - Mod.JW]
