Increase in hepatitis A in tourists from Denmark, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden returning from Egypt,
November 2012 to March 2013
---------------------------
(By: MacDonald E, Steens A, Stene-Johansen K, Gillesberg Lassen S, Midgley SE, Lawrence J, Crofts J, Ngui SL, Balogun K, Frank C, Faber M, Gertler M, Verhoef L, Koopmans M, Sane J, van Pelt W, Sundqvist L, Vold L.)


Since November 2012, there has been an increase in reported cases of hepatitis A (HAV) in tourists returning from Egypt in several European countries. [See also: ProMED-mail: Hepatitis A - EU: Nordic countries, food-borne, frozen berries, archive number 20130417.1653060]. As of 24 April, 80 HAV cases in travellers with symptom onset after 1 November 2012 visiting different areas in Egypt have been reported: 4 cases in Norway, 6 cases in the Netherlands and 5 cases in England share an identical hepatitis A viral RNA sequence. This increase in cases suggests that vaccination recommendations for travellers to hepatitis A endemic countries should be reinforced.

The alert
---------
Since January 2013, 6 hepatitis A cases with travel history to Egypt during the incubation period (2-6 weeks after infection) were reported to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). Typically, [only] a single case of hepatitis A with travel history to Egypt is reported in Norway annually. 4 of the 6 cases were genotyped and were found to be infected with the same genotype 1B hepatitis A virus (HAV) strain. On 15 April 2013, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health posted an urgent inquiry on the Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS) platform asking if any other European countries had observed an increase in HAV with travel history to Egypt in the same period. Initially, 4 countries (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden) responded that they had all observed an increased number of hepatitis A patients with travel history to Egypt.

On 19 April 2013, an alert was also sent through the European Commission Early Warning and Response System (EWRS). Subsequently, an increase in HAV cases in tourists returning to England was also reported. A multi-national investigation has been initiated in order to identify European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries with reported increases in HAV among travellers to Egypt, compare travel history among cases, and potentially identify any common exposures among travellers originating from different countries.

Background
----------
The incidence of HAV in European countries has decreased from 15.1 in 1996 to 3.9 per 100 000 population in 2006, attributable to improved sanitary and living conditions [1,2]. However, the reduction in circulation of HAV has led to an increase of susceptible individuals, resulting in several outbreaks in recent years, notably among European tourists visiting Egypt [3-6]. In Egypt, the burden of disease due to HAV is one of the highest in the world, with most HAV strains belonging to genotypes 1A and 1B.

Recent studies of the presence of HAV in sewage and in the population have shown that the virus circulates widely in Egypt [7]. Egypt is a popular destination for travellers from many European countries (Table 1) [8-12]. HAV vaccination is generally recommended for all travellers to Egypt, although funding the vaccination for tourists or including the vaccine as part of the national vaccination plan is uncommon.

Hepatitis A cases are mandatorily notifiable in all EU/EEA countries. In Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, age, sex, vaccination status and location of travel are submitted as part of the notification. In England the same information is recorded at notification with the exception of vaccination status and location of travel, which are collected as part of local public health surveillance. In Denmark, Statens Serum Institut performs sequencing for surveillance purposes of all IgM positive samples received from local diagnostic laboratories.

Description of cases
--------------------
As of 24 April, 80 HAV cases in travellers with symptom onset after 1 November 2012 visiting different areas in Egypt have been reported. Overall, 46 percent of cases are male, with ages ranging from 3 to 76 years. Onset of symptoms of HAV cases ranged from week 44 of 2012 (29 October-4 November) to Week 15 of 2013 (8-14 April). Cases occurred in several waves, with a peak in Week 6 (4-10 February). Cases from England, the Netherlands and Norway sharing the outbreak strain are clustered between Week 5 and Week 13. Cases travelled primarily to Sharm-El-Sheik and Hurghada, with case genotyping reporting travel history to both Sharm-El-Sheik and Hurghada. Hepatitis A cases in travellers to Egypt from Denmark, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden with symptom onset date after 01 November 2012 as of 24 April 2013 (n=80).

Vaccination recommendations
---------------------------
Despite the explicit vaccination recommendations in all involved countries for travellers to Egypt, almost no cases were vaccinated prior to travel. In Denmark, England, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden all cases with known vaccination status were unvaccinated. In Germany one case reported a full course of vaccination and is being interpreted as a vaccination failure. All other cases from Germany with available information were unvaccinated. This increase in cases reported from European travellers returning from Egypt suggests that European public health authorities should consider reinforcing HAV vaccine recommendations for tourists travelling to endemic areas, especially Egypt. Although HAV vaccination is recommended, with the exception of England, none of the involved countries fund the vaccination of tourists or include the vaccine as part of the national vaccination plan. In England the hepatitis A vaccine is often provided free of charge by general practitioners.

The lack of vaccination may be partly explained by the perception among travellers that the risk of acquiring hepatitis A is low when engaging in organised holidays or activities. All interviewed cases in Norway and Denmark stayed in hotels that were either all-inclusive or had restaurants on-site. Information regarding participation of HAV cases in specific activities such as cruises, day trips, organised tours and recreational activities that may present a risk of exposure is unavailable at this time. Public health authorities may wish to engage travel companies in order to ensure travellers are informed about vaccination requirements prior to travel. Because of the increasing number of travellers booking tickets online, an automated reminder when booking tickets has also been suggested as a means of increasing vaccination coverage [14]. Further investigation into the level of knowledge and attitudes among tourists visiting countries where hepatitis A is prevalent, particularly those joining chartered tours, could assist in targeting information about HAV vaccination. The collection of this information is being planned as part of the next stage of the multi-national investigation.

Conclusions
-----------
This investigation into an outbreak of cases of hepatitis A in tourists to Egypt from several EU/EEA countries is ongoing and at this time the dynamics of the increase in cases are unclear. Although the background level in Egypt of the HAV strain involved in this outbreak is unknown at this time, a unique sequence among cases may indicate a common exposure.

[{Despite the availability in all the involved countries of hepatitis A vaccine for travellers to Egypt, almost no cases were vaccinated prior to travel.

This report makes a strong case for making hepatitis A vaccine compulsory for all travellers to Egypt and beyond. Better communication of the risk of hepatitis A virus infection in certain endemic areas is necessary. Even where vaccination is free-of-cost, as in the UK, few people take advantage of this protection. Hepatitis A is endemic in Egypt in particular, as indicated by the recent ProMED-mail post describing cases of hepatitis A in northern Europe associated with consumption of frozen berry fruit from Egypt. - Mod.CP]
