Feijoa growers are worried about the potential spread of a new fungal disease that is devastating some orchards in Northland, anthracnose [caused by] _Colletotrichum theobromicola_. Some orchards have been badly affected by the new fungus.

Feijoa Growers Association's Roger Matthews said the arrival of the new [fungus] was a concern, and it was difficult to predict if [it] would spread. "Growers further south are thinking that humid conditions might be what the fungus needs, and [that therefore they] might be protected from it," he said. "However, facing climate change, all bets are off."

He said central to stopping the spread was good orchard hygiene. "If you are pulling trees out -- which unfortunately they have had to do -- those will be destroyed." Beyond that, there was not a lot that could be done. "The spores are airborne, so they will blow in the wind."

[A] grower [who] has been hit hard by the disease, [said] that the new fungus behaved very differently from other versions of anthracnose because [it] attacked the fruit before it was ready. He said other growers further down the country should be worried.

[Feijoa (pineapple "guava"; _Acca sellowiana_, family Myrtaceae) originates in South America and is a major fruit crop mainly in areas of the southern hemisphere, including New Zealand.

Fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops. In woody hosts, symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting.

The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose usually centers on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce environmental moisture.

Anthracnose caused by other _Colletotrichum_ species has been reported in NZ earlier. It is not clear from the report above whether _C. theobromicola_ is considered a new incursion in NZ or just a new pathogen on feijoas. In the country, the crop is also at risk from guava rust (ProMED-mail post 20170508.5022345) and guava moth.
