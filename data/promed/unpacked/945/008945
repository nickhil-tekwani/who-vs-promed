A proliferation of rats during the past three weeks in the province of Rio
San Juan has extended to other regions of Nicaragua, including Managua, and
has increased the probability of an outbreak of leptospirosis, officials
reported Saturday.
The overpopulation of rats in Rio San Juan has led to the destruction of
some 24,000 hectares of crops - mostly basic grains. The rats have now
extended north to Chontales, according to representatives of the National
Union of Farmers and Livestock Breeders.
Health Ministry reports listed two deaths and scores of infections from
leptospirosis, [caused by a bacterium carried by the rat, in those
communities where crops of rice, beans and corn were devastated by the
rodents.
"The outbreak of Leptospirosis is under control in Rio San Juan, and we are
combating the proliferation of rats by providing rat poison to the rural
community," Health Ministry Director of Epidemiology Juan Jose Amador said.
Five tons of "Bio Rat" being shipped from Cuba is expected to arrive in one
week in Managua. From there, the rat poison will be distributed to
Chontales, Managua and Masaya, located 29 kilometers east of the capital.
Leptospirosis infections are difficult to detect in laboratories and
produce symptoms such as strong headaches, vomiting, high fever and
dizziness. Nine days after contracting the disease, the victim typically
dies from internal hemorrhaging. [The case fatality rate is actually low,
but may reach 20% in a subset of patients who develop serious disease with
jaundice and renal involvement. Subclinical cases are common. - Mod.ES
Another sporadic occurrence of this epidemic, which claimed 20 lives, arose
following the devastation of that area by Hurricane Mitch in late October
1998.
