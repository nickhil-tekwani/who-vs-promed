More than 20 000 cholera cases have been confirmed in the Lake Chad Basin states of Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon since January [2018]. In its latest epidemiological analysis of the regional cholera outbreak, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said 255 deaths have been reported since January [2018].

"This is 8 times more than the average cholera case-load in the past 4 years. Nigeria is the most affected, with 18 000 cases. The outbreak has spread into neighboring Cameroon and Niger. The major cities of Maradi in Niger as well as Yaounde and Douala in Cameroon have confirmed cholera cases. More than 5 million people are living in the outbreak areas," UNICEF said. Further, the organization said the current outbreak is characteristically similar to the 2010 epidemic which killed 2610 people and infected 63 000 in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

In Nigeria, the outbreak may spread in the 3 states of Kano, Katsina and Kaduna. In Niger, the disease is likely to spread in the Zinder and Niamey local government areas, while the cities of Douala and Yaounde are at risk of larger outbreaks in Cameroon. People in the disease-endemic areas of Cameroon and Niger are at greater risk as the 2 countries have not run any vaccination campaigns in the past few years. Heavy rains across the region have created an ideal environment for the cholera outbreak to spread.

A cholera epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 127 people since February [2018], while a further 22 have died in Niger, officials said on [Wed 15 Aug 2018]. "As many as 2100 patients are currently being treated and since February [2018] we have registered 125 deaths," said Hippolyte Mutombo Mbwebwe, health minister in the eastern Kasai region. A total of 10 more cases, including 2 deaths, were confirmed in neighbouring central Kasai, he said.

Meanwhile, in Niger the United Nations said on [Wed 15 Aug 2018], that 22 people had died from cholera in the Maradi region, close to Nigeria. It said 1351 cases had been registered including the 22 fatalities.

The cholera epidemic continues to spread in the Kasai provinces of central DRC. In Kasaï Oriental, the provincial Minister of Health puts forward a total of 125 people who died after the epidemic, in the space of 6 months.

"Since the outbreak of the epidemic in February [2018], we have recorded 125 deaths. Currently, 2100 patients are being cared for, "said Hyppolite Mutombo Mbwebwe, provincial health minister in Kasai Oriental. It was in a statement made [Wed 15 Aug 2018], to the press in Ngandajika. Only one of the 19 health zones in the province is unaffected by the epidemic. "Cholera continues to wreak havoc; 18 of the province's 19 health zones are currently affected, "added the minister. The artisanal diamond mining areas in Kasaï Oriental are the potential reservoirs of the epidemic.

Central Kasai health officials said a probable case of cholera was admitted [Wed 15 Aug 2018] at Kananga Provincial Hospital. "We have taken the samples that we intend to send to the INRB (National Institute for Biomedical Research), in Kinshasa, for in-depth examinations. But I am able, in view of the clinical signs that the patient presents, to confirm that it is cholera, "told Actualite.cd, Dr. John
Bimvulu, provincial health minister of Kasai Central.

Ten other cases with 2 deaths were confirmed in the Mwetshi Health Zone in the Dimbelenge (Central Kasai) area. To stop the epidemic, Minister Bimvulu recommends the population to strictly observe the rules of hygiene.

[5] Cholera - Nigeria (Kano)

At least 28 lives have been confirmed dead following the outbreak of cholera across Nigeria's northwest state Kano in the past seven7 months, an official said [Tue 14 Aug 2018]. The state recorded 400 suspected cases of acute watery diarrhea with 50 confirmed cases of cholera across the 33 local government areas, Kabiru Getso, state commissioner for health, told reporters in Kano city.

Out of 50 the confirmed cases, 28 deaths were recorded, he added, noting that the state had instituted several control measures to combat the outbreak. He said other measures include mounting of continuous surveillance for all epidemic-prone diseases as well as active search for cases of diarrhea and vomiting.

Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterised in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. Such outbreaks are common in Nigeria due to the poor water supply systems, especially in densely populated areas.

[6] Cholera - Nigeria (Abuja)

A cholera outbreak killed at least 7 people in the Nigerian capital Abuja over the past few days, an official said. "So far, there has been 7 deaths from across 6 communities here in Abuja while efforts are on to reverse the trend," Humphrey Okoroukwu, head of the Health Department in the capital, told Anadolu Agency on [Tue 14 Aug 2018].

In a news briefing on [Mon 13 Aug 2018], Okoroukwu had said the health workers have been dispatched to various communities to teach locals on how to manage the outbreak.

In July [2018], the country's Center for Disease Control (CDC) put death toll from the latest cholera outbreak at 116 across 12 states. The report said at least 13 006 cases have been reported in hospitals.

Cholera is a yearly phenomenon in many parts of Nigeria largely because of poor water system and improper hygiene especially in hugely populated areas.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
