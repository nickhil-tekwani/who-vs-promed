Australia: Ross River Fever Alert for South-eastern Queensland
--------------------------------------------------
An alarming outbreak of Ross River fever across southeastern Queensland has
prompted a health authority warning for holiday-makers to cover up this
Easter. The 953 cases of the mosquito-borne virus already reported to
Queensland Health in 2004 were well up on the same period of 2004, said
Communicable Diseases Unit manager Margaret Young.
"It might be a bumper year, so I encourage people to protect themselves
over the rest of autumn," Ms Young said. "The fact that we have had a lot
of rain so far means there is a risk, and people will have to work hard to
keep the number down."
In 2002, just 886 cases were reported all year, attributed to drought
conditions breaking the mosquito breeding cycle. However, 2003 was
significantly worse, with 2516 cases reported statewide. Authorities blamed
heavy rainfall in the past 4-6 weeks for the increase, although they also
said that increased awareness and testing may have pushed figures up in
recent years. The southeast corner has been hardest hit, with north and
southwest Queensland also reporting a sharp increase in cases in recent weeks.
Ms Young has warned people outdoors over Easter, particularly campers, to
be careful, with the peak season for the virus extending from February
until May. No cure is available, only prevention through measures such as
mosquito repellent, fly screens, and covering up exposed skin. Residents
have been urged to control mosquito breeding around homes by emptying water
from containers, pools, and guttering.
Only 25 to 45 percent of Ross River fever victims suffer symptoms, though
for those who do, they can be debilitating. Symptoms include fever, pain,
swelling of the joints, and a red rash affecting the trunk and limbs. Joint
pain can last up to 6 weeks, though victims usually take 4-7 months to
fully recover.

[Epidemics of benign polyarthritis were recorded in Australia as early as
1927, and the etiologic agent was isolated in 1963. Ross River virus was
shown to be a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to the genus
_Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Ross River virus is endemic in
most coastal regions of Australia and since the 1980's appears to have
extended its geographical range to include most of the island communities
of the South Pacific. The animal reservoir species are various, and humans
exhibit a significant viraemia such that some epidemics are maintained in a
human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. The mosquito vectors vary
according to the local environment. Fortunately, illness in humans --
although occasionally prolonged and painful -- is not fatal and recovery is
complete. - Mod.CP]
