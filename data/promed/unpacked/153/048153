Southern NSW barley stripe rust scare
-------------------------------------
New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has promptly
responded to a suspected outbreak of exotic stripe rust in barley in
southern NSW. The site was inspected and symptoms suggested it was
unlikely to be the exotic barley stripe rust _Puccinia striiformis_ f.
sp. _hordei_.

Samples [sent] to the Cereal Rust Laboratory at the University of
Sydney were subjected to molecular diagnostic tests which confirmed
that the pathogen was not barley stripe rust. NSW DPI's Colin Wellings
has identified the pathogen as barley grass stripe rust (_P.
striiformis_ f.sp. _pseudo-hordei_) which has been endemic in NSW
since the late 1990s. This pathogen is capable of causing minor
symptoms in certain barley varieties.

NSW grains biosecurity said barley stripe rust remains an exotic
threat to Australian barley growers. "The different forms of stripe
rusts that may occur on barley are not visibly distinguishable," they
said.

"Tests overseas indicate a majority of our commercial varieties are
susceptible [to _P. s._ f. sp. _hordei_], and grain yield losses could
approach 80 percent. The industry needs to remain alert to the
potential arrival of barley stripe rust. Early detection and prompt
reporting are the keys to limiting spread and increasing the chance of
successful containment and eradication in the case of an incursion.
All stripe rust found in barley should be reported for investigation
by DPI."

The trial operator who reported the rust was part of a network of
people across NSW involved in active surveillance for a number of
exotic grain pests and pathogens. This surveillance is part of the
Grains Farm Biosecurity Program supported by Grain Producers Australia
and Plant Health Australia.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) on cereals is caused by closely
related species and their strains of _Puccinia_ fungi that vary in
host range. Wheat stripe rust is caused by _P. striiformis_ var.
_striiformis_ which can also affect some barley varieties, triticale
and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and
stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat but
yield loss in barley crops is generally low. This pathogen is already
present in Australia.

Barley stripe rust is caused by _P. hordei_ (previously _P.
striiformis_ f.sp. _hordei_) which only affects barley. It has not
been reported from Australia and is a major quarantine concern for
national barley production. A separate strain or species (referred to
above as _P. s._ f.sp. _pseudo-hordei_) has been reported from barley
grass (_Hordeum_ species) in Australia (see link below).

Different races of the stripe rust pathogens may only attack
particular varieties of the host species. Spores are wind dispersed in
several cycles during the cropping season, and the fungi survive on
living host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons.
Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging
worldwide and continuous resistance breeding is required to keep ahead
of pathogen evolution. Efficient crop monitoring is important to
recognise any emerging new pathogen strains. In Australia, this is
carried out by the Australian Cereal Rust Control Programme which
identifies the rust pathotypes present throughout the country each
year.
