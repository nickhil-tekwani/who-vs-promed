An anthrax scare has gripped Orissa's tribal dominated Kandhamal, as
at least 12 people, including children, were affected by the dreaded
disease in Tumudibandh block of the district, official sources said.

The condition of 2 of the 12 patients at Guchua village in Gumma
Grama Panchayat, where the disease surfaced 3 days ago, was stated to
be critical, Additional District Medical Officer (Public Health),
Jatin Patnaik, said. Both the patients were admitted to hospital at
Tumudibandha, and the rest of the affected people were being treated
at their houses in isolated rooms, as the disease is highly contagious
[sic: It is not. - Mod.MHJ], Patnaik said.

The disease has created panic in the locality, but steps have been
taken to check its further spread, he said. The disease broke out in
the remote village with a population of only 120, including 48 people
from Kutia Kondh (a primitive tribe), apparently due to consumption of
rotten beef and pork, sources said. [On] receiving the information, a
health team from Phulbani, led by CDMO N C Behera, and a mobile health
team from Balliguda rushed to the village and geared up preventive
measures. All houses were disinfected with DDT and bleaching powder.
The team also collected skin smears and blood samples from the
affected people for medical examination. The villagers were also
advised not to take rotten beef and pork and to keep away from the
patients. Rotten dried pieces of beef and pork were also found in some
houses and destroyed, Dr Patnaik reported.
