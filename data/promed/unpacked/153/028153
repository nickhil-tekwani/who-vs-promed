The Press Trust of India on Tuesday [8 Oct 2013] reported that in the past few days, 15 children have died in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's [2013] toll to 358. Doctors say affected patients come from between 10 and 12 districts in the region, and are mostly the rural poor. The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.

More than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.

At least 6500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the 1st case was detected in 1978.

Gorakhpur and adjoining districts, which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas, are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.

Until 2005, doctors say that the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. But in the past 7 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.

The diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.

Doctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected. A 5th of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.

The government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region. Last week [week of 1 Oct 2013], India launched a vaccine [campaign] against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus.

"Beginning with the 1st report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states," Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine. In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.

[As with previous reports of viral encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state, there is no indication of the proportion of these cases due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections or to other, undetermined causes. In previous reports, some have been diagnosed as due to Japanese encephalitis infections and other associated with contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The massive Japanese encephalitis virus vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus.

The cause of the majority of the AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases remains undiagnosed, and one hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to find out what is going on, so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. Although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.
