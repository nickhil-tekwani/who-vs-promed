A dog suspected of rabies in Rankin Inlet was euthanized Wednesday [23 Nov 2022]. The dog resided at one of the 10-plex units near the healing facility and was displaying signs of the virus when it was euthanized by bylaw.

Due to the danger of rabies, residents who may have had contact with this dog should be examined at the health centre. "Anyone who has been bitten or scratched or had close contact with this dog should go to the local health centre and report the incident immediately," wrote the Department of Health in a news release Thursday [24 Nov 2022].

Domestic animals spending time tied up outdoors should be monitored for a change in behaviour and signs of rabies, which include behaving strangely, staggering, frothing at the mouth, choking and making strange noises. Pet owners who believe their pet had contact with this dog should contact the regional environmental health officer.

A resident in the Manila area was bitten by a fox over the weekend, almost a month after a similar incident in the same area involving a fox which later tested positive for rabies. The fox in the most recent incident has not been caught and its rabies status cannot be confirmed. The bite victim is currently undergoing treatment for possible rabies exposure.

Since this report, Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services Division of Environmental Heath (DEH) has received several additional reports of foxes acting aggressively in the area by the north end of the Ma-lel Dunes. Local health officials are urging caution to people in the area between Manila and Mad River Beach. Anyone who sees an animal acting strangely should contact DEH, which is monitoring reports in that area.

Benjamin Dolf, DEH Supervising Environmental Health Specialist, said generally it is important to use caution around wild animals, and if you encounter an animal that is sick, injured or docile do not try to approach it, help it or try to nurse it back to health.

Rabies is always present in the wildlife population throughout Humboldt County, especially foxes, skunks and bats. People who come across sick or injured animals can contact the Humboldt Wildlife Care Center, which has staff who are trained to respond.

Preventive measures against the spread of rabies in Humboldt County include avoiding contact with wild and stray animals, bringing pet food indoors at night and reporting animal bites to your county or municipal animal control officer.

If you are bitten, wash the bite(s) immediately with soap and water and go to the emergency department to seek medical treatment. It is critical that anyone potentially exposed to rabies be treated within 24 hours, and sooner is better.

Public Health officials stress the importance of fully vaccinating domestic animals against rabies, including dogs, cats and select livestock.

For questions about rabies or to report a rabid or suspected rabid animal, call Division of Environmental Heath (DEH). To report a sick or injured animal, contact the Humboldt Wildlife Care Center.

A rabies alert has been issued for a portion of the City of Live Oak. The Suwannee County Health Department issued the alert Wednesday [16 Nov 2022] following a confirmed case of rabies in a cat. The alert covers the city from US Highway 90 (Howard Street) to the north, White Avenue to the east, Helvenston Street to the south and Ohio Avenue (US Highway 129) to the west.

The rabies alert is good for 60 days and is centered in the core business district of Live Oak, containing approximately 8 blocks. In the alert, the health department warns all visitors and residents in Live Oak that rabies is present in wild animals, and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated. "The public is asked to maintain a heightened awareness as rabies is active," DOH [Department of Health] said in the alert.

DOH warns people shouldn't have a false sense of security in areas outside the named area. The health department states in the alert contact with wildlife, particularly raccoons, bats, foxes, skins, otters, bobcats and coyotes, should be avoided.

Rabies, a disease of the nervous system, is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunization.

https://scdhec.gov/news-releases/rabid-raccoon-confirmed-laurens-county-one-pet-exposed


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a raccoon found near Crape Myrtle Road and Greenwood Road in Laurens, SC has tested positive for rabies. No people are known to have been exposed at this time. One dog was exposed and will be quarantined as required in the South Carolina Rabies Control Act. The raccoon was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 16 Nov 2022 and was confirmed to have rabies on 17 Nov 2022.

Please report all animal bites, scratches, and exposures to potentially rabid animals to DHEC. "It is very important for you to seek medical attention if you have been exposed to a wild, stray, or domestic animal. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of infected animals and can be transmitted through a bite, scratch, broken skin, and the mucous membranes of your eyes, nose, or mouth. Immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "Contact your local Environmental Affairs office for further guidance."

If you believe you, someone you know, or your pets have come in contact with this raccoon or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Greenwood office during normal business hours or on the after hours and on holidays number.

It is important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. This raccoon is the 4th animal in Laurens County to test positive for rabies in 2022. There have been 77 cases of rabid animals statewide this year. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2021, one of the 101 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina was in Laurens County.

Contact information for local Environmental Affairs offices is available at http://www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices. For more information on rabies, visit http://www.scdhec.gov/rabies or http://www.cdc.gov/rabies.

South Carolina health officials announced the confirmation of rabies in a calf found near Red Feather Road and Pine Grove Road in Seneca, Oconee County. Three people were exposed and have been referred to their healthcare providers. A total of 22 cows and 21 calves in the same pasture were potentially exposed.

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility coming with owning an animal. It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, your pets, and your livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind." said Terri McCollister, Department of Health and Environmental Control's Rabies Program Team Leader.

Livestock are susceptible to rabies and all livestock should be vaccinated with USDA-approved rabies vaccinations.

There have been 79 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2022]. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year.

[7] New York (Westchester County): coyote, human exposure

There's a warning in Westchester County about a possible rabid coyote. Police said 2 women were attacked Thursday [17 Nov 2022] near a wooded area on Turkey Hill Road in North Salem. One woman was bitten several times and had to get rabies shots [These are post-exposure prophylaxis shots, to prevent rabies. - Mod.TG]. The other woman was not seriously hurt [This is very concerning because any bite or scratch or exposure to the saliva in the eye could result in exposure to the other person. - Mod.TG].

"The coyote grabbed one by the arm -- he didn't really do any damage there -- but then he went after the other lady and shredded her pants and got her leg pretty good," North Salem deputy supervisor Peter Kamenstien said.

Police believe the coyote may have rabies because the animal reportedly attacked the tires of a car when someone stopped to help. Attacking inanimate objects is a sign of rabies.

After the attack, police searched but couldn't find the animal. Residents in the area are urged to be on the lookout.

The Camden County Health Department is issuing advice to people, especially pet owners, after a resident brought in a stray cat that later tested positive for rabies. The incident occurred on 16 Nov 2022 when a Lindenwold resident discovered a stray cat exhibiting signs of infection.

The resident wrapped the animal in a cloth and brought it to the animal hospital, where it exhibited signs of rabies and was euthanized. Testing from the county health department confirmed the animal was rabid, though the only known exposures were the Lindenwold resident and veterinary staff.

Pet owners are being encouraged to keep their furry friends under direct supervision and to contact local animal control to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood.

[Rabies is a deadly disease! Deadly diseases are extremely serious situations. Rabies can be deadly to almost any mammalian species without vaccination and/or treatment.

Those headlines need to sink in to your mind and forever imprint how dangerous, serious and deadly rabies is. I have often said, please vaccinate your farm animals. Rabies vaccine in the United States (and other countries) is safe and approved for cattle, horses, sheep and even for pigs and goats. Our pets, cats and dogs also need to be protected against this disease. One does not know when they may encounter this disease through a wild animal attack, a bat or a non-vaccinated domestic animal bite.

We are blessed to have post-exposure prophylaxis for humans, but our pets and livestock are financial and emotional investments. We need to protect them because it also builds a barrier between ourselves and this disease and provides emotional well-being when it is a beloved pet protected from this disease. - Mod.TG
