Five cows have died from tick fever in recent weeks in the Northern Rivers region, leaving veterinarians pleading with producers to practise good farming biosecurity. District veterinarian Dr Phillip Kemsley confirmed that 3 cows have died from the disease on a property in the Tweed and 2 on a holding in the Lismore area.

If the disease spreads, Dr Kemsley said tick fever and cattle tick can cause the biggest economic impact on cattle production in northern Australia, because it can create the potential of large losses of animals, production losses, restrictions on trade and, a large cost of treatment. "Tick fever can move quickly, and prompt action on both properties involved in our region has prevented further losses. It's important to contact your District Vet early," he said. "Tick fever in cattle is a devastating condition causing fever, jaundice, anaemia, miscarriage, red urine, and a range of nervous signs including change in temperament, lethargy, muscle tremors, and difficulty walking. Effective treatments and prevention are available."

But Dr Kemsley added that producers needed to be aware that once cattle are affected by tick fever, "they often die soon after the onset of signs, so it is not unusual to discover cattle already dead. Tick fever is only spread between cattle by cattle ticks. The infection cannot spread from beast to beast without ticks," he said. "When cattle ticks are detected on a property, movement restrictions are put in place, and tracing of animals is undertaken to check for spread to other holdings. The NSW Department of Primary Industries will supervise a cattle tick eradication program, which can run for over 12 months."

General manager of North Coast Local Land Services Louise Orr urged livestock producers to be on the lookout for ticks and anything unusual. "These recent outbreaks are a reminder to cattle producers to be vigilant with biosecurity practices to prevent introducing diseases, pests, and weeds onto our farms."

Dr Kemsley recommends holding all new cattle in a yard or small paddock for a week and treating for internal and external parasites. "As weeds can be spread in cattle manure, holding in a small area allows cattle to pass any weed seeds in a confined area. Being confined also helps cattle to settle into their new environment," he said.

If you see signs suspicious of tick fever after hours, contact the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline. For further information, contact North Coast Local Land Services.

[Tick fever is a cattle disease caused by any one of the following blood parasites: - _Babesia bovis_, _Babesia bigemina_, and _Anaplasma marginale_. These parasites are all transmitted by the cattle tick (_Boophilus microplus_). Disease caused by _Babesia bovis_ or _B. bigemina_ is called babesiosis, often referred to as "red water". Disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_ is called anaplasmosis.

_B. bovis_ is the most important parasite, causing more than 80 per cent of outbreaks of tick fever in Queensland each year.

Clinical signs of tick fever include weakness, depression, and loss of appetite. These signs are mainly due to the associated fever and red blood cell destruction (causing anaemia). Despite the common name red water, red urine is only occasionally present and late in the course of the disease. Other clinical signs may include jaundice and neurological signs. Cattle with _B. bovis_ infections may be quite sick even in the absence of anaemia and red urine. It is difficult to diagnose tick fever based on clinical signs alone. The best way to diagnose tick fever is to send blood smears to a laboratory for examination.

Risk factors for tick fever:
- Breed. British, European, and other _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds are more susceptible to tick fever caused by babesia organisms than Brahman and _Bos indicus_ breeds. Cross breeds (_B. taurus_ x _B. indicus_) have intermediate susceptibility determined by the percentage of each breed type. All breeds, including _B. indicus_ breeds, are highly susceptible to disease caused by _A. marginale_.
- Age. There is a strong link between age and resistance. Most outbreaks occur in animals 18 to 36 months of age. Calves exposed to tick fever organisms between 3 to 9 months of age rarely show clinical signs and develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.
- Exposure. Cattle born and raised in areas where cattle ticks are endemic can develop natural immunity through exposure to ticks infected with tick fever. However, exposure of calves to ticks infected with tick fever (and subsequent development of protective immunity) can be highly unpredictable. Exposure is influenced by factors such as breed, season, and tick-control strategies.

All cattle raised in areas free from cattle ticks are at risk of tick fever if introduced into areas where ticks are present.

The most likely tick fever here is caused by the organism _Babesia bigemina_.

Tick fever should be suspected in animals showing haemoglobinuria, elevated temperature, jaundice and anaemia. _Babesia bovis_ (Argentina) infections often cause nervous symptoms, followed by coma and death. Splenomegaly at necropsy is characteristic. The animal and its herd mates should be examined for ticks https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/about-us/services/laboratory-services/veterinary/tick-fever-of-cattle.

The 1st signs of illness usually occur 8-10 days after tick attachment for _B. bovis_ and 14-20 days for _B. bigemina_. The severity of the illness can range from a mild fever to one which is rapidly fatal. Clinical illness is rarely seen in animals less than 9 months of age.

- At first, the membranes around the eye are bright red but over a few days turn pale, or even white, as anaemia develops.
- The animal's appetite is depressed, and there is a rapid loss in condition. In dairy cows, a drop in milk production occurs at the same time as the fever develops.
- Nervous signs are a feature of infection with _B. bovis_. Circling and personality changes such as aggression are often seen.
- The urine is often red or brown to almost black, hence tick fever is sometimes referred to as "red water".
- Pregnant cows may abort.
- Infected bulls may be temporarily infertile for 6-8 weeks.

An animal may die at any time from about 3 days to 4 weeks after the onset of the illness. The fever usually lasts for about a week, and the course of the disease is about 3 weeks. In animals that survive, the appetite gradually returns to normal, but recovery is slow and may take weeks or even months. Treatment with specific drugs usually results in rapid recovery if given early, but animals showing clinical signs and left untreated frequently die.

In cattle-tick endemic areas in northern Australia, tick fever vaccine is regularly used to protect cattle. The vaccine has a short shelf life as it contains living organisms so must be used straight away. It is available from the Tick Fever Centre at Wacol Qld: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/58289/Tick-fever.pdf.

I have included some information about the disease these ticks carry. This becomes a huge cost to the producer, is very hard on the animals, and so much easier to prevent than to treat. It is critical to follow the regulations and not spread the tick or any diseases it may likely carry. - Mod.TG
