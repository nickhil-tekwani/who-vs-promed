[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 continues to spread in West and Central Africa. Since 2015, countries that have reported the disease are Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and now Togo.

According to the OIE WAHID database only Burkina Faso has reported the HPAI outbreak that started in February 2015 as resolved. The final report was sent to the OIE on 12 Aug 2016. See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000020749_20160816_163621.pdf

The rest of the affected countries in the region continue to fight the disease. In July (2016), FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organization) called for increased vigilance in the region and communicated that they are "working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to offer member-countries assistance, such as risk assessments, contingency planning, technical advice and laboratory material. FAO is also helping with investigating potential avian influenza cases in animals and humans and locating the source of infection" (http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/424832/icode/. See posting 20160713.4343176).

All outbreaks of HPAI reported from 1 Jan 2015 to date can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/jybc7j6 (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in).
