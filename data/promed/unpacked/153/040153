It is worth noting that the 2 outbreaks are
separated by a distance that is almost the
length of the country. Of course, from what I
could piece together from the translated text in
the first piece, only 18 of 852 susceptible
animals were destroyed and buried. If this is the
case, the animal health authorities have chosen
to live with the disease rather than eradicate
it. Such an approach would be unusual because
according to the OIE report in the 2nd part of
this posting, the previous reported outbreak was
in 2001. If it has been 6 years and there are
only one or 2 cases of FMD, depopulation and
stamping out would likely be the best approach.
However, the approach indicated in these 2
reports does not seem to suggest that
depopulation will be used as a strategy. We
would, of course, appreciate some insight into these observations. - Mod.PC]
