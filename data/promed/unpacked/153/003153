Two Los Angeles County residents died from hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome this summer 2006, but it was unclear where the rodent-spread
disease was contracted, public health officials said Tuesday [15 Aug 2006].
One person, whose name, age and gender was unavailable, died in July
2006 after camping in Mono County, an area where rodents are known to
have the virus, according to the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services.
Then, on 6 Aug 2006 an Antelope Valley youth died after complaining
of fever, headache, shortness of breath and a cough, health officials said.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is spread by infected rodents through
urine, droppings or saliva. Humans can contract the disease by
breathing air in areas contaminated with rodent excrement, but
hantavirus cannot be transmitted from person to person, public health
officials said [with the exception of Andes hantavirus in South
America, which has been shown to be transmitted from an infected
person to a susceptible one - Mod.TY]. The disease, primarily spread
by the deer mouse [_Peromyscus_], was 1st recognized in 1993.
Only 2 other cases in Los Angeles County have been documented, and
both patients caught the disease in other parts of the state or
outside California.
To prevent the illness, people should seal up rodent entry holes,
trap rats and mice, clean up rodent food sources and take precautions
when cleaning rodent-infested areas, according to health officials.
