It's been a rough flu season. There has been a spike in human flu cases in Washington and across the country. The Washington State Department of Health reports at the end of December [2017], there had been at least 29 deaths from influenza. But people aren't the only one susceptible to the flu. So is your dog.

Veterinarians are warning pet owners that a spike in dog flu cases has raced across the country. Canine influenza has been reported in 46 states -- including here in Washington. Dog flu, like the human flu, is passed from dog to dog through the air. Symptoms are similar to the flu that affects humans, said Critical Care Veterinarian Meghan Harmon of Blue Pearl Seattle. "Things like coughing, sneezing, not eating, lethargy and fever (are symptoms)," Harmon said.

Harmon said only about 2 cases of confirmed dog flu have been reported in Washington dogs. However, dogs traveling to other areas of the country for shows or other reasons where the flu is prevalent have a good chance of getting sick. "Once they're exposed, there's a good chance they'll get infected," Harmon said.

Around 80 percent of dogs exposed to canine influenza get the virus. Most dogs recover in 2 to 3 weeks. But, like humans, older dogs and dogs with weakened immune systems can come down with more serious health problems as a result. Less than 10 percent of dogs that get the disease will die, Harmon said. The virus is not transferable to humans.

The disease is often mistaken with Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common infection for dogs.

If you suspect your dog has the canine flu, keep it quarantined from other pets. If it has a high fever, such as 104 or 105, it's a good idea to call your vet. And if you think your dog has the flu and you plan on taking them in, please call ahead, Harmon says. "The disease is spread by aerosol and it lives on surfaces for hours," Harmon said, mentioning dogs with the flu will be put into quarantine at the vet.

Is your pup sneezing, coughing or not acting like himself? He may have dog flu. Cases of canine influenza have been popping up around the country, including states like Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania and now Canada -- and it's highly contagious among dogs.

"They were 1st recognized in greyhounds around 2003, and they've since been diagnosed in over 36 states," Dr. Kyle Frandle, a veterinarian at Los Gatos Dog and Cat Hospital, told Mercury News in California. "Experts feel dog flu is now endemic in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Florida and now here in California. There's some controversy over where it originates from; some experts think it came from horse influenza and some think from avian influenza."

Canine influenza can't infect humans, but it can be dangerous for dogs and might even lead to death, with a mortality rate of 10 percent, if not treated, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Some vets, however, are calling the panic unwarranted. After Fox News published an initial report of the disease spreading in 46 states, one Washington doctor refuted that claim, writing in a blog post said it wasn't time to panic yet.

"There has been no serious increase in flu cases on the west coast, and no confirmed cases reported in Washington for over 2-years," Dr. Mark Kummer, who works at Fairhaven Veterinary Hospital, wrote.

Still, several states are seeing an increase in cases. One pet hospital near San Francisco, United Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Hospital, saw over 50 cases in 2 weeks, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The disease is transmitted "through droplets or aerosols containing respiratory secretions from coughing, barking and sneezing," according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. "Dogs in close contact with infected dogs in places such as kennels, groomers, day care facilities and shelters are at increased risk of infection."

If you notice symptoms in your dog, like coughing, sneezing, fever, decreased appetite and nasal discharge, you should take them to the vet to get tested. The symptoms could mean a different illness, and so a test is the only way to know for sure.

The illness has even been spotted in Canada, where 2 dogs in southwestern Ontario had tested positive, the Toronto Sun reported on [Tue 9 Jan 2018].
