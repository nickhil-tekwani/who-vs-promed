The [parasitic infection] canine leishmaniasis is currently threatening 1 million dogs in the south of France. To date, about 40 000 dogs have already been found to be infected. The alert concerns 14 departments including 2 in Corsica, since the affected area increased throughout 2015.

The disease can also affect humans (40 cases reported each year) and other mammals. It is transmitted through the bites of flying insects (phlebotomus sand flies).

The symptoms: weight loss, skin problems, nose bleeds, abnormally long claws. The disease leads to a deterioration of the general
condition of the animal. Without proper treatment, the life expectancy of [an infected] dog is short.

Screening is undertaken by veterinarians performing a simple blood test. For dogs who live in the departments concerned, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, prevention is imperative and indispensable.

The month of February is specifically dedicated to the fight against canine leishmaniasis. Throughout the month, owners will receive from their veterinary clinicians information on the disease and advice on its prevention and treatment. Screening, when positive, allows timely treatment. Owners will also be given tips to prevent transmission of the parasite. According to experts, vaccination would be the best strategy to contain [the spread of infection].

[Canine leishmaniasis (CanL, also Leishmaniosis), among OIE's listed diseases, is defined in OIE's Manual (chap 2.01.08. update 2014) as follows: "Leishmaniosis is not a single entity but comprises a variety of syndromes caused primarily by at least 16 _Leishmania_ species affecting humans, transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the genera _Phlebotomus_ and _Lutzomyia_. Leishmaniosis is
associated with and limited by the geographic distribution of its sandfly vectors. 15 nosogeographical entities have been classified worldwide, of which 13 have an established or putative zoonotic nature."

The Manual adds: "In recent years, the number of regions becoming leishmania-endemic has grown significantly, accompanied by an increased number of animal and human cases. Dogs are commonly affected by _L. infantum_ and _L. chagasi_ (now regarded as synonyms), which causes a chronic viscero-cutaneous disease in this host. Asymptomatic infection in dogs is widespread and contributes to maintaining the long-term presence of the parasite in endemic regions. The clinical appearance and evolution of leishmaniosis is a consequence of complex interactions between the parasite and host immune response. The outcome of infection depends on the ability of host macrophages to effectively destroy the parasite."

In Europe, CanL is notifiable in Greece, and at the municipality level in the endemic regions of Italy, Portugal, Turkey and autonomous regions in Spain. It is not notifiable in France; nor is human leishmaniasis notifiable there. France's annual reports to the OIE identify this disease entity as "present" without quantitative or any additional information. The source and basis of the figures included in the media report above is requested.

In the EU, 2 parasites are known as endemic, namely _Leishmania infantum_, which causes zoonotic visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans and the domestic dog (the reservoir host), and _L. tropica_, which causes anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The natural vector of _L. tropica_ occurs in southern Europe. Periodic disease outbreaks elsewhere should be easily contained by surveillance and prompt treatment, unless dogs or other synanthropic mammals prove to be reservoir hosts. The northward spread of _L. infantum_from the Mediterranean region will depend on whether climate and land cover permit the vectors to establish seasonal biting rates that match those of southern Europe. Increasing dog travel poses a significant risk of introducing _L. infantum_ into northern Europe.

The domestic dog is the only reservoir host of major veterinary importance, and in Europe there is a large market for prophylactic drugs and treatment of canine leishmaniasis caused by _L. infantum_. Domestic cats might be secondary reservoir hosts of _L. infantum_ in southern Europe, because they are experimentally infectious to sandflies, and natural infections can be associated with feline retroviruses.

The above and additional information pertaining to Europe can be found in Ref 1. For information on the requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals, please refer to section C in the chapter 2.01.08 "Leishmaniosis" in OIE's Manual, where additional information on the disease may be found as well: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.08_LEISHMANIOSIS.pdf.
