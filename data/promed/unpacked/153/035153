Summary
-------
1. There were no new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).* One new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) involving a 34-year-old man from Yunnan Province (China) was reported by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) on 23 Mar 2015 [but see item [2] below, with a new case of H5N1 reported].

2. From 2010 to 2014, 32 to 62 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) were reported to WHO annually (according to onset date). In 2015 (as of 23 Mar 2015), 89 cases were reported by WHO**, and 2 additional cases were reported by NHFPC.

3. Since the previous issue of the Avian Influenza Report, there were no new human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9). Since March 2015 (as of 23 Mar 2015), there were a total of 638 cases reported.

* Since 21 Nov 2012, WHO only publishes information on human cases with avian influenza A(H5N1) infection in "Influenza at human-animal interface: Monthly Risk Assessment Summary." Only cases of human infection with H5N1 involved in events that are unusual or associated with potential increased risks will be reported in Disease Outbreak News.

[3] Viet Nam: avian influenza H5N1
Date: Mon 23 Mar 2015

Viet Nam has diagnosed the 1st outbreak of avian H1N1 flu in humans in 2015, said Viet Nam's Ministry of Health's General Department of Preventive Medicine (GDPM) in the capital Hanoi on [Mon 23 Mar 2015].

On 14-21 Mar 2015, a total of 33 victims, who mostly are students at a primary school in Central Highlands Lam Dong province, some 1050 km [about 652 mi] south of Hanoi, were reported with symptoms of fever, coughing, and running nose, stated the GDPM.

Samples of these victims have been tested to give positive results with avian H1N1 flu, which caused an epidemic in Viet Nam in 2009, Viet Nam's state-run television VTV quoted a report by the GDPM as saying on [Mon 23 Mar 2015].

The 33 above-mentioned cases are temporarily dismissed from school for isolation and medical treatment. The GDPM representative advised local authorities to cooperate with the healthcare sector for early detection of new H1N1 flu cases so that they will be isolated, diagnosed and treated promptly.

[Excerpted from WHO Western Pacific Region (http://www.wpro.who.int/vietnam/topics/avian_influenza/factsheeth5n1october2012/en/):

Viet Nam has had an active control programme against H5N1 avian influenza since the disease was first detected in 2003. This control programme has been successful, and cases of H5N1 in poultry and people have declined progressively and dramatically; however, many challenges remain.

Viet Nam's strong commitment to fight highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is the major factor behind the success for containment of the disease. Several donors and agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO), have been supporting the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) since the 1st HPAI outbreak in 2003 and continue to do so.

H5N1 is a disease agent that has spread across many borders, and Viet Nam is no exception. Viet Nam has trade links with neighbouring countries, and formal or informal trade in poultry across the borders is known to introduce new diseases or new strains in a country.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in humans are generally caused by bird-to-human transmission of the virus and are rare and sporadic events, occurring mostly in areas where the virus is circulating endemically in poultry. The majority of human cases of H5N1 infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry.

[4] Egypt: avian influenza H5N1, WHO
Date: Tues 24 Mar 2015
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/egypt-h5n1-avian-influenza-tally-is-116-for-2015-to-date-56314/


The World Health Organization (WHO) in a report from 21 Mar 2015 says the number of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in Egypt stands at 116, including 36 deaths for the period of 1 Jan 2015 to 17 Mar 2015. This accounts for 36 percent of the total H5N1 avian influenza cases reported in Egypt since 2006.

Since it was first reported in March 2006, a total of 318 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1), including 112 related deaths (case fatality rate = 35.2 per cent) have been reported in Egypt.

Since its introduction in Egypt, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds or H5N1-contaminated environments.

Though the number of cases reported is higher compared to last year [2014], the increase in the number of cases does not change the current risk status of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus that is currently circulating at the animal-human interface in the country.

From 8-12 Mar 2015, a joint high level mission was conducted in Egypt comprising representatives of WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Organisation for Animal Health, US Naval Medical Unit-3, and UNICEF on the current H5N1 situation in Egypt and to understand the current and future risks of transmission of the currently circulating avian influenza viruses. The mission reviewed the effectiveness of the recent and ongoing disease control measures implemented by both the human and animal health sectors, as well as assessed gaps in disease control policies and strategies. Recommendations were presented to the Ministry of Health and Population following conclusion of the mission.

In addition to Egypt, China has reported 3 human avian influenza A(H5N1) cases so far in 2015 [but see note above reporting an additional case, bringing the total to 4].
