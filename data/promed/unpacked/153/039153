Over 7000 pigs to be culled over swine fever in south Russia
------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities in south Russia's Stavropol Region plan to cull 7000 pigs
to prevent the spread of African swine fever, first detected 2 weeks
ago, a regional governor's spokesperson said on Monday [27 Oct 2008].

Some 2500 pigs have been already culled in the village of Gorkaya
Balka, where the fatal virus was first reported on 15 Oct 2008. Some
117 pigs died and later tests confirmed the deaths were caused by the
African swine fever virus [ASFV].

A state of emergency has been declared in the area, where 2 new
outbreaks were reported at private farms earlier on Monday [27 Oct
2008]. The area has been quarantined, and the transport of livestock,
poultry, and agricultural products has been banned.

The economic cost of the outbreaks is estimated at around 100 million
rubles (USD 3.7 million).

Outbreaks of the highly contagious virus, which was first registered
in 1903 in South Africa, are rare outside the region, but 5000 pigs
were culled or died from the virus in the summer in Russia's North
Caucasus republic of North Ossetia.

The virus does not pose a threat to humans.

[Following its initial introduction into Georgia via Abkhazia, during
the 1st quarter of 2007, ASF has been continuously spreading in the
Caucasus region, affecting Nagorno-Karabagh, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
several Russian territories.

The Stavropolskiy Kray (Stavropol) is the 5th main Russian
administrative division affected, following Chechnya, North
Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, and Orenburg (outside the Caucasus;
reportedly, wildlife affected). As of 24 Oct 2008, the total number
of outbreaks reported to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) by Russia since the start of its epizootic on 5 Nov 2007, has
reached 21; see a summary, with a map including all said outbreaks, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>
(zoom-in).

A political/ethnic map of the Caucasus, including the mentioned
Russian and non-Russian territories, is available at
<http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/waroutcomes/pics/ethnicMap.jpg>.

The 1st 2 outbreaks in Stavropol (in the Gorkaya Balka village)
started, reportedly, on 15 Oct 2008 (see ProMED-mail 20081025.3372,
covering Russia's OIE follow-up report No 6). In the said follow-up
report, the authorities informed that no culling was yet carried out,
while "stamping out" (a justifiable measure in view of the fact that
ASF cannot be controlled by vaccination) listed under "Measures to be
applied."

The currently reported application of stamping out policy (2500 pigs
already culled), and plans for additional culling following the
discovery of 2 new outbreaks, are a promising indication of the
Russian resoluteness to control ASF. - Mod.AS]
