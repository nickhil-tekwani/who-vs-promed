Earlier this year ProMED-mail carried a discussion of problems with the
availability of ribavirin, especially as it relates to medical emergencies
such as the outbreak of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone that occurred during
the first half of this year. We would appreciate information about the
current status of ribavirin availability. Information may be forwarded to
<promed@usa.healthnet.org>.
