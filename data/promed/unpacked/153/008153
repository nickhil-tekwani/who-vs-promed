Consumers have long been exposed to antibiotics in meat and milk.
Now, new research shows that they also may be ingesting them from
vegetables, even ones grown on organic farms.

For half a century, meat producers have fed antibiotics to farm
animals to increase their growth and stave off infections. Now
scientists have discovered that those drugs are sprouting up in
unexpected places.

Vegetables such as corn, potatoes and lettuce absorb antibiotics when
grown in soil fertilized with livestock manure, according to tests
conducted at the University of Minnesota.

Today, close to 70 percent of the total antibiotics and related drugs
produced in the United States are fed to cattle, pigs and poultry,
according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Although this
practice sustains a growing demand for meat, it also generates public
health fears associated with the expanding presence of antibiotics in
the food chain.

People have long been exposed to antibiotics in meat and milk. Now,
the new research shows that they also may be ingesting them from
vegetables, perhaps even ones grown on organic farms.

The Minnesota researchers planted corn, green onion and cabbage in
manure-treated soil in 2005 to evaluate the environmental impacts of
feeding antibiotics to livestock. Six weeks later, the crops were
analyzed and found to absorb chlortetracycline, a drug widely used to
treat diseases in livestock. In another study in 2007, corn, lettuce
and potato were planted in soil treated with liquid hog manure. They,
too, accumulated concentrations of an antibiotic, named
Sulfamethazine, also commonly used in livestock.

As the amount of antibiotics in the soil increased, so too did the
levels taken up by the corn, potatoes and other plants.

"Around 90 percent of these drugs that are administered to animals
end up being excreted either as urine or manure," said Holly
Dolliver, a member of the Minnesota research team and now a professor
of crop and soil sciences at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.
"A vast majority of that manure is then used as an important input
for 9.2 million hectares of (U.S.) agricultural land."

Manure, widely used as a substitute for chemical fertilizer, adds
nutrients that help plants grow. It is often used in organic farming.

The scientists found that although their crops were only propagated
in greenhouses for 6 weeks -- far less than a normal growing season
-- antibiotics were absorbed readily into their leaves. If grown for
a full season, drugs most likely would find their way into parts of
plants that humans eat, said Dolliver.

Less than 0.1 percent of antibiotics applied to soil were absorbed
into the corn, lettuce and other plants. Though a tiny amount, health
implications for people consuming such small, cumulative doses are
largely unknown.

"The antibiotic accumulation in plants is just another negative
consequence of our animal agriculture industry and not surprising
given the quantity fed to livestock," said Steve Roach, public health
program director for the non-profit Food Animal Concerns Trust.

For highly processed plants such as corn, the drugs would most likely
be removed, added Dolliver. But many food crops such as spinach and
lettuce are not processed, only washed, allowing antibiotics to remain.

"Nobody particularly eats corn or soybean directly," said Satish
Gupta, a University of Minnesota professor of soil science and study
leader. "But there are crops I am much more worried about, like
cabbage and lettuce, because these are leaves we eat directly and consume raw."

One finding that particularly worries food scientists is the
accumulation of antibiotics within potato tubers. Tubers are an
enlarged, underground stem that uptake and store nutrients from the
soil. In crops like potatoes, carrots and radishes, it is the part humans eat.

"Since these tubers and root crops are in direct contact with the
soil, they may show a greater propensity for (antibiotic) uptake," said Gupta.

Health officials fear that eating vegetables and meat laced with
drugs meant to treat infections can promote resistant strains of
bacteria in food and the environment.

Roach said "the clearest public health implication" from treating
livestock with antibiotics is the development of resistant bacteria
that reduces the effectiveness of human medicine. Past studies have
shown overuse of antibiotics reduces their ability to cure
infections. Over time, certain antibiotics are rendered ineffective.

Scientists believe antibiotics also may have contributed to the
explosive rise in asthma and allergies in children over the last 20
years. Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, following 448
children from birth for 7 years, reported that children who received
antibiotics within their 1st 6 months had a higher risk of developing
allergies and asthma.

Such health concerns led the European Union in 2006 to ban antibiotic
use as feed additives for promoting livestock growth. But in the
United States, nearly 25 million pounds of antibiotics per year, up
from 16 million in the mid 1980s, are given to healthy animals for
agriculture purposes, according to a 2000 report by the Union of
Concerned Scientists.

Livestock producers contend that the spread of resistant strains of
bacteria stems from the overuse of all medicines to treat infectious
diseases in both humans and animals. Removal of antibiotics, they
say, would only lead to increased disease in animals and reduction in
food safety.

Tainted manure can impact more than just the soil. Once applied to
the land, antibiotics can infiltrate water supplies as water seeps
through the soil into aquifers or spills into surface water due to
runoff, explained Dolliver.

"The other thing to remember is that the field is not a sterile
environment. Mice, rabbits and foxes traverse farmland while other
animals graze, all with the potential to become vectors for the
resistant bacteria organisms and spread them throughout different
animal populations," said Pat Millner, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture microbiologist based in Maryland.

The presence of antibiotics within the food chain is likely to
increase as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has permitted
greater use of controversial drugs on farm animals. For example, this
past October 2008, the FDA dropped plans to halt use of cefquinome, a
potent antibiotic, after it said in July 2008 it would push against
its use in animals.

While there are restrictions on use of raw manure in U.S. organic
farming because of concern over bacteria, no such rules are in place
regarding antibiotics or hormones. Not all organic growers use manure
with antibiotics, but many do, said Gupta. Even if a product has the
USDA organic label, it still might harbor traces of antibiotics
[Correction 6 Jan 2009: FDA was changed to USDA].

High-temperature composting of manure, designed to kill pathogens, is
required for crops certified under the USDA organic label. That could
eliminate some antibiotics. But others are resistant, and growers are
not required to monitor crops for the drugs.

"Antibiotic uptake by plants may be of particular concern to organic
crop producers. To our knowledge, there is no current plan or
standardized methodology for monitoring antibiotics in animal manure,
which is often obtained from nonorganic farms where antibiotics are
commonly used," Dolliver said in the 2007 study.

Added Gupta, "We urgently need to find some way to put guidelines in
place on organic food regarding these chemicals."

Gupta said all growers should be told that composting manure can help
reduce antibiotics. Composting decays piles of food or manure as
microbes decompose organic matter using oxygen to survive, grow and
reproduce. Heating up the material creates conditions conducive for
bacteria to break down antibiotics and pathogens.

A pilot study by USDA scientists in Maryland added straw to a beef
cattle manure pile, heating up the dense material while allowing
spaces for air to penetrate. The higher temperatures sped up the
decaying process of harmful substances.

"The process happens very rapidly; in this study, it took about 10
days," said Millner. "This is not too surprising, since antibiotics
are not a thermally stable chemical compound."

In another study, the same researchers who discovered the uptake of
antibiotics by plants tested 4 of these drugs to determine how
effective composting would be in reducing harmful chemicals in turkey
manure. After 25 days using a combination of natural heat generated
by microbial activity, 3 of the 4 antibiotics broke down under the
high energy conditions created, said Dolliver.

Composting reduced concentrations of some antibiotics by up to 99 percent.

"These findings suggest manure management can be an important
strategy for reducing the overall impact for these compounds making
their way into the environment," said Dolliver.

Many questions still remain. Currently, projects are underway to grow
crops for a full season in antibiotic laced manure, to grow them in
fields rather than greenhouses and to analyze the concentrations and
locations of the antibiotics within the plants. Researchers also want
to determine which antibiotics are more likely to be picked up, which
plants are more prone to uptake, what composting methods are most
effective in reducing harmful material in manure, and what
antibiotics may be resistant to composting.

There are serious societal implications regarding the discoveries
already made and the questions yet to be answered, Gupta concluded.

"We are a chemical society, and humans are the main users of
pharmaceutical products," said Gupta. "We need a better understanding
of what takes place when chemicals are applied to sources of food,
and we must be more vigilant about regulating what we use to grow
food and what we put in our bodies."

[In some ways, this article supports how _E. coli_ was found in the
spinach plant in 2006. However, the article and perhaps the research
does not deal with the variety of human wastes from septic systems on
farms and other rural areas that also have antibiotic residue from
pharmaceutical agents used to treat various human maladies.

I would wonder how many residues and subsequent antibiotic resistant
strains come from human beings who have not finished their
prescriptions and thus promote the development of antibiotic
resistance in bacteria. I would also wonder what percentage of actual
viruses in humans are treated with antibiotics in an effort to
prevent secondary bacterial infection and may thus be an overuse of
antibiotics and/or another mechanism of promoting antibiotic resistance.

It is always a double edged situation. If antibiotics are not used in
animals, then illnesses can and do spread through flocks and herds.
The loss of the food producing animals eventually translates into
higher food costs further increased by higher transportation costs.
However, how much blame are humans willing to take regarding their
own antibiotic use or misuse? How much are we willing to pay for food
without antibiotics? Shouldn't organics or antibiotic-free production
of animals be a choice for whomever vs. enforcing the higher cost on
all of us? How much more poverty will that create and how much more
stress on the health care system will that produce because of malnourishment?

These are all issues worthy of consideration, but as some of these
questions are points to ponder and may be rhetorical, this thread
will not become a discussion line for the questions presented here. - Mod.TG]
