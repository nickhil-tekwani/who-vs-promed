Tick paralysis: first record in Egypt
-------------------------------------
Tick paralysis caused by the secretion of toxin with saliva while taking a blood meal is an important veterinary disease, but is rare in humans. Although it has certain geographical predilections, it exists worldwide. Tick paralysis was demonstrated for the first time in Egypt among four children living in rural area at Giza Governorate.

The clinical pictures were confused with rabies; myasthensia gravis; botulism; diphtheritic polyneuropathy encountered in rural areas. The recovery of tick infesting the four little children and negative clinical and laboratory data of all diseases denoted tick paralysis.

The encountered ticks infesting their animals were _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ on dogs, _Hyalomma dromedarii_ on camels and _Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum_ and _Haemaphysalis_ sp. on goats. The case was recognized as first record of tick paralysis in Egypt.

[Tick paralysis is due to toxins in the saliva of the tick and affects humans and animals worldwide. Most cases occur in Australia and North America. There is no specific treatment. It is important that patients are examined for ticks and any tick removed.
