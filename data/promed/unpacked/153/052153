At least 10 cases of cholera have been reported in Gulu Municipality. The
secretary for health, Ms Santa Oketta, on 15 Jul 2006 identified the areas
affected by the disease as Kirombe, Kanyagoga, and Pece Pawel. She said
other 6 cases had been reported in Unyama IDP camp.
Mayor Christopher Acire urged health workers to sensitize residents on how
to contain the disease. Meanwhile, authorities in Adjumani town council
have closed over 20 eating places for lack of toilet facilities.
The town clerk, Mr Samuel Lagu, said the move was aimed at controlling the
spread of waterborne diseases, especially cholera. He said they had also
banned the sale of food items like unpacked bread, roast and boiled maize
on the roadside to ensure proper hygiene in the community.

An outbreak of severe dysentery and diarrhea on Tanzania's semi-autonomous
island of Zanzibar has resulted in the death of 7 children with another 454
admitted to hospital, a health official said on Fri 4 Aug 2006.
"Most of the cases were of severe dysentery and diarrhea but without
symptoms of cholera," said Dr Omar Suleiman, the director of information
policy in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. He said almost all the
cases registered at the Mnazi Mmoja main hospital in Stone Town originated
from the Urban District. Health officials, he said, had established that
contaminated water was to blame. Suleiman said samples of the water would
be sent to Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of mainland Tanzania.
