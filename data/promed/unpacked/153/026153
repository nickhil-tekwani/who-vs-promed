French farm minister Jean Glavany was cited as dismissing fears of a new
wave of mad cow disease [Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE at a news
conference Wednesday, saying the number of fresh cases was small and should
disappear after 2001. The new cases detected so far this year could be
traced back to events which took place before late 1996 when tough new
controls were slapped on animal feed.
It was in the second half of 1996 that the French authorities, hoping to
check the spread of the disease, banned using animal nervous tissue, ground
bone and certain internal organs in feed intended for pigs and poultry as
well as cattle. Before then, such materials were barred from cattle feed
but not products destined for pigs and poultry.
Glavany said French scientists believed the current mini-wave of new cases
was due to the accidental contamination before 1996 of cattle feed with
products intended for pigs and poultry.
France, with a cattle herd of 21 million, has recorded 56 cases of BSE
since the authorities began tracking the disease in 1990. In each case, the
entire herd of cows was killed off and their bodies burned.
In Britain, by contrast, there have been more than 175,000 cases.
