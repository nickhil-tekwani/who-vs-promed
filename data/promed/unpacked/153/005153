The aforementioned 5 cases, including 2 deaths, had already been accounted for in the previous MERS-CoV DON ([7 Nov 2014], see MERS-CoV (54): Saudi Arabia, new cases, outbreak control, WHO 20141108.2938223).

[According to the 22 Nov 2014 ECDC Communicable Disease Threats report during the period ince April 2012 through 20 Nov 2014 there have been a total of 943 cases of MERS-CoV ncluding 379 deaths reported by local health authorities worldwide.
(http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-22-nov-2014.pdf)

With the addition of the newly reported cases on 20 Nov 2014 and 22 Nov 2014, and the one reported death on 20 Nov 2014, this would increase the total number of reported cases to 945 including 380 deaths (case fatality rate of 40.2 percent). Looking at Saudi Arabia specifically, with the newly reported case on 22 Nov 2014, there have now been a total of 809 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 346 deaths (case fatality rate 42.8 percent).

Of the 5 cases reported in the above WHO update, case #1 (42 year old female nurse from Taif) was officially reported on the Saudi MOH website on 16 Oct 2014 and was most likely reported as a recovered case on 4 Nov 2014.
