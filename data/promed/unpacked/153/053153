The incidence of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning presenting to general practice is estimated to be 0.24 per 1000 persons per year in England and Wales [1,2]. Between 1992 and 2008, _C. perfringens_ was identified as the cause of 10 percent of food-borne outbreaks [2].

_C. perfringens_ causes a mild and short-lived gastrointestinal illness characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain (80 percent of cases) followed by diarrhea (more than 90 percent) [3,4]. The incubation period is usually 12 to 18 hours (range: 8 to 22 hours) [3,4]. Illness is due to an enterotoxin produced by _C. perfringens_ type A strains [5]. Outbreaks often have a high attack rate and are usually associated with mass catering and a failure of adequate food preparation procedures, including inadequate cooking or inappropriate temperature control of food after initial cooking [6-8]. Meat, meat products and poultry are commonly implicated with inadequate cooking or storage allowing growth of vegetative cells [9,10].

The outbreak we describe involved a secondary school (for children aged 13 to 18 years) in London, with 358 staff members and 897 students. On Fri 22 Mar 2013, the local Health Protection Unit was notified that 53 students and 32 staff were ill with abdominal pain and diarrhea. The onset of illness for the majority of cases was reportedly during the evening of Thu 21 Mar 2013 and the early hours of Fri 22 Mar 2013. All cases, both students and staff, appeared to have eaten lunch in the school dining hall at least once in the 2 days before becoming unwell.

On Fri 22 Mar 2013, an outbreak control team (OCT) was convened to investigate the outbreak. Our investigation aimed to determine the size and nature of the outbreak, to determine the cause, to identify any factors associated as well as to recommend control measures to this outbreak and to prevent any recurrence in future.

Methods
----------
Epidemiology:
The study population was the staff and students at the school. The study design was a retrospective cohort study, including all students and staff (cleaning, teaching and kitchen staff) attending the school on Wed 20 and/or Thu 21 Mar 2013. We defined a case as any student or member of staff with onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (any one of the following: diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) between 20 and 23 Mar 2013.

We developed an online structured questionnaire using SelectSurvey, an online commercial software used by Public Health England to develop surveys. A link to the questionnaire was distributed to all students and staff, after piloting, on Wed 27 Mar 2013 via email. All students and staff have school email accounts, and the school uses these as the main route of communication between staff, students and the school senior management team. The questionnaire was also announced on the school's intranet site with a link.

We excluded those (i) with onset of gastrointestinal symptoms (as described above) in the 7 days before 20 Mar 2013, or (ii) who had a household member with gastrointestinal symptoms in the 7 days before 20 Mar 2013.

We described cases and compared risk of illness for various food items using risk ratios (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) and Fisher's exact test. We tested the association between eating the various food items and the risk of becoming ill subsequently (for example, in the analysis of exposure to food items eaten on 21 Mar 2013, we excluded the cases with onset on 20 Mar 2013). We did not consider in the analysis students or staff who had not attended school on that day.

We calculated attack rates for exposure to each food item on the overall number of responders for the question relative to that specific food item. We applied a robust Poisson multivariable analysis, which included variables significantly associated with the occurrence of illness (p less than 0.15) to provide an adjusted risk ratio (95 percent CI). We chose the best model using the likelihood ratio test.

The questionnaire was structured so as to allow responders to report how much of each food item they had eaten (none, less than a portion, one standard portion, more than one portion). We analysed dose-response effect and tested the p value for interaction among strata with the likelihood ratio test.

Finally, we analysed the timing of responses to our questionnaire survey. All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and Stata 12.0.

Microbiology:
We collected stool specimens on Fri 22 Mar 2013 from the 19 symptomatic cases who were available because they presented to the school's general practitioner (GP). We requested the GP to obtain samples from them and send them to the Public Health England Public Health Laboratory London, the designated laboratory for the outbreak investigation. Specimens were tested for a range of organisms, including _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Escherichia coli_ O157, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _C. perfringens_, _Bacillus cereus_, norovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus and rotavirus. The specimens were also tested for the presence of _C. perfringens_ enterotoxin at the Public Health England Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pathogens.

Environmental analysis:
We conducted a kitchen inspection at the school on Mon 25 Mar 2013. Detailed information was collected on the preparation, storage and transportation processes for the food, especially those dishes served at the school at lunch on Wed 20 Mar and Thu 21 Mar 2013. A sample of rice served on 21 Mar 2013 which had been kept refrigerated by the catering company was collected and analyzed. A further visit on 26 Mar 2013 was made the following day to take hygiene control swabs, further review temperature recording charts for the main cooking pans, and to take temperatures at various points in the main cooking pans while food was cooking. Food samples were collected from some of the herbs and spices used in cooking on 20 and 21 Mar 2013 (fresh mint, nigella seeds, dried oregano and ground cumin). On 28 Mar 2013, samples of cinnamon, salt, black pepper, dried turmeric, dried star anise and coriander seeds were also collected. Other relevant foods were unavailable for sampling.

The rice sample was tested for _Enterobacteriaceae_, _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, _S. aureus_, _C. perfringens_ and _Bacillus_ sp. The herbs and spices were tested for _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _C. perfringens_.

Results
-------
We received responses from 561 of 1255 (45 percent) overall, of whom 398 of 897 (44 percent) were students and 163 of 358 (46 percent) were staff. We excluded 42 (7.5 percent, 30 students and 12 staff) based on the criteria described above. The overall attack rate was 19 percent (100/519) and was 16 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in students and staff (p=0.006). Attack rates were comparable among different staff groups (teaching, catering, cleaning, support staff; p=0.228). The majority of cases were ill between 16:00 on Thu 21 Mar 2013 and 8:00 on Fri 22 Mar 2013, with a peak at 8 to 12 hours after the lunch on 21 Mar 2013 (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL. - Mod.LL]).

The most frequently reported symptoms were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea (90/100, 75/100 and 36/100, respectively); 7 people reported fever and 3 reported bloody stools. Symptoms were short-lived. 71 of 100 cases reported symptoms for one day or less.

We had precise times of onset for 95 cases. Of these, 2 occurred before the lunch served on Wed 20 Mar 2013 (in grey in Figure 1), hence we only considered the other 93 as potentially associated with the lunch served on 20 Mar 2013 (in blue and green in Figure 1). Those who had eaten in the school dining hall on 20 Mar 2013 were 2.5 times more likely to be ill than those who had not (RR=2.5, 95 percent CI: 1.1-5.3, data not shown). No particular food item served on 20 Mar 2013, however, was strongly associated with illness in the univariable analysis.

Ten cases had an onset after the lunch served on Wed 20 Mar 2013 and before the lunch served on Thu 21 Mar 2013 (in blue in Figure 1), hence we only considered the remaining 83 cases as potentially associated with the lunch served on 21 Mar 2013 (in green in Figure 1). Overall, 425 of 435 responders declared that they had attended school on that day, and 10 responders declared that they had not. Eating in the canteen was strongly associated with increased risk of illness (p=0.001). All the cases with onset after the lunch on 21 Mar 2013 had eaten in the canteen that day (attack rate: 100 percent).

Those who ate chicken balti on 21 Mar 2013 were 16 times more likely to be ill (RR=15.9; 95 percent CI: 8.2-30.6) than those who did not, and those eating items served with the chicken (raw red onions, tomatoes and coriander rice), as well as soup and mango coulis, were also more likely to be ill (Table 1). When asked whether they had eaten any chicken, 64 cases (77 percent reported they ate chicken, 9 reported they had not, and 10 did not respond. In the multivariable analysis, the only risk that remained was for chicken balti, with those eating it 19 times more likely to be ill, taking account of the other variables (Table 2).

We found a strong dose-response effect for eating increasing amounts of chicken balti. The RR of illness went from 14.5 among those who reported eating less than one portion of chicken, to 19.2 among those who had a standard portion, up to 23.1 among those who had more than one portion (p for interaction less than 0.001; Table 3) after adjusting for the other food items considered in the multivariable model.

Finally, we found that 73 percent of the questionnaires (412/561) were completed during school hours on the day the survey was launched (Figure 2). No new cases were reported after 23 Mar 2013. By Mon 25 Mar 2013, only 9 students and one kitchen staff were still off sick, and by Thu 28 Mar 2013, symptoms had resolved in all those affected, and all had returned back to school or work.

All 19 stool specimens tested positive for _C. perfringens_. Isolates from 18 of 19 patients were found to have the enterotoxin gene, and all 18 enterotoxigenic isolates were undistinguishable by molecular typing (fAFLP CLP.39), which was indicative of a common source. 17 stool specimens also tested positive for _C. perfringens_ enterotoxin. No other pathogens were detected in the stool samples.

On kitchen inspection, there was no evidence of poor hygiene or poor temperature control during the preparation of food. The temperatures of the pans used for cooking were reviewed and found to be satisfactory. The kitchen's logbooks for temperature recordings from the pans for Wed 20 and Thu 21 Mar 2013 were reviewed and also found to be satisfactory. No pathogens were isolated from the food samples examined (rice, herbs and spices). The hygiene control swabs were negative for _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _Enterobacteriaceae_.

Discussion and recommendations
--------------------------------
We found that eating chicken balti was the likely cause of this outbreak of _C. perfringens_ in a large secondary school in London. Microbiological analysis confirmed that _C. perfringens_ was the causative organism in this outbreak. We could not establish what factors may have contributed, as environmental investigations revealed satisfactory processes and procedures. The kitchen inspection and the review of the cooking pan temperature recordings revealed no evidence of poor hygiene or poor temperature control during the preparation of food. An inadequate temperature control of food after initial cooking may have contributed to this outbreak.

One of the main challenges in this investigation was the lack of appropriate food samples from food items served at the school on Wed 20 Mar 2013 and Thu 21 Mar 2013. Although it was not possible to conclusively identify underlying factors contributing to the outbreak, the epidemiological study was very useful to pinpoint the cause of the outbreak as the chicken balti dish.

The chicken balti was prepared on Thu 21 Mar 2013 in the morning. The chicken, which was delivered fresh on the same morning raw and pre-diced from the suppliers, was fried in a big kitchen pan with vegetables and sauce ingredients on the premises. It was kept hot in the pan until serving, and subsequently placed on the hot counter of the dining hall for serving. The garnish, including raw red onion, tomato, fresh coriander and nigella seeds, was added on top of the chicken balti before serving. Once serving started, the garnish would have mixed in with the chicken balti and it would have been unlikely that the 2 items would have been eaten separately.

Chicken was the likely source of the outbreak, as is often the case with _C. perfringens_ outbreaks [5]. However, _C. perfringens_ can also be found in spices and herbs sampled from production and retail premises in the United Kingdom [11-13]; spices and herbs have been linked to food poisoning outbreaks in the past [11]. The garnish, therefore, cannot be ruled out as the potential vehicle of the outbreak. The fresh coriander, in particular, was not available for sampling. The nigella seeds tested negative for _C. perfringens_.

We limited our investigation to the food items eaten in the school canteen on 20 and 21 Mar 2013. From the information received from the school, we knew that the outbreak came from a point source, had an extremely rapid onset, and symptoms were short-lived. This directed our suspicions towards a bacterial toxin or a viral infection, all with short incubation periods. We felt that investigating food items eaten in the canteen over 2 days back in time would have rendered the questionnaire unnecessarily long, hindering response rates. We also considered that those responses would have been subject to considerable recall bias.

Our case definition included illness occurring on 20 Mar 2013, and we did observe 5 cases who were ill on that day and 8 who were ill during the evening or early hours of morning before the lunch on 21 Mar 2013 (Figure 1). We can speculate that respondents were ill for other reasons or that they recalled the days incorrectly. It is also possible that some of the food items consumed on 20 Mar 2013 might have been cross-contaminated in the kitchen by food to be served on 21 Mar 2013. This notion is strengthened by the fact that one of the 19 positive faecal specimens came from a student who had been ill in the morning of Thu 21 Mar 2013, and the strain isolated from this specimen was the same as that isolated from all the other specimens. This makes it highly unlikely that this early case was unrelated to the outbreak. It is also unlikely that this, or any other of the early cases, were responsible for contaminating the food. Students do not come in contact with food until it is served at the counter by catering staff. None of the catering or cleaning staff were ill before the afternoon of 21 Mar 2013.

The strength of the outbreak investigation was defined by the rapidity required for the public health response and coordination across multiple organizations. The weakness of the investigation was the retrospective nature of the kitchen inspection, which provided a limited picture of the food transport, storage and preparation processes that occurred on site on a specific day. A key strength was the speed with which the outbreak control team was set up and a meeting organized on the afternoon of Fri 22 Mar 2013. This occurred within 60 minutes of the outbreak being notified to the local Health Protection Unit. In addition, the prompt collection of stool samples on Fri 22 Mar 2013 afternoon provided a rapid microbiological diagnosis.

An interesting aspect of the investigation has been the high rate of completion of the questionnaires using smartphones. Figure 2 shows how almost 3/4ths of the questionnaires were completed during school hours on the day the survey was launched. Currently, however, the tool we use to develop questionnaires does not have templates to build surveys specifically for smartphones, and responders had to scroll and zoom the questions on their phones in order to complete it. The survey could have been made more accessible and readable to the responders if a specific tool to develop questionnaires for smartphones had been available.

It would have been useful to have a question in the survey asking which device participants had used to complete the questionnaire. This is a limitation of the study. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggested that the majority of participants had used smartphones. No laptops or tablet computers are allowed in the school for security reasons, and the Deputy Head reported to us that teachers had observed the students completing the questionnaires on their phones during lesson time and break time. The school has computer rooms, but they are supervised by teachers and are only open for private use at lunch time and after school. Our analysis showed that most questionnaires were completed in the morning. The teachers reported that approximately 30 to 40 students overall used the computer room on 27 Mar 2013.

Our previous experience with similar school outbreaks is that it is very difficult to achieve a good response rate, and the process of data collection can take days and several reminders. This delay increases the potential for recall bias among late responders and reduces the possibility of setting up public health interventions. In the outbreak presented here, no reminders were necessary, and the responses collected in one day were sufficient to identify the cause of the outbreak.

This investigation evidenced the need of an assessment of smartphone technology, and of other technologies, as a data collection tool in outbreak settings. Survey participants use a range of devices to complete online questionnaires. Which device is being used is an important question that should be included, to assess which data collection tools and devices perform best under different outbreak circumstances and settings.

In view of the fact that we could not find any issues with the kitchen or the food preparation, but given that poor food preparation practices are the contributing factor in the majority of _C. perfringens_ foodborne outbreaks [2], we felt it was still worthwhile recommending to the school/catering company (i) reviewing standards and procedures to ensure adequate heat penetration in bulk cooking processes and adequate temperature control of food after initial cooking, and (ii) reviewing the preparation, storage and serving of raw garnishes.

Our main recommendation for the Health Protection Agency (as of 1 Apr 2013) Public Health England, and other health agencies is to explore opportunities for using smartphone technology for distributing questionnaires. There is evidence that smartphones are being used for data collection and surveillance purposes with good effect [14,15]. As many people now have access to mobile devices such as smartphones, this would provide an alternative distribution channel for questionnaires, which may improve the speed and completeness of response rates in future epidemiological studies.

Finally, we recommend an assessment of the validity of different data collection tools, including smartphones, in different outbreak settings.

Regarding the chicken balti, balti (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_(food)) is a type of curry served in a thin, pressed steel, flat bottomed but wok-like "balti bowl." It is served in many restaurants in the United Kingdom. The consensus appears to be that the term refers to the pot in which the curry is cooked rather than to any specific ingredient or cooking technique, although it is stated that it is cooked until the cooking liquid has largely evaporated. Where the Balti style of cooking originated is uncertain; some believe it to have been invented in Birmingham, England, while others believe it originated in the northern Pakistani region of Baltistan in Kashmir, from where it spread to Britain. - Mod.LL
