Human anthrax, Uganda [3 Feb - 23 May 2018]
--------------------------------------------
Event Description
Uganda has been experiencing recurrent outbreaks of anthrax since February 2018, with 4 districts being affected. In the latest event that occurred in week 20 (week ending 20 May 2018), Kiruhura District in the western region has reported an outbreak of anthrax in humans, with a concurrent epizootic (outbreak in the animal population). As of [23 May 2018], a total of 22 human cases of cutaneous anthrax have been reported in Engari Sub-county, with no deaths. A total of 35 heads of cattle from 16 farms have reportedly died of the disease. Of 18 animal samples collected, 7 tested positive on anthrax rapid diagnostic test. Test results of 9 human and 15 animal samples are awaited.

On [21 May 2018], a cluster of 3 suspected human cases of cutaneous anthrax was reported in Zombo District in the northern region. The case patients, 3 children from one family, presented to the district hospital with skin lesions typical of an anthrax infection. Swab samples from the skin lesions have been collected and shipped to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). The test results are still pending.

On [20 Apr 2018], a cluster of 7 case-patients from Kaplopwotow village, Kween District in the eastern region presented to the local health facility with skin blisters and oedema of the upper limbs. The case patients reportedly participated in skinning, handling and/or eating a dead cow, alongside other people. As of [21 May 2018], a total of 48 human cases (with no deaths) have been reported. Most of the cases have the cutaneous form of the disease, a few have gastrointestinal features and one inhalation. A total of 10 cows have reportedly died of the disease, 4 of them within the same kraal in Kaplopwoto village.

On [5 Apr 2018], an outbreak of cutaneous anthrax was confirmed in Arua District (bordering Zombo) in northern Uganda (Weekly Bulletin 17). The outbreak emerged on [3 Feb 2018] in Rhino Camp Sub-county (a refugee settlement). A total of 10 cases (one confirmed, 7 probable and 2 suspected) were reported, with no deaths. No new cases have since been reported.

Between [3 Feb and 23 May 2018], a cumulative total of 83 suspected human cases of anthrax (with 0 deaths) has been reported from 4 districts: Kween (48), Kiruhura (22), Arua (10), and Zombo (3). In-depth epidemiologic and ecological investigations are ongoing and further updates on these events will be provided as information becomes available.

Public Health Actions
- National multi-disciplinary rapid response teams from the Ministry of Health and the Veterinary Office have been deployed to the affected districts (except Zombo) to conduct outbreak investigation and support local response.
- Approximately 600 people in Kiruhura District have been started on post-exposure prophylaxis, following consumption of meat from carcasses and participating in skinning/handling carcasses.
- Active surveillance has been instituted in the affected districts for humans and animal cases. Healthcare workers have been orientated on the basic epidemiology and prevention of the disease, aimed to improve case detection and appropriate pre-referral care, including infection prevention and control.
- Communication and social mobilization to sensitize affected communities on anthrax prevention and control is ongoing.
- Animal burial teams have been activated and are conducting disposal of carcasses.
- Case management is ongoing in the local health facilities.

Situation Interpretation
Four districts from different parts of Uganda have experienced/are experiencing anthrax outbreaks. No apparent links have been established between the events. The disease is being propagated by a well-known traditional practice of eating meat of animals that have died of unknown causes or slaughtered due to ill-health. All the cases in these outbreaks either participated in skinning, handling and/or eating meat from carcasses. Intensive community sensitization and health promotion/preventive interventions need to target this practice at community level in order translate the One Health strategy into practice.

One effective strategy to control anthrax in humans is mass vaccination of livestock, especially during epidemics. In Uganda, the cost of vaccinating animals against anthrax (and other diseases) is borne by the farmers. This policy has not been effective in controlling livestock diseases, including anthrax. This policy needs to be reviewed, particularly during epidemics. There is a need for a comprehensive control strategy and plan embracing both the public health and animal sectors to control the ongoing outbreaks, with emphasis on community engagement and animal health interventions, as well as strengthening public and animal health surveillance, including community-based surveillance.

[There is an excellent map of Uganda in this report showing where the outbreaks are occurring in 4 different and separate parts of the country. This report is a sound summary of the events to date, and the response.

As they point out, the optimum control response of livestock vaccination -- a tried and long-proven methodology -- is ineffective as the cost has to be covered by the livestock owners, though it is a very cheap but effective vaccine. This needs to be reviewed ASAP. The last sentence should be printed out and pinned on the ministry office walls: "There is a need for a comprehensive control strategy and plan embracing both the public health and animal sectors to control the ongoing outbreaks, with emphasis on community engagement and animal health interventions, as well as strengthening public and animal health surveillance, including community-based surveillance." - Mod.MHJ
