The New Mexico Department of Health [NMDOH] has joined in the
investigation of 3 heroin users hospitalized with what may be wound
botulism. Botulism is a rare but potentially fatal illness, and wound
botulism is caused by the toxin produced from a wound infected with a
botulism bacterium. The 3 people are hospitalized in Texas and are
believed to have used contaminated heroin.

"All healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion
for botulism in any patient presenting with the signs and symptoms
suggestive of the disease, particularly if they have a history of
injection drug use," NMDOH secretary Dr Catherine D Torres said. The
NMDOH is working on the investigation with colleagues in Texas and at
the CDC.

The city of El Paso Department of Public Health is investigating
another suspected case of wound botulism, bringing the total number of
patients so far to 4, said Armando Saldivar, a spokesman for the
department. The recent case involves an injection drug-user with a
history of black tar heroin use, Saldivar said Tue 6 Sep 2011.

Last week [week of 29 Aug 2011], health officials reported that 3
people with wound botulism were hospitalized in El Paso. They also
were heroin users. Health authorities suspect that the source of the
botulism is a tainted batch of black tar heroin from Mexico.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_
contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in
vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug
users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject
subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to
infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound
botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a
gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly
in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally
injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The
local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents
("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the
_C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of
wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the
injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,
flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the
severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early
in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results
of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical
debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse
after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl
penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of
both foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by
toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis
and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the
presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine
transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
