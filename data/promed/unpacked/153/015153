More than 841 acres of cocoa in St. Mary have been treated under the Frosty Pod Rot Management Programme. Minister of Industry and Agriculture Audley Shaw said [at the launch of the International Year of Plant Health (ProMED-mail post 20190206.6303482) on Wed 22 Jan 2020] that 288 farmers have benefited. The programme is part of government efforts to revive the cocoa industry and recover from the losses caused by frosty pod rot [which has been plaguing cocoa farmers in recent years].

Shaw said the programme has been reaping positive results. "There has been an increase in yields where the programme has been implemented." Focus was placed on cultural control, chemical control, public awareness, research and development, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation. Jamaica's cocoa is recognised by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Over the last 5 years, there has been an annual average [production] of approximately 255 tonnes [281 tons], [down from] approximately 368 tonnes [406 tons].

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease that was originally identified in Ecuador in 1917 and spread rapidly to other countries in Latin America during the 1970s. It can cause complete yield loss and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production in the region. FPR reached the northern boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. FPR was detected for the 1st time outside of Latin America in 2016 in Jamaica's Clarendon parish (ProMED-mail post 20161004.4534271).

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies (shrivelled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores, giving affected pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Conventional control measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in parts of Brazil and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both pathogens also pose a potential threat to cocoa-growing areas in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.

In Jamaica, an initial response to FPR by the Ministry of Agriculture, to simply prune affected trees, was controversial (ProMED-mail post 20191010.6720797) due to the damage done to plantations and its lack of effectiveness. The new integrated approach described above appears much improved.
