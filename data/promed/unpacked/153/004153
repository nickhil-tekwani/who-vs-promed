West Nile Virus Activity - USA, 3 Oct to 9 Oct 2001
---------------------------------------------------
The following report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data
reported to CDC through ArboNET and verified by states and other
jurisdictions as of Tue 9 Oct 2001.
During the week of Wed 3 Oct to Tue 9 Oct 2001, no human cases of WNV
encephalitis were reported. During the same period, WNV infections were
reported in 323 crows, 108 other birds, and 5 horses. A total of 51
WNV-positive mosquito pools were reported in 5 states (Georgia, Kentucky,
Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania).
During 2001, 25 human cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in New
York (6), Connecticut (5), Maryland (5), Florida (4), New Jersey (4), and
Georgia (1); one death occurred in Georgia. Of these, 13 (52%) cases
occurred in females, median age was 71 years (range: 37--81 years), and
dates of onset ranged from 13 Jul to 11 Sep 2001.
A total of 3383 crows and 1299 other birds with WNV infection were reported
from 25 states and the District of Columbia; 113 WNV infections in other
animals (all horses) were reported from 11 states (Alabama, Connecticut,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia); and 671 WNV-positive mosquito pools were
reported from 14 states (Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island).
Additional information about WNV activity is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>.
[The MMWR Update is consistently under-reporting the number of human cases
of West Nile virus infection. An eighth case of human infection in Florida
was reported by the Florida Department of Health on Thu 4 Oct 2001, and a
ninth case on Wed 10 Oct 2001; see below. - Mod.CP

Florida Reports Ninth Human Case of West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: The Florida Department of Health announced today that the
ninth human encephalitis case caused by the West Nile (WN) virus has been
reported in a 36-year-old female resident of Leon County. Due to previous
WN activity, Leon County has been under a medical alert since July.
Health officials want all citizens living in counties under the medical
alert to be on heightened awareness. A total of 49 counties are included in
this alert: Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Citrus, Clay, Collier,
Columbia, Dade, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden,
Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Highlands, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson,
Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Marion, Martin, Monroe,
Nassau, Okaloosa, Pasco, Putnam, Santa Rosa, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter,
Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia, Wakulla, Walton and Washington counties.
Remember, all mosquito-born illnesses are preventable. Even though the
weather is changing, the Department of Health is still urging all
Floridians to take precautions against mosquito bites:

Ninth Human Case of West Nile Virus in Florida
----------------------------------------------
State health officials confirmed on Wed 10 Oct 2001 the first human case of
the West Nile virus infection in Leon County in a 36-year-old woman. The
woman, who lives on the east side of town beyond Capital Circle, developed
symptoms sometime in mid-September, health officials said. She went to her
doctor but was not hospitalized. "She certainly had a brain infection but
seems to be handling her (condition) relatively well," said Dr. Carina
Blackmore, a regional epidemiologist with the state Department of Health.
The woman, whose name was not released because of patient confidentiality,
is the ninth and youngest person in the state to come down with West Nile
virus since July 2001, when a 73-year-old Madison County man became the
first person in the state to contract the illness.
The woman with West Nile virus infection is the second Leon County person
to become ill with a mosquito-transmitted disease this year. In August, an
8-month-old girl was hospitalized with eastern equine encephalitis.
With days getting cooler and shorter, mosquitoes are becoming less active,
Blackmore said. But because some mosquitoes survive the winter, it's
possible there will be isolated cases of mosquito-transmitted diseases in
coming months, she said.

Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in North Carolina Not Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Some additional data on the suspected West Nile virus infected patient. The
same acute serum specimen tested by the commercial lab for West Nile virus
was received by the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health, and
tested by IFA; results were negative for flavivirus IgM, and verified a low
titer (? value) IgG. Convalescent sera obtained about 1 month later
revealed persistently absent IgM, and a stable (low) IgG titer.
These results confirm earlier suspicions that the initial serologic
response represented evidence of pre-existing flavivirus infection
(probably yellow fever vaccine-induced antibody).
Therefore, North Carolina still has no confirmed human cases of WNV.

West Nile Virus in Dogs
-----------------------
I would like to respond to the ProMED-mail posting of Sun 30 Sept 2001:
First Case of West Nile Virus in Dogs Found in Georgia [see: West Nile
virus surveillance 2001 - USA (22) 20010930.2380.
We have a 1977 West Nile virus dog isolate in our collection. Unfortunately
there is no history available - just given as a routine diagnostic isolation.
The isolate was used as one of 10 flaviviruses in a study on diagnostic
procedures for flaviviruses in South Africa in the following publication:
Barnard, B.J.h. and Voges, S.F. (1986) Onderstepoort J Vet. Res. 53, 181-185.
