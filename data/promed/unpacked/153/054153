Visceral Leishmaniasis in Kenya, comment
----------------------------------------
I strongly suspect that an investigation will find that the affected
area is suffering from famine, or at least some situation that promotes
malnutrition. When working in the Sudan, we found a relatively high
infection rate in vectors (_Phlebotomine_ sandflies). This made it
inconceivable that residents were not repeatedly receiving infective
bites. It seemed obvious to me at least that it was the condition of
the human host that was the key to visceral infections.

[We thank Ellicott McConnell for his comment. The suggestion that
host factors are important in the increase of visceral leishmaniasis
also raises the question of whether there has been an increase in HIV
infection in the area. - Mod.EP]
