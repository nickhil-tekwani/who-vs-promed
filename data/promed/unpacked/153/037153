The Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates of the costs of illness
and premature death for a number of foodborne illnesses have been
used in regulatory cost-benefit and impact analyses. Like all cost
estimates, the ERS estimates include assumptions about disease
incidence, outcome severity, and the level of medical, productivity,
and disutility costs. Changes to any of these assumptions could
change the cost estimates and, as a result, change the way
policymakers rank risks, prioritize spending, and formulate food
safety policies.

The Foodborne Illness Cost Calculator provides information on the
assumptions behind foodborne illness cost estimates and gives you a
chance to make your own assumptions and calculate your own cost estimates.

The calculator and other data may be accessed at:
