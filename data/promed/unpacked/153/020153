This week [week of 14 Jun 2021], the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture issued an alert cautioning there have been confirmed cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a white-tailed deer in Warren County, just miles from the New York border.

Pennsylvania has taken CWD very seriously, taking aggressive steps to contain the disease, using a scientific, fact-based approach," Pennsylvania State Veterinarian Dr Kevin Brightbill said.

In New York, CWD was first discovered in captive and wild deer in Oneida County in 2005. Since then, no new cases of CWD have been found, though the deer in Pennsylvania was approximately 5 miles [8 km] from the state's border.

According to state wildlife officials in Pennsylvania, the suspect deer was euthanized and no other [affected deer were detected at the preserve]. The Department of Agriculture also announced the preserve will be quarantined for 5 years to allow for further contact tracing.

Brightbill added: "we will continue to investigate and implement rigorous controls on any business whose deer may have been exposed, and we are working with New York state regulatory partners to mitigate the threat."

[Chronic wasting disease (CWD) cases have been detected in both Pennsylvania and New York. The case above may represent a new area of expansion within the state of Pennsylvania but neither this article nor others provide specific information about this fact.

Pennsylvania will be closely watching this premises and others nearby for the disease. Most states have a captive breeding certification program and there are regulations regarding testing of any unexplained deaths on the premises. Therefore, this is the 1st case on this premises.

Likewise, New York has CWD, but the threat of this disease near their border may be in an area not having reported CWD cases previously.

Chronic wasting disease continues its march across much of North America and parts of Europe. Thus far, no method of effective control/prevention measures has been found. Slaughtering animals in regions where positive animals exist may temporarily reduce the number of positives, but ultimately the disease marches on. Sadly, our scientists are apparently no closer to a treatment or prevention for this disease. - Mod.TG
