Since the 1970s, Oman has lost more than one million lime trees to a disease with no known cure, Witches' Broom Disease of Lime (WBDL). Dr Abdullah Dawood Al Zadjali, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, has now found a way to grow disease-free trees to rehabilitate the Sultanate's lime production.

"Trees [with WBDL] will die completely in 4-5 years. Annually, we're losing a lot of trees. New trees in 2-6 years die too. Once the tree [is] showing some symptoms, [farmers] should eradicate [it], even the roots, so as not to transfer the disease," he advises.

"We found the only way to overcome the disease is to grow clean material, disease-free, and distribute to farmers so we can reduce the disease in the environment. Or we can clear the area of citrus plants and replant with 100 percent certified disease-free material," explains Al Zadjali.

The success rate for the technique is no more than 5 percent, but now [they] have about 1500 mother plants from which more trees can be grown. "We also find good results in the field where we're using the resistant root stocks," he mentions. Now they are moving on to mass production. "We need to produce at least 10 000 seedlings annually."

[They] managed to grow Omani limes and also other varieties of disease-free citrus, including oranges, grapefruits, lemons and others fruits from Oman. "We've succeeded to produce over 15 different varieties," he said.

The project aims to produce enough disease-free trees to bring the industry back to [the] days before WBDL appeared, [when] many Omani farmers depended on limes as a major part of their livelihoods.

[Witches' broom of lime is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma aurantifolia, type member of the 16SrII phytoplasma group. It was 1st described from Oman in 1975 as the 1st phytoplasma disease for citrus. Since then, it has also been reported from Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and India. Currently in Oman, it infests over 98 percent of limes and is highly devastating in the country and adjoining regions.

So far, the only known natural host of the pathogen is the small-fruited acid lime _Citrus aurantifolia_, but more information on the host range is needed. Symptoms may include abnormal chlorotic proliferations of small shoots ("witches' broom," a common symptom of phytoplasma infections), followed by dieback of affected branches and eventual death of the tree within a few years.

The pathogen is transmitted by grafting, but an insect vector, like for many other phytoplasmas, is also suspected because the disease spreads amongst ungrafted trees as well. Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum, and use of certified clean planting material.

Control measures have previously failed in all countries where WBDL has been reported. Thus, the production and certification scheme for clean replanting material described above is an important step forward for Oman and may also serve as a model to be used in other affected areas.
