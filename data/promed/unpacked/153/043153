Disease threatens rice in Tila Valley
--------------------------------------
A fungal infection threatens to destroy 80 percent of this year's
[2011] paddy harvest in the Tila Valley of Jumla [Mid Western region],
the world's highest rice cultivation area. The irrigated valleys of
the Tila and Sinja rivers have consistently good harvests of the Marsi
variety of high altitude rice. But their hopes were dashed as the
harvest time neared.

"We burnt our paddy fields as the yield was very low," says a farmer,
who blames the heavy monsoon rains during the transplantation period
for the spread of the rice blast fungus. Other farmers say they have
lost half their harvest.

The District Agriculture Office says excessive use of nitrogen
fertilizer could have made the conditions right for the spread. They
say that some farmers who planted the Chandanath variety had healthy
harvests, but it was the Marsi who suffered the worst losses. There
are 3000 hectares [7500 acres] of paddy planted in Jumla every year,
but this year [2011] the district may have to depend on outside rice
to see itself through the winter.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously
classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most
destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of
more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the
shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are
infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are
severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages,
plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses
and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars. This
could explain the difference in the effect on the two varieties
(Chandanath and Marsi) grown in Jumla, as described above.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The disease
is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence.

A previous outbreak of rice blast was reported from Jumla in 2009
(ProMED-mail post 20090731.2682).
