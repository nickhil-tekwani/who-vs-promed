Florida reports 2 additional EEE cases in horses, total now 18
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 3 Aug [2016], 2 new eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) case were confirmed, one each in Jackson and Jefferson County, Florida. The Jackson County case, a 10-year-old Quarter Horse, became clinical on 16 Jul [2016] and was last vaccinated against EEE in February 2016 per submitting veterinarian. The horse was euthanized for humane reasons the same day.

The Jefferson County case has no previous vaccine history and no recent travel history. Clinical signs began on 24 Jul [2016] and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons 3 days later.

This is the 2nd confirmed EEE case in Jackson County, the 3rd case in Jefferson County and cases 17 and 18 in Florida for 2016.

EEE is a mosquito-transmitted disease that is much more severe than West Nile virus (WNV). The mortality rate in horses from WNV is reported at around 30 percent, while the rate for EEE is almost 90 percent. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for EEE.

The virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General symptoms include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 degrees F, ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression and stupor. Other symptoms may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All symptoms may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

A horse in West Tennessee has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a virus that can be fatal for horses and humans. The Tennessee departments of Agriculture and Health are advising citizens to take precautions to protect themselves and their livestock.

Mosquitoes transmit EEE. Humans cannot contract these viral infections directly from infected horses. However, mosquito-borne diseases do pose a public health risk.

"Although Tennessee has never had a documented human case of EEE, it is important for the public to remember mosquito-borne diseases including EEE and West Nile virus can occur each summer," medical entomologist Dr. Abelardo Moncayo said. "Fortunately, the prevention measures are similar for EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases."

[The 2 Florida counties affected are Jackson in the armpit of the state and Jefferson on the border with Alabama; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/states/florida.gif.

Even the Tennessee Department of Agriculture's full news release, from which the above was cut and pasted -- https://www.tn.gov/agriculture/news/44502 -- does not give the location of their affected horse. While we are in the midst of the summer mosquito season and therefore a bit late to vaccinate one's horses, if they have not been vaccinated, it would be wise to do it now before they are infected and dead. - Mod.MHJ
