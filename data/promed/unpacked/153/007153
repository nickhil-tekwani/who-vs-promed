45 Children Rushed to Hospital
---------------------------------
Yesterday at 2:00 p.m., a number of students at the nursery school of
Beijing Tire Factory suddenly developed a rash after eating lunch. Based on
the hospital diagnosis, the rash might have been an allergic reaction
caused by fish they consumed at midday.
Yesterday at 3 p.m., this reporter hurried to the Emergency Room of 306
Hospital. Inside, 13 children sat in the main hall. It could not be seen
that they had any symptoms. On the left side of the main hall, within the
emergency room, 16 children were sitting or lying down. They were sweating
and some [were] vomiting. In the pediatric emergency room on the right
side of the main hall were 16 children being cared for by an adult, but
they were not sweating.
A doctor from the hospital emergency room's pediatric department who
did not wish to reveal her identity said the children ate some fish for
lunch. Afterward, they developed a rash. It is highly likely to be a food
allergy. At this point, the children are not in any danger.
But, according to a driver from the Beijing Tire Factory, the reason the
children developed a rash might be the fish they ate at midday, but the
children have eaten similar fish before without any problems at all -- so
it is unknown what specifically caused the rash this time. Neither the
driver nor a caregiver from the nursery revealed what fish [the children] ate.
At 3:32 p.m. after a period of observation, a vehicle from the Beijing Tire
Factory and an ambulance separately brought some of the recovering students
back to the school. 16 students remained for treatment at the hospital.
At 4:00 p.m., this reporter concluded the interviews and was ready to
leave, when I saw another sweating student suddenly vomit. The doctor said
it was not possible to confirm whether the vomiting was connected to the
food allergy.
306 Hospital has already reported this incident to the Beijing Health
Bureau, the China CDC, and other health departments.
Up to 6:00 p.m. when this reporter submitted his draft, the children who
had been sweating were leaving the hospital one after the other. Beijing
Health Bureau and other departments are now investigating the cause.

[Allergies to some types of fish are not uncommon. Scombroid fish poisoning
has occurred after eating the dark-fleshed fish of the family scombridae,
namely tuna, mahi-mahi, and bluefish. Scrombroid fish poisoning usually
causes symptoms within 60 to 90 minutes after ingestion. Signs include
headaches, nausea, flushing, dizziness and diarrhea. Most victims recover
but are miserable until then.
The natural toxin that causes scrombroid fish poisoning is histamine, which
is present in very large quantities in these fish. If fish contain large
amounts of free histidine and are not kept on ice or frozen after being
caught, the histidine breaks down and forms histamine, which can cause the
signs and symptoms mentioned above.
Hence, the reason that experienced fishermen and chefs know they must
quickly chill fish and maintain them at cold temperatures until they're
cooked. - Mod.TG]
