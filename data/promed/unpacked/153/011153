Zambia has recorded 1600 cases of measles since the disease broke out a
week ago. Director of Public Health and Research at the Ministry of Health
Victor Mukonka disclosed this in an interview with ZNBC [radio] over the
weekend.

Dr Mukonka, however, claimed that the disease is under control. He didn't
say how many people have died so far. He said all patients are receiving
treatment in isolation centres, which have been set up.

Dr Mukonka said the Ministry of Health will embark on a countrywide
campaign and immunisation against measles in the 3rd week of July 2010.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles is one of the
leading causes of death among young children, even though a safe and
cost-effective vaccine is available. In 2008, there were 164 000 measles
deaths globally, nearly 450 deaths every day or 18 deaths every hour. More
than 95 per cent of measles deaths occur in low-income countries with weak
health infrastructures. Measles vaccination resulted in a 78 per cent drop
in measles deaths between 2000 and 2008 worldwide.

[On 15 Jun 2010, the number of measles cases in Zambia was reported to be
817, and the number of fatalities to be 33. As of 28 Jun 2010, the number
of cases has increased to 1600, approximately. The number of deaths is not
stated in the above press report, but it is likely that more than 50
children have died now during the course of this outbreak. Further
information is awaited.
