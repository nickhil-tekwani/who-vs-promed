A 3rd possible case of _E. coli_ infection in a student at Monroe's
Abe Lincoln Elementary is being investigated by the Green County
Health Department, prompting recommendations that all pre-kindergarten
and kindergarten students at the school be tested for _E. coli_.

One of the 2 other recently confirmed cases at the school genetically
matches a previous cluster of _E. coli_ O157 infections in August and
early September 2011, officials said.

Health officials are investigating 2 recently confirmed cases of _E.
coli_ in children in the Monroe School District. WISC-TV reports the
cases were in children who attend Abe Lincoln Elementary School in
Monroe.

Officials don't know whether the new cases are related to a previous
cluster of _E. coli_ cases that happened in August and early September
[2011] in Green County. The Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene is testing
to determine the genetic strain of the recent cases.

[ProMED has previously posted on this cluster in Green County,
Wisconsin, which had consisted of 9 cases including a death of a
20-month-old child (E. coli O157 - USA (07): (WI) 20110915.2819). New
cases with matching DNA "fingerprints" suggest that the reservoir
continues to exist. The infection can be food or waterborne, be
associated with direct livestock contact as at a petting zoo, or may
be spread from person-to-person. The source, so far, remains unknown.
