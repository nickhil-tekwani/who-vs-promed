A Colorado resident was infected with the plague after a squirrel in the state tested positive for the bubonic plague, the first human case in the state since 2015, according to a report. The unnamed person, who lives in the south west section of the state, contracted septicemic plague earlier this summer and has since recovered, officials confirmed to the Denver Post. The person had had contact with sick squirrels.

Septicemic plague is one of the 3 main forms of plague, the other forms being bubonic and pneumonic. All are caused by bacteria called _Yersinia pestis_ that live in some animals -- mostly rodents -- and their fleas. Septicemic is the rarest of the plague varieties and is an infection in the blood, which can cause tissues to turn black and die, whereas the bubonic form causes swollen and painful lymph nodes, and the pneumonic form is a severe lung infection. The bubonic plague is the commonest type.

The disease doesn't spread easily to other people, and nobody else was infected, health officials said. However, experts warned of an "increase of reported plague activity" and cautioned people to avoid handling or feeding rodents and other wildlife. "While we see most plague activity during the summer, the disease can be found in rodents year-round, and [it] sometimes spills over into other wildlife species as well as domestic cats and dogs," Dr Jenifer House, Colorado's public health veterinarian, said in a statement. "Plague has been present in Colorado since at least the 1940s, and cases in wild rodents in Colorado are reported most years."

While the infection can be deadly if left untreated, most people recover when given antibacterial treatment promptly. Household pets like cats and dogs can also catch plague from infected wildlife, so the health department advised not allowing pets to roam or to hunt rodents, according to the outlet.

Earlier this summer, a squirrel in Jefferson County tested positive for the bubonic plague, which killed more than 50 million people across Africa, Asia, and Europe in the Middle Ages and came to be known as "black death".

["The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14% (one in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal."

In recent decades, an average of seven human plague cases have been reported each year in the United States (range: 1-17 cases per year) (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Most cases of _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of the "Four Corner" states: Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, although California and, to a lesser extent, Oregon also may have cases. - Mod.LL
