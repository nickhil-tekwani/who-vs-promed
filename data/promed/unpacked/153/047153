Avian influenza H7 confirmed in Oxfordshire
-------------------------------------------
The Chief Veterinary Officer, Nigel Gibbens, has
today confirmed avian influenza in chickens on
premises near Banbury in Oxfordshire after
preliminary tests were positive for the H7
strain. All birds on the premises will be
slaughtered as a precautionary measure.

Laboratory testing continues and results which
will allow confirmation of whether the strain is
high or low pathogenicity will follow. A detailed
epidemiological investigation to better
understand the origin and development of the disease is underway.

A Temporary Control Zone with a 3km [1.86-mile]
inner zone and a 10km [6.2-mile] outer zone is
being established around the Infected Premises [a
map is available at the above URL]. A number of
measures apply. All birds must be housed or
otherwise isolated from contact with wild birds
in the inner zone. Bird gatherings are banned and
all other movements of birds and some products
are banned in the whole of the Temporary Control
Zone. DEFRA is urgently considering whether any wider measures may be needed.

Nigel Gibbens said: "I would stress the need for
poultry keepers to be extremely vigilant,
practice the highest levels of biosecurity and
report any suspicions of disease to their local
Animal Health Office immediately."

The Health Protection Agency has advised that it
is important to remember that H7 avian flu
remains largely a disease of birds. The virus
does not transmit easily to humans, as evidenced
by the small number of confirmed infections
worldwide to date. Almost all human H7 infections
documented so far have been associated with close
contact with dead or dying poultry. The risk to
human health posed by H7 avian influenza viruses
remains low. Nonetheless, the local Health
Protection Unit will be identifying and following
up those who may have had contact with the
infected poultry and provide guidance and advice,
and preventative medication as appropriate.

Dr. Judith Hilton, Food Standards Agency head of
microbiological safety, said: "This case of bird
flu on a premises in Banbury, Oxfordshire, poses
no safety implications for the human food chain.
Properly cooked poultry and poultry products,
including eggs, are safe to eat. The science
shows that the virus isn't contracted by eating
food Â­-- but usually by close contact with infected birds."

All poultry keepers on the GB Poultry Register
are being notified, and the EU Commission has been informed.

Notes to editors
----------------
1. Avian Influenza is a disease of birds. Whilst
it can pass very rarely and with difficulty to
humans, this requires extremely close contact
with infected birds, particularly faeces.

2. Advice from the Food Standards Agency remains
that properly cooked poultry and poultry
products, including eggs, are safe to eat. People
should follow the Agency's normal food hygiene
advice in relation to handling eggs and raw
poultry meat in the kitchen. People should not
eat raw eggs or use raw eggs in dishes that will
not be cooked. Eggs should be cooked until the
whites are solid. People at particular risk of
salmonella should continue to cook eggs until the
yolks are solid. People should also ensure that
poultry meat is cooked to the point where the
juices run clear and there are no red parts in
the meat. The H7 virus is destroyed by cooking thoroughly.

3. All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low
pathogenic but only H5 and H7 are known to have
the potential to become highly pathogenic.

[Details on the housing and husbandry mode
applied on the affected farm as well as
epidemiological and clinical observations will be
helpful. Laboratory results, addressing the
pathogenicity and genetic lineage of the isolate, are anticipated.

Avian H7 influenza viruses from both the Eurasian
and North American lineage have caused outbreaks
in poultry since 2002, with confirmed human
infection occurring during outbreaks in The
Netherlands, British Columbia, and the United
Kingdom.

The most publicised case was recorded in the Netherlands during an
extensive epizootic of HPAI H7N7 virus on commercial poultry farms,
between March and May 2003. One case involved fatal respiratory
distress syndrome in a veterinarian who was in close contact with
infected poultry -- see ProMED ref. below. Reportedly, 86 cases in
poultry workers and 3 cases in people with no poultry
contact were initially confirmed by PCR.

The majority of H7 infections have resulted in
self-limiting conjunctivitis, whereas probable
human-to-human transmission has been rare.

viruses possess human receptor specificity:
Implications for virus transmissibility," which
