Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a mosquito-transmitted disease, has been detected in Delaware the 1st for 2022 in a sentinel chicken, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced today [12 Aug 2022]. Mosquito-transmitted virus detections in DNREC's sentinel chickens are unrelated to Delaware's poultry industry.

The EEE finding in northern New Castle County was from a sentinel chicken station sampled by the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife Mosquito Control section and confirmed by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory 9 Aug [2022]. While there have been no reported EEE cases in humans this year [2022] in the state, Delawareans are reminded that the possibility of contracting mosquito-transmitted diseases, including EEE and West Nile virus (WNV), will continue until colder autumn temperatures in late October [2022] or later.

The 1st EEE-positive sentinel chicken for this year [2022] adds to 5 WNV-positive sentinel chickens found earlier at 3 other sentinel chicken arbovirus monitoring stations in New Castle and Kent counties, with the 1st WNV finding occurring in early July [2022]. No EEE or WNV human cases have been reported to date in 2022 by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory, nor have any EEE or WNV equine cases been reported by the Delaware Department of Agriculture.

Blood samples are collected by the Mosquito Control section each week from early July into October from the state's outdoor-caged sentinel chickens, humanely housed and handled at 20 monitoring stations statewide. The blood samples are tested for EEE and WNV antibodies by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory. Sentinel chickens bitten by mosquitoes carrying EEE or WNV develop antibodies to these diseases but are otherwise unaffected. Mosquitoes can transmit both WNV and EEE to humans and horses.

The public is reminded to take commonsense precautions to avoid mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors in mosquito-prone areas, applying insect repellent containing 10-30% diethyltoluamide (DEET) in accordance with label instructions, and avoiding mosquito-infested areas and at times of peak mosquito activity around dusk, dawn, and at night.

Spraying to reduce mosquito populations in areas where EEE or WNV is detected may be initiated by DNREC's Mosquito Control section as warranted, based on factors to include mosquito population levels and mosquito species present in affected areas. To reduce mosquito-breeding habitat and chances of disease transmission, residents should drain or remove outdoor items that collect water, such as discarded buckets or containers, uncovered trashcans, stagnant birdbaths, unprotected rain barrels or cisterns, old tires, upright wheelbarrows, flowerpot liners, depressions in boat tarps, clogged rain gutters, corrugated downspout extenders, and unused swimming pools.

While EEE is rarer than WNV, both EEE and WNV can adversely affect people and horses. Most people who become infected with EEE virus and WNV show either no or mild symptoms. Early symptoms in people contracting EEE or WNV can be similar, but EEE often becomes more pronounced and debilitating, manifested by meningitis or encephalitis typically resulting in hospitalizations. EEE has a higher human mortality rate of approximately 30%, with infants, children, and the elderly most vulnerable, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms in people infected with EEE usually start from 4 to 10 days after being bitten by a mosquito infected with EEE. Early EEE symptoms can include headache, high fever, stiff neck, tremors, or muscle weakness, with more severe cases progressing to stupor, disorientation, coma, convulsions, paralysis, and possibly death. Most people infected with WNV do not develop symptoms, but about 20% can develop a mild illness, including fever, body and muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash symptoms. A small number of people infected with WNV can develop serious illness involving neurological problems, paralysis, and possibly death. There are no human vaccines for EEE or WNV. Anyone developing the symptoms described above should see their healthcare provider.

Horse owners should contact their veterinarian immediately if they suspect their horse may be showing signs of WNV or EEE. Signs of EEE in horses include fever (102.5-104.5 deg F [39.2-40.3 deg C]), loss of appetite, head pressing, depression or personality change, wobbling or staggering, weakness, blindness, convulsions, muscle tremors in the head and neck, or hind-limb weakness. These signs are also consistent with WNV, although a fever may or may not be present with WNV. [There are vaccinations for horses to prevent these 2 diseases. Horse owners should see their veterinarian immediately to get their animals vaccinated, as the virus is already circulating in the areas. - Mod.TG]

The Jefferson County Public Health Service has been notified by the New York State Department of Health that a 6-year-old, unvaccinated horse, who died in the Town of Antwerp, was positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE, Triple E). Results are pending for another horse residing in the Town of Orleans who was exhibiting similar signs. The last lab-confirmed positive EEE cases in Jefferson County horses occurred in 2020.

Antwerp is located in upstate New York approximately 90 mi [145 km] north of Syracuse.

EEE is very rare but serious. Mosquitoes infected with EEE virus (EEEV) can infect people, horses and other mammals, some birds, reptiles, and amphibians. About 5-10 EEE human cases are reported each year in the US. Five cases of EEE in people in New York State have been reported since 1971. These cases were reported in 1971, 1983, 2009, 2010, and 2011 and occurred in Oswego and Onondaga counties. All 5 cases died.

The risk of getting EEE is highest from late July through September. People at the greatest risk of developing severe disease are those over 50 years of age and younger than 15 years of age. There is no specific treatment available for EEE.

A horse in the town of Mexico died Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] of eastern equine encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus, Oswego County Health Department officials said.

The diagnosis was confirmed in test results released by the New York Health Department, officials said.

The horse was not vaccinated for EEE, according to a news release by the Oswego Health Department. Horses cannot spread the disease to people, but it can be transmitted by infected mosquitoes to humans and horses. There is no EEE vaccine available to humans.

Human cases of EEE are rare. About 1/3 of people who get EEE die from the disease, and most survivors suffer brain damage.

The county is planning an aerial spraying, a partial measure to control the spread of the EEE virus, officials said. Details will be announced to the public when plans are finalized, officials said.

Health officials said people should use repellent, wear protective clothing outdoors, and remove standing water from their yards, which can serve as mosquito breeding grounds.

There have been 8 reported human EEE deaths in Onondaga and Oswego counties since 1971.

Central New York is a hot spot for EEE. Freshwater swamps such as the Cicero Swamp in Onondaga County and Toad Harbor in Oswego County are prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying EEE. Infected mosquitoes can travel up to 5 mi [8 km].

The Oswego County Health Department announced a donkey from the town of Albion has died from eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). The diagnosis was confirmed in testing conducted by the state Department of Health.

Donkeys are as susceptible to mosquito-borne diseases as horses. Like horses, they cannot transmit EEEV to a person; however, infected mosquitoes pose a risk to both humans and livestock. EEE vaccines are available for donkeys and horses. The health department recommends that owners talk to their veterinarian for advice on having these animals vaccinated.

Oswego County Interim Public Health Director Vera Dunsmoor reminds residents that EEEV is endemic to this area. "We continue to monitor and assess mosquito and virus activities and are working closely with the state Department of Health.

"Until we have a killing frost, people in all areas of Oswego County need to fully protect themselves from mosquito bites when they participate in outdoor activities," she said. "Try to avoid being outdoors during the periods when mosquitoes are most active, primarily around dusk and dawn. If you are outdoors, consider wearing long pants and long sleeves and using insect repellents."

Insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus are effective. Repellents that contain permethrin are meant for clothing and gear and should not be applied directly to the skin. Read the product label for repellents and follow package instructions.

Residents are also advised to take the following measures to remove standing water and reduce mosquito breeding sites around the home and property:

- Repair or replace window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.
- Mosquito larvicide "dunk" packs, suitable for treating large containers of water, are available from the Oswego County Soil and Water Conservation District or at local municipal offices. The treatments must be used according to the label's instructions.
- Dispose of old tires. Used tires are a significant mosquito breeding site and are accepted at Oswego County transfer stations. Visit https://www.oswegocounty.com/departments/infrastructure_facilities_and_technology/solid_waste/faq.php or call the Oswego County Solid Waste Department for details.
- Empty or dispose of pails, cans, flowerpots, and similar water-holding containers.
- Clear roof gutters and be sure they drain properly.
- Turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use.
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs, and drain pool covers.
- Change the water in birdbaths and horse troughs [at least] twice a week.
- Remove leaf debris from yards and gardens and clean vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds.
- For more information about protecting your family against mosquitoes, call the Oswego County Health Department or visit https://health.oswegocounty.com/.

[Mosquito season is here! Unvaccinated horses, donkeys, mules, and other equids are at risk of this disease. It can be deadly. EEE immunity wanes fairly quickly in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

The virus is spread by mosquitoes, but a hard killing frost will kill the mosquitoes.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when you gave vaccination last, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG]
