Kazakhstan: another Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever case in the south
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A 32 year old man has been admitted to hospital with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever in a southern province of Kazakhstan. According to the
Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan, 3 people were identified as
having contact with the infected man. These 3 people are under medical
observation. The focus of infection has been disinfested [to eradicate tick
vectors], and other anti-epidemic measures have been taken to prevent the
spread of infection.
Earlier, in the city of Kizilorda, a provincial centre in the south of
Kazakhstan, a 22 year old woman died in the provincial infectious diseases
hospital. Her condition was diagnosed as "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
with acute internal hemorrhage". She had developed Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever following tick bite (see: Crimean-Congo hem. fever -
Kazakhstan (Kizilorda) 20050525.1449).

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by a tickborne bunyavirus
belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. It is
endemic in the southern region of Kazakhstan. Previously reported cases
from Kazakhstan appear to have been direct consequences of tick bite with
no subsequent person to person transmission. Further information on the
nature of the exposure of the new case in southern Kazakhstan would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP]
