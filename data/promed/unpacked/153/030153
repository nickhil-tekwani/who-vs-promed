CJD Diagnostic Test "Ready in a Year"
-------------------------------------
Researchers in Israel claim to have developed a simple diagnostic test for
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as vCJD or
CJD (new var.), the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
They say their method can reliably distinguish between urine samples from
healthy humans and samples preserved from people who died of vCJD. Ruth
Gabizon, who leads the team at the Hadassah Medical Organisation in Israel,
says that the procedure was developed using urine from humans, hamsters,
and cattle. British specialists say the work is interesting, but raise
questions about its accuracy.
vCJD, which is a fatal degenerative disease affecting the brain, is hard to
distinguish from other degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.
Doctors often cannot be sure that a person has vCJD until after death. So a
urine test would make diagnosis much simpler and might even be used to work
out how far and how quickly the disease has spread through the general
population.
vCJD in humans, BSE in cows, and scrapie in hamsters are believed to be
related forms of the same disease, known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. "We had urine samples from all the cases of CJD in Israel
in the last year," she told BBC News Online. The team compared these
samples with urine from non-infected people, and carried out the same
procedure on urine from British BSE-infected cattle and scrapie-infected
hamsters. "We were able to detect all the positives as positives and all
the negatives as negatives," she said, adding that in some cases the team
could detect scrapie infection in hamsters which had not yet shown any
symptoms.
The debate about the test arises from the difficulty in detecting CJD. Ruth
Gabizon says that there is only one substance which all scientists agree is
evidence of CJD infection. This substance is known as PrPSc and forms part
of the prion or rogue protein believed to cause the disease. Her test
detects a related substance that she calls UPrPSc. She says that she is
confident that the 2 are linked because her test produced reliable results.
But researchers from Britain's MRC Prion Research unit, who are world
leaders in the field, have their doubts. They do not believe that there
have been sufficient controls to show that the Israeli team really are
detecting prions. [Since there have been no deaths from vCJD in Israel, the
precise identity of the human samples utilized by the Israeli group is
unclear from this press statement. - Mod.CP
The question is whether prions really do move from the brain to urine. If
prions move into urine, the British team thinks it is likely that the rogue
proteins would accumulate in the kidneys, where they would be found by
doctors conducting postmortem examinations. But Ruth Gabizon disagrees.

[This urine diagnostic test would be a great advance if its specificity and
sensitivity stand up to critical scrutiny.
The research is published in the 21 Jun 2001 electronic pre-print issue of
the Journal of Biological Chemistry (): A protease resistant
PrP isoform is present in urine of animals and humans affected with prion
diseases, by Shaked GM, Shaked Y, Kariv Z, Halimi M, Avraham I, Gabizon R.
The text of the abstract reads as follows: "PrPSc, the only known component
of the prion, is present mostly in the brains of animals and humans
affected with prion diseases. We now show that a protease resistant PrP
isoform can also be detected in the urine of hamsters, cattle and humans
suffering from TSEs. Most important, this PrP isoform (UPrPSc) was also
found in the urine of hamsters inoculated with prions long before the
appearance of clinical signs. Interestingly, i.c. inoculation of hamsters
with UPrPSc did not cause clinical signs of prion disease even after 270
days, suggesting it differs in its pathogenic properties from brain PrPSc.
We propose that the detection of UPrPSc can be used to diagnose humans and
animals incubating prion diseases, as well as to increase our understanding
on the metabolism of PrPSc in-vivo." - Mod.CP
[ProMED-mail does not normally post on preliminary results of diagnostic
assays, therapies, or immunizations. In this case, however, the potential
importance of this assay, if the results of the Israeli group can be
confirmed, merits a wide readership. - Man. Ed. DS
