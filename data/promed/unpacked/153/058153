This Saturday [30 Apr 2022], the Los Lagos regional Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat] confirmed the 6th hantavirus case of the year [2022] in the area, specifically in the Osorno commune. This is a 35-year-old official from the hospital in the Rio Negro commune, in the province of Osorno, who is in serious condition, explained the Health SEREMI, Carlos Becerra.

"This is a serious disease, and we issue a call with the basic [preventive] measures that we all know. In rural environments, always maintain good ventilation and control rodents so that they do not come near the usual places of residence. In the face of symptoms such as respiratory distress or cough, go quickly to a health center," he added.

With the confirmation of this case in Osorno, to date [30 Apr 2022] the case count is 6 people infected with a hantavirus in the Los Lagos region.

[This is an active year (2022) so far for hantavirus transmission in the Los Lagos region. Severe cases of hantavirus infections occur in the Los Lagos region occasionally and in Chile every year. Although not specified in these or previous reports from the regions, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus can be transmitted directly person to person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family. However, unless specific laboratory tests are done, Seoul hantavirus cannot be ruled out.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
