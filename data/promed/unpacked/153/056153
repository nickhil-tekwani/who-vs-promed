Recovered SARS Patient Continues to Shed Virus in Stool
---------------------------------------------------
An issue that has not been discussed anywhere in ProMED-mail in
detail (perhaps because little is known about it) is that of
continual viral shedding by clinically recovered SARS patients. A
colleague of mine in Singapore, who has had the SARS illness and was
diagnosed with the SARS coronavirus by RT-PCR culture and electron
microscopy, has informed me that SARS coronavirus RNA has continued
to be detected in stool samples by RT-PCR, although it has not yet
been successfully grown in culture. This continued for sometime after
the quarantine period of 10-14 [days?] after recovery from illness
(up to 3 weeks post-recovery).
If such is the case for most -- or even some -- of the recovered SARS
patients, perhaps this may account for the ongoing transmission we
are seeing in places like Singapore in household and workplace
contacts of clinically recovered SARS patients. Perhaps the
laboratories of the WHO collaborating network should ask for
convalescent stool samples as well as sera to monitor and
characterise this phenomenon.

[The current RT-PCR tests utilize primers that amplify short
sequences of the polymerase gene of the putative SARS coronavirus.
These tests may do no more than detect the presence of defective
virus in gut contents. The replication of many RNA viruses is
accompanied by the progressive accumulation of defective interfering
particles (the equivalent of deletion mutants), which are thought to
be a determining factor in the self-limiting characteristics of some
acute virus infections. The failure to isolate infectious virus from
the patient after recovery suggests that transmission of SARS via gut
contents post-recovery does not represent substantial risk.
Nonetheless, it is not possible to discount this route of
transmission of SARS virus without knowledge of the relative
sensitivity of the cell culture employed, and Dr. Julian Tang has
drawn attention to an important question. - Mod.CP]
