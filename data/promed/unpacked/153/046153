Cattle anthrax cases reported in North Dakota
--------------------------------------------------
A cow in Traill County has tested positive for anthrax. State
Veterinarian Susan Keller says it's the 1st case of anthrax in the
state this year [2007]. Keller says the Traill County herd where the
cow was found had about 18 animals. She says the herd has been
quarantined and vaccinated.
Keller says anthrax usually appears in very wet or very dry
conditions, when dormant bacteria spores in the soil are disturbed.
Animals that consume the spores are exposed to the disease. Keller
says ranchers who find dead livestock should consult their
veterinarians before disposing of the carcasses.
Last year [2006] in North Dakota, there were 4 confirmed cases of
cattle anthrax in 4 counties. More than 500 animals 2 years ago in 16
North Dakota counties died from anthrax, the worst outbreak in state history.
Keller says ranchers have stepped up vaccinations since the record
outbreak in 2005.

Cattle anthrax case in Traill County is ND's 1st in 2007
--------------------------------------------------------
A single cow in eastern North Dakota's Traill County has tested
positive for anthrax, state veterinarian Dr. Susan Keller said in a
statement Monday [30 Jul 2007]. The associated Traill County herd has
been quarantined and vaccinated, according to the North Dakota
Department of Agriculture. About 18 head of cattle were quarantined
after 2 cows died. The 2nd was not tested, but showed the same
symptoms as the confirmed case. Keller said it is safe to say it also
had contracted anthrax. The animal was examined by Dr. Allen
Hoverson, Cooperstown, ND, who forwarded tissue samples to the
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at North Dakota State University in
Fargo, according to the release. The test confirmed the diagnosis
Friday [27 Jul 2007], the release said.
The case of anthrax did not affect any other herds of cattle, Keller
said. "These cattle were not going to move anyway, so it worked out
OK, except the man lost 2 cows," she said. Anthrax vaccines are
readily available but take about a week to establish immunity, Keller
said. Producers should make sure their animals are vaccinated, she
said. Producers who find dead livestock also are urged to consult
their veterinarians before disposing of carcasses.
In early July [2007], the Minnesota Board of Animal Health reported
that a bull from a farm in Marshall County had died from anthrax
about a week earlier. It was that state's first anthrax case this
year [2007]. The herd, which was not identified, was to remain under
quarantine for 30 days from the day when the bull died. The dead bull
was discovered in a pasture. The Marshall County herd had not been
vaccinated for anthrax and had since been taken off the pasture where
the infection occurred, according to the Animal Board of Health.

[Now we cross our fingers and wait to see whether this year will
mimic 2006 when there were only a few scattered single cases, or
whether it will follow 2005 when there were many outbreaks. Rancher
vaccination will play a significant role in preventing spread.- Mod.MHJ]
