The North Dakota Department of Health said [Mon 12 May 2014], it has confirmed an additional case of hepatitis C related to an outbreak at a Minot nursing home, bringing the total number of cases to 45. Since the investigation began last August 2013, the Health Department has tested at least 500 people for exposure to the virus. All of the confirmed cases have been current or former residents of Manor Care Health Services in Minot.

State Epidemiologist Tracy Miller said it's important to note that the latest case was likely exposed to hepatitis C in 2011 or 2012. No newly infected cases have been found in people with exposures associated with the outbreak since October 2013, the department said in a news release. The Health Department is still conducting tests.

[According to the ND Department of Health website, the viruses are genetically related and epidemiologically linked to the nursing home. Little data are available related to the outbreak otherwise. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted generally by blood contact via transfusion or shared needle or sharps exposure. In a nosocomial setting, a number of outbreaks of hepatitis, either B or C, have been linked to a number of situations such as glucose point of care testing via inadvertent contamination of testing equipment and medication contamination by drug-abusing health care workers.

Unlike hepatitis A and B, acute manifestations of HCV infection are quite uncommon and the infection is generally found serologically. Chronic infection may occur in 85-90 percent of cases but clearance seems to be higher when acute infection is overt and when acquired in childhood. As compared to hepatitis B, sexual transmission and perinatal transmission are much less common. No vaccine is yet available and gamma globulin preparations do not seem to prevent transmission when used post exposure. A certain percentage of infected individuals will slowly progress to cirrhosis and some will develop liver cancer but these complications are usually over decades. At least in a geriatric nursing home setting, HCV is not likely to be a significant issue in morbidity or mortality.

The therapeutic bandwidth for hepatitis C is expanding rapidly since the time when the interferon and ribavirin combination was the only choice. A number of highly effective medications have recently or will soon reach the marketplace and will change the playing field. Although cost of therapy can be an issue, the cost savings in preventing the medical costs of cirrhosis and liver cancer should be entered into the equation. Not all individuals with chronic HCV infection develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer and most, when they die, will die with HCV and not from HCV. Distinguishing those with HCV who will progress is, however, not easy. - Mod.LL
