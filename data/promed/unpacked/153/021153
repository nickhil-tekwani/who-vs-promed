[A] Omicron BA.2
Date: Tue 22 Feb 2022

As part of its ongoing work to track variants, WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) met yesterday [21 Feb 2022] to discuss the latest evidence on the omicron variant of concern, including its sublineages BA.1 and BA.2.

Based on available data of transmission, severity, reinfection, diagnostics, therapeutics and impacts of vaccines, the group reinforced that the BA.2 sublineage should continue to be considered a variant of concern and that it should remain classified as omicron. The group emphasized that BA.2 should continue to be monitored as a distinct sublineage of omicron by public health authorities.

The omicron variant of concern is currently the dominant variant circulating globally, accounting for nearly all sequences reported to GISAID. Omicron is made up of several sublineages, each of them being monitored by WHO and partners. Of them, the most common ones are BA.1, BA.1.1 (or Nextstrain clade 21K) and BA.2 (or Nextstrain clade 21L). At a global level, the proportion of reported sequences designated BA.2 has been increasing relative to BA.1 in recent weeks; however, the global circulation of all variants is reportedly declining.

BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins. Studies have shown that BA.2 has a growth advantage over BA.1. Studies are ongoing to understand the reasons for this growth advantage, but initial data suggest that BA.2 appears inherently more transmissible than BA.1, which currently remains the most common omicron sublineage reported. This difference in transmissibility appears to be much smaller than, for example, the difference between BA.1 and delta. Further, although BA.2 sequences are increasing in proportion relative to other omicron sublineages (BA.1 and BA.1.1), there is still a reported decline in overall cases globally.

Studies are evaluating the risk of reinfection with BA.2 compared to BA.1. Reinfection with BA.2 following infection with BA.1 has been documented; however, initial data from population-level reinfection studies suggest that infection with BA.1 provides strong protection against reinfection with BA.2, at least for the limited period for which data are available.

While reaching the above determination, the TAG-VE also looked at preliminary laboratory data from Japan generated using animal models without any immunity to SARS-CoV-2 which highlighted that BA.2 may cause more severe disease in hamsters compared to BA.1. They also considered real-world data on clinical severity from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Denmark, where immunity from vaccination or natural infection is high: in these data, there was no reported difference in severity between BA.2 and BA.1.

WHO will continue to closely monitor the BA.2 lineage as part of omicron and requests countries to continue to be vigilant, to monitor and report sequences, as well as to conduct independent and comparative analyses of the different omicron sublineages.

The TAG-VE meets regularly and continues to discuss available data on transmissibility and severity of variants, and their impact on diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

[B] South Korea: training to make vaccines
Date: Wed 23 Feb 2022 10:32 EST
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-plans-second-hub-training-countries-make-covid-vaccines-2022-02-23/


The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday [23 Feb 2022] it has set up a hub in South Korea to train low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines and therapies, and is expanding its COVID-19 vaccine project to a further 5 nations. The new training hub comes after the UN agency set up a technology transfer hub in Cape Town, South Africa, last year [2021] to give companies from poor and middle-income countries the know-how to produce COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA technology.

The new hub outside Seoul will provide workforce training to all countries wishing to produce products such as vaccines, insulin, monoclonal antibodies, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing. "Currently, bio-manufacturing training facilities are located mainly in high income countries..., putting them out of reach for many lower income countries," he said.

The facility in South Korea is already carrying out training for companies based in the country and will now accommodate trainees from other countries, the WHO said. The WHO also said 5 more countries -- Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Serbia and Viet Nam -- will receive support from its mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa. The countries have been vetted by a group of experts and proved to have the capacity to move to production stage relatively quickly, the WHO said.

Last week, 6 African countries -- Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia -- signed up as the 1st on the continent to receive the technology to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

On Wednesday [23 Feb 2022], Tedros said that so far 20 countries had expressed interest in getting training on developing an mRNA vaccine by the South African hub. The WHO said it is currently prioritising countries that do not have mRNA technology but already have some manufacturing infrastructure and capacity.

[2] MIS-C: rare in vaccinated teens
Date: Wed 23 Feb 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/mis-c-rare-covid-vaccinated-teens-study-finds


Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is rare among 12- to 20-year-olds who have received COVID-19 vaccination, a study yesterday [22 Feb 2022] in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health suggests (https://bit.ly/3phMOsQ).

The study was based on 9 months of follow-up data on US children and young adults ages 12-20 who had received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine from 14 Dec 2020 to 31 Aug 2021. Only 21 cases out of more than 21 million vaccinated adolescents developed the rare disorder, which mimics Kawasaki's, during the follow-up period. Fifteen of the 21 were diagnosed as having COVID-19 despite vaccination, while 6 developed MIS-C for unknown reasons.

"Our results suggest that MIS-C cases following COVID-19 vaccination are rare and that the likelihood of developing MIS-C is much greater in children who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 5 years and older in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19," said Anna R. Yousaf, MD, the lead author and a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a Lancet press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943996).

Of the 21 patients, all were admitted to the hospital, with 12 requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). None died, and the median hospital stay was 7 days.

Of those who developed MIS-C, 11 received one dose and 10 received 2 doses of the vaccine before MIS-C onset. Median time from dose to hospitalization was 8 days for those who had received one vaccine dose and 5 days for those who had received 2.

The rate of one case per one million vaccinated adolescents is significantly lower than the rate of 200 MIS-C cases per million in unvaccinated children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the authors said.

In the 6 cases of MIS-C in the study that occurred in children who had gotten the vaccine but had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the authors said they were unable to determine if the vaccine contributed to the development of MIS-C, or if there were other reasons for the illness, such as other unrecognized conditions.

According to the CDC, there have been 59 deaths from MIS-C linked to COVID-19 infections, and 6851 cases since surveillance began in May 2020. The average age of an MIS-C patient in the United States is 9 years, 60% of patients are male, and 59% of cases have occurred in children who are Latino or Black (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#mis-national-surveillance).

Though most pediatric COVID-19 infections are mild and self-limiting, MIS-C has confounded clinicians since the beginning of the pandemic. MIS-C usually appears 2 to 6 weeks after COVID-19 infection, and it can cause major organ failure. Initial symptoms often include fever, rash, eye redness, and gastrointestinal complications.

In a commentary on the study, Joyce Chang, MD, MSCE, and Mary Beth Son, MD, both of Boston Children's Hospital, write that the study is reassuring (https://bit.ly/3ImAb7t). "As COVID-19 vaccines were being introduced to the paediatric population, there were fears that vaccination could induce a hyperinflammatory response akin to MIS-C," they said. "Concerns about post-vaccination MIS-C stemmed from uncertainties surrounding MIS-C's immunopathogenesis."

Instead, Chang and Son say the study results offer assurance that the vaccines do not trigger MIS-C in children. More work will be needed to track MIS-C in children age 5-11 years who were approved to get vaccinated just as this study came to an end.

"In evaluating individuals with a MIS-C clinical presentation after COVID-19 vaccination," the study authors concluded, "it is important to consider alternative diagnoses, and anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing might be helpful.... Our findings suggest that MIS-C without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare after COVID-19 vaccination."

[A] COVID vaccines and blood clots
Date: Wed 23 Feb 2022

Two independent UK studies published yesterday [22 Feb 2022] in PLOS Medicine find only a very slight risk of blood clots in the brain after receipt of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine and none after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Both studies were led by University of Edinburgh researchers.

The 1st study involved analysis of the electronic health records of 46 million adults in England, 21 million of whom were vaccinated during the study period of December 2020 to March 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003926). After adjusting for demographic characteristics and underlying illnesses, the risk of blood clots blocking an artery or vein was slightly lower in the 28 days after vaccination with either the AstraZeneca or AstraZeneca vaccine in people 70 years and older. In people younger than 70, the risk was similar in the 28 days but rose slightly for venous blood clots in the brain after AstraZeneca.

This finding corresponded to an estimated excess risk of 0.9-3 per million, depending on age and sex, about twice that of unvaccinated people. The authors, however, said the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination likely exceed the risk.

"We were able to show that these risks occur only in people under 70 years old with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and that the increase in risk is extremely small -- no more than a few people per million vaccinated," lead author William Whiteley, BM BCh, PhD, said in a PLOS news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943615).

The 2nd study involved a dataset of 11.6 million adults in England, Scotland, and Wales from December 2020 through June 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003927). The researchers compared rates of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a rare kind of blood clot in the brain, in the 90 days before vaccination with Pfizer or AstraZeneca with the rate in the 4 weeks after vaccination.

There was a small elevated risk of CVST after AstraZeneca vaccination, equivalent to one additional event per 4 million people vaccinated, or about twice as high as before vaccination. "This evidence may be useful in risk-benefit analyses of vaccine policies and in providing quantification of risks associated with vaccination to the general public," the researchers concluded.

[B] Digital health guidance for pandemics

A consensus statement by 13 international leaders in public health, digital health, and healthcare today [23 Feb 2022] in JAMA Network Open provides a roadmap for the implementation of digital health policy for healthcare and local, national, and international governments to address the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789277).

Digital health refers to the use of computing platforms, networks, software, and sensors to improve the ability to diagnose and treat diseases. The group created the Riyadh Declaration on Digital Health using the proceedings of the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit in August 2020. Stakeholders identified high-priority issues within the themes of team, transparency and trust, technology, "techquity" (addressing health disparities), and transformation.

Their 9 recommendations are to:
- Implement evidence-based protocols for effective communication to the public
- Work globally to address misinformation on social and mass media
- Develop a standard global dataset for public health reporting
- Ensure prioritization of digital health
- Provide technology to collect and share data quickly
- Develop a healthcare workforce able to address current and future public health crises
- Ensure that surveillance systems enable a public health response while respecting privacy
- Create digital personal tools and services to support disease prevention, testing, management, and vaccination
- Fund and create innovative surveillance systems for rapid preparedness and optimal global response

COVID-19 revealed weaknesses in global healthcare systems and public health responses, including the lack of long-term investment in digitization health information, collaboration, interoperability, and integrity, the authors said.

"The collection of data for public health surveillance was irregular...and few countries or communities had pandemic preparedness plans that enabled them to rapidly expand their data capture abilities to accurately monitor and track key outbreak information," they wrote. "Contact tracing had previously relied heavily on analog systems and could not be scaled up rapidly." Implementation of the recommendations could ultimately lower fatalities and unite countries in confronting current and future pandemics, the authors said.

In a related commentary, Lennart Reifels, PhD, of the University of Melbourne in Australia, and Virginia Murray, MBBS, of the UK Health Security Agency, said that the recommendations, along with the World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025, "provide crucial policy drivers to advance the digital health agenda and guide local stakeholders to establish digital health systems and protocols that facilitate future disaster health preparedness and emergency management" (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789276).

["A designated digital health agenda is bound to provide invaluable tools and insights to strengthen existing approaches to public health emergency management in relation to future epidemics and pandemics and, beyond that, preventing and managing the health risks and consequences of varied types of hazards and disasters." This is exactly the direction to be taken now to be better prepared for the next emerging pathogen. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 41 countries, including Germany (219 859), South Korea (170 006), Russia (137 642), Brazil (133 626), USA (101 841), Turkey (86 600), Viet Nam (81 856), Japan (77 810), France (66 833), Indonesia (61 488), Italy (49 162), Netherlands (40 569), UK (39 234), Austria (34 409), Spain (33 911), Malaysia (31 199), Denmark (27 473), Chile (25 200), Ukraine (25 062), Thailand (23 557), Australia (22 304), Poland (20 463), Singapore (20 312), Slovakia (19 075), Mexico (18 671), Switzerland (18 336), Norway (17 385), Greece (16 962), Iran (15 340), Czech Republic (14 353), India (14 148), Réunion (13 632), Singapore (13 623), Hungary (13 261), Portugal (13 158), Argentina (12 564), Israel (12 410), Ireland (11 654), Romania (11 477), Latvia (11 320), and Georgia (10 230), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 11 228 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 21 Feb 2022 to late 22 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 78 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 38 of the 78 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 17.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 38.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 30.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.90 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 430.19 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.93 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally; however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA
