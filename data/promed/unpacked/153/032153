Dry salted fish and bream recalled for possible botulism
--------------------------------------------------------
Krasnyi Oktyabr Inc in Brooklyn, NY, is recalling Vobla (Roach) Dry Eviscerated Salted Fish and Bream Dry Eviscerated Salted Fish because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium produces a toxin that can cause illness and death. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with the consumption of these products.

The recalled products are sold in un-coded clear, vacuum pack plastic bags. Each bag weighs 5.29 ounces [approx 150 grams]. The Vobla (Roach) Dry Eviscerated Salted Fish has a UPC number of 4606495-001308. The Bream - Dry Eviscerated Salted Fish has a UPC number of 4606495001346. The fish was imported from Russia and sold to retail stores in New York and California from February through April 2016.

Routine sampling and inspection by the FDA discovered that the fish was not properly eviscerated before processing. The viscera of fish are most likely to contain _C. botulinum_. This contamination will not cause the fish to look, smell, or taste spoiled.

If you purchased these products, do not eat them. Throw them away in a sealed or double bagged package, or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as, control of water activity, or pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.

Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches [7.6-12.7 cm] in length). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.

FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) (4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.

These products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL
