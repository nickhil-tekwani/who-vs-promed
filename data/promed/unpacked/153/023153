Viet Nam: 21st Avian Influenza Virus Case Confirmed
---------------------------------------------------
The human price in Asia's bird flu crisis mounted on Mon 16 Feb 2004 with
Viet Nam's 21st case of the disease confirmed, while Singapore's top health
official moved to ease fears of travel in Asia by saying it is safe going to
countries affected by the virus.
The 15-year-old boy in Viet Nam was hospitalized with fever, coughing, and
shortness of breath in northern Thanh Hoa province, where doctors said it
was unclear how he was infected. Many of the 20 people killed by bird flu
in Asia have come from poultry-farming families or otherwise had contact
with birds sickened by the outbreak, which was first reported in December
2003 in South Korea and now spans 10 countries. The boy's family raises no
poultry, and says he did not come in contact with birds, although his
neighborhood did experience a bird flu outbreak, health officials said. "We
were surprised that he got infected with the bird flu," said Dr. Le Trong
Dung of Thanh Hoa General Hospital.
In Singapore, which has so far kept free of the outbreak, acting Health
Minister Khaw Boon Wan told reporters he has assured his relatives they
should travel to Thailand despite concerns about bird flu in poultry farms
there. "There's no need to avoid infected countries," Khaw was quoted as
saying by The Straits Times newspaper. "However, the best precaution is to
stay away from farms. Stay in the city and there should be no problem."
Singapore plans to gas and burn thousands of healthy chickens on Wednesday
in a drill to prepare for any possible outbreak here. Health officials have
said the slaughter of infected chickens -- by workers adequately protected
with goggles, gloves, and other safety gear to ensure they themselves are
not infected -- is the best way to contain the outbreak.

China: RT-PCR Method Able to Detect Avian Influenza Virus in 4 Hours
--------------------------------------------------------------------
China has developed a method to test for avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in
4 hours, much shorter than the 21 days taken by the internationally-accepted
detection method recommended by the Paris-based World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE), according to a meeting held on Sat 14 Feb 2004 in Beijing to
approve the method.
The new method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was jointly developed by the Beijing Administration for Entry-and-Exit
Inspection and Quarantine and a company in Shenzhen, south Guangdong
Province. The method has been assessed and approved by experts from the
Ministry of Science and Technology, the State Administration of Quality
Supervision,Inspection and Quarantine, Agricultural University of China, and
the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

[So-called "real-time" RT-PCR is indeed very fast, but needs to be carefully
controlled with parallel testing by the slower method before it can be
pronounced free of false positives and false negatives. - Mod.JW]
