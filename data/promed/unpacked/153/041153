The Health & Sanitation Council determined that the source of the _Salmonella_ outbreak which affected 34 children from the municipal nursery in Arguineguin (Gran Canaria island) was located in the food served in this center, and it may have become contaminated because of "hygiene deficiencies" when manipulating the food.

The Canary Islands Government published today, 22 Mar 2013, the conclusions of analyses performed in this nursery in Mogan Municipality, after 17 children between 1 and 2 years of age were hospitalized last week because of abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and malaise.

Data collected by the General Direction for Public Health revealed that _Salmonella_ were present in the foods served in the nursery and they finally declared that 34 children became sick (including the 17 children who were hospitalized).

Also, it was found that 10 workers in the center were _Salmonella_ carriers and one of them had a sick leave 2 or 3 weeks before this occurrence because of nausea and diarrheal disease.

The Health & Sanitation Council considers that "the outbreak could have been originated because of the presence of asymptomatic _Salmonella_ carriers and because of hygiene deficiencies when manipulating the foods served in the aforementioned nursery, and this led to having food that was already contaminated before being served and eaten."

The report states that _Salmonella_ were found only in one portion of Russian salad (potato salad), but not in other foods analyzed (beef stew, mashed vegetables, and pears).

However, the report adds on "everything points out to indicate that more than one dish was contaminated."

The 1st case was detected in the evening of 11 Mar 2013, and the last one was detected on 14 Mar 2013. The average incubation time was 23 hours, which is compatible with acute gastroenteritis caused by _Salmonella_.

[It is certainly likely that one of the food workers was the reservoir of this enteric pathogen. It is important to derive the microbiological and genetic data of the isolated strains to confirm the source. Salmonellosis tends to be a more severe disease in the very young and very old as well as the immunocompromised. 50 percent of the cases required hospitalization in this outbreak. The total number of children in the nursery school is not stated, so an attack rate cannot be calculated. The serotype of _S._ enterica involved is also not stated. - Mod.LL
