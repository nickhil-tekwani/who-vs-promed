Naturally occurring anthrax is blamed for the death of a bison on the
Flying D Ranch, health officials with the Montana Department of
Livestock said Wednesday [14 Jul 2010]. But so far, there has not
been a repeat of an anthrax outbreak that killed nearly 300 animals
on the ranch in 2008.

Carcass samples taken from a dead yearling heifer revealed that the
animal died from exposure to naturally occurring anthrax, Department
of Livestock spokesman Steve Merritt said in a statement.

The animal was found Monday [12 Jul 2010] "near a pasture where the
disease killed 287 bison 2 years ago [2008]," Merritt said. "The
pasture has been quarantined ... and the ranch is monitoring its herd
to quickly identify any additional cases that may occur."

According to state veterinarian Marty Zalusky, most of the 2500 bison
living on the Flying D were vaccinated since the 2008 outbreak,
though "the dead bison had not been vaccinated due to its young age."

Because of the vaccinations, "a repeat of outbreak in 2008, which
lasted 3 weeks, isn't likely," he said.

According to the Department of Livestock release, "producers in the
immediate area are encouraged to work with their local veterinarian
to learn more about risks, prevention, and treatment of the disease.
Anthrax vaccines are effective and relatively inexpensive.

"If your area has a history of anthrax, it's not a bad idea to
discuss prevention strategies with your veterinarian," Zaluski said.
"You need to be aware that the disease is there, just lying in the
ground, and that there is no way to predict when it might surface."

Anthrax is caused by a naturally occurring bacterium, _Bacillus
anthracis_, according to the department. Spores of the bacteria can
lie dormant in the soil for decades, then become active under certain
conditions, typically after climactic events such as heavy rains or
flooding preceded by drought. Animals are exposed to the disease by
grazing or consuming forage or water contaminated with spores.

Clinical signs of the disease include labored breathing, rising body
temperature, staggering, depression, unconsciousness, and
convulsions, the department said. Untreated animals may die within
24-48 hours of exposure, and one or more animals are typically found
dead without any recognition of early clinical signs.

Anthrax can be spread from animals to humans, the department said.
However, there hasn't been a reported case of human anthrax since
1961. Human infection usually takes the form of skin lesions and is
generally the result of occupational exposure involving direct
contact with infected animals or animal products such as wool, hides,
and horns.

The anthrax bacterium "is fragile and easily inactivated by common
disinfectants or exposure to moderate temperatures, and as such,
poses virtually no risk to the food chain," according to the
department. He added that because of the 2008 incident, "the positive
test was not entirely unexpected."

[We have been in touch with the ranch veterinarian, David Hunter, who
is very experienced, and Danny the ranch manager. Apparently the
bison were very nervous and edgy in the 'Basin' pasture and the
decision was made to move them up valley to another pasture. Soon
after the move the heifer was found dead. It is presumed that she was
incubating the infection during the move. The herd itself soon
settled down and were their normal selves. It is speculated that they
were fighting infections and were thus behaving oddly. Some 25 are
due to be darted in the next 10 days and the serology tested for
raised titres.

Last autumn [2009] the adult cows, older heifers, and cadet bulls
were vaccinated but the adult bulls are too big to run through the
chutes and therefore could not be vaccinated. As these animals run
the highest risk of anthrax, they are being very carefully watched.

Back in 2008 some 80 elk died on the mountain ridges. So a flight was
flown today (Fri 16 Jul 2010) to look for any sick or dead elk. None
were reported but 8/10 radio collared elk were seen. Our thanks to
Dave and Danny for the updates. - Mod.MHJ]
