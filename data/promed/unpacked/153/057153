Bacterial Wilt of Beans (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) Caused by _Curtobacterium
flaccumfaciens_ in Southeastern Spain.

Accepted for publication 29 Sep 2005.
Symptoms of bacterial wilt were observed on common beans (cv. Donna) in
southeastern Spain. From samples collected in 4 different fields (coast of
Granada), a bacterium was isolated with the following characteristics:
gram-positive, aerobic rods with yellow colonies, strictly oxidative,
oxidase negative, galactose, sucrose, erythritol, mannitol, sorbitol and
m-inositol were not used as a sole carbon source, and hydrolysis of casein
was positive. These results coincide with what is expected for
_Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ pv _flaccumfaciens_ (3).
One isolate from each field was selected for pathogenicity tests using 2
different methods. Bacterial suspensions (approximately 100 million CFU/ml)
were spray-inoculated on bean seedlings of cv. Andecha (10 plants with 3
true leaves for each isolate). Beans were covered with transparent plastic
bags for 2 days and held at 25 deg C and 80 percent relative humidity with
a 12-h photoperiod. In addition, 10 healthy seeds of cv. Andecha were
soaked in bacterial suspensions (ca. 100 million CFU/ml) for 1 h and
incubated at 25 deg C (2). Seedlings sprayed with distilled sterile water
and seeds soaked in water served as controls. With both methods of
inoculation, assays were conducted twice. Results were recorded after 3 weeks.
Symptoms that developed on plants after infection with the 4 isolates were
similar to those observed in the field. They included golden yellow
necrotic leaf lesions and wilting. Wilting was more pronounced in the field
and when inoculation was performed by spraying seedlings rather than by
soaking seeds. Control plants did not develop symptoms and grew bigger than
the inoculated plants. 2 pathogenic isolates were identified through
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The genes were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (1) and their nucleotide sequences (1418 bp) proved to be
identical (Accession No. AJ879110).
Comparison of these sequences with databases showed that they were also
identical to those of _C. flaccumfaciens_ strains LMG 3645 and P 259/26
(Accession Nos. AJ312209 and AJ310414) and _Curtobacterium_ sp. strains
2384 and 3426 (Accession Nos. AY688359 and AY688360).
In Spain, the bean pathogen _C. flaccumfaciens_ was first isolated from
seeds during 2001 (4). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report
of damage caused by this bacterium in the field. Bacterial wilt has been
recorded, but often not substantiated, in several countries from North and
South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Europe.

[_Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ subsp. _flaccumfaciens_ (Cff) grows
throughout the water-conducting tissues of the plant and impedes water
movement, resulting in a wilt. Symptom development is favored by
temperatures greater than 32 deg C. Infection is often caused by the
planting of infected seed, but Cff may also survive in infested crop
debris. Cff bacteria are more confined to internal infection of plant
vascular tissue, and apparently are not spread as readily by rain or
movement of machinery among wet plants as compared to the halo blight
pathogen (_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _phaseolica_ ) or the common bacterial
blight pathogen (_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _phaseoli_). Infection
through natural openings on the plant are rare, but hailstorms and wounding
favor infection. Cff is disseminated among fields by irrigation water and
movement of infested crop debris or contaminated seed.
Disease management strategies include planting high-quality certified seed
free from the bacterial wilt pathogen. There are varietal differences in
their susceptibility to bacterial wilt, and resistant or tolerant varieties
should be planted if available. A 2-year crop rotation to non-hosts such
as small grains is recommended. Avoid reuse of irrigation water if possible
and practice strict sanitation of crop debris and volunteer beans to reduce
pathogen survival between bean crops. Antibiotic seed treatment can reduce
surface contamination of seed, but chemical controls are most effective
when integrated with sound cultural practices.
