Korea's pork exports to Japan have been deadlocked. In a telegram sent to
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry through its embassy in Seoul, the
Japanese government said that it will suspend pork imports from South Korea
beginning April 1, if the meat came from vaccinated pigs or pigs raised
within 10 km of the region where pig cholera broke out.
Related to this, the ministry will soon dispatch working-level officials to
Japan to engage in bilateral negotiations on the matter, a ministry
spokesman said yesterday. However, the ministry dose not expect Japan to
suddenly stop Korean pork imports starting April 1, he said.
As Japan still vaccinates pigs against cholera, it is unreasonable that
Japan would suspend imports of vaccinated pork from Korea, said the official
who requested anonymity.
However, the Korean ministry feels the need to hold talks with its Japanese
counterpart concerning Japan's move to expand the scope of the pork import
ban from the present within 2 km of the cholera outbreak region to within 10
km, he said.
In preparation for Japan's move to root out pig cholera and declare a
cholera-free region before 2001, the Seoul government will also work out
proper measures to prevent the outbreaks of cholera in the country, he
said.
Commenting that Korea's pork exports have been centered on Japan, he said
that the nation's pork exports to Japan are expected to reach $350 million
worth this year, up from $313 million in 1998.

[Hog cholera is a contagious febrile disease of pigs. In Europe it is often
termed classical swine fever, to avoid confusion with African swine fever.
Both names, hog cholera and classical swine fever, continue to be used
today. Hog cholera has the potential to cause devastating epidemics,
especially in countries that do not vaccinate or are free of the disease, so
that the entire pig population is susceptible. The main source of infection
is the pig, either live animals or uncooked pig products. Another major risk
is accidental introduction of the virus through imported pig meat and meat
products that find their way into the porcine food chain, generally through
feeding of waste food.
Current vaccines are the live attenuated type, either derivatives of the
lapinized [passed through rabbits *C* strain, or strains adapted from cell
cultures. Although the vaccines are effective at controlling clinical
disease, they allow the virus to continue circulating subclinically.
Therefore, vaccination is inappropriate in countries or regions with an
eradication policy - Mod.TG
