This is in response to the request for information regarding an alleged
outbreak of legionellosis associated with a hotel in Reno, Nevada. This
possible outbreak has been reported to the Nevada State Health Division. We
were unable to confirm the diagnosis of Legionnaire's Disease in the husband
and wife who were initially reported. Discussion with the infection control
nurse and the treating physician at St. John's hospital in Jackson, Wyoming
indicated a diagnosis of bronchitis secondary to streptococcal pneumonia.
No tests for legionella were ordered.
The husband and wife had attended a large convention in Reno and some of the
organizers alerted other attendees via a web site to this unconfirmed
diagnosis. As a result many individuals have reported to their physicians
with a variety of symptoms and a history of "exposure" to Legionnaire's
Disease. In several cases tests for Legionnaire's Disease have been ordered
but are still pending.
In summary, we have not, to date, been able to confirm any cases of
Legionnaire's Disease associated with this convention.
