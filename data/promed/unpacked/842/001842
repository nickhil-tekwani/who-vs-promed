Exposure to Mumps During Air Travel - United States, April 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The state of Iowa has been experiencing a large mumps outbreak that
began in December 2005 (1). As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515
possible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of
Public Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across
Iowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is
under investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =
4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska
(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).
The reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.
Mumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific
prodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,
followed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of
parotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70
percent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).
Approximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly
50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory
symptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis
(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),
meningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.
Transmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or
saliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from
exposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days
before symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.
IDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were
potentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial
flights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial
airline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are
listed below by date, carrier, and flight number:
Northwest Airline (NWA) flights:
26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota
26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan
27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,
DC--Reagan National
29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to
Minneapolis, Minnesota
29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa
American Airlines (AA) flights:
2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)
2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest
Arkansas Regional [NAR])
2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri
2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa
Persons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps
within 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an
health-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant
for mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland
inflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately
to public health officials.
A multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state
health departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed
passengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index
cases). This investigation is using a new software application,
eManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and
Quarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign
passenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely
identification of exposed persons. These data are securely
transmitted to state and territorial health departments via the
Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of
potentially exposed passengers.
Incidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after
vaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine
vaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease
in the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to
be attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of
respiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on
several factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)
infectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen
by infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious
passengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)
hygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;
and 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other
respiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).
Exposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has
not been described previously.

[ProMED-mail has been covering this unusual outbreak due to the size
of the outbreak, the genotype involved (genotype G, most recently
associated with outbreaks in the United Kingdom) and now the
additional information that there may be spread to neighboring states
and the possibility of exposure during airline travel. The mention of
a new software application "eManifest" is interesting, and one
wonders whether it shortens the time necessary to identify passengers
at risk of exposure to diseases while traveling. We look forward to
hearing more about this tool. - Mod.MPP]
