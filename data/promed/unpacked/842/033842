Influenza Survey Uncovers Key Differences Between Bird Flu And Human Flu
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists have found key features that distinguish influenza viruses
found in birds from those that infect humans. Specific mutations
linked to immune suppression and viral replications differ between
bird and human flu viruses could be used to monitor emerging pandemics.
The St. Jude team used a mathematical technique to identify specific
amino acid building blocks that are statistically more likely to
appear in avian influenza virus proteins and those that are more
likely to be in human influenza virus proteins. The differences in
these amino acids can be used as markers to track changes in H5N1
avian influenza strains that threaten humans.
"Influenza mutates rapidly, so that any marker that is not the same
in bird flu but remains stable in human flu is likely to be
important," said David Finkelstein, Ph.D., research associate at the
St. Jude Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology. "If
human specific markers start accumulating in bird flu viruses that
infect humans, that suggests that the bird flu may be adapting to
humans and could spread."
The researchers also found that various strains of the H5N1 that have
infected humans are more likely to contain human markers than are
H5N1 strains that have not infected humans. Only occasionally have
H5N1 samples obtained from human patients shown any of these markers,
and no H5N1 strain has permanently acquired any of them.
The investigators cautioned that there is no proof yet that the human
markers in H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses directly contribute
to the ability of these viruses to cause pandemics among humans; and
H5N1 is not any more adapted to humans today than in the past.
However, the fact that the bird viruses accumulate and retain these
markers after infecting humans suggests that these changes are
important. Therefore, scientists should monitor avian influenza
viruses to see if they are acquiring human markers.
The St. Jude team identified 32 specific locations in proteins where
a gene mutation caused the existing amino acid to be substituted with
a different amino acid. What made these 32 changes special was that
influenza from birds differed from the influenza that was in humans.
After the avian influenza infected humans, the amino acid changes are
stable in the proteins and remain stable over time. Therefore, these
markers can be used to distinguish influenza viruses that infect
birds from those that infect humans.
The researchers discovered these markers by computationally surveying
the sequence of amino acids in 10 671 proteins from avian influenza
viruses and 13 757 proteins from human influenza viruses. The survey
identified 32 persistent markers that exist in 5 bird and human virus
proteins: PA, NP, M1, NS1 and PB2. These markers stand out as obvious
differences between bird and human viruses, and many appear in
regions where host protein and viral replication occur. The
researchers did not determine what functional role the markers play
in the life of the viruses.
For example, 26 of the 32 markers discovered are found in NP, PB2 and
PA, which help to form a complex of proteins critical for the
replication of virus genes. The other 6 persistent host markers are
in M1 and NS1 proteins. M1 is known to bind to a protein in cells
that enhances the replication of viruses; and NS1 plays a role in
suppressing the host immune response. Therefore, the markers in M1
and NS1 might represent key mutations needed to improve the ability
of the virus to suppress the immune system and enhance viral replication.
The St. Jude team also studied markers in influenza viruses that
caused pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 -- outbreaks thought to have
been caused by avian influenza viruses that adapted to humans. The
study focused on the viruses isolated from humans early in each
pandemic in order to determine which markers the viruses had recently
acquired just before they sparked the outbreak. The researchers
showed that 13 of the 32 markers identified by their survey had
remained stable in these viruses, and, like the other viruses, these
markers were distributed among PB2, PA, NP and M1 -- the proteins
linked to virus replication. "This suggests that these 13 sites are
required for pandemic influenza to fully function," Finkelstein said.
The researchers also showed that the H1N1 virus that caused the 1918
pandemic -- the most deadly pandemic known -- already contained 13 of
the 32 markers early in the outbreak; and acquired the other 19
markers within 10 to 20 years, acquiring the preferred human
influenza amino acids in stages. Eventually, descendents of the
pandemic virus became the seasonal flu outbreaks rather than deadly pandemics.
"While we can't directly estimate how long it would take an avian
virus such as H5N1 to acquire these traits, we can use these markers
to roughly measure the distance between an avian influenza and a
pandemic," said Clayton Naeve, Ph.D., St. Jude Hartwell Center
director and the paper's senior author.
The current study used data obtained in part from the first
large-scale study of avian influenza virus genomes, conducted at St.
Jude's Hartwell Center, which doubled the amount of genetic
information available on the genes and proteins of these viruses. The
aim of that project was to enable researchers to gain insights into
H5N1 and to provide the first fundamental insight into the evolution
of influenza viruses in nature -- the source of all influenza viruses
that affect humans, domestic animals and birds.
A report on this work will appear in the advanced online edition of
"Journal of Virology" (doi:10.1128/JVI.00921-07).

[This report advances understanding of the genetic properties of the
influenza A viruses that differentially infect birds and humans.
Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequences of 10 671 proteins
from avian influenza viruses and 13 757 proteins from human influenza
viruses has revealed 32 distinguishing locations (genetic markers),
26 of which involve the replication proteins NP, PB2 and PA, and the
other six the M1 and NS1 proteins involved in replication and host
response to virus infection. Perhaps a greater degree of complexity
than previously supposed.
This analysis defines genetic markers for the systematic
differentiation of avian and human viruses, but it does not by itself
predict rates of change in the host range of influenza viruses nor
directions of change - Mod.CP]
