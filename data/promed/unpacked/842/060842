------------------------------------------------------------------
This morning there was a ProMed posting about Equine viral arteritis in horses. It contained a pretty significant error. The Coggins test is for equine infectious anemia [EIA], a different disease, without cure or vaccine. EIA is transmitted by contaminated needles or blood sucking insects, generally biting flies.

[Dr Bedell is responding to a recently published post. The original article, reproduced in the posting, stated: "The troublesome pathogen, which causes equine viral arteritis, can be detected with a Coggins blood test."

Indeed, Coggins blood test is used for equine INFECTIOUS anemia (EIA) while serum neutralization is used for equine VIRAL arteritis (EVA).

My apologies to the readership for not having corrected that statement and thanks to Dr Bedell for reminding me to make that correction. - Mod.TG]
