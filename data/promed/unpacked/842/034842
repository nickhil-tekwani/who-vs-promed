Iran's deputy health minister, Kamal Heidari, says 164 measles cases have been detected in the country, blaming it on the influx of Afghan refugees into Iran. He noted that last year [2021], Iran received a certificate from the World Health Organization for the elimination of the disease and this achievement coincides with an outbreak of measles in Afghanistan.

He said the entry of Afghan nationals into Iran and their presence in different cities have caused concern and cases of measles have been reported in those areas. The deputy health minister said the cases are inpatients and outpatients and that all healthcare personnel are ready to deal with this situation.

Heidari said the outbreak is threatening the efforts of Iran to contain measles, adding that a vaccination plan must be put in place for foreigners to boost the level of inoculation against the disease. He said vaccination of people against the disease must be pursued seriously so that the outbreak is contained, but that people who are fully inoculated against measles should, however, not be worried.

[2] Afghanistan: outbreak
Date: Fri 1 Apr 2022

Currently, 180 children and their extended families occupy a paediatric ward at the Faryab Provincial Hospital that has the bed capacity and manpower to care for just 30 patients. It is the only remaining hospital in Afghanistan's northern Faryab Province, home to 2.5 million people -- and it is tackling a devastating surge of a childhood killer.

Afghanistan is in the midst of a major measles outbreak. Already this year [2022], 43 000 children have been infected and 214 have died, according to the World Health Organisation -- with 97% of fatalities among children under 5. This is already more deaths from measles than the country saw in the entirety of 2021.

Dr Fawad Masomi believes these figures are a gross underestimate. Afghanistan has been crippled by an economic crisis and many families in Faryab Province cannot afford to travel to the hospital; many measles victims are being quietly buried in unmarked graves near their homes. "I have been a paediatric doctor for 8 years and I have never seen a measles outbreak like this," he says. "I would say we are seeing around 4 times as many cases this year [2022] as usual."

Neither the Taliban nor international aid organisations have been able to curb spiralling infections, and weekly case numbers are rising in all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. The main reason for the surge, says Dr Masomi, is the conflict that preceded the Taliban's return to power in August [2021]. The violence wrought havoc on immunisation campaigns and less than 50% of children are vaccinated nationwide, with these figures falling as low as 18% and 3% respectively in the provinces of Helmand and Uruzgan, according to WHO.

There is also hesitancy among some conservative Islamic communities, despite the spread of the deadly disease. Logistics also presents a major challenge. Fighting destroyed the country's cold chain vaccine network, meaning many of the children who did receive doses were given vaccine that had not been stored properly -- rendering them ineffective.

The United States and its allies had provided 80% of the previous Afghan government's budget, but this money was withdrawn when the Taliban returned to power. Many banks are on the verge of collapse amidst a nationwide liquidity crisis, public sector salaries have gone unpaid and international aid agencies face huge funding shortages. Meanwhile, The United Nations Development Programme estimates that 90% of Afghans will fall below the poverty line by the end of 2022. This economic crisis has resulted in widespread food insecurity, while more than 3.5 million children require immediate medical support to combat malnutrition, according to the UN. Hunger only worsens a measles infection.

"What is so heart-breaking is not just seeing Afghan children's health status flipping back and all the gains that have been made being undone, it is also because it is man made, because of the sanctions. The poorest and most vulnerable in Afghan society are paying the price," says Noor Hassanien, acting country director for Afghanistan at Save the Children. "The rise of malnutrition among Afghan children is weakening their immune system to measles and also making them a lot more vulnerable to complications, like pneumonia and brain damage."...

In mid-March [2022], a WHO-funded measles vaccination campaign was launched. But, as it will only reach 1.2 million children it is just a "drop in the ocean," says Ms Hassanein. A Taliban Ministry of Health spokesperson told The Telegraph they were planning to ramp up vaccination efforts over the upcoming months.

But up to 90% of Afghan hospitals are facing closure due to funding restraints after money from the World Bank, European Commission and the USAID for the country's public healthcare sector was withdrawn; many have already shut their doors. "In some provinces we don't have any major hospitals left and those that remain don't have access to drugs, oxygen or funding to pay their staff," says Dr Waris Aria, chief executive of Tabish, an NGO working to improve Afghan public healthcare. "We are seeing this epidemic of measles because there is not enough money to do vaccination campaigns or provide services for those who contract the disease."

In Faryab, shortages of both staff and resources are also acute. Dr Fawad Masomi is one of only 6 doctors and 6 nurses in the hospital's paediatric department. Many former doctors and nurses fled the country in the wake of the Taliban's takeover or left after the hospital was unable to pay wages for 3 months. "Our personal efforts are not enough, we only have a few staff and so many of them don't even have the qualifications to give injections to children. We break down often because we can't do enough to save the children with what we have," he told The Telegraph. "Sometimes we only have one oxygen canister for every 4 children admitted, many of them lay on the floor."

But, there are a few signs of change on the horizon. On Thursday [31 Mar 2022], the largest UN humanitarian appeal in history was launched, with a virtual pledging conference in Geneva aiming to raise 3.3 billion pounds [USD 4.3 billion] for Afghanistan. So far, just 1.85 billion pounds has been raised. ...

[3] Republic of the Congo

Health authorities in the Republic of Congo have declared a measles epidemic. Pointe Noire and the district of Ntchamba-Nsassi in the south of the country are among the most affected areas with more than 3400 cases, including 78 deaths, mainly among children under 5, according to the Ministry of Health and Population.

"We came here because my child had high fevers, I was told it was measles and that there was no vaccine. But the treatments are expensive" complained one mother interviewed by Africanews. "We are confined, we are in the same bed, how are we going to sleep? It's deplorable really, and the Congolese state should help us with the treatments" pleaded another mother.

The measles vaccination campaign was interrupted during the state of emergency due to COVID-19, as well as other preconceived ideas, according to the medical profession."Remember that we are in the tumultuous period of corona, and in this period there were a lot of problems, a lot of financial difficulties, a lot of travel difficulties, and therefore a lot of parents listened to bad advice telling them that vaccinations are bad things" said Dr Bandoho Mombo Aime, a paediatric vaccinologist.

"Many parents here say that they have noticed that rashes, as a usual symptom of measles, appear only very late during this wave of measles epidemic in Congo. Consequence: cases are already in the terminal phase when they arrive at the emergency room" said Africanews reporter, Cedric Lyonnel Sehossolo.

"It's a fact, many parents take their children to hospital only when they're already in a complicated phase, so as soon as you notice that your child has a fever, any child who has a fever, the most important thing is to go to hospital" advised Dr Ndongui Kibalou Dany, head doctor of the paediatric emergency unit.

The Congolese government and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation are preparing the roll-out of a vaccination campaign by 15 May 2022.
