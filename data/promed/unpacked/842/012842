Regarding the culturing of food for _Shigella spp._, from what I understand
from conversations with Wallace Andrews, US Food and Drug Administration
food microbiology testing expert, the approved methods for isolating
shigellae from foods are positively abysmal (compared with those for other
enteric pathogens) and can only detect contamination rates in the order of
10 000 to 100 000 bacilli per gram of product.

[Dr Schaffner's comments are appreciated. It is stated in the "Bad Bug
Book" from the USA Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap19.html>) that the
foods associated with transmission of shigellosis are salads (such as
potato, tuna, or macaroni), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and
poultry. Contaminated water and poor handling by food workers are the usual
methods for contamination of the food. The document further underscores Dr
Schaffer's comments that shigellae are difficult to demonstrate in food
because of poor isolation procedures but state that genetic probes are
being developed.
It should be noted that despite the fact that all species of the organism
have been linked to foodborne outbreaks, _S. sonnei_ is the leading cause
of food associated shigellosis. The other species are more likely to be
linked to fecally contaminated water. - Mod.LL]
