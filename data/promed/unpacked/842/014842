---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
While the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied in blood, relatively little is known about the antibody response in saliva and its relationship to systemic antibody levels. Here, we profiled by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) IgG, IgA, and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) in serum and saliva of acute and convalescent patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 ranging from 3-115 days post-symptom onset (PSO), compared to negative controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were readily detected in serum and saliva, with peak IgG levels attained by 16-30 days PSO. Longitudinal analysis revealed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly decayed, while IgG antibodies remained relatively stable up to 105 days PSO in both biofluids. Lastly, IgG, IgM, and to a lesser extent, IgA responses to spike and RBD in the serum positively correlated with matched saliva samples. This study confirms that serum and saliva IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are maintained in the majority of COVID-19 patients for at least 3 months PSO. IgG responses in saliva may serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 based on their correlation with serum IgG responses.

Introduction
------------
We know very little about the local antibody response at the site of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters the naso- and oro-pharyngeal tracts where it subsequently replicates (15). For this reason, nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are used to test for virus using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect viral RNA. However, saliva has also been shown to be an effective biofluid for testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA (16-19). This makes sense given that pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 shedding precedes viral replication in the lungs (15), and, like cytomegalovirus (20,21), the salivary glands themselves can be a reservoir for the virus (22). Yet in spite of the oral cavity being a site for viral replication, few studies have examined anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this compartment. In this study, we examined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response over a 115-day period in the serum and saliva from n=439 (serum) and n=128 (saliva) patients with COVID-19, compared to controls. Antigen-specific IgG in both biofluids was maximally detected by 16-30 days PSO and did not drastically decline in relative level as late as 105--115 days PSO. In contrast, antigen-specific IgM and IgA were rapidly induced but subsequently declined in both serum and saliva. In serum, neutralizing antibodies reached their maximum by 31-45 days PSO and slowly declined up to 105 days, with a more pronounced drop in the last blood draw (105-115 days PSO) Importantly, IgG and IgM levels against both antigens were strongly correlated across paired serum and saliva samples (n=71), indicating that saliva can be used for monitoring the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, the systemic and mucosal IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 is sustained over a 3-month period, while the IgM and IgA response occurs early and is transient.

We observed no drastic decline in levels of anti-spike, anti-RBD, or anti-NP IgG levels over a 3-month period. The same was true for the antigen-specific measurements in saliva (anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG). On the other hand, similar to other findings (28, 29), IgA and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were found to decline in both serum and saliva.

In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 spike persists in the saliva and the serum, and that this response can be correlated between the 2 biofluids [serum and saliva], particularly for IgG. Given that the virus can also be measured in saliva by PCR (16-19), using saliva as a biofluid for both virus and antibody measurements may have some diagnostic value. Since SARS-CoV-2 initially replicates in the oro- and nasopharyngeal tracts, in the future it will be critical to characterize the nature and kinetics of salivary antibodies at the earliest time points post-infection in contact-traced individuals in order to determine if there are correlates of protection that impact viral setpoint and COVID-19 disease progression.

[These findings support those of others who have observed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in saliva. The use of a single specimen type to test for viral RNA and antibody has distinct advantages. In addition, saliva is easily obtained in a non-invasive manner. The study only went through 115 days. It would be good to test specimens at later time points following symptom onset to determine limit of detectability over time, especially in cases with varying degrees of severity, and including asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, it would be good to know whether the antibody being measured by the ELISA is protective. The investigators used a protein-based surrogate neutralization ELISA approach where the ability of antibodies (in serum in this case) to prevent the association of soluble biotinylated ACE2 to immobilized RBD was measured. But a standard neutralization assay with infectious virus would be informative.

Abstract
--------
Background
Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.

Methods
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.

Results
A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (CI 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; CI 1.12 to 1.49; P less than 0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an 8-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio 1.5; CI 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio 0.73; CI 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).

Conclusions
Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

[This is the 1st antiviral agent shown to affect disease duration. Remdesivir (GS-5734), is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase with in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and was identified early as a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19 because of its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This was a double bind clinical trial involving 60 trial sites and 13 subsites in the United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1). The primary outcome was defined as number of days from to recovery.

In the discussion the authors mention that improvement held up with glucocorticoid treatment, suggesting that the simultaneous administration of remdesivir and steroids might be synergistic.

The authors conclude with "However, given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient for all patients. Current strategies are evaluating remdesivir in combination with modifiers of the immune response (such as the Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor baricitinib in ACTT-2, and interferon beta-1a in ACTT-3). A variety of therapeutic approaches including novel antivirals, modifiers of the immune response or other intrinsic pathways, and combination approaches are needed to continue to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19."

While helpful, it is unfortunately not the "silver bullet" hoped for.

[India the USA, and Brazil, are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (70 824), followed by the USA (57 539) and Brazil (27 182) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 6437 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (7-8 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include India, USA, Brazil, France (18 129), Argentina (15 454), UK (17 540), Spain (12 105), Russia (11 493), Colombia (8496), Netherlands (5822), Ukraine (5397), Czech Republic (5397) and Mexico (5300). A total of 43 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 19 of the 40 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, and 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.9%.

Coleman Schaefer has put together growth curves based on daily case reports for the countries in the WHO European region (based on daily reports captured on Worldometer). There are 3 curves, based on differing levels of cumulative case reports.
- The 1st set of curves at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/COVID%20Europe%201%20OCT8_1602218817.pdf includes those countries with a current cumulative case count above 200 000.
- The 2nd set of curves at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/COVID%20Europe%202%20OCT8_1602218902.pdf includes those countries with current cumulative case reports greater than 25 000 but less than 200 000.
- The 3rd set of curves at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/COVID%20Europe%203%20OCT8_1602218953.pdf includes those countries with cumulative case counts less than 25 000.

Each of these pdf files clearly highlights the increases in transmission ongoing in many of the European countries.

Impression: Global 7 day averages have increased with reports from the past 72 hours. There is still an apparent though lesser decline in reports from India, and Brazil. The USA has an increase of 9.7% in 7 day averages of newly confirmed cases and a decrease of 0.86% in 7 day averages of reported deaths. A common observation is while there are increases in reported cases, the decrease in reported deaths is stabilizing. - Mod.MPP]
