The Ministry of Health is investigating 2 suspected Ebola deaths in
Bundibugyo, a week after the country was declared free of the
disease. The victims who were residents of Bwera in Kasese but
working in Bundibugyo, died last week. The primary health care state
minister, Emmanuel Otaala, said: "It may or may not be Ebola. We
cannot tell now. We need to get the results and see what to do next."
He said a team of investigators had been sent to Bundibugyo.

Dr Monica Musenero, an epidemiologist at the Health Ministry, said
the samples were expected at the Uganda Virus Research Institute in
Entebbe, later yesterday [Sun 2 Mar 2008]. "We cannot dismiss the
possibility of Ebola, but we have to be patient and wait for the
results," she said.

A teacher at Bundikeki Primary School, succumbed to the disease on
Sunday afternoon [2 Mar 2008] after being admitted to hospital on
Tuesday [26 Feb 2009]. Health officials say he was complaining of
pain in joints and headache. He had been sharing a bed with a teacher
of Bukangama Primary School, who passed away a week earlier after
showing similar symptoms. [These are the 2 individuals referred to in
the opening sentence].

The New Vision has learnt that there is also growing panic by several
people that were in contact with the deceased. But Otaala urged
residents to be calm. "We should not panic. It is not yet confirmed
that this is Ebola and we have enough manpower to handle all
situations." Samuel Kazinga, the resident district commissioner, also
allayed fears that the strange disease was Ebola.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health
declared Uganda Ebola-free on 22 Feb 2008. The Ebola Virus struck
Bundibugyo in November last year [2007] leaving more than 40 people
dead.

[Although the soundness of the preliminary diagnosis of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever cannot be judged from the scant information
contained in this report, it may be that the announcement of the end
of the Ebola fever outbreak by WHO and the Ugandan Ministry of Health
was premature. A clear account of the outbreak in Bundibugyo and the
final death toll has still to be published. Further developments are
awaited.
