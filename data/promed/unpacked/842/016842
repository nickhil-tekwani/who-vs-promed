[Several species of hantavirus may be present in Panama. It is not possible
to deduce the identity of the pathogen from this report. Previously, 2
hantaviruses have been isolated in Panama: Choclo virus (reservoir host
_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) and Calabazo virus (reservoir host _Zygodontomys
brevicauda_). Only the former has been associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (see: Vincent et al., Virology 277:14-19, 2000). Further
information on the identity of the hantavirus and rodent reservoir
implicated in the current outbreak would be welcomed. The reader is
referred to the comment in Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (WV, VA ex
WV)(03) 20040722.2001 for information on the involvement of cardiac
insufficiency in hantavirus pathogenesis. - Mod.CP]
