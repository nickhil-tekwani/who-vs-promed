CITRUS MOSAIC DISEASE - INDIA

It has previously been reported that citrus mosaic disease (EU Annex II/A1)
is associated with a badnavirus (EPPO RS 96/137). This disease is widely
distributed in India, especially on sweet orange
(_Citrus sinensis_) and pummelo (_C. grandis_). Studies made in quarantine
conditions in Florida (US) showed that an Indian isolate of citrus mosaic
badnavirus could be experimentally transmitted with _Planococcus citri_ to
sweet orange seedlings (S31).

yellow mosaic badnavirus by the citrus mealybug (S43). Abstracts of papers
presented at the APS/ESA Joint Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, US,
1998-11-08/12. Phytopathology, 88(9), Supplement, 144 pp.

[This report is the first to demonstrate mealybug transmission of the
badnavirus associated with citrus yellow mosaic, and suggests that the
virus may be spread under orchard conditions by this vector. The virus was
also demonstrated to be readily transmitted by grafting to many Citrus
spp., and its distribution in commercial orchards in India is probably the
result of using infected budwood during propagation. Transmission of the
citrus yellow mosaic virus by the citrus mealy bug to virus-free sweet
orange seedlings is another step forward in understanding the etiology of
citrus yellow mosaic disease. Mealy bugs remained viruliferous for at least
24 hours after removal from donor source plants. Should the virus be
introduced into the US, dispersal of the virus into commercial production
areas would be a potential hazard - Mod.DH].
