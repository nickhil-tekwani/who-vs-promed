Disease strikes Delta longan crop
---------------------------------
Witches' broom disease is sweeping through more than 60 percent of the longan-growing area in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta, leaving many farmers with severe losses, according to the Plant Protection Department.

Can Tho City and Soc Trang, Tien Giang, Tra Vinh, Vinh Long, Dong Thap, and Hau Giang provinces have all announced epidemics, with 24 000 ha [59 300 acres] out of their 39 000 ha [96 400 acres] being affected.

"Witches' broom causes an abnormal brush-like cluster of shoots arising from or near the same point on branches, affecting fruiting," said Dr Nguyen Van Hoa of the Southern Fruit Research Institute. The vector is an insect that cannot be seen with the bare eye, he said.

A farmer of Tien Giang Province said 85 percent of his 130 trees were affected. "I have to cut down all the infected trees, the trees are more than 10 years old," he said.

Vinh Long Province is the worst affected in the delta with 9020 ha [22 300 acres] out of its 9840 ha [24 300 acres] affected at 30 to 100 percent. It has organised training courses for farmers on witches' broom.

Tra Vinh Province has earmarked VND 12 billion (USD 570 000) to be used to survey infected areas, organise disease-prevention courses for affected farmers, and give them financial support.

The disease appeared in Viet Nam in 2003 from infected longan strains imported from neighbouring countries, according to experts. There are no effective measures to prevent or control the disease.

[Longan (_Dimocarpus longan_) is an important fruit crop in parts of Asia. Witches' broom (or rosette shoot) is a serious disease of the crop with reported yield losses of up to 50 percent. It was first described from China in 1941 where in some areas up to 100 percent of trees were infected, with higher incidence in mature trees. Since then it has also been reported from other countries in the region, for example Thailand and Taiwan.

Symptoms appear on branches and leaves but not on fruit. They may include distorted mature leaves, unexpanded young leaves, dense clusters of shoots, poorly developed flowers, as well as abnormal development of flowers and panicles resulting in "broom-like" appearance of the inflorescences. Similar symptoms have been reported from litchi and a close relationship between the 2 diseases is indicated.

The disease is still considered to be of unconfirmed aetiology, but is suspected to be caused by a filamentous virus transmitted by vectors such as litchi stink bug (_Tessaratoma papillosa_), longan psyllid (_Cornegenapsylla sinica_), and a new species of gall mite (_Eriophyes dimocarpi_). The disease is also spread through grafting and preliminary evidence suggests that it may be seed transmitted. Disease management may include orchard sanitation (removal of potential pathogen reservoirs), phytosanitary measures (disinfecting cutting tools), insecticides for vector control, and use of clean planting and grafting material. Resistant crop varieties are available for some areas.

The term "witches' broom" is descriptive of symptoms only and is used for a range of plant diseases caused by different pathogens.
