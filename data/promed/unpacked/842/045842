Students recovering from soup poisoning in Hunan
-----------------------------------------------
All of the approximately 100 students sickened by poisonous soup are
recovering, with 10 of them still in the hospital, as of Fri
afternoon, 30 Apr 2004, said the rescue staff.
13 students jointly bought tung oil and put it into the breakfast
soup provided in the school canteen in Taoyuan County, in central
China's Hunan Province, leaving over 100 students sickened and
hospitalized on Thu 29 Apr 2004.
All of the victims from the local Siping Town Middle School were
rushed to the hospital immediately after they became sick with
headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea after drinking the soup in the
dining room around 8:30 AM Thu 29 Apr 2004.
Local public security and sanitation supervision departments
confirmed that tung oil in the soup had been the cause of the
poisoning. The students said they that did it because they were not
satisfied with the quality of the dishes provided by the canteen and
thought the dish price was unreasonable.
Police, and the school, were not going to punish them but would
educate them in a mild way and ask teachers and other students to
help them in study, said Tong Jing, deputy county magistrate.

[Tung oil is commonly used as a water-resistant wood varnish. The oil
is produced from the buds of flowers obtained from the tung tree.
Tung wood is used in the production of items such as matches,
toothpicks, bento boxes, sandals, and furniture. Of note, currently,
in Taiwan, the Hakka Tung Flower Festival is running from 17 Apr to
16 May 2004.
Seeds from the tung tree (_Aleurities moluccana_) -- the tree is also
referred to as candlenut, candleberry, or barnish tree -- are used as
an herbal remedy for asthma. Allergic cross-reactions can occur in
those with latex allergies. - Mod.LL]
