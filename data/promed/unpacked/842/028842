[2] New countries/territories confirming cases (Yemen)
Date: Fri 10 Apr 2020

Yemen has reported its 1st coronavirus case in a southern province, raising fears of catastrophic consequences in a healthcare system broken by 5 years of war.

"The 1st confirmed case of coronavirus has been reported in Hadramout province," Yemen's supreme national emergency committee for COVID-19 said on Twitter on Friday [10 Apr 2020].

The committee, run by the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, said the infected patient was in stable condition and receiving care.

"The case is in isolation and treatment; all known contacts are being traced and quarantined," the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Twitter. "WHO is working closely with [the health ministry] to ensure further rapid containment measures are taken."

Hadramout province has seen some of the worst pockets of malnutrition and disease in the war-torn country.

The committee said medical teams and concerned authorities had taken all necessary precautions and promised to release further details on the coronavirus case later on Friday [10 Apr 2020].

The patient was a Yemeni working in the port of al-Shihr, a local official told Reuters news agency.

Following years of war, Yemen already faces what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian disaster. Aid groups have warned that a major outbreak will be "disastrous" and devastate the country's gutted healthcare system. Repeated coalition bombings have destroyed or closed more than half of Yemen's health facilities. Deep poverty, severe water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have made the country a breeding ground for disease.

"We're seeing some of the most rich nations, with their most advanced health systems, unable to cope with this pandemic," Sultana Begum, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera. "In Yemen, you have millions of people who are hungry, young children who are malnourished, people with life-threatening health conditions... In this kind of environment, this pandemic will be deadly," she warned.

If the virus spreads in Yemen, the impact would be "catastrophic" as the health status of at least half the population is "very degraded," and the country does not have sufficient supplies, capabilities, or facilities, said UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande.

In a statement, Grande said that people across the country "have some of the lowest levels of immunity and highest levels of acute vulnerability in the world."

"What's facing Yemen is frightening. More people who become infected are likely to become severely ill than anywhere else," she warned. "It's time for the parties to stop fighting each other and start fighting COVID together."

Saudi Arabia is also scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. Its health ministry has reported more than 3200 coronavirus infections and 44 deaths from the illness.

There are more than 134 000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the Middle East, including over 5300 fatalities. Some 4100 of those deaths are in Iran, which has the largest outbreak in the region. Authorities there have recorded more than 66 000 total cases.

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has risen to 4601, including 66 deaths, according to the country's health ministry on Friday [4 Apr 2020]. The country's most populated province, Punjab, remained the most affected area with 2279 total cases followed by southern Sindh province with 1128 cases.

A total of 620 cases were reported in northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 219 in southwest Balochistan province, 215 in north Gilgit-Baltistan region, and 107 in the capital, Islamabad. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded 22 deaths, followed by Sindh and Punjab, which reported 21 and 18 causalities, respectively. Currently, there are 3808 active cases under treatment in different hospitals, and 727 were discharged after complete recovery. The health authorities feared that the country may witnesses a sharp increase in the death toll, as at least 45 patients are in critical condition.

[The updated information on the COVID-19 situation in the country can be accessed on the national dashboard established by the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (http://covid.gov.pk/) with a total of 5011 confirmed cases and 85 deaths as of 11 Apr 2020. The 1st case was reported from Karachi on 26 Feb 2020.

The highest number of cases has been reported from the Punjab province (2414), followed by Sindh (1318), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (697), Balochistan (220), Gilgit Baltistan (215), Islamabad Capital territory-ICT (113), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (34). There have been 13 deaths during the last 24 hours, which is the highest number of cases reported in one day. The number of cases and deaths is increasing despite a lockdown being in place in the entire country and is a cause of serious concern. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET 11 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- Yemen reported its 1st case of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
- WHO has developed the following definition for reporting COVID deaths: A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g., trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.
- WHO Director-General Dr.Tedros, in a press conference held yesterday [Fri 10 Apr 2020], highlighted the issue of planning the transition out of stay-at-home restrictions: "WHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone. At the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence."
- WHO has updated its Q&A page on COVID-19 to provide information of how the virus spreads and how it is affecting people worldwide.
- To date, there are a limited number of publications and national situation reports that provide information on the number of healthcare-worker (HCW)infections. Understanding infection in HCWs is critical to informing the specific infection prevention and control measures needed to protect HCWs from infection. For more on this topic, see the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: infection in health care workers
--------------------------------------------------------------
Healthcare workers (HCWs) play an essential role at the front lines, providing care for patients. In the context of COVID-19 and during routine health services, they provide critical care to patients and ensure that infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are implemented and adhered to in healthcare facilities in order to limit healthcare-associated infections. As of 8 Apr 2020, 22 073 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. However, at the present time, there is no systematic reporting of HCW COVID-19 infections to WHO, and therefore this number probably under-represents the true number of COVID-19 HCW infections globally.

To date, there are a limited number of publications and national situation reports that provide information on the number of HCW infections. For example, a publication from China CDC on 44 672 confirmed cases as of 17 Feb 2020 indicated 1688 (3.8%) infections were among HCWs, including 5 deaths (1). In Italy, a situation report from 10 Apr 2020 reported 15 314 infections among HCWs, representing 11% of all infections at that time (2). Further publications have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infections among HCWs (3-7). While many infections are indicated as mild, severe outcomes, including deaths, among HCWs have also been reported.

Understanding infection in HCWs is critical to informing the specific IPC measures needed to protect HCWs from infection. A limited number of publications have identified risk factors for infection among HCWs. Preliminary results suggest HCWs are being infected both in the workplace and in the community, most often through infected family members (8).

In healthcare settings, factors associated with HCW infection have included late recognition or suspicion of COVID-19 in patients, working in a higher-risk department, longer duty hours, sub-optimal adherence to IPC measures such as hand hygiene practices, and lack of or improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (9-10). Other factors have also been documented, such as inadequate or insufficient IPC training for respiratory pathogens, including the COVID-19 virus, as well as long exposure in areas in healthcare facilities where large numbers of COVID-19 patients were being cared for. To prevent infection in healthcare settings, WHO recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions by HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19 (11).

WHO also recommends that airborne precautions be applied in settings in which procedures and support treatments that generate aerosols are performed (11). In this context, the correct use of PPE is critical, in particular wearing appropriate PPE for the clinical setting, paying special attention to procedures to put on and remove PPE correctly, and adhering to hand hygiene and other IPC measures. When these precautions are applied correctly and consistently, alongside standard precautions and administrative, engineering, and environmental controls, the risk for HCW infections is substantially reduced or avoided altogether.

WHO has also developed a risk assessment tool for exposed HCWs in a healthcare facility (12) and a sero-epidemiological protocol to determine risk factors for infection among HCWs (13), and is finalizing an in-depth epidemiological surveillance tool for HCW infections. A number of countries are currently using these tools and protocols, and this information will be essential to understand the extent of infection among HCWs, the extent of transmission within healthcare facilities, and the best approaches to protect HCWs against infection.

Finally, as HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19 are subject to long working hours, fatigue, occupational burn-out, stigma, physical and psychological violence, and back injury from patient handling, it is important that efforts be made to maintain the physical and mental health of HCWs and the quality of care. Therefore, WHO recommends that IPC measures be complemented by occupational safety and health measures, psycho-social support, adequate staffing levels, and clinical rotation, to reduce the risk of burn-out, for safe and healthy working environments and to respect the rights of health workers to decent working conditions ([14]).
