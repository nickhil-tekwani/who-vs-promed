Bay of Islands oysters are off the menu after 3 Northlanders who ate
oysters from the Kerikeri Inlet came down with a nasty stomach bug.
The oysters were sold in Auckland and Northland last week, but the
company which sold them has since voluntarily taken them off the
market. Health authorities are warning people not to collect
shellfish in the area until they can establish where the
contamination came from.

Northland medical officer of health Jonathan Jarman said test results
from oysters harvested from the area showed that they were infected
with norovirus, a micro-organism [a virus] found in human feces. It
can cause an illness with symptoms including nausea, stomach cramps,
diarrhea, vomiting, headache, chills and aching muscles. He would not
say where the contaminated oysters had been sold or what brand they
were, saying that was the responsibility of the New Zealand Food
Safety Authority. The authority could not be contacted yesterday [12
Oct 2008], but Dr Jarman confirmed the oysters were no longer in shops.

The source of the initial outbreak in Northland could not be
determined, but when further cases were reported in Auckland, a
particular brand of oysters was pinned down as the source of the
illness. The company tested its product and found the oysters came
from the batch which made the Northlanders ill and pulled them from
the market. Dr Jarman said public health staff were now trying to
determine the source of the norovirus.

A health protection team was in Kerikeri on Friday [10 Oct 2008]
inspecting septic tanks and looking for contamination. He said it was
not clear whether the oysters were contaminated while still in the
water or during harvesting and processing.

"We look at all the places where contamination may have occurred.
There are a number of possible places -- from the time when the
oysters were growing in the seawater, during processing, to the time
they were purchased -- that contamination may have occurred.
Commercial shellfish farming in the inlet has also been halted until
the source of the virus has been found.

[Noroviruses are enteric viruses associated predominantly with
outbreaks of sudden-onset gastroenteritis. Consumption of raw or
uncooked oysters is a hazardous practice. Oysters are filter-feeding
invertebrates that, particularly in marine environments, can
concentrate disease-producing enteric viruses wherever there is
discharge of untreated sewage into the sea. This seems to be a
possibility at Kerikeri since the local authorities are examining
septic tanks in the area. However, contamination may have occurred at
some other stage after the harvesting of the oysters during their
handling and processing for consumption.
