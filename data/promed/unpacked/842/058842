It is disturbing that one new case was a 7-year-old girl who had been vaccinated in 2018! And she was not included among contacts of cases. Adding to the mystery is that 63 days passed without a single identifiable case. How did she become infected? And how many other similar cases have been found, i.e., one year post-vaccination? - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Tue 24 Dec 2019. WHO sitrep 73
[WHO/AF/WHE/HIM, edited]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1uyhqs4hyu4q720bx6nkml?email= true&a=11&p=56205393

In the week of 16-22 Dec 2019, 14 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases were reported from 4 health areas within 2 health zones in North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new confirmed cases in the past week are from Mabalako health zone (12/14; 86%) and Butembo health zone (2/14; 14%).

All 14 cases reported in the past 7 days are linked to the case in Aloya health area, in which one individual was a potential source of infection for a transmission chain currently linking 39 people reported between 8 and 22 Dec 2019. Based on the preliminary sequencing of samples from this individual, this is being classified as a relapse of EVD. A total of 29 reported cases are thought to have direct epidemiological links to this case, and 10 cases are likely the result of further secondary transmission of EVD.

In the past 21 days (2-22 Dec 2019), 49 confirmed cases were reported from 12 health areas within 6 neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Mabalako (76%; n=37 cases), Beni (12%; n=6), Mandima (4%; n=2), Butembo (4%; n=2), Oicha (2%; n=1), and Biena (2%; n=1).

As of 22 Dec 2019, a total of 3362 EVD cases, including 3244 confirmed and 118 probable cases have been reported, of which 2226 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1892) were female, 28% (n=945) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=169) were healthcare workers.

[3] Risks and difficulties
- Sun 22 Dec 2019. Malawi: illegal immigrants
[Wanangwa Mtawali-Nyasa Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nyasatimes.com/illegal-immigrants-putting-malawi-at-risk-of-ebola-attack-says-know-your-neighbor-project/

Officials of Know Your Neighbour Project (KYNP), which is being jointly implemented by Youth Health Network and Titha Organization of the People with Disabilities, have asked the government of Malawi to remove all illegal immigrants from the country's locations and move them to refugee camps, saying they can spread the deadly Ebola virus among Malawians.

Malawi is grappling with an influx of illegal immigrants from Ebola hotspot Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Somalia. However, the country has not yet registered any Ebola case.

The illegal immigrants, running away from wars, civil unrest, hunger, and famine in their countries, are settling in Malawi to the extent that they are even scrambling with Malawians over smaller businesses.

Recently, the government of Malawi assured the nation that it has placed Ebola screening machines in all the country's entry points, but KYNP feels Malawi remains at great risk of an Ebola attack because these illegal immigrants are sneaking into the country using uncharted routes.

"We must sensitise Malawians about Ebola as well. It is sad that amid this influx of illegal immigrants, many of them do not know Ebola and how deadly it is," said country coordinator for KYNP Apostle Helix Jaxon Chigonammalunji Undi.

KYNP operations manager, Rex Whyghtone Daud, disclosed that they have already been to most border areas to sensitise people, where they also met chiefs and set up committees to help coordinate the work of protecting Malawi against illegal immigrants and Ebola.

"We do not hate our brothers and sisters from other African countries. All we are saying is they should follow procedures when entering our country because this will ensure that they are thoroughly screened for Ebola in order to protect other people.

-Wed 25 Dec 2019. Beni: increased security
[Radio Okapi, in French, trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/12/25/actualite/sante/ebola-beni-le-comite-de-riposte-plaide-pour-un-renforcement-de-securite

The support committee for the response to the Ebola virus disease on Tuesday (24 Dec 2019) called in Beni to reinforce security for the agents and structures for the treatment of this disease. This committee says it deplores the threats and several attacks against health structures recorded recently in the territory of Beni (North Kivu) and Mambasa (Ituri).

The president of the support committee for the response against Ebola, Me Omar Kavota, makes this proposal to the FARDC general staff:

"We are currently advocating at the military level for a specialized unit for securing response teams. We would like that, compared to the operational sector which is in Beni, as it is subdivided in axes according to certain commands, we would like that they are affected by the general staff of the FARDC, a commander who will be able to manage units responsible for securing response teams."

The structure believes that efforts must be made to ensure that the care agents and structures are protected and secure in order to definitively overcome this disease.

- Thu 26 Dec 2019. Ituri province (Biakato)
[Voice of America, abridged, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/africa/doctors-without-borders-quits-drc-ebola-operation
[Byline: By Lisa Schlein]

Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders says it has stopped Ebola prevention operations and other services in a town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The group said it took the action because of the presence of armed government forces inside several health facilities in Biakato, which is in Ituri province, just north of North Kivu. Both provinces are struggling to control the epidemic.

MSF, known as Doctors Without Borders, says it had no choice. The group says it had to leave Biakato because the presence of military troops inside its health facilities goes against its principles of neutrality and impartiality.

The deputy program manager for Emergencies Programs, Trish Newport, tells VOA the problem surfaced at the end of November [2019] following attacks by armed groups. Three Ebola responders were killed, and many others were injured.

In the wake of the violence, she says the government in Kinshasa sent security forces to the area to protect the Ebola operation. Newport says she understands the need to protect civilians and medical personnel. But, she notes, the presence of the armed government forces discourages people from seeking medical care.

"There are people that would not go to a healthcare facility because they are afraid of armed forces, because they have a different history with armed forces . . . and we have always said that healthcare facilities should not be armed," said Newport. "There should not be armed people within them. And people should be able to have access to healthcare facilities that are neutral."

Doctors Without Borders has been working in Biakato since 2016, supporting the Ministry of Health. Initially, its activities were focused on assisting victims of sexual violence. Since the start of the Ebola epidemic, it has expanded its operations to manage suspected and confirmed cases of the deadly disease.

Over the past 3 years, Newport says Doctors Without Borders has built a strong, trusting relationship with the community. So the decision to close the operation was very difficult to make.

"Biakato was really a place where we worked very closely with the community. We were not just focusing on Ebola," said Newport. "We really listened to the community, asking them what their priorities were. For instance, the community said at one point, we do not understand why you just respond to Ebola. We do not even have access to water here. And so we worked with the community to build wells in the community, so that they did have access. What we were also doing was providing primary healthcare, providing pediatric, hospital care."

Newport says MSF's departure is permanent. She says the organization's 18-bed Ebola treatment center and all other health activities will continue to be run by the health ministry.
