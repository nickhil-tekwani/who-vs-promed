BSE, IFST position statement - UK 980403065945
Date: Thu, 26 Nov 1998 00:24:58 GMT
From: J Ralph Blanchfield <jralphb@easynet.co.uk>

The latest updated version of the IFST Position Statement on BSE was issued
today, 26 November 1998. It may be found on the IFST Web site
<http://www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/>.
When you visit the Web site you will find many other goodies, including
numerous Position Statements on food science hot topics.
To make life easier, the updated BSE Position Statement text has now all
been integrated into one file (instead of the previous five
consecutivel-linked files). It is at
<http://www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/hottop5.htm>
That is the same address as the first file of the previous version, so that
links to it and bookmarks remain valid.
However please note that the Legislation Appendix remains a separate file
<http://www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/hottop5l.htm>
with the same address as before, so that links to it and bookmarks also
remain valid.
