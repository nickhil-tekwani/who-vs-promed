Another human case of bird flu surfaces
---------------------------------------
Another human case of avian influenza [A/H5N1 virus infection] has
been detected in the Kamalapur area of the capital, 2 days after a
13-month-old [previously stated to be 16-month-old] girl was found
carrying the H5N1 virus in the same locality.

The Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR)
discovered the fresh case while mopping up the area on Wed [16 Mar
2011]. It launched a drive in the locality following the detection of
the 1st case of the year [2011] in the area on Sunday [13 Mar 2011].

IEDCR director Prof Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com that a
31-month-old boy had been detected carrying the virus [by tests
conducted] in their lab. They tested nasal as well as throat swabs and
blood to confirm the case. The boy showed up with mild symptoms
including fever and cough at the IEDCR and ICDDR [International Centre
for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh], B joint surveillance
site at Kamalapur, the director said.

Prof Rahman, however, said that the boy was not related to the
earlier case. So far, 3 people [all children - Mod.CP] have been
detected infected with the bird flu virus since its 1st outbreak in
March 2007 in poultry.

IEDCR urged people not to panic, rather be aware of the disease.
"Maintaining bio-security in poultry farms and personal hygiene can
keep the virus away," Prof Rahman said, adding that the virus had the
potential to cause severe illness in humans with a high fatality
rate.

"We are lucky that the strain (clade 2.2) of H5N1, which circulates
in Bangladesh, is less virulent, so it causes less infection to
humans," he said. "But we have to be careful as it has the potential
to change into another class (2.1), which [has been] highly infectious
to human," he added.

The 1st human case in May 2008, a 15-month-old boy, got the virus
when his mother slaughtered a chicken at home and later cuddled him
with unwashed hands. Now, IEDCR is working on ascertaining the source
of infection of the 2nd baby. They advised doctors to seek history of
exposure to sick poultry while attending on patients with serious
respiratory illness, who might have contracted the deadly strain of
human avian influenza [A/H5N1] virus.

The institute is getting cases from Kamalapur area because of their
extensive surveillance, which was not possible everywhere in a
resource-starved country like Bangladesh.

IEDCR currently maintains virus surveillance at 28 sites, including
26 hospitals across Bangladesh. The government is funding 14
surveillance sites, while others are being run with the help of US
Centre for Disease Control. Prof Rahman suggests the 'one health'
approach that means combined effort of the departments of livestock
and health.

Principal scientific officer of IEDCR Dr M Mustaque Husain, however,
said that the current practice of marketing live birds in kitchen
markets and at roadside open spaces might pose significant risk to the
people. He urged people to wash the egg shells with soap to prevent
[transmission of] germs. [In addition], he said people should wear
protective gear and [adopt] practice measures in outbreak areas to
prevent personal contamination while slaughtering chickens and
handling dead chickens. He advised people to cough into the crook of
their elbow and wash hands with soap often to reduce the spread of
influenza virus at home or in the community.

Livestock experts suggest double fencing in every farm -- outer
fencing at the boundary and an inner fence around the poultry sheds to
prevent dogs, goats, or backyard chickens entering the sheds. Even
grass should be killed with chemicals so that rats cannot hide into
it.

The world's 1st outbreak of bird flu among humans occurred in Hong
Kong in 1997, when it claimed 6 lives.

So far, it has killed 315 people out of 534 [now with this case 535 -
Mod.CP] infected in 15 countries and most of these cases have been
linked to close contact with infected poultry or their secretions.

[The 2 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1 virus infection
identified recently in the Kamalapur area of Dhaka (only the 2nd and
3rd cases ever recorded in Bangladesh) are unusually in that both are
young children with mild symptoms of respiratory infection. Exposure
to infected poultry is a common feature, but otherwise the cases are
unrelated. It seems likely that their detection has been the result of
a particularly comprehensive and sensitive surveillance system, and
possibly the prevalence in Bangladesh of a strain of virus with
reduced virulence for humans.
