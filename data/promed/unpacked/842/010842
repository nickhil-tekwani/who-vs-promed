Health officials say more than 100 chickenpox cases have been confirmed in a western Indiana county where many children have been blocked from school because they aren't properly immunised. Vigo County Health Administrator Joni Wise says while school officials have vaccination records for students, day care providers don't have this information. Wise told the Tribune-Star (http://bit.ly/T0Sj78) that day care sites have been doing the right thing by sending suspected ill children home.

Vigo County School Corp. officials say they believe most of the 230 students excluded from school last week [week of 12 Nov 2012] will be able to return by next week. Student Services Director Ray Azar says some 100 of these students are already back, either by meeting immunisation requirements, or because 3 weeks have passed since their school's last chickenpox case.

[Chickenpox is a contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus, a herpesvirus. It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or never received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters.

The best way to avoid chickenpox is to be vaccinated. Children, adolescents, and adults should have 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox vaccine is safe and effective. The herpesvirus specific antiviral drugs acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir are available for treatment of severe cases of chickenpox in adults.

It is not clear why so many children have contracted chickenpox in this district of Western Indiana. It suggests local deficiencies in the programme of childhood vaccinations.

Vigo County is a county located along the western border of the state of Indiana. It is included in the Terre Haute, Indiana, Metropolitan Area. The county seat is Terre Haute. According to the 2010 census, the population was 107 848. Vigo County can be located by accessing the map at <hhttp://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/indiana.shtml>. - Mod.CP
