PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (03)
******************************

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from any part of the
world are now included in these updates where appropriate, and other
forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

[1] UK: National CJD Surveillance Unit -- monthly statistics

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics -- as of 1 Feb 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJD
referred to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 1 Feb 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163

Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, and the number of patients alive is unchanged.

These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline (although the incidence curve may be
developing a tail). The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and so far none in 2008

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 1 Feb 2008 in the UK in the year 2008 so far there have been 9
referrals, 6 deaths from sporadic CJD, one death from iatrogenic CJD,
none from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[2] UK: SEAC 99th meeting report
Date: Thu 31 Jan 2008R (SEAC)
Source: Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), 99th
meeting, 14 Dec 2007 [edited]

Update on vCJD and sCJD epidemiology
------------------------------------
Dr Richard Knight (NCJDSU-National CJD Surveillance Unit) presented
an update on the epidemiology of cases of sporadic CJD (sCJD) and
vCJD in the UK and elsewhere. Between May 1990 and October 2007, 944
cases of sCJD had been identified in the UK with a mean age at onset
of 66 (range 15-94) years and mean age of death of 67 (range 20-95)
years. There is no significant gender difference in sCJD incidence.
There had been a trend towards an increasing number of cases over
time to almost 80 cases per year in 2003; this increased trend had
also been observed in other countries and was considered to be a
result of better surveillance and diagnosis of disease. There has
been a decline in number since 2003, but this may not be of
significance. The post mortem rate for sCJD referral is about 60
percent. The genotype distribution of sCJD cases was 64 percent MM,
18 percent MV and 18 percent VV at codon 129 of the prion protein
gene.

Dr Knight explained that the total number of definite and probable
vCJD cases in the UK up to November 2007 was 166, with 4 cases still
alive. 3 out of 4 vCJD cases treated with pentosan polysulphate (PPS)
had appreciably longer survival times, but it is not proven that this
is the result of treatment. No statistically significant gender
difference had been observed in vCJD cases. The age distribution of
vCJD had not altered over the course of the UK epidemic, with the
median age of death of 30 (range 14-75) years. Statistical analysis
of the UK incidence of deaths from vCJD suggested the epidemic had
peaked in 2000 with 28 deaths. There are 3 cases identified with
onset in 2006 and four deaths in 2007. Geographical distribution of
vCJD cases in the UK shows higher incidence in the North than South.
All 146 vCJD cases tested to date are of the MM genotype [but see
ProMED-mail Prion disease update 2008 (02) 20080107.0087 for a recent
exception. - Mod.CP]

Dr Knight explained that elsewhere in the world up to November 2007,
39 vCJD cases have been reported with 23 in France, 4 in the Republic
of Ireland (RoI), 3 in the USA, 2 in the Netherlands, 2 in Portugal
and single cases in Italy, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Spain.

Infection is considered likely to have occurred in the UK in 2 Ireland
cases, 2 USA cases, and the single French, Japanese & Canadian cases.
One of the French cases had a history of possibly significant
residence in the UK. One USA case is thought likely to have been
exposed to infection in Saudi Arabia, rather than the USA.

Dr Knight explained that the Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology Review
study had identified 4 instances of vCJD infection resulting from
receipt of non-leucodepleted [white cell reduced] red blood cells
donated by individuals who had subsequently developed vCJD. The donors
developed clinical vCJD ranging from 17 months to 3.5 years after
blood donation and this indicates that blood can be infective 3.5
years before the development of clinical disease. Clinical vCJD was
identified in 3 recipients (all of MM genotype) between 6.5 and 8.3
years after receipt of blood. The 4th recipient, who died of
non-neurological disease, with only lymphoreticular evidence of vCJD
infection, was of MV genotype.

In response to a question about the neuropathology of the vCJD case
that died after receiving PPS, Dr Knight explained that no autopsy
was undertaken.

A member asked about the reason for the increase in sCJD detection in
the years up to 2003. Dr Knight replied that it was probably due to
better awareness of the disease and the availability of better
diagnostic methods such as cerebrospinal fluid testing and magnetic
resonance imaging.

Mr Mark Noterman (Department of Health [DH]) asked whether the
neuropathological referrals rate had increased after the Chief
Medical Officer's letter to clinicians earlier in the year to remain
vigilant about cases of neurological disease that could be related to
prion disease. Dr Knight replied that there had been no subsequent
significant increase in referral rate.

[3] BASE transmission risk
Date: Wed 30 Jan 2008

Evaluation of the human transmission risk of an atypical bovine
spongiform encephalopathy prion strain
---------------------------------------------------------------
The following is the Abstract of a paper published in the Journal of
Virology by Qingzhong Kong and colleagues at the Department of
Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106,
USA; CEA [Centro di Referenza per le Encefalopatie Animali], and the
Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale, 10154 Torino, Italy;
Department of Neurological and Visual Sciences, University of Verona,
37134 Verona, Italy.

"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the prion disease in cattle,
was widely believed to have only one strain (BSE-C). BSE-C causes the
fatal prion disease named new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob [vCJD]
disease in humans. Since 2004, 2 atypical BSE strains, BASE [bovine
amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy] (or BSE-L) and BSE-H, have
been discovered in several countries ; their transmissibility and
phenotypes in humans are unknown. We investigated the infectivity and
human phenotype of BASE by inoculating transgenic (Tg) mice
expressing the human prion protein with brain homogenates from 2
BASE-affected cattle. 60 percent of the inoculated Tg mice became
infected after 20-22 months incubation, a transmission rate higher
than those reported for BSE-C. A quarter of BASE-infected Tg mice,
but none of the Tg mice infected with a sporadic human prion disease,
showed presence of pathogenic prion protein isoforms in the spleen,
indicating that the BASE prion is intrinsically lymphotropic. The
pathological prion protein isoforms in BASE-infected humanized Tg
mouse brains are different from those of the original cattle BASE or
sporadic human prion disease. Minimal brain spongiosis and long
incubation time are observed in the BASE-infected Tg mice. These
results suggest that, in humans, BASE is a more virulent BSE strain
and likely lymphotropic."
