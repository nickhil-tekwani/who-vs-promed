Suspected livestock disease in Kombo Central
-----------------------------------------------
Reports reaching the Daily Observer have indicated that many livestock are
dying, leading to suspicion of an outbreak of animal disease.
Speaking to the Daily Observer, Mariama Jallow, a native of Kafuta who
claimed she lost most of her livestock to the disease, called for an urgent
investigation to ascertain the cause of the sudden frequent deaths among
animals in the area. She said the matter has since been reported to the
livestock authorities in Brikama.
Mariama's story was corroborated by other villagers who also said they were
worried about the mysterious deaths of their livestock. "In fact I know of
a case where several people lost their ram before Tobaski," said a villager.
When contacted, Sheriff Bojang, divisional livestock officer (DLO) for
Western Division, confirmed that his office had received a complaint, and a
team was dispatched to the area to resolve the matter. "Though we were not
aware of it initially, as nobody informed us, we sent livestock personnel
there immediately [as soon as] we received the message," he said.
Dembo Bojang, a livestock senior officer, informed this paper that the
affected livestock would be given proper treatment, while a thorough
investigation would be mounted to know the cause of deaths. He pointed out
that last August [2004], they conducted a district vaccination campaign,
but that did not adequately cover the area, as many livestock owners could
not afford the cost of the vaccines.
