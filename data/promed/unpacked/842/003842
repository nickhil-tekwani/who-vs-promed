CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype) Newport infections. Results from this ongoing investigation indicate that organic sprouted chia powder distributed by Navitas Naturals of Novato, California is the likely source of this outbreak. Chia powder is made from ground dried chia seeds.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, obtains DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. This PFGE pattern has never been seen before in PulseNet.

A total of 12 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Newport have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), California (2), Connecticut (1), Massachusetts (1), New York (4), Utah (1), and Wisconsin (2).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 21 Jan 2014 to 5 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 4 years to 71 years, with a median age of 48 years. 58 percent of ill persons are female. Among 10 ill persons with available information, 1 (10 percent) reports being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback findings have linked this outbreak of salmonellosis to organic sprouted chia powder distributed by Navitas Naturals. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about food eaten and other exposures in the week before becoming ill. 7 (100 percent) of 7 persons interviewed reported eating chia powder. 6 (86 percent) of these 7 people reported eating the Navitas Naturals organic sprouted chia powder.

On 28 May 2014, Navitas Naturals recalled products that contain organic sprouted chia powder due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination. The recalled products include Navitas Naturals Organic Sprouted Chia Powder, Navitas Naturals Omega Blend Sprouted Smoothie Mix, and Williams-Sonoma Omega 3 Smoothie Mixer. The recalled products are available for purchase in many retail stores and online.

Several samples of leftover organic sprouted chia powder from ill persons' homes and unopened packages from retail locations are being tested for the presence of _Salmonella_. Results of this testing will be released when they become available.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners in this investigation.

[The source of the initial contamination is as yet unknown.

Chia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica) -- plant name _Salvia hispanica_ -- is grown commercially for its seed, a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, since the seeds yield 25-30 percent extractable oil, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Of total fat, the composition of the oil can be 55 percent omega-3, 18 percent omega-6, 6 percent omega-9, and 10 percent saturated fat. Chia seeds are typically small ovals with a diameter of about 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous gel-like coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive texture.
