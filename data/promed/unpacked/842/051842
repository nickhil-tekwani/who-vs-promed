Chinese son likely gave bird flu to father
------------------------------------------
A 24-year-old Chinese man who died of bird flu in December 2007
passed the virus directly to his father in a rare case of
human-to-human transmission of the virus, doctors reported on Monday
[7 Apr 2008]. Chinese officials had already said they believed the
younger man infected his 52-year-old father, who survived; and
genetic sequencing and other checks confirmed this was likely, the
researchers said.

"In this family cluster of confirmed cases of infection with highly
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in mainland China, we
believe that the index case transmitted H5N1 virus to his father
while his father cared for him in the hospital," they wrote in the
Lancet medical journal.

H5N1 avian influenza is regularly breaking out in birds across Asia,
the Middle East, Africa and Europe. It only rarely infects humans but
has killed 238 out of 376 people known to have been infected since
2003. Most have been directly infected by a sick bird, but in a few
rare cases, one person appears to have infected another. These have
been documented in Indonesia and, just last month [March 2008],
between 2 brothers in Pakistan. Most have been among people who are
genetically related and this also appears to be the case with the 2
Chinese men, the researchers said.

Some experts believe there may be a genetic susceptibility to H5N1
infection. The fear is that the virus will acquire changes that allow
it to be passed from one person to another more easily. This could
cause a pandemic that could kill tens of millions of people globally,
so experts are carefully studying every case of transmission.

Yu Wang of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in
Beijing and colleagues investigated the cases of the man and his son,
who were diagnosed within a week of each other in December 2007 in
Jiangsu Province. They also tested 91 people the 2 men had come into
close contact with. None of these people became infected. The young
man had a high fever, cough and watery diarrhea and his father nursed
him intensively in the hospital.

The younger man died but his father got the flu drugs Tamiflu and
rimantadine as well as serum from a woman inoculated with an
experimental H5N1 vaccine and recovered.

"With the exception of occasional infection in health workers, all
published incidents of possible or probable person-to-person
transmission report transmission between genetically related
individuals," Nguyen Tran Hien of Vietnam's National Institute of
Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi, and colleagues wrote in a
commentary. "Although this finding could be related to the intensity
and intimacy of contact between family members, host genetic factors
might also play a part in susceptibility to H5N1," they added. So
anyone in close, prolonged contact with an H5N1 victim should get flu
drugs just in case, they said.

Last week [31 Mar - 4 Apr 2008] the World Health Organization said
some human-to-human spread likely occurred when 3 brothers in
Pakistan became infected with H5N1 last year. The largest known
cluster of human bird flu cases occurred in May 2006 in Indonesia
when at least 7 family members died.

[Perhaps the most significant and novel feature of this report, apart
from the confirmation of the probability of transmission of infection
from son to father, is the fact that the surviving patient was
treated with serum from a woman inoculated with an experimental H5N1
vaccine. - Mod.CP]

Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 8
----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new
human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection.

The patient is a 19-year-old male from Kafr El-Dawar District, Behera
governorate. He developed symptoms on 30 Mar 2008, was hospitalized
on 31 Mar 2008, and died on 4 Apr 2008. The patient was confirmed as
being infected with A (H5N1) by the Central Public Health
Laboratories and by Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3).

Investigations into the source of his infection indicate a history of
contact with sick and dead poultry.

Of the 48 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 21 have been fatal.
