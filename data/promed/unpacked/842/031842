The U.S. Agriculture Department Tuesday will urge meat plants to test for a
deadly bacteria in hot dogs and luncheon meat to prevent outbreaks of food
poisoning in ready-to-eat meats, industry and government sources said
Monday. The USDA began work on the guidelines earlier this year after 21
deaths occurred from contaminated hot dogs and deli meat sold by Sara Lee
Corp.'s Bil Mar plant in Michigan.
Investigators documented more than 100 illnesses in 22 states caused by
_Listeria monocytogenes_ in the Sara Lee meat. The bacteria, which is
destroyed by cooking, is common in the environment and not dangerous to
most people. But unborn babies and others with weak immune systems can die
if infected with listeria.
The rash of cases worried scientists, who speculate that new, more
resistant strains of the bacteria may be emerging in foods that consumers
do not have to cook.
An estimated 1,300 cases of listeriosis are reported to federal health
officials each year, with one-fifth of these patients dying.
USDA sources said the guidelines to be announced Tuesday would include a
"strong recommendation" that plants begin testing packaged meat about to be
shipped as well as test for sanitary conditions at the plant.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the frequency of the
listeria testing would depend on each plant's record and production.
A spokeswoman for the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service declined to
comment.
The USDA now randomly tests a small number of samples each year but has
said it lacks the budget to dramatically expand testing programs.
Although the guidelines will not have the force of law, the
publicity-conscious U.S. meat industry is expected to adopt them.
"There may be some things that we disagree with, but it will be an approach
we can work with," said Dane Bernard, a food safety expert with the
National Food Processors Association.
"The product as it emerges from the cookers is pretty clean," Bernard said.
"We're not talking about dirty plants, but about a bacteria that is
difficult to control and sometimes gets back in the package."
However, the guidelines will not include two things sought by consumer
groups -- warning labels on hot dog packages and more rigorous shelf-life
dates, sources said.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest and other groups had pressed
the USDA to require warning labels alerting pregnant women and
immune-deficient consumers of the risk of ready-to-eat hot dogs and deli
meats. The groups also have expressed concern about how some packages of
ready-to-eat foods linger in storage and on grocery store shelves for
months.
But faster results will come from the USDA issuing guidelines, rather than
attempting a full-blown rulemaking, consumer advocates said.
"I want something to happen right now to protect consumers from listeria,"
said Carol Tucker Foreman, a food safety expert with the Consumer
Federation of America. "If you put out a proposed regulation, you're
looking three or four years down the road before it becomes final."
The listeria outbreak earlier this year was the first major public health
test of the USDA's shift to a science-based inspection program for meat
plants.
Under the new rules phased in during the past two years, plants are
responsible for developing check points during processing, and monitoring
them to make sure that food is safe at each point.
The program -- known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points --
cannot require plants to take specific safety measures. With the new
guidelines, USDA will urge plants to reassess their HACCP programs and
consider testing to address listeria contamination.
The listeria contamination in the Sara Lee plant was eventually traced to
construction dust from repairs to the plant's air conditioning system.

[Two cheese recalls in the same day. Interesting in the wake of the USDA
guidelines for meat released today. -MPP
*****
A small Missouri dairy is recalling 135 pounds of specialty cheese that may
be contaminated with dangerous listeria.
Morningland Dairy Farms Inc., based in Mountain View, Mo., said the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has temporarily closed its cheese-making
operations.
In Raleigh, N.C., state officials reported a recall of a quantity of
imported cheese after tests found evidence of the same bacteria in it.
Routine testing at a grocery store revealed the _Listeria monocytogenes_
pathogen in Pinna Ricotta Salata Cheese, made with 100% sheep's milk.
The Missouri recall involved Morningland Dairy Chives Colby Cheese, which
authorities said should be returned for refunds to retailers who sold it.
The cheese is made from raw milk, and contamination showed up in tests by
federal health officials.
Calls to the company went unanswered Tuesday. A recorded message said: "The
FDA has temporarily shut down the cheese-making facility. We will not be
shipping for a couple weeks for sure. Call us back after that to find out
how we are doing. Sorry."
Listeria can cause serious, potentially fatal, infections in young
children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. It also can
cause miscarriages. Healthy people, however, usually suffer short-term
symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and fever.
The recalled Colby cheese, sold in vacuum-packed plastic bags, carries the
code A259 on the label. It was sold by mail and in retail stores in
Missouri, Colorado, Utah, Illinois, Arizona, Tennessee, New York,
California, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.
No illnesses have been reported from the cheese recalled in North Carolina,
which was imported from Italy distributed by Anco Foods of Fairfield, N.J.
The Food and Drug Protection Division of the North Carolina Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services advised consumers not to use the product
in packaging bearing the code "Sell by Sep 18, 99."
The cheese also may have been distributed in South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.
