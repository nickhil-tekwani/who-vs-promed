Dr Celia Martinez, Chief of Health Surveillance, pointed out that when analyzing the current situation of influenza and other respiratory diseases in Paraguay, there is an increased frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. This virus causes pneumonia and severe respiratory diseases, including bronchiolitis, a condition that leads to respiratory distress of variable severity and affects mainly children less than 2 years old. This infection also may cause many cases (outbreaks), particularly in closed spaces (such as children daycare centers). Most severe symptoms occur in premature babies, toddlers, and small children, but adults and the elderly may also be affected, and RSV may cause pneumonia in these groups of patients.

Dr Antonio Arbo, Minister of Health, declared that his office purchased an important amount of very costly drugs in order to strengthen the immune system of premature babies and for protecting them from the aforementioned disease. The drug [presumed to be the monoclonal antibody palivizumab. - Mod.CP] will be dispensed in the Itaugua National Hospital and in the San Pablo Mother and Child Hospital, he said. Each dose of the drug costs around 10 million Guaranies (nearly USD 2400), and premature babies require 3 doses in order to achieve the desired effect.

Among other respiratory viruses circulating in Paraguay are influenza A/H3, influenza B, parainfluenza, and adenovirus (9 percent). "Vaccines against influenza administered in healthcare services may confer some protection against these viruses and for this reason it is important that persons belonging to risk groups for developing complications be immunised," reminded Dr Martinez.

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In children under one year of age, RSV is the most important cause of bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung. In temperate climates almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their 2nd birthday. When infants and children are exposed to RSV for the 1st time, 25 percent to 40 percent of them have signs or symptoms of bronchiolitis or pneumonia, but only 0.5 percent to 2 percent will require hospitalization. Most children hospitalized for RSV infection are under 6 months of age. Nonetheless people of any age can get another RSV infection, but later infections are generally less severe. However the elderly and adults with chronic heart or lung disease or with immune systems weakened by medical conditions or treatments remain at high risk for developing severe RSV disease if reinfected. In temperate climates, RSV infections generally occur during autumn, winter, and early spring. The timing and severity of RSV circulation in a given community can vary from year to year.

RSV appears to play a greater role (or perhaps is diagnosed more assiduously) in Southern America than elsewhere. In an investigation of the genetic characteristics of circulating human RSV in 9 countries of Central and South America between January 2007 and June 2009, a period uncomplicated by pandemic influenza, a total of 296 RSV isolates from 9 countries were characterised and considerable antigenic and genetic heterogeneity were observed. Later studies have concluded that this heterogeneity is global, but it is as yet unclear to what extent this impinges on the epidemiology of the accompanying disease. - Mod.CP
