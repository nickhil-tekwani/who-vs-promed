Cowpox deaths have farmers in Pursat worried about rice
-------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Pursat's Krakor district have expressed concern about the
effect that a recent wave of cattle deaths -- primarily due to
preventable diseases including cowpox -- could have on rice cultivation.

Ly Phun, governor of Krakor district, said that up until 6 weeks ago
there were 200 000 bulls and buffaloes in Krakor district. Since
then, 15 percent have died as a result of cowpox infection, a disease
caused by a virus similar to variola virus and foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] [see comment. - Mod.AS] Bulls and buffaloes are widely used for
plowing rice fields.

Several officials in the province said that they had run into
difficulty containing the spread of the diseases, in part because
farmers had not been correctly disposing of animal carcasses.

"We have told people to bury their dead cows -- particularly those
which died of infectious diseases -- but they still eat the carcasses
so the virus keeps being transmitted to other cattle in the area," Ly
Phun told the Post Sunday [18 Jan 2009].

Bung Taing Lay, clerk of Anlong Thnot commune, said that even when it
appears that cattle have died of cowpox or FMD, their owners are
reluctant to part with the food the cattle can provide. After the
dead animals are eaten, animal parts are then routinely thrown out
near where other cattle feed, increasing the risk of reinfection.

Ly Phun said a vaccine shortage had also contributed to the spread of
the diseases.

Kuch Veng, 45, a farmer in Kbal Trach commune, Krakor district, said
roughly 200 bulls and buffalos had died of the diseases in the
commune since last month. He said he believes the diseases originated
in nearby communes.

He said he asked authorities to provide vaccines but that his request
went unheeded until it was too late.

He called for the people in his commune to vaccinate their buffaloes
and bulls. However, he said it is difficult to persuade some
villagers to vaccinate their cattle. "The villagers believe more
strongly in ghost spirits than in vaccine injections," he said.

Khlem Sokoun, chief of the Pursat Health Department, said the
situation in the province had improved since he sent veterinarians to
administer vaccines about a month ago.

"Before then, between 10 and 20 cattle died per day, but now only 3
die per day, and we hope that they will stop dying soon," he said.
"Now our staff are educating the villagers about the impact of
contagious viruses."

[The claims attributing the illness and mortality of Cambodian
bovines ("bulls and buffaloes") to cowpox are, most likely,
erroneous. Cowpox is a mild, eruptive disease of dairy cows,
restricted to udder and teats; although once common, it is now
extremely rare, and reported only in Western Europe. Certainly not a
fatal, generalised disease.

In the absence of details on the clinical signs and PM (post-mortem)
changes observed, diagnosis cannot be made. Since suspicion of cowpox
has been raised, it may be assumed that pox-like lesions have been
seen. They should be reported in more detail. More likely, the losses
are caused by FMD. According to the information available on the
SEAFMD (Southeast Asia Foot and Mouth Disease Campaign; a regional,
OIE coordinated FMD control project by 8 countries, including
Cambodia) website, FMD is present in Cambodia. The last report dates
back to July 2008. The circulating virus has not been typed. See
<http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd>.

The information in the newswire above, stating that vaccination seems
to decrease losses, adds support to the assumption that one deals
here with FMD. However, only adequate epidemiological and laboratory
investigations will enable ruling out other diseases.

Official data from professional sources is anticipated. In case FMD
is confirmed, serotyping is expected; neighbouring Viet Nam suffers
currently an extensive outbreak of FMD serotype A.- Mod.AS
