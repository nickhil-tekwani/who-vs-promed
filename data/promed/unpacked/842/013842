[An outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) was previously reported in domestic swine in Phuentshogling town, Chhukha District (same district where the current outbreak is located), on 6 May 2021. According to the epidemiological comments, "The disease outbreak has started from the sewerage area of Phuentshogling town, which shares a porous border with Jaigaon town, Alipurduar, West Bengal, India. Since the demarcated infection zone falls under Phuentshogling City area, pig rearing is strictly prohibited; therefore, there are no pig farms around the area. All the sighted pigs are stray scavenging. However, 3 sub-districts around the infection zone are designated under surveillance zone, and pigs' farms in these areas have been constantly monitored. Under the directives of the Department of Livestock, rapid response teams have been activated and implementing necessary prevention and control measures in the zones (infection and protection) demarcated based on epidemiological assessments. Implementation of 3-D operations have started as one of the main strategies. See the final report (on 27 Jul 2021) at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=36767.

The latest updated report on "ASF situation in Asia and Pacific update," published by FAO on 15 Apr 2022, mentioned that Bhutan has taken the following actions: "The authority has implemented 3D (depopulation, disposal, and disinfection) operation, surveillance, quarantine, movement control, sensitization and awareness raising, [and] import ban and encouraged farmers to adopt good pig farming practices (e.g., heighten farm biosecurity, properly cooked kitchen wastes before feeding pigs, etc.). [On 8 Apr 2022], the government released an alert on risk of ASF introduction and rise in incidence of other livestock diseases in the country.
