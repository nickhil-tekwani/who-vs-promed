PHYTOPHTHORA TROPICALIS, CACAO

I noticed your article in ProMED reporting _Phytophthora capsici_ on
cucumber and melon, and your note that this pathogen also attacks
cacao. We have shown (Aragaki and Uchida, 2001) that certain isolates
of "_P. capsici_," provisionally called _P. palmivora_ MF-4, are clearly
distinct from _P. capsici_ Leonian. A new taxon, _P. tropicalis_
accommodates this group of organisms. Pathogenicity to cacao is an
attribute of some isolates of _P. tropicalis_ but not of _P. capsici_.

_Phytophthora capsici_ and _P. tropicalis_ sp. nov. Mycologia 93(1): 137-145.
