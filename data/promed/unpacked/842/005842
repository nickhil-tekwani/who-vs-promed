INFLUENZA B, VIRULENT - SPAIN (BALEARIC ISLANDS)

From: MICROBIOLOGIA HSD <jreina@hsd.es>

Last week (epidemiological week 47) we isolated 3 influenza type B viruses
at the beginning of the current epidemic wave. The 3 cases are very special
because they affected 3 children between 11 & 13 years old and with
extraordinary clinical virulence.
Two children presented with high fever (greater than 39C) with myalgias,
rabdomyositis (CPK greater than 1000), arthralgias and maculopapular
erythema with petechias (one case). These clinical presentations are not
normal and could represent the behavior of the new antigenic and genetic
variant of Influenza B virus described last year [2001] in Asia and this
year in Houston, Texas, USA (March 2002). The strains have been sent to the
National Influenza Reference Center (Madrid) to characterize and sequence to
demonstrate correspondence with the strain B/Hong-Kong/330 (included in the
current flu vaccine).

[ProMED reported outbreaks of influenza B/Hong Kong/330/01 in children in
Houston, Texas in June 2002 & in San Pedro, Misiones, Argentina in August
2002 -- see refs. below. Could some incubating cases have traveled from
Argentina to Spain? ProMED appreciates this early warning and looks forward
to hearing the results from the Reference Center & news of any further cases
due to this strain, anywhere. - Mod.JW]
