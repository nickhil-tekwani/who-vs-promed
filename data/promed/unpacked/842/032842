The Qinghai Animal Disease Control Center confirmed on 1 Dec 2020 an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants in Golmund city, Haixi prefecture, Qinghai province. A batch of 159 imported sheep was affected, of which 106 got sick and died. After the outbreak, the local authorities applied the epidemiological activities in accordance with relevant programs and technical specifications for prevention and control.

[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. It is not zoonotic.

Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle, and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible, although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established. PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia.

The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterised by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea, and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes, particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form.

PPR was initially reported in China from Tibet in 2007 and remained, apparently, restricted to this south-western region for years. In December 2013, China reported to the OIE a new PPR event, initially causing 7 outbreaks in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the northwest of the country. Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh District to the south and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India to the west. The disease spread in 2014 throughout China, with 251 outbreaks reported from 21 administrative divisions: Chongking, Anhui, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Liaoning, Sichuan, Yunnan and Zhejiang. Mass vaccinations were introduced.

On 31 Aug 2015, China submitted to the OIE its 22nd follow-up report of the above event, which became a "final report," with the following comment: "The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports." The said and the previous 21 follow-up reports, with a map presenting all accumulated outbreaks since the start of the event, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14492.

Earlier this year (2020), 2 outbreaks were recorded in Xinjiang. PPR may be regarded as having become endemic in China, mainly controlled by preventive vaccinations.

The OIE and the FAO, in their joint strategy for control and eradication of PPR, have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030 globally. This ambitious initiative is based on the recognised similarity between PPR virus and rinderpest virus, allowing for the lessons learned from rinderpest eradication to be used in the PPR eradication strategy.
