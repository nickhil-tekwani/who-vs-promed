New malaria case in Jamaica
---------------------------
The hospitalisation of a man diagnosed with malaria last week has
sparked fear among residents of Mountain View Avenue in Kingston that
they could become infected by the potentially deadly disease.

The man, a 25-year-old resident of Jacques Road in the area, was
reportedly tested for malaria by public health officials in January
[2010], but was just informed last week of his status. He has been
admitted at the Kingston Public Hospital since Tuesday [9 Feb 2010].

The Sunday Observer was told that public health officials have been
visiting the area since January [2010], at least once weekly, to
administer anti-malarial drugs and pass out flyers about the disease.
The group last visited on Thursday [11 Feb 2010], during which time
scores of residents were said to have been tested for the disease.

"The 1st time is like a beg them have to beg people to come and do it,
but like yesterday (Thursday) the road full of people," one resident
of Jacques Road told this newspaper on Friday [12 Feb 2010]. "Is whole
heap of them (health officials) come. Is about 2 bus loads of them did
come," added another resident who rolled up his sleeve to show where
he had been injected by a member of the team. She said other persons
have, since last week, been complaining of symptoms associated with
the disease, such as joint pain and vomiting. "Mi hear that is 6
people have it, but I don't know how true that is," she said.

Another resident said that in addition to the weekly visits by health
officials, a group has been coming in daily to carry out vector
control operations during the evenings.

"Mi not telling no lie, the thing (spray) affect me bad. It just block
up my throat and make me sneeze," complained another resident. "But mi
no see what them a do, because by the time them gone, the mosquito
come back."

Another resident believed the build-up of rubbish in a nearby gully in
the area was the reason for the malaria case, even as many speculated
that it was somehow connected to what was happening in Haiti where a
powerful earthquake killed hundreds of thousands and left millions
homeless a month ago.

"Only when the rain fall the gully get to flush out, so if them get
some power wash to flush it out, that would be good," [she said].

Efforts to get the Ministry of Health to confirm the residents' story
were unsuccessful. When contacted, director of health promotion and
protection Dr Eva Lewis-Fuller said she was unaware of the situation
as she was on leave. She directed us to the ministry's Chief Medical
Officer Dr Sheila Campbell-Forrester who, we were told, was off the
island.

Malaria is transmitted when female _Anopheles_ mosquitoes, infected
with any of certain protozoa [plasmodia] bite people. Symptoms of the
disease include fever, shaking chills, headache, muscle aches,
tiredness, and other flu-like illnesses. Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea may also occur.

There were 11 confirmed cases of the disease in sections of Portmore
in 2009. In 2006, residents in some sections of the Corporate Area
were quarantined following an outbreak of the disease in Denham Town,
Tivoli Gardens, Trench Town, and Delacree Park in Kingston and
sections of Portmore, Church Pen, and Sydenham Villas in St Catherine.
Other parishes, including Clarendon, St Thomas, and St Elizabeth also
experienced outbreaks of malaria, bringing the total number of
confirmed cases in the island close to 300 by February 2007.

On Friday [12 Feb 2010], residents and those who work off Jacques Road
said they are not taking any chances. "It's a serious issue," said [a]
woodworker. "We just try not to keep any water in the area for them
(mosquitoes) to breed up or anything."

Meanwhile, the mother of the hospitalised man said that he was doing
well. "Him not too bad. Him say they are giving him tablets and them
take blood from him," she said.

[The current outbreak of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in Jamaica
started in 2006 and was the 1st autochthonous malaria in Jamaica since
1966. ProMED-mail reported 5 new cases in March 2009, but we have not
received information on new cases before the present report. If the
new case has indeed been infected in Kingston, there must be more
cases as the mosquitoes must be infected from a reservoir of
gametocyte carriers.

Further information on the follow up of this patient will be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
