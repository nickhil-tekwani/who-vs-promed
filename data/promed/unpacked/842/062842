Tipu's Tiger Chai Inc, of Missoula, Montana is voluntarily recalling
its Tipu's Tiger Chai Concentrate because it has the potential to be
contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can
cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to
use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Tipu's Tiger Chai Concentrate was distributed, primarily to stores
and coffee kiosks in western Montana and one cafe in Prescott,
Arizona using the concentrate for mixed beverages sold on-site.
Limited distribution of the bottled product was made directly to
consumers in Western Montana.

The product is distributed in plastic half-gallon (1.89L) units
labeled as "Tipu's Tiger Chai, Chai Concentrate." The lid or neck of
bottle states "refrigerate after opening" followed by dates of 23 Sep
2009 through and including 22 May 2010.

Please note that no illnesses have been reported to date.

Through a records audit, the pH level of the product manufactured
during this period was found to be higher than required by FDA standards.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls (as in this case)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
