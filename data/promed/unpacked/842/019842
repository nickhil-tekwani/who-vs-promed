[1] Dysentery - Moldova

The epidemiological situation in the village of Tomai, Ceadir-Lunga
district is now stabilized after the dysentery outbreak. Fewer cases
have been registered within the last few days. So far, 27 of the
hospitalized patients have had the dysentery diagnosis confirmed.

Oleg Benes, head of the Centre of Epidemiology for Particularly
Dangerous Diseases and Bioterrorism, announced that all patients with
gastrointestinal problems are held under medical observation, even
when the dysentery diagnosis was not confirmed in their case, since
there is a danger of the epidemic reemerging among those who had
contact with dysentery patients.

The precise origin of the outbreak is being sought by the
investigation that has been started. Epidemiologists suppose the
patients were infected through drinking water contamination with
sewage. Water sources in the village have been decontaminated and
checked for leaks.

Another dysentery outbreak was reported at the Cahul boarding school
[the submitter indicates that this is an orphanage - Mod.LL], where
33 patients contacted a mild form of the disease.

Physicians warned the inhabitants of the area about respecting basic
food safety norms, washing fruits and vegetables and drinking boiled
water only.

[ProMED-mail thanks Solverlad Freey for this report. The etiology of
the outbreaks may not be the same. Shigellosis is suspected in the
Tomai cluster. The total number of people affected is not mentioned.

[2] Shigellosis - Russia (Stavropol)

The producers of dairy products appear to be responsible for a
large-scale outbreak of dysentery in Stavropol. During the last
several days, the number of cases has doubled and reached almost 600.
The cases began in Lermontov on 3 Oct 2007, when children from 3
kindergartens started to come to a number of hospitals. Later, a new
locus of infection emerged in Kislovodsk.

According to the information from Irina Kovalchuk, the Deputy of
Regional Office of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the
Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], 6
townships had been affected by 6 Oct 2007: Lermontov, Kislovodsk,
Pyatigorsk, Essentuki, Jeleznovodsk, and Vinsadi. The cumulative
number of cases is 595, among which 551 are children; 374 cases have
been hospitalized.

Tests confirm the outbreak as dysentery. It appears that all the
affected people had consumed products of the dairy company "Vita."
According to Irina Kovalchuk, this link has been established in 454
cases. The management of the dairy company said that they have
stopped the production and tests are being carried out from product
samples and on specimens from personnel.

Russian chief sanitary physician, Gennady Onishchenko, said at a
press conference in Kislovodsk on Mon 8 Oct 2007, that the total
number of the infected in the Lermontov and Kislovodsk cities is 503
people and all cases in other areas of the region are "the seasonal
rise of the background disease incidence."

"The peak of the outbreak was registered on 4 Oct 2007 when about 120
people in each of the cities became ill," Onishchenko said.

The chief sanitary doctor confirmed that according to the epidemic
investigation data and preliminary laboratory analyses, the infection
source was products of the Vita dairy company of Zheleznovodsk.
Onishchenko noted, "9 samples of the confiscated product have proven
positive for dysentery, so the work of the company has been suspended
and the court will soon make a decision on its closure."

The head of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency, Valentin Uiba,
told a news conference in Lermontov on Sun 7 Oct 2007, that lab tests
had confirmed dysentery. "This disease [after recovery], as a rule,
leaves no aftermath in people," Uiba stressed.

According to the newest reports from the regional office of the
Rospotrebnadzor, 624 people, including 572 children younger than 14,
contracted the infection as of Sun evening, 7 Oct 2007. A total of
396 people, including 356 children, have been taken to hospital. This
is the 4th outbreak of intestinal infection on the Stavropol
territory since July 2007. The total number of sufferers in these
outbreaks exceeds 1100.

Physicians say the incubation period for the outbreak will be over by
the middle of this week, but new cases are possible. About 150
children have been hospitalized with intestinal infection in
Kislovodsk. Uiba told reporters that they had been diagnosed with
dysentery caused by Sonne shigella [_Shigella sonnei_].

[4] Diarrhea - Philippines (Cavite)
Date: Sun 14 Oct 2007

<http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=95777>


The number of residents affected by diarrhea in a barangay [village]
in Gen. Trias town in Cavite continues to rise. From 315 cases
reported by TV PatrolWorld Fri 12 Oct 2007, the number of residents
in Barangay Panungyanan affected by diarrhea rose to 359 cases on Sat
13 Oct 2007.

Dr. Abe Escario, municipal health officer, said that residents downed
by diarrhea may have drank "stock water" which may have been
contaminated water. He said however that he does not expect the
number of residents affected to increase as much as the past several
days. Health authorities also warned that contraction of diarrhea by
other residents may continue even if the water supply has been fixed
since diarrhea may be communicated to others. They said this was
proven when some residents were affected even if they did not drink
from the contaminated water lines.

Meanwhile The STAR reported that Cavite health officer Dr. Vilma Diez
is expecting more cases of diarrhea in General Trias town. "Expect
more (patients) to come because the incubation period of those people
who were able to drink the contaminated water is not yet over," Diez
told The Star in a mobile interview.

Health workers in General Trias are spreading advisories to all the
residents to first boil their drinking water or treat it first with
sodium hypochloride tablets that should be dissolved in water.

No fewer than 5 persons, including 2 women, 2 children and a
middle-aged man, were killed in Bauchi Sun 7 Oct 2007, by cholera.
Secretary to the state's branch of the Nigerian Red Cross, Alhaji
Adamu Abubakar, confirmed the deaths. He told newsmen in Bauchi that
about 35 other persons had been infected by the epidemic, adding that
the victims were currently responding to treatment at the Specialist
Hospital, Bauchi. Abubakar said that a special unit had been created
at the hospital for the treatment of infected persons.

Abubakar said that the epidemic was more pronounced in Gwallaga,
Korar Ran, Kofar Durmi, and Bakin Kura areas of the metropolis. The
Red Cross secretary attributed the outbreak to poor sanitary
condition in the metropolis, adding that the various flood disasters
experienced in the area in 2007, had also contributed to the outbreak.

[6] Cholera - Nigeria (Benue)
Date: Fri 12 Oct 2007

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200710120759.html>


A total of 5 persons have lost their lives from a suspected outbreak
of cholera in parts of Makurdi, the Benue state capital. The News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that communities where deaths have
been recorded included Idye Village, Logo 2, and Wadata suburb of
Makurdi, areas where pipe-borne-water could be regarded as "liquid
gold."

When NAN visited the affected communities yesterday [11 Oct 2007],
mourners, families, and friends of those who lost their lives to the
dreaded water-related disease were seen in clusters discussing the
issue and how to find a solution to the problem.

At a hospital in Wadata suburb, which is host to Hausa community
resident in Makurdi, Dr Jona Ibuku, a medical doctor told newsmen
that the hospital recorded the death of a 12-year-old girl on Sat 6
Oct 2007.

Ibuku said the hospital was inundated on a daily basis with people
who might have contracted the disease and warned people to be
cautious about the water they drank and food they ate.

NAN reports that in 2005, gastroenteritis broke out in some
communities in the state and killed several persons, a situation
which caused the government to award contract for the rehabilitation
of the Makurdi Water Works to meet the water needs of the town. NAN
also reports that the contract was, however, abandoned due to the
inability of the federal government to pay its counter-fund for the
project.
