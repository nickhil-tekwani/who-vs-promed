Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Outbreak in Kindergarten in Hong Kong
----------------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: At least 30 children from a kindergarten in Hong Kong have
contracted the potentially fatal hand, foot & mouth disease. A Health
Department spokesman said on Tue 18 Jun 2002 that they were first told of
the outbreak on Thu 13 Jun 2002 and the number of infected children at the
school in the New Territories had since doubled.
The children were treated but none have needed hospitalization. Authorities
have allowed the school in Tsuen Kwan O, a newly developed residential
district in Hong Kong's outlying territories, to remain open for the time
being. "It may not be necessary to shut the school since the disease may be
[restricted] to kids belonging to a [single] class. We have told the school
to advise parents to keep their children at home until they are fully well."
This viral infection, which can be fatal, is spread through contact with
nasal discharges, saliva, faeces and fluid from blisters, and contact with
items used by an infected individual. The incubation period for the disease
is 3 to 7 days. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, runny nose, mouth
ulcers, a painless rash on the hands, feet or buttocks, vomiting and
diarrhea. Officials were checking whether the children were infected with
the potentially deadly virus species known as _Enterovirus 71_, which
killed 30 children in Malaysia in 1997 and more than 50 in Taiwan the
following year.
Enterovirus 71 is one of several viruses that can cause hand, foot & mouth
disease, which is not usually life-threatening but sometimes causes
potentially fatal inflammation of the heart muscles, spinal cord, or brain.
So far this year 4 people in Hong Kong have been infected with enterovirus
71 but all have recovered, Lee said. He said earlier records were not
available.
