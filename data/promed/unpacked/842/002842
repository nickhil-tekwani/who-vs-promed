Investigation of Mysterious Bird Deaths (7 Apr 2007)
-----------------------------------------------
A biologist and bird expert has some theories about the deaths of a
large number of birds that washed ashore in Holyrood on Friday [6 Apr
2007]. Bill Montevecchi says the birds are thick billed murs and
common murs.
Montevecchi says the deaths may be due to avian cholera or
starvation. He says that in November and December 2006, there was a
major outbreak of avian cholera offshore and that it affected mostly
large gulls, with a little bit inshore near St. John's.
Avian cholera, also known as fowl cholera, is one of the most common
diseases among wild North American waterfowl. This disease kills
swiftly, sometimes in as few as 6 to 12 hours after infection, and
healthy birds can contract the disease from bacteria released into
the environment by dead and dying birds.
Montevecchi says the other option is that the birds have been unable
to get food for a while due to wind conditions or unavailability.
Montevecchi says birds have also been turning up in other areas. He
says there have been birds close to shore looking lethargic, which
can indicate illness. He says they have been turning up all along the
Southern Avalon, essentially from Witless Bay all the way down to St.
Shotts.
Montevecchi says that if anyone spots birds along a beach, they
should report them to wildlife officials. He says people should avoid
picking up the birds as a precaution and to double bag a bird for
officials if necessary.
Montevecchi says the 2 species of birds could be heading north
towards the arctic to breed.

There are several types of the bacterium _Pasturella hemolytica
(multocida)_, but the type most often affecting wild birds is Type 1.
In soil or water, the bacteria have been known to survive for up to 4
months. Consequently, the bacteria can be ingested through food or
water, or may be passed between birds by direct contact, or through
feces from infected birds. The bacteria may also be transmitted by
aerosol, especially if birds are in close proximity to each other.
Die-offs are most often seen in ducks and geese, although coots,
crows, and gulls may also be affected in these die-offs. Death is
usually very acute, to the point that birds may literally fall from
the sky. As a consequence of this rapid onset, large numbers of
well-fleshed birds may be found dead.
If illness is observed, the birds will be lethargic, or they may have
convulsions, swim or fly erratically or in circles, or they may
appear to try to fly upside down. Illness is not often observed, as
the onset is so acute. Fecal droppings range from pale yellow to
bloody.
Avian cholera (also sometimes called fowl cholera) is a disease to be
differentiated from avian influenza. But lesions and testing can
demonstrate that difference. Avian cholera, caused by _Pasteurella
multocida _, is not to be confused with the cholera that affects
humans, caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Fowl cholera or
avian cholera is not zoonotic and has no public health significance.
