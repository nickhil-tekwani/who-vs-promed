At least 23 people from 4 villages in Pegunungan Bintang regency,
Papua have died from acute respiratory infection since January
[2008], a local health official says. "This is not an extraordinary
situation, and health workers have been providing medical care in the
4 villages," Pegunungan Bintang Health Office head Darius Salamuk
told The Jakarta Post by cell phone Monday [24 Mar 2008].

The affected villages are Okteneng, Kaeb, Kokiabakon and Bakonaib,
all in Kiwirok district. Salamuk said respiratory diseases were a
major problem in Papua's central mountain areas. One reason for this,
he said, is that people sleep near the fire in their "honai" homes
due to the cold weather, exposing them to smoke [A honai is a hut
made of sticks and thatch.].

"This is a common health condition suffered by most of the people in
remote villages. Sufferers could be cured if they sought medical
treatment immediately, but because they're beyond the reach of
medical services, some of them cannot be saved," said Salamuk.
Medical workers must walk for days or use small planes to reach the
remote villages.

Salamuk said the team dispatched by the regency administration to
provide medical attention to villagers had found a number of
rudimentary problems. "The villagers lack clean water and good
sanitation. Their housing conditions are poor, and they sleep by the
fire in their honai to warm themselves at night. They also lack food
that meets nutritional standards," said Salamuk.

These problems are compounded by the lack of medical care. "The
villages are only served by an auxiliary community health clinic in
Mipol village, which takes at least 6 hours to reach on land from the
4 villages," he said.

Without a more detailed description of the condition of the patients
and an indication of their ages, it is difficult to infer the
possible identity of the acute respiratory disease afflicting these
villagers. Their poor standard of living, exposure to cold night
temperatures and smoke inhalation, as well as their poor nutritional
status make them vulnerable to a wide range of respiratory pathogens,
H5N1 avian influenza not excluded. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
