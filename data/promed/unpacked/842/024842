A measles epidemic has broken out in the so-called Bible Belt encompassing a Dutch Calvinist majority area that crosses the country from west to east. The population of the Bible Belt refuse vaccines on the basis of their religious convictions, and this has fuelled a national debate on the rights of the child. Or rather, on the right of the state to force parents to protect their children from preventable infectious diseases. The official number of children at risk is 466, but according to the National Institute of Public Health (RIVM) it may be 10 times higher. "In this community, not everyone goes to the doctor or informs the relevant health authorities," say Dutch virologists, who have launched an urgent campaign to inoculate 6000 at-risk babies between 6 and 14 months old. "The campaign is designated an invitation, because nationwide the vaccination schedule is voluntary. In practice, the aim is to cover more than 95 per cent of the population to eliminate the disease. Vaccination is offered where less than 90 per cent of the population has been vaccinated," they added. Between 1999 and 2000, 3 children died of measles in a similar episode and 150 were hospitalized.

The [MMR] vaccine provides protection against measles, mumps and rubella. However, the hard core of Dutch Calvinists numbers about 600 000 and this group has 3 seats in the Dutch Parliament of 150 members; a vigorous debate is being conducted at this level. Their creed leads them to question the scientific evidence favouring vaccination. Some, however, admit that peer pressure has led them to decline vaccination for their children. Aware of this situation, the RIVM has ensured that the recommendations are delivered directly to private addresses. The political debate continues unresolved [Readers interested in the arguments of the Calvinists should access the original text via the source URL. - Mod.CP].

Overall, there have been 2 cases of encephalitis and 2 pneumonias; 5 more, and an infant, are seriously ill. In 1971, the same biblical dogma was instrumental in the emergence of a poliomyelitis epidemic that killed 5 children and left another 44 with serious sequelae [pathological conditions resulting from the disease]. In 1999 there was a 2nd such outbreak.

The incidence of measles has increased 1.4-fold in the suburbs of Moscow during the 1st half of 2013 compared with the same period in the previous year. 95 per cent of measles patients either had not been vaccinated against the disease or had no record of vaccination, according to a statement from the Moscow Region Rospotrebnadzor [Health and Welfare Administration].

"During the 1st 6 months of 2013 a total of 136 cases of measles was recorded -- a 1.4-fold increase in incidence, amounting to 1.98 cases per 100 000 population. Infants were the predominant age group affected comprising 56.6 per cent (77 individuals), and the adult population 43.4 per cent (59 people)," according to the statement.

Outbreaks of measles were recorded in the Mytishchi, Odintsovskom, Balashikhinsky, Istra, Resurrection, Lenin, Ramenskoye Schelkovskoy, Pushkin, Ljuberetsky, and Naro-Fominsk areas, and specifically in the adjacent Litkarino, Jubilee, Khimki, Dolgoprudnom, and Chekhov districts.

In 2012, the incidence of measles increased several fold in Moscow, with about 100 cases. Measles is an acute infectious viral disease that is rapidly transmitted from person to person, even during brief or limited contact with the patient. It is easy to become infected through contact with children [prior to vaccination] and adults who have not been immunised against measles virus infection. A sick person is contagious until 5 days after the start of a visible rash on the skin and mucous membranes. The illness usually lasts 10-15 days, deaths occurring only in complicated cases in infants and the elderly.

About 48 people have died as a result of measles virus infection and over 3000 cases have been reported since January [2013] in Katanga province. The report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), published on Wed 17 Jul 2012 in Lubumbashi, states that the territories of Kabalo and Kalemie in Tanganyika district have been the most affected by this disease.

Tanganyika Health District alone has recorded 1511 cases of measles, including 14 deaths. This is an area of Luanika Kalemie territory, inhabited mostly by pygmies, and remains the most affected part of the health district. According to information collected by the 4 provincial health authorities in of Katanga, quoted by the OCHA, the extent of the disease is beyond the capacity of the local authorities responsible for containing the outbreak.

The rise of the epidemic is mainly due to low immunization coverage in many health zones in the province of Katanga and poor allocation of funds for the organization of immunization campaigns. Several sources indicate that the Kalemie health zone, for example, has provided no known response to the vaccination campaign against measles in a year. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which helps handle cases of measles in Luanika [Bas-Congo province], is faced with logistical problems. The World Health Organization (WHO), quoted by OCHA, says that the need for the organization of immunization activities is enormous in Katanga.

A total of 4 children have died of measles in El Salam camp for the displaced near Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, and there are threats the camp "might have to be dismantled." Speaking to Radio Dabanga on Friday [19 Jul 2013], Sheikh Mahjoub Adam Tabaldiya attributed the children's deaths to a lack of medicine and health care and a food shortage at the camp.

Sheikh Tabaldiya reiterated that "the displaced are going through very difficult humanitarian and health circumstances -- especially children, women and the elderly." He warned that "the camp might be dismantled from lack of food [and] medicine and due to the organisations' stoppage of food provision to displaced people," the sheikh said, appealing to the authorities and humanitarian NGOs to urgently provide food for the displaced.

Many of the displaced from across the Darfur camps have expressed concern about the spread of disease during the rainy season. A woman from Dreige camp in the same locality told Radio Dabanga that the heavy rains last week [week ending 21 Jul 2013] have "turned the camp into a pool of water," which encourages the breeding of flies and mosquitoes. As this can promote the spread of disease, she appealed through Radio Dabanga to humanitarian organisations working in the field of environmental sanitation to bridge and spray the water pools and provide plastic sheeting, mosquito nets and tents for the displaced. The Association of Displaced Persons and Refugees of Darfur has described 2013 as "the worst for Darfur camps," as record numbers of displaced struggle in abysmal conditions throughout the region. Speaking to Radio Dabanga, the spokesman for the Association, Hussein Abu Sharati, also expressed concern about the deteriorating health conditions and spread of diseases among the displaced.

"The heavy rains result in a general deterioration in environmental health. This, coupled with a lack of shelter such as plastic sheets and tents, contributes to the spread of diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea, bronchitis, urinary [infections], conjunctivitis, and all manner of autumnal diseases in the camps." Abu Sharati added the Association's voice to the appeal for international organisations to provide assistance, plastic sheets and tents for the displaced so that they can better endure the rainy season.

Extended Programme for Immunisation's (EMI) Dr Younas has claimed a decrease of over 50 per cent in measles cases in Punjab [province]. On Saturday [27 Jul 2013], he said that an intensive drive had resulted in the reduction of daily measles cases from 50-80 to just 20-40. He claimed that the figures would continue to improve as time progressed, as the measles [vaccine recipients] would start developing [immunity] 3 weeks [after] their initial vaccination. During the anti-measles drive from [29 Apr 2013] to [5 May 2013], around 250 000 children ranging from 6 months to 10 years old were vaccinated.

Moreover, only 27 cases of measles were reported in Punjab [province] during the last 24 hours, including only 3 from Lahore. However, the total cases of measles during the previous 6-and-a-half months were 22 885, including 192 deaths in Punjab [province].

The Orlando [Florida] area has a confirmed case of measles. Orange County health officials said on Thursday [25 Jul 2013] that a British tourist was diagnosed with the highly contagious illness. The patient was exposed to measles in the United Kingdom before taking a trip to Florida.

Health officials say the patient visited numerous tourist attractions in central Florida last week [week ending 21 Jul 2013]. They advise that anybody who develops a rash-like illness should seek medical care. Symptoms include a blotchy rash, fever, cough, runny nose and a run-down feeling. Measles is rare in the United States but is still present in Europe, Asia and Africa.

A measles outbreak among New York's Orthodox Jewish community has been curtailed, according to officials for the New York City's Department of Health. From March to June [2013], 58 cases of measles were reported in Williamsburg and Boro Park in Brooklyn, 2 heavily populated Orthodox Jewish communities, among children and adults who were not vaccinated or had denied vaccination. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) worked with yeshivas, rabbis, and other community groups to report cases and encourage vaccination.

The outbreak resulted in one case of pneumonia and 2 hospitalizations. Measles is a viral infection that can also cause miscarriages, brain inflammation, hospitalization, and even death. The collaboration between city health officials and the Orthodox community on measles prevention was notably more cooperative than other recent efforts between the 2 parties. Members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community and the DOHMH are currently involved in litigation revolving around the city's regulation of metzitzah b'peh [MBP], a controversial oral suction cleansing technique used after circumcision, which can transmit herpes. Pro-MBP advocates claim the city's medical evidence is false and that the regulation infringes on religious rights.
