Summary
Background: In mid-1997, several children died in Sarawak, Malaysia, during
an epidemic of enterovirus-71 (EV71) hand, foot, and mouth disease. The
children who died had a febrile illness that rapidly progressed to
cardiopulmonary failure and the cause was not satisfactorily resolved. We
describe the isolation and identification of a subgenus B adenovirus from
the children who died.
Methods: We studied two groups of children presenting to Sibu Hospital from
April 14 to Sept 30, 1997. For children who died, the inclusion criterion
was death after febrile illness, and for those who did not die it was acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP). Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested
for IgM antibodies to Japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses. Viruses
isolated were identified by immunofluorescence, reverse-transcriptase PCR,
or PCR and DNA sequencing.
Findings: Enterovirus was isolated in three (19%) of 16 children who died
and in none of the eight surviving children with AFP. However, an agent
that was initially difficult to identify was found in ten (63%) children
who died and five (63%) surviving children who had AFP. The agents isolated
from ten (66.7%) of these 15 children were eventually identified as
adenoviruses and were isolated mainly from clinically important sterile
sites or tissues. All the enterovirus-positive children who died had this
second agent.
Interpretation: Our data raise doubts that EV71 was the only aetiological
agent in these deaths.
