Aquaculture official Nhu Van Can told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Thursday [21 Apr 2016] that the problem 1st came to light when farmed fish in the central coastal provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Tri, Quang Binh and Hue began dying in great numbers. Now, locals are still discovering large numbers of dead fish washed up on the beaches, with local fishermen reporting that there are dead fish across the ocean floor as far as 3 miles offshore.

Officials are investigating whether the problem may be caused by pollution, and say that signs currently point to the fish having been poisoned by "unidentified substances". Locals have been asked not to eat the dead fish or feed them to their livestock because of health concerns.

The environment minister, Tran Hong Ha, said they need to establish very quickly if the fish have died due to environmental pollution, and a team of environmental experts have been dispatched from Hanoi to investigate.
