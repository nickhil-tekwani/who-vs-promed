Veterinarians are investigating several rural areas in England after 6 pigs
tested positive for AujeszkyÂ´s disease, a livestock ailment, the government
said Fri 28 Jun 2002.
The discovery was made at the same slaughterhouse where the first case of
foot & mouth was detected in last year's epidemic. The Department of
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] said it was likely a coincidence
that the 2 diseases were discovered at Cheale Meats, in Brentwood, Essex,
southern England.
The ailment, which mainly strikes pigs, is not as contagious as foot & mouth
and is generally spread slowly from pig to pig, the department said Friday.
Aujeszky's disease, first discovered in cattle in the United States in 1813,
turned up in Britain in 1979 and the last outbreak was in 1989. Two years
later, Britain was declared officially free of it. The disease also has been
found in continental Europe.

[Aujeszky's disease (AD), also known as pseudorabies, is caused by an
alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs,
such as the respiratory tract. Pigs are the only natural host for the
Aujeszky's virus, although it can infect cattle, sheep, cats, dogs and rats
causing fatal disease. Infected pigs may remain latently infected following
clinical recovery. The disease is controlled by containment of infected
herds, removal of latently infected animals, or by vaccination. Vaccination
would alleviate the clinical signs and is used in many countries.
AD had not existed widely outside Eastern Europe before the 1960s but by now
has a world-wide distribution. Following the 1989 outbreak, during which
1373 animals were slaughtered, Britain was declared officially free of this
disease in 1991 after the completion of extensive serum surveys; vaccination
is prohibited while a stamping-out policy is applied. The current cases
should be regarded as "suspected" until official confirmation or exclusion
of AD is obtained.
A diagnosis of AD is established by detecting the agent (isolation or PCR --
Polymerase Chain Reaction) as well as by serological tests: virus
neutralisation, latex agglutination or ELISA. See OIE's Manual
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00039.htm>.
The UK pig industry has suffered outbreaks of 2 OIE List A diseases in
recent years: Classical Swine Fever (2000) and FMD (2001). Changes in swine
management, notably total confinement of large numbers of pigs and
continuous farrowing, may have been contributing factors. The use of swill
for swine feeding could have been another one.
AD is an OIE List B disease, meaning a "transmissible disease which is
considered to be of socio-economic and/or public health importance within
countries and which is significant in the international trade of animals and
animal products". List B diseases should be reported to the OIE once a year.
Additional reporting is expected if there are findings of exceptional
epidemiological significance to other countries. According to article
2.2.2.2. of the International Animal Health Code of the OIE, one of the
conditions for a country or a zone to be considered free of AD is that "no
vaccination against the disease has been carried out". - Mod. AS]
