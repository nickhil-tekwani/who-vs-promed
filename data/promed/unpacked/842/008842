Outbreak description
--------------------
In early September 2011, local health authorities were notified by a
hospital clinician of an outbreak of 5 suspected cases of botulism
(Outbreak 1) among 8 people who attended a family dinner in the
Vaucluse department in south east France. The 5, aged in their mid-50s
to mid-80s, presented with classic symptoms of botulism
(gastrointestinal symptoms followed by descending paralysis) 24 to 36
hours after the meal and were hospitalized the same or the following
day after symptom onset. All 5 rapidly developed quadriplegia and
required intubation and mechanical ventilation. A trivalent antitoxin
was administered to all 5. As of the end of November (latest
information available), all were still in hospital.

A further suspected case, who had attended the same family dinner, was
initially asymptomatic, but went on to develop mild symptoms of
botulism (double vision, ptosis, and difficulty in swallowing), 7 days
after the family meal. This person was hospitalized the day of symptom
onset. The patient did not develop paralysis of the limbs or
respiratory muscles and was discharged from hospital 3 days after
admission.

A 2nd outbreak of 3 suspected cases (Outbreak 2) was reported 2 days
following notification of Outbreak 1, among 6 people who attended
another family dinner, in the Somme department in the north of France.
The 3 suspected cases, all aged in their 20s, presented with classic
symptoms of botulism 1 day after the dinner and were hospitalized that
day. All 3 rapidly developed quadriplegia and required intubation and
mechanical ventilation. A trivalent antitoxin was administered to all
3. The duration of hospitalization ranged from 34 to 58 days. 2
asymptomatic people who also attended the dinner were hospitalized for
observation and were discharged after 48 hours.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
An investigation was undertaken the day Outbreak 1 was notified, to
confirm the diagnosis, identify any additional cases and the vehicle
of intoxication and to put in place appropriate control measures.

When the first outbreak was notified, the French Ministry of Health
issued an urgent message about the outbreaks to all French hospitals
and poison control centers. Hospital clinicians were reminded to
report immediately all clinical suspicions of botulism to the local
health authorities, using the mandatory notification system.

The local health authorities documented the food consumption of the
suspected cases in the 2 to 3 days before symptom onset and
particularly during the meal shared by each family in the outbreaks,
including type of food, brand and date and place of purchase.

Clinical samples
----------------
Serum, gastric juice, and stool samples from the suspected cases and
samples recovered from leftover foods from the 2 family meals were
analyzed by the National Reference Centre for Anaerobic Bacteria and
Botulism at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The presence of botulinum
toxin type A was confirmed by the mouse lethality test and by
seroprotection with specific antibodies [1]. The presence of
_Clostridium botulinum_ was investigated by real-time PCR
amplification of the type A, B and E neurotoxin genes, and strain
isolation and characterization [1].

Type A botulinum toxin was identified in serum samples by the mouse
lethality test from 7 of the 9 suspected cases and _C. botulinum_ was
isolated from stool and/or gastric juice from the same 7 cases. As the
other 2 persons had clinical symptoms compatible with botulism and an
epidemiological link with a laboratory-confirmed case, they were also
considered as cases.

Serum samples taken from 3 asymptomatic people who had participated in
the family meals, 1 in Outbreak 1 and 2 in Outbreak 2, were negative
for botulinum toxin.

Food investigation
------------------
In Outbreak 1, the 8 family members had shared a single common meal at
the start of September 2011 (24 to 36 hours before symptom onset in
the first 5 cases), during which all 5 ate ground green olive paste
(containing green olives, garlic, capers and olive oil). The 2
asymptomatic participants did not report having eaten the paste. The
case who presented later with a milder form of the disease, reported
not having eaten the paste, but having used the knife that had been
used to serve it. A dried-tomato paste was also eaten by some (number
unknown) of the family members who attended the meal.

In Outbreak 2, consumption of ground green olive paste and a
dried-tomato paste during the single common meal in early September
(one day before symptom onset) was reported for all 3 cases. The
asymptomatic participants did not report consumption of these
products, with the exception of 1 participant who ate only the tomato
paste.

Leftovers of the 2 meals were sent for testing 2 days after each meal
had taken place. The national reference centre identified botulinum
toxin type A in the green olive paste from the meal in Outbreak 1,
with toxin titres of 20,000 mouse lethal doses (MLD)/g. The
dried-tomato paste, eaten by some of the family of Outbreak 1, was
negative for botulinum toxin. Type A botulinum toxin was also
identified in the leftover olive paste (toxin titres of 2000 MLD/g)
and to a lesser extent in the tomato paste (2 MLD/g) from the meal in
Outbreak 2.

_C. botulinum_ type A was identified by real-time PCR from all 4 food
samples and isolated from 3 food samples (green olive paste leftovers
from both meals and the leftover dried-tomato paste from the meal in
Outbreak 2).

Trace-back and environmental investigations
-------------------------------------------
The trace-back investigation found that the 2 families in Outbreaks 1
and 2 had eaten ground green olive paste that had been produced on 20
May 2011. The tomato paste eaten by members of Outbreak 1 had been
produced on 26 July 2011, while that eaten by members of Outbreak 2
dated from 20 May 2011.

The green olive pastes and tomato pastes had been purchased by the
families in 2 grocery stores in 2 neighboring districts of the
Provence region in south-east France, in late July and Aug 2011. They
were sold in small glass jars with screw-top lids as part of a
collection of several pastes, which are typical of this region. The
products came from a local artisanal producer: they were produced in
small quantities (the size of the batch of olive paste produced on 20
May 2011 was about 60 pots) and distributed principally to grocery
stores under 3 different brand names, in a limited geographical area
in the south-east of the country. The products were also sold in small
quantities on the Internet.

An environmental investigation carried out by the district food
control authority identified that the sterilization process was
incorrect, which affected not only the production of the 2 types of
paste, but all goods made by this producer. No in-house quality
assurance controls had been performed and the producer had not
declared the food production to the local health authorities
responsible for inspecting food producers.

Public health measures
----------------------
The green olive paste was recalled nationally, via a local and
national press release, the day after the first outbreak was notified.
Following trace-back investigation, inspection of the production
procedures and microbiological results suggesting that other products
prepared using the same sterilization process could also be at risk,
all products of the producer involved were recalled 2 days after the
press release was issued.

European countries were informed of the occurrence of the cases and
the incriminated product via the Early Warning and Response System
(EWRS) and the Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS) of the
European Centre for Disease Control, the International Food Safety
Authorities Network (INFOSAN) of the WHO and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations and via an alert in the European
Union’s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), the day after
the press release was issued and during the following 2 days.

As of 6 Dec 2011, no other case of botulism associated with this
product has been identified in France or any other European Union
Member State.

Discussion
----------
Botulism is a rare disease in France and has been statutorily
notifiable since 1986. Between 2007 and 2009, 47 cases were notified
[2] and among the confirmed cases, botulinum type B toxin was
identified in 33 and botulinum type A toxin in 8 (3 of the 8 were
infants). The last reported episode of botulism in France due to
botulinum type A toxin was in Corsica in 2010 [3], in which 5 people
who attended the same meal developed severe botulism: one case died.
This episode was linked to the consumption of home-preserved French
beans in a salade niçoise.

Botulism due to type A toxin is characteristically associated with the
consumption of vegetable products, especially home-canned vegetables,
but some cases have been linked to commercially processed foods [4].
The probable food source in the outbreaks described here was a green
olive paste produced by a local manufacturer using inadequate
sterilization techniques. Botulism food poisoning associated with
incorrectly prepared olives has previously been documented [5,6].
Garlic, which was included in the preparation of the olive pastes
involved in these outbreaks, has also been previously associated with
botulism [7].

_C. botulinum_ spores are present in the environment and can be
present in foods that have not been subjected to a sufficiently high
temperature during preparation [8,9]. If appropriate conditions exist
within such foods, _C. botulinum_ spores present can germinate,
multiply, and produce toxin. The environmental investigation carried
out following the 2 outbreaks described in this report demonstrated
that the sterilisation process used by the producer was incorrect. Our
findings strongly suggest that the inadequate sterilisation process
permitted spores of _C. botulinum_ to survive the preparation process
and consequently was the probable cause of the outbreaks.

These outbreaks highlight the potential public health threat of _C.
botulinum_ associated with inadequate sterilization processes and
underline the importance of monitoring practices of producers involved
in small-scale food preparation.

[This is a more formal description of this outbreak which was reported
previously in ProMED-mail (Botulism, human - France: homemade tapenade 20110906.2720). Olive products are not uncommon sources of botulism,
if inappropriately prepared, as they are low acid foods. The severity
of disease in these cases is suggestive of type A botulism as compared
to types B and E, the other botulinum toxins commonly causing human
botulism. - Mod.LL ]
