[Ref: R Pan et al. Cylindrocladium black rot caused by
_Cylindrocladium parasiticum_ newly reported on peanut in China. BSPP
New Disease Reports 2009 (Feb-Aug); 19]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In June and October 2008, disease symptoms on peanut (_Arachis
hypogaea_) were observed in several fields in Guangdong Province. The
characteristic symptoms were black rot of the basal stems and the
below-ground tissues including roots, pegs and pods, with
reddish-orange fruiting bodies on the diseased parts. Entire vines
eventually wilted and died. The disease incidence reached as much as
50 percent in some fields, causing severe yield losses.

Microscopic examination revealed that the reddish-orange fruiting
bodies were perithecia. Isolation was made from basal stem tissues at
the edge of disease lesions. Conidia and microsclerotia were observed
after 3 to 4 days. Perithecia were formed after 20 days. The fungus
was identified as _Cylindrocladium parasiticum_ (teleomorph
_Calonectria ilicicola_) (Bell & Sobers, 1966; Crous et al., 1993).
Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculation of 2-week-old seedlings in
pots of cv. Bendizhongby drenching the soil near to the shoot with a
mixed suspension of mycelia, conidia and microsclerotia. All
inoculated plants showed black rot symptoms on stem bases and roots 2
weeks after inoculation, and _C. parasiticum_ was reisolated from
inoculated plants.

Cylindrocladium black rot of peanut is a major disease in the United
States. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of this disease on
peanut in China. This pathogen may pose a serious threat to peanut
production in China where peanut is a major crop.

[The fungus _Cylindrocladium parasiticum_ affects peanut
(cylindrocladium black rot; CBR) as well as other crops including
soybean (red crown rot), cowpea, tea, beans, blueberry, lucerne and
clover. Yield losses of more than 50 percent have been reported for
peanuts in some areas. CBR is found in tropical and subtropical
regions in Oceania and parts of Asia as well as the US where it is
the limiting factor for peanut production in some areas. Symptoms
include stunting, wilting, leaf yellowing and rotting of stem bases
and root system. Pods may show various stages of decay and nuts may
be shedded prematurely. The disease is soilborne and affected plants
may be confined to a small area of a field or scattered throughout.

The fungus is spread with soil, plant material (including seed
coats), contaminated equipment and other materials. Susceptible weed
species and volunteer crops may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management includes phytosanitary measures to limit spread, cultural
methods (such as crop rotation), soil fumigation and fungicides. Only
few commercial peanut cultivars with some level of resistance are available.
