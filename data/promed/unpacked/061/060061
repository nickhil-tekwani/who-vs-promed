Outbreak Number 15 took place in Azriqam, Ashkelon sub-district, Hadarom district, and was, as stated, "the 1st outbreak outside the northern region of Israel."

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 16 [of which 11 dairy cattle farms and 5 beef herds]
Total animals affected
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 3639/ 151/ 2/ 30/ 0

[Out of the 151 reported cases, 123 were recorded in dairy cattle]; a total of 30 of them were culled; no culling applied in beef herds].

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Vectors

Epidemiological comments: The disease continues to spread towards the south and west of the index outbreak. Lately, many dairy herds have been affected (in most of the farms small number of diseased animals). Modified stamping out has been practiced in these herds (euthanasia of the animals with clinical signs) [see comment]. It seems that in the winter the vectors prefer warmer stables (dairy) than open, cooler and windy areas (beef). On 11 Mar 2013 the disease appeared for the 1st time during this event outside the northern part of the country.

Measures applied: Control of arthropods, Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Screening, Dipping/Spraying, Modified stamping out.
