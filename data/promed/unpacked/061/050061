EU Animal disease notification system (ADNS)
-----------------------------------------------
According to the annual information for 2006 as presented in table 11
(animal disease situation per country and per disease) of ADNS (Animal
Disease Notification System) of DG Health and Consumer Health, EU, the
total number of confirmed bluetongue (BT) outbreaks reported by EU member
states during 2006 was 2288. Of the said outbreaks, 2047 were reportedly
caused by BT virus (BTV) serotype 8 in north Europe (Belgium, France,
Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). The remaining 241 outbreaks were
reported from south Europe, namely Italy (Sardinia; 227), Bulgaria (13) and
Portugal (1).
The following data relate to BTV-8.
Country / 2006 total (last confirmation date)
1. Belgium / 695 (14 Dec 2006)
2. France / 6 (14 Nov 2006)
3. Germany / 885 (29 Dec 2006)
4. Luxembourg / 5 (11 Dec 2006)
5. Netherlands / 456 (29 Dec 2006)

[No new outbreaks have been reported from France, Luxembourg and Belgium
since (respectively) 14 Nov, 11 Dec and 14 Dec 2006. The disease seems to
be still lingering in the Netherlands and Germany. ADNS table 11 for the
week 29 Dec 2006 - 5 Jan 2007 reports 4 outbreaks in Europe, of which there
were 2 in Germany and 2 in the Netherlands. This is rather surprising when
the disease in question is a culicoides-borne disease that was expected to
disappear during the late autumn. For the mentioned update of table 11, see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11/adns_050107_en.pdf>.
A detailed epidemiological analysis on the evolvement of the BTV-8
epizootic that started in the summer of 2006, including weekly reports with
maps and epidemic curves pertaining to the disease dynamics within the
respective countries, can be found in the last available update of
"Bluetongue Serotype 8 Epidemic Bulletin" by EFSA Epidemiology Working
Group (No 11, 21 Dec 2006: Outbreak Period until 20 Dec 2006). See
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/in_focus/bluetongue/outbreak_overview.html>.
The review includes, among other information, critical assessment of the
ADNS data.
Can the demonstrated involvement of _Culicoides dewulfi_, a vector present
throughout the palearctic region in areas where cattle are husbanded, be
responsible for the prolonged activity of the virus? Entomologists,
meteorologists and ecologists might be the ones equipped to propose
explanations.
Will BTV-8 survive the winter and renew its circulation in northern Europe
next year? This crucial question is a matter for speculation and concern,
involving, in addition to the affected countries, their neighbors and
particularly the UK, which harbors Europe's leading sheep population. - Mod.AS]
