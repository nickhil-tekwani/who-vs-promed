Qualitative risk assessment for seasonal transmission of bluetongue virus and its spread by movements of ruminants from restriction zones.
-----------------------------
After many years of freedom from bluetongue disease, new cases of infections with serotype 8 occurred in cattle in the southwest of Germany at the end of 2018. Therefore, the FLI updated the risk assessment regarding the seasonal transmission of bluetongue virus by biting midges and the risk of spread of bluetongue virus by movements of ruminants from restriction zones.

With regard to seasonal transmission through biting midges, the risk was assessed as negligible for the months December to March (low vector-active period), moderate for April and November and high for May to October (vector-active period). The risk may vary between different regions of Germany.

There is, in principle, a risk of virus spread by movements of animals carrying replicating virus (viraemic animals) or cows that are pregnant with viraemic fetuses, to free areas. However, the bluetongue disease (BT) virus can only spread if living vectors are active. To mitigate this risk, national and European regulations (Commission Regulation (EG) No 1266/2007) for animal movements exist.

During the vector-free period, the EU regulations impose certain time limits or combinations of examinations and waiting periods to avoid movements of viraemic animals that were infected at the end of the vector-active period. Within the vector-active period, animal movements are only allowed if there is proof of vaccination or if antibodies can be detected. For this reason, the risk of spread by movements of animals according to regulation EG No 1266/2007 is estimated as negligible.

Regarding national regulations:

(1) The risk of spread by movements of animals for slaughter or movements of animals with sufficient vaccination is estimated also as negligible both within the low vector-active period and the vector-active period.

(2) The risk of spread by movements of infected calves to free zones is estimated as low both within the low vector-active and the vector-active periods for 2 reasons. During the last months, an increasing number of viraemic calves have been observed, which allows an undetected spread of the virus. Due to the 9-month gestation period, an intrauterine infection might lead to viraemic calves being born virtually all year round.

(3) The risk of spread by movements of animals tested virologically negative in combination with a protection against biting midges is estimated as probable within the vector-active period (due to possible infections between testing and movement and because of the esteemed insufficient repellent effect), and as negligible within the low vector-active period.

Broadly, the current FLI BTV-8 assessment, issued 26 Apr 2019, falls in line with the BTV-8 assessment document authored by DEFRA's (UK) experts, updated 29 Mar 2019 (ProMED-mail post Bluetongue - Europe (07): BTV-8, cattle, Belgium, Germany, France, congenital 20190330.6394747 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/794759/btv8-germany-update3.pdf).

The DEFRA assessment of the possible spread of congenital BTV-8 in Germany said: "The outbreaks since the previous outbreak assessment in January [2019] are all within the same [countries], and in this respect, the virus does not appear to have spread further north or east within Germany since January 2019." This has not changed since.

DEFRA's general concluding remarks (following), similar to FLI's assessment, include reference to EU's 1266/2007 regulations:

"We are now approaching the start of the Culicoides biting midge vector season in northern Europe and the UK. In this respect, the month of March [2019] (and early April) presents a negligible risk of introduction of BTV-8 from the trade of cattle or sheep from northern Europe, which have sufficient residual viraemia (from infection in late autumn 2018) to infect UK midges and hence infect UK cattle. However, given that the Belgian and German cases suggest there is virus circulation occurring presently, by late April 2019, some livestock may be sufficiently viraemic to infect UK midges if moved to the UK. The restriction zones currently in place across the whole of Belgium and France and parts of Germany will minimise risk of importation of infected cattle to the UK. ... The risk of entry of BTV-8 to the UK is thus considered to be LOW for April and May 2019.

"The role of increased trans-placental transmission of the re-emerging BTV-8 strain in northern Europe in terms of an "over-wintering" mechanism and risks of introduction from importing in-calf cattle needs to be kept under review. The 1266/2007 regulation requires cattle to be vaccinated prior to being serviced, and this should prevent transplacental transmission."

During May 2019, Culicoides activity is expected to increase in Germany and the other named countries. Adhering to EU requirements and maximal BTV-8 vaccination coverage of cattle are warranted. - Mod.AS
