Ministry of Health
Box 2223, Government Building
Suva, Fiji
Dengue Fever
Disease Outbreak Warning #15
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, April 14, 1998
The Dengue Fever epidemic is continuing into its fourth month throughout
Fiji, with nearly 24 000 suspected cases and 1600 hospitalisations
reported from Ministry of Health facilities since it began in late
December.
In addition, there have been two isolated reports of
travellers to Fiji being diagnosed in Australia and the Cook Islands.
Dengue is continuing to spread around the Western Pacific region, with
cases reported from the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tonga and Indonesia
among others.
The 12th death due to Dengue occurred on 31 March, and was confirmed by
serology and clinically compatible autopsy. The victim was a six year
old boy from Taveuni who had presented two days earlier with flu-like
symptoms, and was sent home. Two days later, the victim was admitted in
critical condition, and died within hours from shock and internal
haemorrhage. Nationally, this was the first Dengue death in more than a
month, and the first laboratory-confirmed case diagnosed on Taveuni.
There have been 10 deaths reported from CWM Hospital in Suva, and 1
death reported from Nadi Hospital to date.
The Northern Division is the latest area to experience a rise in Dengue
infections, with 30 admissions reported at Labasa Hospital in the past
two weeks, and more than 200 admissions at the 24 bed Savusavu Hospital
in the past two months. The Northern Division reports that intensive
vector control activities are currently underway. The Divisional Medical
Officer Central / Eastern Division also reports high levels of Dengue
cases from Kadavu Island, with more than 9% of the population affected
to date.
The public is advised to avoid complacency, to continue activities to
destroy mosquito breeding sites, and to cooperate with government
officials responsible for helping to control the epidemic. Only
sustained effort will effectively reduce the impact of Dengue in Fiji,
and prevent more avoidable deaths and hospitalisations.

[It would be wonderful if other countries would produce such succinct
reports on their ongoing dengue situation as Fiji. The only thing missing is
a mention of the types of dengue virus isolated - Mod.JW
