[This report includes comments from correspondents, as well as information
released by official and other sources up to Fri 3 Aug 2001, edited for
presentation in ProMED-mail.
Since the last weekly surveillance report, West Nile virus-infected birds
have been reported in Ohio and Pennsylvania. West Nile virus had not
previously been found in Ohio.
The suspected human case of West Nile virus infection in Florida has been
confirmed.
Because of variation in the reporting regimes of different agencies, it is
difficult to keep accurate running totals of the number of West Nile
virus-positive results. For the present, the appearance of West Nile virus
in new states and geographical areas will be reported separately in
ProMED-mail as such reports are received. Subsequently test results for
each state will appear in the weekly surveillance report only. - Mod.CP

Rebuttal of Moderator's Comments: see West Nile virus surveillance 2001 -
USA (14); part (11) 20010728.1476
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In my comment of 25 July [West Nile virus surveillance 2001 - USA (14) I
said, "Given the inadequate nature of surveillance methods used for
arboviruses and the lack of seriousness with which some folks take West
Nile virus, my suspicion is that this virus is just about everywhere in the
eastern United States and maybe in other areas of North America and perhaps
has extended into Latin America. It is highly unlikely that the only
infected mosquitoes, birds, and mammals found are the ones that have been
infected. Something may be very wrong with the surveillance system,
starting with vector surveillance." The key phrases here are "inadequate
surveillance" and "something must be wrong with the surveillance system."
Jack Woodall, my esteemed and somewhat older colleague, commented on my
comment, saying: "Not to disagree with my esteemed colleague Charlie
Calisher, but I would think that the surveillance effort in all states is
even higher than it was in the last 2 years, and that the dead crow index
is a good one. Looking for arboviruses in their vectors is like looking for
a needle in a haystack (and I know, I´ve done it for years). Most
mosquitoes that come to traps have never fed before, so can´t have been
infected in the first place -- the number that are transovarially infected
is probably rather low. Hence you have to catch and process many thousands
of mosquitoes to make a handful of virus isolations. Not many states have
that capacity. What limits mosquito transmission is mosquito survival,
which can be measured by the number of days for which the ambient
temperature is above a certain threshold for larval development. In the
Southern USA this threshold was passed before the Northeast. When the
Northeast catches up, we may be in for a nasty surprise."
Jack is certainly right insofar as the surveillance details are concerned,
but I would like to point out that he has only confirmed that the
surveillance system being used is greater, more intense -- not better --
than before. No doubt the federal government has invested a great deal of
money and local governments are trying harder, but are they doing better?
As far as I am concerned, they clearly are not.
What has sophisticated surveillance come to when a sick Cooper's hawk found
in DeKalb County is the best that Georgia can do to monitor for West Nile
virus; when untrained citizens are being asked to pick up and submit dead
birds for testing; and when recommendations for mosquito control are being
based on information about St. Louis encephalitis virus? Keeping in mind
that Cooper's hawks feed on birds, one may assume that this bird ate a bird
that was infected with West Nile virus. That chickens have been shown to be
inadequate as sentinels tells me that _Culex pipiens_ is not the critical
vector. That we do not yet know the vector with certainty is another
problem unsolved.
It is not the efforts being put into the current surveillance scheme that I
criticize, it is the inadequate basis for that scheme that seems so
lacking. It has been 2 years after the discovery of West Nile virus in the
U.S., and local health departments still have to send samples to C.D.C. for
confirmation. All this is the price we are paying for having allowed the
2-decade long decline in support for arbovirologic studies at the local and
national level. Reductions in taxes come with a price, probably the least
publicized consequence of a political decision in recent history.

Correction
----------
[Dr John E. Crews has sent the following correction to the Gannett News
Service Report of Wed 25 Jul 2001 describing a candidate equine West Nile
virus vaccine, which was posted as part [3 of West Nile virus surveillance
2001 - USA (14)20010728.1476. - Mod.CP
The first sentence of the report stated that Dr. William Jeter is an animal
industry biologist for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services' Division of Agricultural Environmental Services. In fact, Dr.
Jeter is a Veterinarian with the Florida Department of Agriculture's
Division of Animal Industry. The Division of Animal Industry is led by the
State Veterinarian, Dr. Leroy Coffman, and Dr. Jeter is in charge of the
Division of Animal Industry's equine programs among his many other duties.

Baltimore City to Halt Testing of Birds
---------------------------------------
The rain of dead birds in 2 Northeast Baltimore neighborhoods has grown so
heavy that city health officials have decided to stop collecting and
testing them for the West Nile virus. City workers have collected hundreds
of dead birds thought to be infected with the disease. Health officials are
asking residents in the 21206 and 21214 zipcode areas to dispose of dead
birds so that the city can focus on counting mosquitoes in these areas.
Mosquitoes spread the virus. If the counts get high enough, the city will
begin spraying insecticides to reduce the threat to human health.

West Nile Virus Found in Mosquitoes Trapped in Foster
-----------------------------------------------------
PROVIDENCE: The Department of Environmental Management has announced that
West Nile virus has been found in 5 mosquitoes from a single trap set on 16
Jul 2001 in Foster [Rhode Island. The finding is not unexpected, since
West Nile Virus has already been identified in mosquitoes this year in
several states including Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. It has also
been found in birds along the East Coast this year, including Rhode Island.
The West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes were collected from a trap in the
vicinity of Paine Road and East Killingly Road in north central Foster, a
sparsely populated area, and separated by species into 2 pools for testing.
One mosquito pool contained two _Aedes cantator_ mosquitoes, a freshwater
mammal-biting species. The other mosquito pool contained 3 _Coquillettidia_
mosquitoes, similarly a freshwater mammal-biting mosquito.
Under this year's mosquito response protocol, no spraying is planned. The
state has revised its protocol this year based on lessons learned last year
and new findings issued by the Centers for Disease Control. This year's
response protocol places more emphasis on larviciding and public education
and less emphasis on the use of adulticides. Spraying will be recommended
this year only if a team of mosquito-control experts determines that the
public is at substantial risk of being bitten by infected mosquitoes.

West Nile virus-positive Birds Now Total 6
--------------------------------------------
As of 1 Aug 2001, the State Mosquito Management Program announced that
Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV) has been confirmed in bird-biting
(_Culiseta melanura_) mosquitoes trapped in North Stonington. The
mosquitoes were collected on 17 Jul 2001. This is the first isolation of
EEEV this year.
Additionally, 2 crows found on 20 Jul 2001 in the Greenfield Hill section
of Fairfield, have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This brings
the total number of birds that have tested positive for WNV in Connecticut
to 6.
