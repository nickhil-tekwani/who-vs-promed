On [Wed 5 Feb 2020], Briarwood Elementary School was notified by the Barren River District Health Department of a confirmed case of typhoid fever in one of their students. Briarwood Elementary School says, according to the CDC, _Salmonella_ Typhi is spread through sewage contamination of food or water, and through person-to-person contact.

The Barren River District Health Department released the following statement on [Thu 6 Feb 2020]:

"Barren River District Health Department uses investigational findings to make public health recommendations. At this time, findings indicate a low risk of _Salmonella_ Typhi exposure to others; therefore, no public health recommendations are currently warranted for the community. As always, public health recommends practicing good health habits, including thorough handwashing and staying home if you are sick."

The CDC says that in the USA, only about 350 people are diagnosed with the illness every year.

Principal Lori Morris advised parents to be watchful for the following symptoms in their children: 103-104 deg F [39.4-40 deg C] fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, diarrhea or constipation, cough, or loss of appetite.

_Salmonella_ Typhi is a treatable illness with the right antibiotics. School officials encourage parents to stress the importance of good handwashing to prevent the spread of infection.

[It is unusual to acquire this infection in the USA. Little information is given regarding the travel history of the case or of the case's contacts.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever; anorexia; lethargy; malaise; dull, continuous headache; nonproductive cough; vague abdominal pain; and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
