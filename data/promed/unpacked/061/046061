One person died and more than 30 were infected in November 2017 in a salmonellosis outbreak among customers of a Colorado restaurant, but the public wasn't notified at the time and the restaurant remains open for business. A 27 Nov 2017 inspection report for the implicated restaurant, La California on Peoria Street in Aurora, Colorado, shows the Tri-County [Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas counties] Health Department did not find any violations at that time. However, reports for inspections on 6, 8, 15, and 19 Dec 2017 show multiple critical violations.

A number of those violations, such as holding foods at the wrong temperatures and not keeping raw chicken separate from other foods, are known to allow _Salmonella_ bacteria to grow rapidly and to cause cross contamination of other foods.

On Thu 8 Feb 2018, the health department confirmed details about the outbreak for reporter Erika Gonzalez of the KDVR-TV Channel 31 news department. It was not clear why public health officials did not alert the public of the outbreak at the time.

Laboratory tests showed the restaurant's family meal combo was likely the source of the _Salmonella_. However, health officials told multiple Denver area media outlets that they had not been able to isolate which food or foods in the meal combo were specifically contaminated.

One restaurant employee tested positive for _Salmonella_ infection, according to the CBS News affiliate in Denver. All of the other outbreak victims were customers of La California. All of the illnesses began between 4 Nov 2017 and 26 Nov 2017, the health department reported.

The department reported 13 of the 33 cases are confirmed. 20 of the sick people are probable cases. 25 of the sick people ate at the restaurant within a five-day period from 10 to 14 Nov 2017.

Violations observed during the 6 Dec 2018 health department inspection of La California restaurant included:
Cross-contamination:
- A container of raw chicken was stored on top of a box of raw shelled eggs in the walk-in refrigerator. A box of eggs was stored on a box of tortillas in the walk-in refrigerator.
- Hand washing: a cook line employee was observed cracking raw shelled eggs but failed to properly wash their hands and change their gloves before handling ready to eat tortillas and ready to eat cheese.
- Food temperature control: 3 large containers of refried beans were 50 deg F [10 deg C] after cooling overnight on the shelf beneath the preparation table across from the preparation sink. A large pot of cooked tomatillos and jalape√±os was 47 deg F [8.3 deg C] after cooling at room temperature overnight on the floor. A small pot of tamale salsa was 53 deg F [11.7 deg C] after cooling overnight in the 4-door reach in refrigerator. A large pot of basole [?posole] was 48 deg F [8.9 deg C] and a large pot of beef soup was 48 degrees F after cooling overnight in the walk-in refrigerator.

The FDA, the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture warn that foods should not be held at temperatures between 40 deg and 140 deg F [5-63 deg C].

Violations observed by public health inspectors during the 8 Dec 2017 follow-up visit included:
- Personnel hygienic practices: an employee was observed rinsing their food probe thermometer in the hand sink located on the cook line. Utensils were stored in the basin of the cook line hand sink.
- Food temperature control: cooked, ready-to-eat carnitas were measured between 124 deg and 132 deg F [51.1-55.6 deg C] on the cook line hot holding table. Cooked rice measured 127 deg F [52.8 deg C] on the cook line hot holding table.

One violation was observed by public health inspectors during the 15 Dec 2017 follow-up visit -- hand washing: paper towels were not available at the hand sink by the food preparation sink.

One violation was observed by public health inspectors during the 19 Dec 2017 follow-up visit -- personnel hygienic practices: a red plastic basket was observed in the basin of the hand washing sink located on the cook line.

A follow-up inspection on 26 Dec 2017, showed no violations.

Symptoms of salmonellosis usually include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, beginning from 12 to 72 hours following exposure, according to the CDC. In most cases, symptoms last for 4 to 7 days, and most victims recover without treatment. However young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be prone to more serious illness, including severe diarrhea, which can result in severe dehydration.
