[Most of the outbreaks addressed in the above follow-up report relate to small (less than 10 animals, mostly less than 3 animals) backyard holdings, while 8 are larger, namely 80 (1 holding), 22 (1), 20 (2), 15 (2), 12 (1) and 10 (1 holding).

Since the start of the LSD event in Albania on 26 Jun 2016 (spread from the eastern neighbor, FYR Macedonia), Albania has suffered a total of 218 outbreaks; their locations can be seen at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20447.

Reportedly, vaccinations are being applied; their number and locations are not presented in the current follow-up report.

LSD, a capripox viral cattle disease, is not transmissible to humans. In animals, it causes fever, salivation, lacrimation, nasal discharge, and typical skin lesions of nodular form from which it derives its name. In the affected farms, LSD is responsible for serious economic losses, resulting from the decrease in milk production, abortions and fertility disorders. Transmission between animals occurs through arthropod vectors, particularly flies, but direct infection or indirect by contaminated instruments are not excluded.

Absence of LSD outbreaks for 3 consecutive years are required for a country to regain an official disease-free status; this underlines the economic severity of an outbreak.

Capripoxviruses are classified by the government of the United States as potential agents for agri-terrorism; in the conditions prevailing there, and in intensive cattle farming units, direct and indirect production losses caused by LSD have been estimated to be as high as 45-65 percent. European estimates of LSD economic impact are yet to be calculated. In developing countries, the poorest small-scale farmers and rural communities, whose livelihood is totally dependent on cattle, bear the heaviest burden during outbreaks. - Mod.AS
