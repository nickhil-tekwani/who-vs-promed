-----------------------------------------------------------
The occurrence of dead dormant flower buds is a common phenomenon of economic importance in the major pear production areas of Europe. Thus far, the cause of dead flower buds disease remained unknown. Several causes have been proposed, including insufficient tree chilling, unmet dormancy requirements, incompatibility between scion and cultivar, but also various biotic stress agents such as pathogens and pests.

In this study, we tested the relationship between reduction of tree growth and dead flower bud incidences, but found no indication that growth regulation can prevent the occurrence of dead flower buds. It has been proposed that the bacterium _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _syringae_ may be the causal agent of dead flower buds of pear. However, although we found the bacterium as epiphyte and even as endophyte on and in flower buds, our findings argue that _P. syringae_ pv. _syringae_ is not the causal agent of dead flower buds disease in the Netherlands.

In our research, _Alternaria_ spp. were consistently found in diseased flower buds, and strong correlations between dead dormant flower buds and infection rates of flower buds with _Alternaria_ spp. were recorded. The isolated _Alternaria_ species were identified as _A. arborescens_ SC [species complex] and _A. alternata_ SC.

Field experiments for disease control showed that the disease may be controlled by specific fungicide applications. Thus, we propose that dead flower buds of pear in the Netherlands should be regarded as a fungal disease caused by _A. alternata_ SC and potentially also _A. arborescens_ SC.

[A number of fungi from _Alternaria_ species complexes have been associated with diseases of pome fruit, such as leaf blotch and fruit rots of pear and apple. Development of these diseases is generally favoured by high humidity and prolonged leaf wetness. These risk factors may be increased by common orchard practices designed to improve yields, such as high density plantings and sprinkler irrigation.

The fungi are spread with contaminated plant material (including crop debris), by mechanical means (including insect and human activities), wind and rain. Disease management may include cultural practices to improve air circulation and reduce humidity in the orchards, as well as phytosanitation but relies mainly on fungicide programmes.

Other species in the genus _Alternaria_ cause, for example, early blight of potato and tomato (_A. solani_); leaf blight of tea (_A. alternata_); purple blotch of onions and related crops ( _A. porri_); almond leaf spot complex (_A. alternata_, _A. arborescens_, _A. tenuissima_).

Over 40 different pathovars of _Pseudomonas syringae_, grouped into several races, are known. The bacteria can affect a wide variety of plants and new diseases are emerging frequently. For more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
