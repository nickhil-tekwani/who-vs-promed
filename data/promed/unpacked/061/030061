Here's the situation:
NE Province and SW Somalia have been incredibly hard hit by rains and
flooding for months, leaving most villages here isolated, without food, and
with using puddle and river water for drinking. Did I mention that many of
the worst/first hit villages are along the River Ewaso Nyiro. Recently (end
Nov beg Dec), the waters began to recede, although even now, we can only
reach most locations by helicopter, and a few more on foot from there, and
some we can't get to at all.
PROBLEM: Anyway, around the first of Dec, animals began to die (this is
nomad and pastoral peoples' land). Most had signs of fever (from the ones
I have seen, I would say easily T=105-108F (no thermometer, only by
touch)), malaise, constipation followed with diarrhea, maybe bloody (40-50%
of cases?), mucopurulent nasal discharge with crusting around the nares,
and blood from the nose (near terminal), then death.
In humans, (through report of next of kin, a few recovered patients, and
observation) the disease is characterised by acute onset of high fever,
severe headache, neck and back pain, abdominal cramps, some joint/muscle
pain, vomiting +/- diarrhea. These (vomiting and diarrhea) often progress
to frank blood. Many have started bleeding from the mouth and the nose, and
death is usually within 12-24 hours of these signs. Case fatality rate =
VERY high ... I am trying to get a handle on a good figure as we speak, but
the obstacles are truly daunting ... I would say 85-90% ... but that is
based on our case definition for the field work ... and we have no way yet
to get at the milder/asymptomatic cases ... so it is as at best a very
preliminary and speculative field impression.
Other signs reported in humans include: chest pain (maybe 2%), blisters,
with or without pus, clear liquid (4%?), acute death (within 24 hours) with
no other signs.
Numbers involved? We have seen about 35 cases ourselves --- some acute,
some "recovering", but have reports of over 350 deaths from the very few
villages we have been able to access ... each village describes this
"bleeding disease" as above, with little variation. Clearly, once the blood
comes in the vomitus or from the nose or mouth, the victim is usually dead
within 12-24 hours.
The village elders also report large numbers of livestock dying as
described above. For example, one man I interviewed lost 196 goats out of
200 since beginning of Dec, another 50/100, another 7/8, etc. A
co/investigator from MSF was out yesterday in an area where he said the
magnitude of the problem in livestock was being expressed in 5 and 10
thousands of deaths. This was in a village of about 2000 people only. I
have looked at the livestock there, and it is virus soup: my guess is there
is papular stomatitis, some foot and mouth, lots of foot rot, etc. So far,
mostly goats, followed by camels, sheep, and then occassionally cattle, are
affected. I cannot tell you if this reflects the distribution of livestock
here, but that is my guess.
Interview of cases and contacts reveals that, because of the isolation and
malnutrition in the area, that when an animal is moribund, a common
practice is to slaughter the animal, and cook it for consumption. Villagers
report that the meat is tasteless, and very soft, or tasteless, and "like a
very ripe fruit", or "like it has been cooked before it was cooked".
CASES:
I saw a 14 year-old female two days ago, who was moribund. She had a
history of 4 days of fever, headache, neck pain, muscle pain, 3 days after
onset began vomiting blood, and had epistaxis, and was delirious. On
examination, she was very anemic, very malnourished, limp, and febrile. I
drew blood specimens from the decubitus, and after venipuncture, the blood
continued to drip. They had slaughtered and eaten a sick goat about a week
before, and she was the only one in the family to eat the liver. [The
rest of family members at the time were healthy.
In the same village, I saw another 14 year-old girl who had blisters filled
with fluid and pus all over her hands. She had healing ones on the back of
her hands that were dark and crusty. She had enlarged regional lymph nodes
and pain in axillary region. She had just started helping her older sister
to butcher the family livestock.
REPORTS:
I have a detailed report from a close family member who was taking care of
the sick in his family of the course of the disease in their household:
Village is Masabubu, south of Garrisa. In this village, 16 have died of the
"bleeding disease" in the previous 2 weeks. The total village population is
about 2500.
Household 1:
Case 1: 40 year-old female, developed fever, then headache, abdominal
pains, no vomiting, but diarrhea with blood, and bleeding from nose, mouth,
and ears when near death. She had yellow eyes. From onset to death, 4 days.
Case 2: 17 year-old female, was normal the night case 1 died, but had a
headache, abdominal & epigastric pains, very painful neck and base of
skull, spine. No bleeding, no diarrhea, no vomiting, acute death, 12 hours
later.
Case 3: 2 year-old male, became ill when case 1 was ill. Rashes (blisters
on whole body -- big blisters with watery fluid, pus, then whole body
turned yellowish). No bleeding, no vomit, no diarrhea, very hot fever, went
unconscious ... 7 days from blisters to death.
Case 4: 18 year-old male. Became sick when case 1 sick. High fever,
headache, muscle stiffness and pain [sic diarrhea with blood, vomiting
blood, then died. About 4 days from fever to death.
Case 5: 1 year-old male. No rash, high fever, diarrhea but no blood, no
vomiting, 10 days from fever to death.
Father of this family is sick now. Sick for 15 days, with fever, vomiting
(no blood), no diarrhea, no rashes, very bad headache, no abdominal pain,
no myalgia, no bleeding from orifices.
Narrator of the case histories is this man's son, who is well at time of
interview, as is the mother of the family. Both have been taking care of
the sick members, and had close personal contact with the cases and their
body fluids.
This family had 200 goats at the beginning of Dec, and now, only 4 are
left. The goats bleed from the nose, and also have a mucopurulent
discharge. They may have diarrhea, certainly dehydration, and then die. I
examined one of these remaining goats, and saw a emaciated, moribund,
animal with some swelling of the distal leg joints, and a really nasty
mucopurulent nasal discharge with crusting around the nares. He was also
febrile, and foaming/frothing from the mouth. The narrator has said that
his family had been eating the sick goats and the meat is tasteless and
softer than normal. They had been slaughtering and eating the goats before
onset of disease.
Second Case history:
Same village: Narrator, wife has died. She was 28 year-old. Became sick
one week ago, was sick for 24 hours with severe headache, back pain, fever,
vomited normally about three times, then vomited blood, diarrhea'd blood,
and lived for only 12 more hours.
The narrator's sister-in-law (wife's sister) died 9 days before interview
(Christmas day), had close social contact with her sister, but did not live
in the same hut like the above case history. She was sick for 7 days, with
fever, headache, abdominal pains, and vomiting, but on the last day vomited
and diarrhea'd blood. No one else in her household is sick ... yet. Husband
is fine, now, but had fever and diarrhea with blood within the last nine
days, but no vomiting, and no headache. In both the above cases, the
narrator knows that the deceased slaughtered and ate sick goats before
getting sick.
The narrator's cousin also died. These are nomadic people, and they were
beginning to move on. He complained of fever on the first night, and said
he couldn't walk and so he was left behind with two men to help him. They
report that after a short time he vomited blood, diarrhea'd blood, was
bleeding from the nose and mouth and then died. From signs to death, about
12-24 hours. This man had sick and dying sheep and goats, no knowledge of
his eating them...
Within 20 paces of the school in the village, I counted 18 goat carcasses
from goats that had died before they could be slaughtered, and were dragged
out to the field away from houses. The villagers say the hyenas and the
vultures don't even eat them, although I saw a dog chomping down pretty
well.
Did I mention that this is also a big problem in Somalia as well ... we are
on the Kenya Somalia border ... there have been 22 case specimens sent in
from Somalia, and none were positive for malaria. There the camels are
dying in serious numbers with same sort of symptoms, and the people eat the
dying camels

[The above case reports were sent to Steve Berger for GIDEON analysis. I
would add that the ProMED-mail moderators were not one as to the probable
diagnosis before the laboratory results were available. - Mod.MHJ

From: Dr. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

I ran these clinical data through GIDEON. Assuming that the etiology is a
zoonosis (specifically cattle- and goat-related), and that all patients
were infected by the same agent, GIDEON favors a diagnosis of Rift Valley
fever (probability of 73%), with CCHF ranked second. GIDEON notes, however,
that bleeding diathesis and jaundice are relatively uncommon in RVF.
Features which were considered atypical for anthrax were arthralgia, back
pain, myalgia and epistaxis.
Given the same clinical picture, but for Somalia, GIDEON gives RVF a
diagnostic probability of 100%.
Interestingly, when no country is specified (i.e., allowing for any disease
worldwide) the differential diagnosis list is not affected.
