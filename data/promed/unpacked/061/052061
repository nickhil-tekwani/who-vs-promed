The patient count in a hepatitis A outbreak linked to Virginia restaurants continues to grow, with 44 people now confirmed as infected. 1 of the patients has required a liver transplant and another has died.

The cousin of the transplant patient reports the operation took place this past weekend. The outbreak patient's husband and daughter were also infected, according to the cousin.

The patient who died and his wife frequently ate at one of the implicated Famous Anthony's restaurants, according to the Roanoke Times. He died on [8 Oct 2021] at age 75. "His daughter said he was a strong and healthy man. He worked out 3 times per week -- lifting weights, riding a stationary bike and walking. He did not have any serious medical conditions," according to the Times. The daughter was also infected, but is recovering.

More than half of the patients -- 26 as of [15 Oct 2021] -- have been so sick that they had to be admitted to hospitals. That is a higher rate of hospitalization than is usually seen in hepatitis A outbreaks [see below - Mod.LL]. The outbreak is associated with 3 Famous Anthony's restaurant locations in the Roanoke, VA, area. An employee who worked at all 3 locations is believed to be the source of the infections. No other details about the employee, including health status, have been released.

"We don't believe there is an ongoing threat to the public," Christie Wills of the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts, said in recent days. The districts are a subagency of the Virginia health department. Wills told Food Safety News there will likely be more sick people identified because of the long incubation time for the virus. It can take up to 50 days for symptoms to develop. More time passes before illnesses are officially reported because of the time required for testing, confirmation and reporting.

The age range of patients is now trending to include younger patients with people from 31 to 79 years old now infected, Wills said this past week. Some of the patients who have required hospitalization have been discharged, but some still remain in hospitals.

Wills said she does not know whether the restaurant employee who has been identified as the carrier of the virus has recovered. Wills said the restaurants where the employee worked were closed for a day after the infection trend was identified. "We offered a vaccination clinic for other employees," Wills said. "We are also offering free vaccinations for the public at our office (in Roanoke)."

Wills told Food Safety News that the Famous Anthony's restaurant chain is a well-respected family-owned chain and has not had a history of problems in the past. She said the health agency is continuing to monitor the situation, but there is little public health employees can do at this time except to wait for more patients to be identified.

"Hepatitis A virus typically causes self-limited inflammation of the liver, however in this outbreak, we have seen a high rate of severe disease," said health district director Cynthia Morrow, MD, MPH. The agency continues to give the people the same advice as it has been, which is to monitor themselves for symptoms if they ate at any of the restaurants implicated in the outbreak. Anyone who visited any of the following Famous Anthony's locations -- 4913 Grandin Road, 6499 Williamson Road, or 2221 Crystal Spring Ave. -- from [10 Aug 2021] through [27 Aug 2021], is urged to seek medical attention if they develop any of the following symptoms:

- jaundice: yellowing of the skin or the eyes
- fever
- fatigue
- loss of appetite
- nausea
- vomiting
- abdominal pain
- dark urine
- light-colored stools

"It is also very important for people with symptoms to stay home from work, especially if they work in food service, health care, or childcare," according to a public alert issued by the public health department.

"Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease. The hepatitis A vaccine is specifically recommended for children, for travelers to certain countries, and for people at high risk for infection with the virus, however, since Virginia is experiencing multi-year widespread outbreaks of hepatitis A, vaccination is recommended for everyone.

"Anyone who is not vaccinated against hepatitis A is encouraged to get the vaccine, which is currently available from many healthcare providers and local pharmacies. The Roanoke City Health Department is located at 1502 Williamson Road."

[Since the last post, 6 days ago, the number of cases linked to an infected food handler has increased from 37 to 44 and there is now 1 death and 1 case of severe enough disease to require a liver transplant. It is now more than 50 days after the end of the period stated in the post (presumably the last time the food handler worked) so the number of cases may level off but secondary household cases could still occur. It is also possible that food contaminated by the food handler could have been refrigerated and served later.

While many cases of acute hepatitis A are mild and can occur without any manifestations ("asymptomatic") or with nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain without jaundice ("anicteric"), hospitalizations are required in severe liver disease which can manifest with bleeding (the liver produces many of the clotting factors) and mental status problems. More often, short hospitalizations can be required related to dehydration from vomiting and the inability to keep liquids down.

The still ongoing epidemic of hepatitis A in many USA states in homeless and substance abusers https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm) first identified in 2016, has produced as of 15 Oct 2021, 42 683 cases with 25 968 hospitalizations (61% - similar to this outbreak) and 391 deaths (case fatality rate 0.9%). So far, 1 death in 44 cases (CFR 2.2%). If a serosurvey were to be done of the diners during that period, it is likely that asymptomatic cases would be found.

A 2020 CDC report [citation, text, and references follow] provided information to support not routinely immunizing food handlers against HAV. While focusing on high-risk groups for HAV is certainly more cost-effective, those groups are difficult to access for HAV immunization. Essentially on many days, one can "google" hepatitis A and find several reports of HAV infection in a food handler, and this cluster of now 44 and counting illustrates what can occur.

"The USA is experiencing person-to-person outbreaks of hepatitis A in unprecedented numbers during the vaccine era (1). As of May 2020, 33 states had reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 32 500 cases, 19 800 (61%) hospitalizations, and 320 deaths since 2016 (1). These infections are spreading primarily through close contact among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness, as well as among men who have sex with men (MSM) (2).

"During these outbreaks, hepatitis A infections occurring among food handlers have raised public alarm and resulted in calls for vaccinating all food handlers, often prompting health departments to divert limited resources away from populations at risk. However, the risk for 2ary transmission from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons is not well understood. To characterize this risk, a novel, structured survey was developed and conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 9.5.13; Vanderbilt University); among 30 state health departments reporting person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks during 1 Jul 2016 to 13 Sep 2019; 29 states responded (3,4).

"A total of] 26 states (89.7%) submitted complete information regarding 2ary transmission events associated with food handlers (Table; see original URL for Table. - Mod.LL). Among 22 825 hepatitis A outbreak cases reported from these 26 states during 1 Jul 2016 to 13 Sep 2019, 871 (3.8%) were among food handlers; 587 (67.4%) hepatitis A-infected food handlers reported one or more risk factors (i.e., drug use, unstable housing, or homelessness, MSM, or incarceration) during the 15-50 days before symptom onset. Associated with these 871 hepatitis A-infected food handlers were 8 (0.9%) 2ary transmission events (Table), which resulted in 57 2ary cases.

"Of 29 states, 18 (62.1%) submitted complete information for public health response activities related to hepatitis A-infected food handlers. Among 275 cases in food handlers from these 18 states, 271 (98.5%) investigations and 63 (22.9%) public notifications took place.

"Ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks have been prolonged and costly to control (5). These study findings indicate that the risk for 2ary infection from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons in these outbreaks is low (less than 1%). Therefore, public health efforts to preemptively vaccinate all food handlers would be ineffective at mitigating the current risk for person-to-person outbreaks. To optimize resources, health departments should assess the risk for 2ary transmission of hepatitis A from infected food handlers on a case-by-case basis and prioritize vaccination efforts in situations where 2ary transmission risk is deemed high (6).

"Approximately 2/3 of the hepatitis A-infected food handlers in this survey reported risk factors commonly associated with the current person-to-person outbreaks. This underscores the importance of vaccination strategies targeting the populations at highest risk (i.e., persons who use drugs, persons experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, and persons who are or were recently incarcerated) as the cornerstone of an effective public health response."

It is likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case here was unimmunized, and this substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019. Outbreaks such as these may not change the statistics for cost effectiveness nationwide but might push public health authorities to a plan to immunize food handlers against HAV. Although now part of childhood immunization programs in the USA and none of the cases were in children, many adults in the developed world are susceptible. - Mod.LL
