MANILA
An epidemic has struck race horses in the Philippines, killing 12 animals
and shutting down the country's race tracks, officials said on Thursday.

The outbreak has affected 96 percent, or more than 1,800 of the estimated
1,900 race horses in Manila, and 12 horses have died, according to
Francisco Cayco, executive director of the Philippine Racing Commission.
"There have been isolated cases in the past, but this is the most
explosive" [outbreak,
he said.
The animals have been afflicted with strangles and possibly equine
influenza, two diseases peculiar to horses, officials of the Bureau of
Animal Industry (BAI) said.
Strangles is a disease that is similar to pharyngitis in humans, attacking
the lymph glands and causing the horse's throat to swell, causing fever and
coughing, according to officials. Equine influenza shows the same symptoms
but without swelling of the lymph glands. Samples of the horses' mucus and
blood have been sent to the Central Veterinarian Laboratory in Singapore
for testing for influenza.
The outbreak started on November 5 when virtually all the race horses at
Manila's two premier race tracks at San Lazaro and Santa Ana districts
simultaneously came down with the symptoms. A week later racing officials
closed down the two tracks and the BAI placed them under quarantine.
Sixty to 70 percent of the horses have since shown signs of recovery and
races could resume gradually starting on November 30 if the BAI approves.

diagnosis. However, this appears to be a serious outbreak, so if anyone
can supply more detailed information it would be appreciated. - Mod.PC
