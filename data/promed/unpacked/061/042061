Viet Nam intensifies bird flu prevention
----------------------------------------
Viet Nam will take more drastic measures on bird flu prevention to bring
the disease under control by 2006 or 2007, and eliminate it by 2010, local
newspaper Viet Nam News reported on Tuesday [19 Apr 2005].
The country will ban raising poultry in some inner cities and urban areas,
including Hanoi capital city, Ho Chi Minh city, Hai Phong northern city,
and Hue central city, and isolate fowl production establishments from
residential areas, Vietnamese deputy minister of agriculture and rural
development Bui Ba Bong said at a conference reviewing bird flu prevention
on Monday [18 Apr 2005].
Viet Nam will extend a ban on hatching and raising waterfowl until 30 Jun
2005 to the end of this year, he added, noting that local farmers will also
not be allowed [to] freely breed waterfowl in fields. In addition, the
country will use bird flu vaccines on chicken flocks and waterfowl in
southern Tien Giang province and northern Nam Dinh province on the trial
basis this year [2005].
At the conference, the Health Ministry asked the government to invest in
building 2 more bird flu testing laboratories, which cost some VND 80
billion (USD 5.1 million). The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has pledged to fund Viet Nam USD 4 million to build the
laboratories and USD 2.5 million to redevelop its poultry sector.
Bird flu has infected 71 Vietnamese people, and killed 36 of them, since
December 2003, according to the health ministry. Meanwhile, the disease has
killed or led to the forced culling of some 46 million fowl, causing a
total loss of some VND 3.5 trillion (USD 222.9 million).

Bird flu experts urge wider duck cull in Viet Nam
-------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam, the country hit worst by Asia's deadly bird flu, should begin a
wider duck cull and overhaul how they are raised if it hopes to stamp out
the virus, influenza experts said on Tuesday [19 Apr 2005].
The H5N1 virus has killed 51 people in Asia since late 2003 -- including 36
Vietnamese -- and experts are zeroing in on the role that wild and domestic
ducks play as silent carriers, spreading the disease in backyard open-air
farms. "In my opinion, the ducks should be culled. I can't see an
alternative way," Robert Webster of St Jude Children's Research Hospital in
Tennessee in the United States told a regional bird flu meeting in Bangkok.
The call came a day after Vietnamese officials delayed a decision on
whether to slaughter all water fowl carrying the H5 component of the bird
flu virus in the Mekong Delta.
Viet Nam's agriculture minister Cao Duc Phat told a bird flu meeting in
Hanoi on Monday [18 Apr 2005] that ducks found with H5N1 must be culled,
but those with H5 should be isolated for further checks. "While their serum
is positive, further study is needed. We should not rush," he was quoted as
saying by state media.
Some officials had raised concerns at the meeting that slaughtering
millions of ducks in the Mekong Delta would be too costly to farmers and a
cash-strapped state, which has appealed for international aid and says it
does not expect to contain the virus until 2007.
Animal health experts say ducks can carry the virus without showing any
sign of illness, making them a reservoir for the avian influenza now
endemic in Viet Nam and several other Asian countries.
Compounding the problem are age-old methods of farming in Asia, where
free-range ducks waddle in rice paddies and farmyards, mixing with geese
and chickens and spreading the disease.
Webster cited a Vietnamese study which showed an H5N1 prevalence rate of 70
per cent when ducks and chickens were raised together, compared to 8 per
cent for chickens raised separately. "It's really a hard one, but I don't
see how they are going to get the figure down unless it is done," Webster
said, adding that the West should help pay for the cull and fund
compensation to farmers. "The rest of the world would benefit if they came
in and spent the money to cull. It would probably take the risk down to
zero," Webster said.
What the World Health Organization fears most is that the virus, which
swept across much of Asia in late 2003, will mutate into a form which can
pass easily between people, killing millions in a global pandemic.
Malik Peiris, a leading microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, also
backed a wider cull, but said it should be followed by a complete overhaul
of duck farming in Viet Nam. That meant putting a stop to ducks wandering
freely through rice fields and shutting them up in closed pens. These and
other biosecurity measures would be costly, and some farmers may lose their
livelihoods, he said. "This is something that really has to be done.
Without tackling that, I don't think they are going to solve this problem,"
he told Reuters.
