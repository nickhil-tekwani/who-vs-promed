CWD CONFIRMED IN DEER TAKEN IN CHEYENNE COUNTY
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Another deer taken during last fall's firearm hunting season has been
found to have Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) according to Bruce
Morrison, assistant administrator of the Game and Parks Commission's
Wildlife Division.
Morrison said this animal was one of an additional 200 deer recently
tested for CWD. It was a 16-to-18-month-old female mule deer taken
by a hunter in southern Cheyenne County, about 12 miles southeast of
Sidney.
"The fact that we had a CWD-positive deer turn up in southern
Cheyenne County is not unexpected," Morrison said. "We believe it
was part of a herd that trades back and forth between Colorado and
Nebraska. This particular deer was killed within 4 miles of the
Colorado border. What it means is CWD is occurring further east in
Nebraska than we had thought."
"At this point we aren't planning a collection program in that area," he
said. "But, we may extend the hunter surveillance area further east for
this year's deer hunting seasons."
This latest case brings the number of confirmed CWD cases in
Nebraska to 10. There have been 6 cases confirmed in northern Sioux
County, 3 in Kimball County and 1 in Cheyenne County. Since 1997
Game and Parks Commission has tested 1919 deer for CWD.
