Respiratory Infection Outbreak among Children in Hong Kong Care Centre
---------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection is liaising closely with the Hospital
Authority in the investigation of an outbreak of respiratory tract
infection involving 19 children at the Caritas Medical Centre. The 12 boys
and 7 girls, aged 4 to 16, developed fever and symptoms of respiratory
tract infection. They were staying in 2 wards providing long-term
residential care for severely mentally handicapped children. An 11-year-old
girl in the ward, who had chronic medical problems, died of a chest
infection on Tue 9 Nov 2004. On receiving the report last night, the centre
liaised with the hospital management to conduct an immediate investigation
and put all exposed patients and staff under medical surveillance.
Advice was given on the cohorting of exposed patients, suspension of new
admissions, and restriction of visitor entry until the end of the
surveillance period. In collaboration with the hospital, the centre is also
following up on visitors to the affected children, providing health advice
and medical surveillance. Laboratory tests are being conducted to identify
the cause of the outbreak.
