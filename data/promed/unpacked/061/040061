[Maps presenting the various zones as implemented in the Czech Republic in relation to ASF, including the ones with prescribed catching intensities of feral pigs, and the numbers/locations of the shot/collected animals, are available at https://www.svscr.cz/amp-mapy/. The titles of the (8) maps can be google-translated; please note that AMP (in Czech) stands for ASF.

The Czech Republic has submitted to the OIE its most recent follow-up report on ASF (No 8) on [Thu 17 Aug 2017], reporting 3 new outbreaks in feral pigs. The said report, as well as new follow-up ASF reports from Ukraine, Russia and Poland, submitted to the OIE on 17-18 Aug 2017, can be accessed at

A global, interactive OIE map presenting all ASF outbreaks since the start of 2017, updated [Fri 18 Aug 2017], is available at http://tinyurl.com/y8hgscdh (click on the central-European cluster, zoom in). The Czech event is currently the most western one, causing concerns of further spread in Western Europe. It is separated by (so far, uninfected) Slovakia from the closest outbreak on its east, south-western Ukraine.

Poland, where ASF has been circulating on the eastern regions since Feb 2014, is now confronting the virus also on its south-west, namely the Czech event. Krzysztof Jurgiel, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Developmentthe, has responded this week [week of Sun 13 Aug 2017] to statements by politicians who related to ASF as a zoonotic disease risking human health. The Minister denied any publich health risk in relation to ASF, quoting a detailed letter from Prof. Krzysztof Niemczuk, the Director of Poland's State Scientific Institute of Veterinary Medicine. See, in Polish, at http://www.minrol.gov.pl/pol/Ministerstwo/Biuro-Prasowe/Informacje-Prasowe/Nieodpowiedzialne-wypowiedzi-nt.-ASF. (thanks to Sabine Zentis for the link).

According to OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, "ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect public health (Sánchez-Vizcaíno et al., 2009)". - Mod.AS
