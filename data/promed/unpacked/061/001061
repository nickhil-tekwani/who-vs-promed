[1] USA: heparin recall
Date: Sat 21 Mar 2008
Source: US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) press release [edited]
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/bbraun03_08.html>


B. Braun Medical Inc. was recently notified by its supplier,
Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL) of a nationwide recall of
heparin sodium USP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The
voluntary recall affects 23 finished product lots manufactured and
distributed by B. Braun Medical Inc. nationwide and to Canada [the
product list can be found on the original URL. - Mod. LL]

B. Braun Medical Inc. began recalling the lots on 21 Mar 2008, 2008
as a precautionary measure. This product recall was initiated due to
a notification received from the supplier, Scientific Protein
Laboratories (SPL), disclosing that one lot of heparin sodium, USP
API acquired by B. Braun Medical Inc. has a heparin-like contaminant.
To date, B. Braun Medical Inc. has not received any adverse event
reports related to this issue.

The FDA has received reports of serious injuries and/or deaths in
patients who have been administered heparin injectable products of
other companies containing this contaminant. As indicated in the
notification issued by the supplier SPL, typical symptoms include
anaphylactic-like reactions such as low blood pressure, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

[2] China: contaminant identified

China has identified a contaminant in batches of blood-thinner
heparin supplied by a USA-owned plant in China for export to the USA
that has been linked to serious reactions and deaths.

China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) said that the
contaminant was "basically the same" as that found by USA health
regulators in batches of Baxter International Inc's blood-thinner
heparin.

The FDA on Wednesday [19 Mar 2008] said it had identified
"over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate" in Baxter's drug, and was
investigating whether the chemical was purposely or inadvertently
added during manufacturing in China.

In February 2008, Baxter recalled most if its USA supplies of
heparin, used in kidney dialysis as well as heart and other surgeries
to prevent blood clots.

Chondroitin sulfate is widely sold as a dietary supplement to treat
joint pain. The over-sulfated version is not known to occur naturally
and therefore likely was chemically modified, an FDA official said.

The FDA is probing whether the contaminant is the cause of up to 19
deaths and hundreds of serious breathing problems and other reactions
reported in the USA.

FDA officials said chemically manipulating chondroitin sulfate, which
is widely available from animal sources, would be cheaper than
getting raw heparin from pig intestines.

China's drug watchdog confirmed the contaminant had been found in
batches of heparin supplied by a China-USA joint venture plant in
Changzhou to Baxter.

The FDA on 5 Mar 2008 said it had found a "heparin-like" contaminant
in some of the drug's active ingredient supplied to Baxter by a plant
in Changzhou owned by Wisconsin-based Scientific Protein Laboratories.

Scientific Protein Laboratories earlier said a consultant working for
the plant had concluded the contaminant was not linked to the plant's
production but likely occurred earlier in the supply chain. Baxter,
in a statement, also said the contamination had occurred before it
reached SPL.

[3] Role of antithrombin III: RFI
Date: Thu 20 Mar 2008
From: Hugh Baker <bakerh@inspection.gc.ca>


Glucosamine might be a good candidate for a "diluent" to artificially
increase the perceived yield of heparin harvested from the activated
resin. Glucosamine is similar in structure to the monomer units of a
heparin chain.

Flooding the serum with glucosamine might interfere with access of
antithrombin III to the binding site on the heparin molecules. This
might account for the relative paucity of adverse reactions to the
adulterated heparin, there being something upwards of 350 000 North
American patients using heparin locks for dialysis and other
indwelling IV catheters (figures from the internet may vary from
reality...). Those with healthier livers and lots of circulating
antithrombin III would be less likely to fail to respond to the
heparin.

However, chondroitin, the current candidate for adulterant in the
heparin, is also similar in structure to heparin, although more
likely to occur in long chains than in monomers.

Can anyone comment on whether interference with antithrombin III
might play a significant role in the adverse reactions reported?
