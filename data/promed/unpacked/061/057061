Vaccinations halted after child deaths
--------------------------------------
Algerian authorities have suspended all vaccinations of infants after seven
children died after vaccination against measles. An Algerian health
ministry statement said the seven babies died within an hour of receiving
the vaccinations in the village of Oued al Abtal in the western Mascara region.
About 30 other babies aged between 3 and 18 months, who were vaccinated at
the same clinic, were rushed to a hospital in the small city of Tighenif,
but have since been allowed to return home [another news article from the
Algerian press
(http://www.elmoudjahid-dz.com/pdf/2001/12/24/html/nation.htm#12) mentioned
that these children were admitted to the hospital for precautionary
observation and not for any illness associated with the receipt of the
vaccine. - Mod.MPP.
Algerian scientists have begun an investigation into the infant deaths.
Algerian press reports quoted doctors as saying that the children had been
injected with two types of vaccine, which might have passed their expiry
dates. Health and Population Minister Abdelhamid Aberkane told Algerian
Radio: "The same vaccine is being used throughout the homeland. There are
no problems with it. It is valid until 2003, and has not expired."

According to the health authorities, among 37 children who were vaccinated
at this health facility, 7 died. They were vaccinated against measles from
the same 10 dose vial of vaccine from lot no. 6494 (the total lot had 334
900 doses in 33 490 10-dose vials). This lot was imported by the Algerian
Pasteur Institute (IPA) in June 2001 and the expiry date is 21 Nov 2002. It
was distributed and used from 11 Aug 2001 throughout the entire country
without any adverse incident. The health sector of Tighennif, on which the
Health Center of Ouled El Abtal depends, had received 1600 doses of this
lot of vaccine on 18 Sept 2001 and had been using this lot without incident
until this morning of Sat 22 Dec 2001. The 7 deaths occurred in an interval
of 90 minutes after vaccination.

[in French, translated & summarized by Mod.JW

Seven infants are dead and 31 were admitted in serious condition to
Tighennif hospital yesterday, Sat 22 Dec 2001, after being vaccinated
against measles at the health center in Oued El-Abtal, in the wilaya
[district of Mascara.
The infants, aged from 3 to 9 months, received injections with the vaccines
Rovac and DTC [measles and DPT vaccines. Three of them died very shortly
after leaving the the health center, and the rest either in Tighennif
hospital or en route to it. Some doctors suspect that it was due to either
falsified or outdated vaccine. All vaccination has been halted nationwide
until the cause of the problem has been identified.

[Checking the Algerian press (French and English language
<http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm?id=673852102&Section=Countries&page=Algeria>,
<http://www.elwatan.com/>, <http://www.lanouvellerepublique.com/>) there
are many reports of the above mentioned event with much speculation. The
reports suggest that a team of epidemiologists has been sent to the area to
investigate.
Symptoms preceding the deaths of these infants were not given in any of the
reports available to review. Rumors that the vaccine was past its
shelf-life would not explain the sudden deaths, but would explain if these
vaccinated children were to become ill with measles at a later age having
potentially received non-potent vaccine past its expiry date.
The fact that the lot of vaccine had been in widespread use within the
country for the preceding 4 months without incident suggests that the event
was a local event rather than a vaccine-lot related event. Given the 1.5
hour interval between vaccine administration and death one wonders if there
was an error in the reconstitution of the vaccine vial preceding
administration. The measles vaccine comes in a lyophilized form (freeze
dried) that is reconstituted with diluent on the day of use of the vaccine.
Standard practice is to have vials of diluent distributed and stored with
the vaccine vials so that appropriate diluent and amounts are used
routinely for vaccination activities. As the 7 reported deaths had all
received vaccine from the same 10-dose vial, one wonders if a contaminated
or incorrect substance was accidently used as "diluent" to reconstitute the
vaccine. Anaphylaxis to a contaminant in the diluent is also a possibility.
At this point there is only speculation as to cause of death of these
infants. More information on the findings of the investigation of this
incident would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
