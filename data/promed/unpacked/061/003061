As of Mon 3 Apr 2006, the deaths of 4 Egyptians have been laid at the door
of avian influenza, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed today,
while Egyptian officials' case tally has reached twice that number. In
addition, an Egyptian was diagnosed with avian influenza in Jordan late
last week, though he contracted the disease in Egypt, according to news
services.
A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has confirmed that 4
Egyptians were infected by the H5N1 virus, the WHO announced in a news
release today. Those 4 cases had previously been identified through testing
in Egypt; of those patients, 2 died and 2 have recovered. Those
confirmations bring the WHO total to 107 fatalities out of 190 confirmed
H5N1 cases.
A 5th Egyptian patient, an 18 year-old-girl from the Kafr el-Sheikh
governorate in the north, has tested positive for H5N1 in Egypt, but
confirmatory tests by WHO are pending, the agency said. She is still in the
hospital undergoing treatment. Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities say they
have confirmed 3 more human cases of avian flu, news reports said.
Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali told Reuters news service yesterday that 2
sisters, also from Kafr el-Sheikh, have tested positive for the virus. One
girl is 6 years old; the other is 18 months. Both handled dead birds,
el-Gabali told Reuters, and both were in stable condition. Blood tests on
close family members were negative, he added.
In addition, an Egyptian man who has been working in Jordan was diagnosed
with H5N1 there on 31 Mar 2006 and was in stable condition, according to
the United Nations Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) news
service. He apparently is the first person in Jordan to have an H5N1
infection. The first bird outbreaks in Jordan were reported about 10 days ago.
The man, a 31-year-old construction worker, has worked in Jordan the past 4
years, said Saeed Darwazeh, Jordan's health minister, as quoted by Agence
France-Presse (AFP) in a Mar 31 report. The man arrived at the Red Sea port
of Aqaba on Mar 28 on a boat from Egypt, Darwazeh said. He was sent to the
Karak state hospital, south of Amman, where tests identified an H5N1
infection. Additional tests by a WHO lab were pending, the AFP story said.
The man was said to have had contact with infected birds in Egypt, AFP
reported. Authorities said on Mar 31 that 6 people who shared an apartment
with him were put under observation.

A delayed international test has confirmed that an 8-year-old Indonesian
girl who died in July 2005 had avian influenza, a health ministry official
said on Tue 4 Apr 2006. The government had problems getting adequate
specimens of the girl's blood which delayed shipment to a World Health
Organisation-affiliated laboratory in Hong Kong, Runizar Ruesin, head of
the ministry's avian influenza information centre, told Reuters.
The girl's father had been found positive for avian influenza and died in
Jul 2005, while her sister, who also died that month, had the same symptoms
but was not tested. The new test result, which was received on Mon 3 Apr
2006, takes Indonesia's confirmed death toll from avian influenza virus
infection to 24 and the global number to at least 108 [109 if the case
reported in the following report is included. - Mod.CP].
Most victims of avian influenza have had direct or indirect contact with
chickens, but scientists fear the virus will mutate into a strain easily
passed among people, causing a pandemic in which millions could die.
Indonesia has had the most avian influenza deaths of any country so far in
2006. The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has affected birds in about
2/3 of the country's provinces.
Stamping out the virus is a huge, if not impossible, task in the sprawling
archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The government
has resisted the mass culling of fowl seen in some other nations, citing
the expense and the impracticality in a country where the keeping of a few
chickens or ducks in the backyards of homes is common in cities and on
farms. Agencies have concentrated instead on selective culling and on
public education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention.
A sweeping door-to-door campaign to try to control the disease in the
capital Jakarta, the country's biggest city, which along with its suburbs
is home to about 12 million people, only got underway at the end of Feb
2006. Agriculture officials estimate that Jakarta alone has some 500 000 fowl.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 8
---------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 4 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an
additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
case, which was fatal, occurred in a 20-month-old girl who resided in
Kapuk, West Jakarta. She developed symptoms of fever and cough on 17 Mar
2006, was hospitalized on 22 Mar, and died on 23 Mar 2006.
Field investigation found a history of deaths in a chicken flock near her
home about one week prior to symptom onset. Chicken deaths in the
neighbourhood have continued, but the cause has not yet been identified.
Family members and neighbours have been placed under observation and
samples from these people have been taken for testing. Preliminary results
are negative, but follow-up investigation is continuing.
The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia to 30. Of these
cases, 23 were fatal.
