The Department of Livestock Development is seeking a vaccine for lumpy skin disease [LSD], spreading across the kingdom's cattle population, said Sorravis Thaneto, director-general of the department. Mr Sorravis said the department is contacting vaccine producers overseas to buy sufficient doses and import them into the country.

The disease is spreading among cattle pens in 18 provinces in the Northeast, Central Plains region and the North, including Kalasin, Roi Et, Nakhon Phanom, Maha Sarakham, Khon Kaen, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom and Chiang Rai. Department officials first detected the disease last month [April 2021] in Don Daeng village in Roi Et's Phanom Phrai district, and the finding was reported to the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] on 9 Apr 2021, Mr Sorravis said.

He said cannot be transmitted to humans. It is spread through mosquitoes, flies and ticks. The department has told staff to impose disease control measures in their respective areas. These measures include the circulation of information on symptoms and the general spread of the disease and a requirement for breeders to monitor the condition of their cattle, he said.

Infected cattle show symptoms such as drowsiness, drooling, loss of appetite and pustules on the skin. Farmers who have just taken in new cattle are recommended to isolate them for 28 days and have them kept under nets. The spraying of insecticide to prevent insects from transmitting the disease is also suggested. Lastly, livestock middlemen are asked to trade at least 50 kilometres [31 mi] away from areas where the disease has spread to prevent additional infections, Mr Sorravis said. He added that insecticide should be used to eliminate breeding carriers in areas where the disease has spread.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by a capripox virus, continues to spread in the Asia and the Pacific region. Since 2019, the disease has been reported in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Hong Kong (SAR-PCR), India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Taiwan (Kinmen), Viet Nam, and, most recently, Thailand. Detailed information summarizing relevant activities that the Asia and Pacific region have been working on, as well as OIE's recommendations on LSD, is available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/ (updated 7 Jan 2021).

The Thai decision to control LSD by vaccination is based upon experience gathered in Middle Eastern and Europe's southeastern countries, into which the disease has spread during 1st and, mainly, 2nd decades of the century. LSD's control measures and the main, decisive role of vaccination have been presented in scientific reports by EFSA's (European Food Safety Authority) experts (1) and by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) (see ProMED posts 20170428.5001476, 20170116.4767100).

Only live LSD vaccines are currently available globally. It will be interesting to note which vaccine strain is obtained and applied in Thailand.
