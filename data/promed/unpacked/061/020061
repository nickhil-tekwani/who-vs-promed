Huge number of diseased fowl destroyed in Galilee
-----------------------
Hundreds of thousands of fowl infected with Exotic Newcastle disease
- fatal viral infection that affects only birds - were disposed of in
the past few months in dozens of Galilee towns, Israel Radio reported
on Wednesday [7 Mar 2007].
In addition, it was revealed that the Agriculture Ministry did not
inform the media of the outbreak of the disease, but took the
necessary steps to eradicate the problem.
The kibbutzim and settlements affected by the disease were
quarantined for 30 days and forbidden to sell local eggs or poultry

[While this outbreak appears to have waned, it occurred in January
2007 and affected both table egg and broilers flocks. Galilee can be
seen on a map at <http://encarta.msn.com/map_701510667/Galilee.html>.
There doesn't appear to be any information submitted on this outbreak
to OIE's WAHID disease information system. Any details about the
outbreak, including history of this event, method of diagnosis,
affected farms, relevant morbidity and mortality statistics etc
would be most appreciated, even though the event has apparently
concluded prior to its reporting. - Mod PC]
