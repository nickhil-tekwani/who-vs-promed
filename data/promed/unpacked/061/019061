Dutch poultry flu spreads
-------------------------
The Dutch government has extended restrictions on the transport of poultry to
a second province, indicating that an outbreak of bird flu has spread.
The agriculture ministry imposed a new ban in the southwestern Dutch
province of Zeeland yesterday and said it had "serious indications" that a
poultry farm there was contaminated with the highly contagious avian
influenza -- which is not dangerous to humans.
The Netherlands has slaughtered hundreds of thousands of chickens since
health authorities first discovered an infected farm 10 days ago in the central
province of Gelderland.
The European Union has banned all exports of Dutch poultry until 13 Mar
2003.

[The Dutch Zeeland province is on the border with Belgium. As reported today
by the Dutch daily "de Volkskrant", the Belgian National Food Authority (VAA)
has applied to the police to prevent any entry of Dutch poultry into Belgium.
The Belgian authorities have taken initial safety measures upon the first
reports of the Dutch HPAI outbreak last week. These steps included the
closing down of all poultry markets; more than 20 farms that had imported live
birds or hatching eggs from the Netherlands prior to the notification of the
outbreak have been put under surveillance. - Mod.AS]
