One more patient died while undergoing treatment for a serious bout
of Japanese encephalitis disease at the Seti Zonal Hospital, Dhangadi
in far-west Kailali district Monday [23 Aug 2010]. The victim has
been identified as from Tribhuvanbasti, Kanchanpur. With this, the
disease has claimed 3 lives in the district so far.

A few weeks ago, 2 minors -- a 2-year-old and 5-year-old of
Pahalmanpur, Kailali -- died while undergoing treatment for the
disease at the hospital. Likewise, more than 12 people have fallen
sick due to an outbreak of the disease in Kailali.

[This small Japanese encephalitis outbreak continues with the
reported cases above. This report does not indicate if the JE virus
etiologies in these cases were laboratory confirmed or if the
diagnosis was made on clinical grounds alone.

This area is located in the northern area of the Ganga River plain in
southwest Nepal, where JE virus probably is endemic. There have been
significant JE outbreaks in Nepal in the past, with 24 districts
having been classified as endemic previously (see ProMED archive no.
20060831.2475). The 1st outbreak was reported in 1978, and there have
been sporadic outbreaks since.
