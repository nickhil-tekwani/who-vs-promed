We apologize for the multiple postings on this same topic, but as more
information has become available, we feel it is important to pass this
information on as part of a public service to our subscribers.
As follow-up to our earlier posting announcing the expansion of the ground
beef recall, the USDA FSIS has released a press announcement containing
information for identification of the products involved in this
recall. This product has been distributed throughout the USA. A listing
of all known states to have received this product is in preparation and
will be covered in additional press releases. This information can be
found at: <http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/recalls/prelease/pr055-2002.htm> -
