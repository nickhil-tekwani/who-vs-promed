A federal veterinary lab in Iowa has confirmed that a whitetail doe shot in
northwest Kansas was the state's 1st wild deer found with chronic wasting
disease. Bob Mathews, Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks spokesman,
announced the finding Monday.
Chronic wasting disease is 100 percent fatal within the deer family, which
includes whitetail, mule deer, elk and moose.
The doe was shot during the 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2005 firearms season, near St.
Francis. Tissue from the deer was taken as part of a program that took
samples from about 2000 Kansas deer last season.
Wildlife and Parks announced the probability of the disease in Kansas when
a preliminary test came back positive last Wednesday. They weren't surprised.
First documented along the Colorado-Wyoming border in the 1960s, in recent
years the disease has shown up as far east as New York and has annually
been found in portions of Colorado and Nebraska.
Mathews said that during fall 2005, a diseased deer was found 12 miles west
of the Kansas-Colorado border.
Though there are still a lot of unknowns about the disease, Mike Mitchener,
Wildlife and Parks wildlife chief, said there's no reason to get alarmed.
"We have a contingency plan we're going to follow," he said. "Right now we
want to make sure people are getting the right information."
Q. Is chronic wasting disease fatal to humans or livestock?
A. No. Although it's a close relative of mad cow disease, chronic wasting
disease has never been transmitted from deer to people or livestock.
Q. Can people safely eat venison?
A. It's not recommended that animals that test positive for the disease be
consumed, but biologists say venison is safe, especially if handled properly.
Wildlife and Parks has advised hunters against cutting through venison
bones, especially near the brain and spinal column, where the disease is
located. They also suggest that hunters wear rubber gloves when processing
deer.
Q. Will the disease wipe out the Kansas deer herd?
A. Chronic wasting disease has had some localized impact on deer herds but
has never caused widespread kills.
Q. What negative effects could chronic wasting disease have in Kansas?
A. The disease could induce some sportsmen to stop hunting Kansas deer.
Kansas deer hunting is a multimillion-dollar business.
Hunter numbers have remained constant in Nebraska, though, where the
disease was first diagnosed in 2000.
It could affect commercial elk and deer facilities, if infected. Also,
continued monitoring programs could cost Wildlife and Parks thousands of
dollars.
Q. Will deer in other parts of Kansas become infected?
A. It's unsure how the disease is contracted, though it's probably from
deer to deer, such as through saliva and urine, which could take a long
time to spread.
Still, chronic wasting disease has suddenly shown up hundreds of miles away
from other cases. Biologists think the spread may have been accelerated by
transportation of infected commercial deer and elk. Such shipping is now
illegal in many states.
Q. What does Wildlife and Parks plan to do about the disease?
A. According to Mitchener, the department is finalizing plans but more
details will be released to the public within a few days.
Bruce Trindle, a Nebraska research biologist, said Nebraska officials have
gone immediately into an area where an infected deer was found, killed more
deer and had their tissue sampled.
In following seasons, Nebraska has issued more permits and has had longer
hunting seasons in diseased areas so that hunters could monitor local deer
closely.

that has been around for a long time, since the 1960's, and there is no
link to human disease or illness. - Mod.TG]
