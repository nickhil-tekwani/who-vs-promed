Some swine breeders want Iowa hogs excluded from this year's World Pork
Expo because of outbreaks of the contagious pseudorabies virus in some
state herds.
"The big thing worrying us is if you get one infected pig in the show and
they [it spend [spends 2 days with other hogs, and all those hogs go back
to all 50 states, then you could have a thing of epidemic proportions,"
said Marty Lathom, a purebred hog breeder [breeder of purebred hogs from
Illinois and member of that state's pseudorabies advisory board.
A severe outbreak of pseudorabies has swept through Iowa. About 500 herds
have been infected, more than in any other state. "I can't believe they sat
around and let this thing get out of control like they did," said Dale
Hendrickson, a veterinarian from Farmland, Indiana. He is in charge of
checking health papers of swine entered in the World Pork Expo shows.
Iowa officials recently released stiffer transportation and vaccination
requirements to try to control the disease. The expo, scheduled for 8-10
Jun 2000 at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis, attracts pork
producers from all over the United States and foreign countries, who buy
the swine exhibited at the shows to improve their breeding herds or produce
a specific type of pork.
Hendrickson said some states don't want Iowa pigs coming back after the
World Pork Expo and are rewriting regulations to exclude Iowa hogs. Darrell
Anderson of West Lafayette, Ind., manager of the World Pork Expo's purebred
swine shows and the accompanying sales, said there is great concern about
pseudorabies.
The airborne virus causes reproductive problems, including abortion,
stillbirths and even occasional death losses in breeding and finishing
hogs. "The sad part is, we've got some people who are discriminated against
just because they have an Iowa address," Anderson said. "They're being
painted with a pretty broad brush even though they have tested negative for
the disease and have been squeaky clean for years."
Swine entered in the show must have been tested negative for pseudorabies
30 days before the show, have a negative lab test result and a
veterinarian's statement they don't have the disease.
Exhibited swine also have to come from herds not having been vaccinated
against pseudorabies. Vaccinations would indicate the hogs might have been
in contact with the disease. All people entering the show ring and sale
barn on the Indiana fairgrounds must step in a disinfectant bath to clean
their shoes of possible contamination.
"We'll do all we can to take every precaution to protect our breeds,"
Anderson said. "In 13 years at the World Pork Expo, we have never had an
outbreak of pseudorabies."
Anderson said the entry deadline for the shows and sales is Monday, so it's
unclear how the pseudorabies scare is affecting entries.
