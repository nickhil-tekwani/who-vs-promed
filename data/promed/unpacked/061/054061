Health authorities are scrambling to contain an outbreak of syphilis that is believed to have claimed the lives of 10 babies across northern Australia.

Professor Basil Donovan, of the Sydney-based Kirby Institute, said while instances of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) were in decline, an outbreak that started in northern Queensland in 2011 had swept across the Top End. "We got a large outbreak amongst very young people in the Gulf country in Queensland, and since that time it's turned up in the Katherine area of the Northern Territory and then swept across the Kimberley [Western Australia]," he said. "We worry because if pregnant women catch syphilis, the result is very frequently disastrous. It leads to loss of pregnancy, stillbirths, [births] of very disabled babies." Professor Donovan said 10 babies had died as a result of congenital syphilis since the outbreak began. "A rich country like Australia, shouldn't really be seeing any deaths," he said.

The Kirby Institute's national surveillance system showed 2000 new cases were diagnosed in 2014. As of [30 Oct 2015], another 1972 cases had been recorded in 2015, making it the most severe Australian outbreak in 30 years. The only other group affected outside of northern Aboriginal communities are urban gay communities. Professor Donovan said in cities like Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth, the STI was almost entirely limited to gay men.

"It's frustrating. We've been putting in grant applications for years, trying to get research funding to address the issue, but unfortunately the funding bodies haven't seen it as a priority," he said. "I don't see either the remote Aboriginal epidemic, or the urban gay epidemics, coming under control unless more resources are allocated."

Syphilis can cause dementia, blindness, [and] brain damage. Syphilis can be cured with a simple course of antibiotics, but if left untreated the STI can have serious health impacts, including dementia, blindness, and permanent damage to the heart and brain.

The northern outbreak crossed the NT border into WA last year [2014] and health authorities in the Kimberley are trying to contain its spread. Broome-based sexual health nurse Katy Crawford said for the 2 years to June 2014, the region had been syphilis-free. But since then, more than 40 people had been infected, and dozens more may be carrying it without realising. "It is a significant health concern for the region, and we expect this outbreak to continue for a number of months to years," he said. "It will be difficult to contain unless we get more people tested, and more people practising safe sex."

Amanda Sibosado, the STI coordinator for Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services, has been travelling the region speaking with young people. "We are trying to get people to get down to a health clinic, and get a check, and also tell your families and your young people, tell your nieces and nephews," she said. "There's a syphilis outbreak, and there's no shame in going to the clinic to get a test." She said it was proving difficult to get the word out to remote towns and bush communities in particular. "We only have limited funding to roll out sexual health programs, and generally it's been very ad hoc in northern Australia," she said. "There are very few positions dedicated to sexual health, and there's been a withdrawal of funding from some really key programs. So we'd like to see a bit more of an investment into sexual health to combat the syphilis outbreak."

Another challenge was finding materials suitable to Indigenous teenagers with often limited English and no understanding of sexual health. "A lot of resources that we have available are created in a metro area where there's very high literacy, so we're trying to create locally appropriate resources," Ms Sibosado said. "One campaign we've started is around the rodeo round that happens up here in the Kimberley, encouraging people to have safe sex, and letting them know where to get more information." The campaign includes condom wallets and posters featuring a rugged looking Aboriginal rodeo rider looking for love.

[The news report above describes the ongoing syphilis outbreak among young indigenous people in remote communities that has spread across northern Australia.

The Northern Territory (NT) is a federal territory in central northern Australia, located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east, and with a population of 233 300, it is the least populated of Australia's 8 major states and territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory). Indigenous Australian people make up 32.5 per cent of the Northern Territory's population. Its capital is Darwin. A map of NT showing the location of the 5 NT regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkly_Tableland#/media/File:Alice_Springs_region.jpg.
Kimberley Region is in the northern part of Western Australia, bordered on the west by the Indian Ocean and on the east by the Northern Territory; about 40 per cent of the region's population is of Aboriginal descent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_(Western_Australia)).
