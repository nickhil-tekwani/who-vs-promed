A carcass of a wild pig that died of African swine fever [ASF], an animal disease that poses a severe threat to pork producers, was found in southern Estonia last week [week of 1 Sep 2014], government veterinary officials confirmed today [8 Sep 2014].

"The infected dead wild pig was found 6 km [3.7 mi] from the Latvian border. No domesticated animal has been diagnosed with the disease yet," said Veterinary and Food Board director general Ago Partel in a statement. He reiterated calls for strict measures to keep the situation that way.

Wild pigs with the disease were found in Latvia earlier in the summer, and the virus is believed to have been present on the Estonian side of the border already earlier.

The disease in the Estonian pig was diagnosed by a EU lab in Spain.

There are 15 pig farming enterprises within an 8 km [5 mi] radius of the carcass, which was found in Hummuli in southern Estonia. Partel has established additional strict measures on slaughter and movement of animals for these farms.

Agriculture Minister Ivari Padar said in a media statement, "Restrictions are likely on the way for export of live pigs. These do not impact meat and meat products."

[An immediate notification of the 1st ASF case in Estonia, including an interactive map showing its location, has been submitted today (8 Sep 2014) by Estonia's CVO to the OIE and is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16019.

Estonia is the 3rd Baltic state to become infected by the ASF virus (ASFV), joining Lithuania and Latvia. ASFV started its ongoing spread in continental Europe in 2007, initially in Georgia from where it spread eastward and subsequently north-westward, and is at present circulating primarily throughout the western parts of Russia, but is reported also from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and now Estonia. The infection is mainly maintained in the wild boar population, spilling over into domestic pig farms. An OIE interactive map showing all reported outbreaks in Europe since June 2007 and differentiating between wild boar and domestic pigs is available at http://tinyurl.com/oc6qr47 (click on the European cluster, zoom in). The map has been updated as of 8 Sep 2014.
