Deadly _E. coli_ bacteria that tainted a small Ontario town's drinking
water may have killed as many as nine people, the Canadian province's chief
coroner told a news conference on Wednesday.
Two of the cases the Ontario coroner's office is investigating occurred
before the outbreak, in the town of Walkerton, was generally known of,
Chief Coroner James Young said. Seven deaths, including two on Tuesday,
have been linked to the _E. coli_ [O157 by hospital officials.
"As of this morning we are investigating nine deaths. I want to emphasize
that some of these deaths may not have been caused by the E. coli
bacteria," Young said. Eight of the deaths being probed were of people from
56 to 92, while one is known to be a two-year-old girl.
A hospital in London, Ontario, near Walkerton, confirmed that the outbreak
had claimed a seventh life in Canada's worst outbreak of the illness,
hospital officials said on Wednesday. Ontario's London Health Sciences
Centre, where three small children remain critically ill, reported that a
seventh person died late on Tuesday but gave no details.
The coroner said on Wednesday morning that he had confirmed at least three
deaths as being a direct result of _E. coli_.
More than 1000 of Walkerton's 5000 residents have reported symptoms similar
to those caused by _E. coli_.
