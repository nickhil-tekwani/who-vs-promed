Citrus disease appears decades after eradication
------------------------------------------------
Nearly 70 years after it was eradicated in south Texas, traces of citrus canker have been confirmed in Cameron County. Suspected citrus canker was discovered on a lime tree, according to USDA [US Department of Agriculture] Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS].

A sample of the tree was sent to the TAMU [Texas Agricultural & Mechanical University] and APHIS, and citrus canker was confirmed. Citrus canker was introduced to the southern United States early in the 20th century and was eradicated in Texas in the late 1940s.

George Nash, APHIS, said the canvass of approximately 1000 properties is about 75 per cent complete. Of 22 samples analyzed so far, 5 have tested positive for citrus canker -- all of them from lime trees. The hope is that [it] is the lime-specific strain rather than the canker strain, which attacks virtually all types of citrus. It could take 2 or 3 to weeks to get an answer, he said.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_). The disease originated in Asia but is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia where an outbreak was successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water, or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material, but may also include bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

The "strains" mentioned above are likely to refer to members of the A group of strains with a wide range of citrus hosts, and the AW group of strains which are genetically similar but have a restricted host range. Other strains originally included in pv. _citri_ have now been included in the related pv. _aurantifolii_ which causes a similar disease in some locations, but is much less widespread.

Other pathovars of Xa affect a range of crops. For example, oily spot of pomegranate is caused by pv. _punicae_; pv. _allii_ causes bacterial blight of onion, a serious disease emerging in several tropical and subtropical areas; pv. _vesicatoria_ causes bacterial spot of tomato and capsicum.
