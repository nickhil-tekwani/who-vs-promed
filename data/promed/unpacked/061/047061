Appeals for calm over measles epidemic in Bayelsa
-------------------------------------------------
The Bayelsa State Government on Thursday [28 Jan 2010] appealed for
calm over an outbreak of measles in Owukoro, Southern Ijaw Local
Government Area of the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr.
Azipabu Eruani, said the epidemic had been contained and assured
residents of the area that it would not spread to other parts of the
riverside local government or [elsewhere in the] state.

Eruani said doctors and other medical personnel, as well as the
necessary medications had been mobilised to the affected communities.
He said an aid group, Medecins San Frontieres, had also mobilised
resources to complement the efforts of the Ministry of Health. "Our
doctors are handling it. Bayelsans should be calm, we appeal to
everybody to report any health situation around them. The measles
will not spread," he said.

Eruani said 4 doctors and other medical personnel had been sent to
Owukoro alone. He said the necessary drugs and other requirements had
been dispatched to the affected community. The commissioner added
that more immunisation officers would be sent to the local government
area so that the epidemic would not spread.

He could not confirm the number of the dead at press time, saying the
claims about the number of victims in Owukoro could not be verified
by the team from the Health Ministry. "I will be going to the
community this afternoon (Thu 28 Jan 2010) to see things for myself," he added.

The commissioner stressed that the 16 new health centres that were
under construction and the 32 that were being renovated would be
completed as soon as the 2010 budget was passed into law. He said
efforts had been intensified to boost primary health care in the
rural communities, particularly with the prevailing peace in the
post-amnesty period in the state.

[An account of the effectiveness of measles control activities in the
African Region up to 2005 (see, "Measles, control activities -
Africa: 1999-2005 20060921.2700") revealed that Nigeria was lagging
behind many other African countries in terms of progress towards
elimination of measles. The current outbreak in the Nigerian state of
Bayelsa probably indicates that measles surveillance and vaccination
is still a concern.

This report gives no indication of case numbers, but deaths are
mentioned, revealing the seriousness of the outbreak. Further
information from the region would be welcomed.
