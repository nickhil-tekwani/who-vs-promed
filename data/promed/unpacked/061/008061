Ghana has announced the country's first outbreak of Marburg virus disease after a World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centre laboratory confirmed earlier results.

The Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, received samples from each of the 2 patients from the southern Ashanti region of Ghana -- both deceased and unrelated -- who showed symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The laboratory corroborated the results from the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, which suggested their illness was due to the Marburg virus. One case was a 26 year old man who checked into a hospital on 26 Jun 2022 and died on 27 Jun [2022]. The 2nd case was a 51 year old man who reported to the hospital on 28 Jun [2022] and died on the same day. Both cases sought treatment at the same hospital within days of each other.

WHO has been supporting a joint national investigative team in the Ashanti region as well as Ghana's health authorities by deploying experts; making available personal protective equipment; bolstering disease surveillance, testing, tracing contacts, and working with communities to alert and educate them about the risks and dangers of the disease; and to collaborate with the emergency response teams. In addition, a team of WHO experts will be deployed over the next couple of days to provide coordination, risk assessment, and infection-prevention measures.

"Health authorities have responded swiftly, getting a head start preparing for a possible outbreak. This is good because without immediate and decisive action, Marburg can easily get out of hand. WHO is on the ground supporting health authorities, and now that the outbreak is declared, we are marshalling more resources for the response," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.

More than 90 contacts, including health workers and community members, have been identified and are being monitored.

Marburg is a highly infectious viral haemorrhagic fever in the same family as the more well-known Ebola virus disease. It is only the 2nd time the zoonotic disease has been detected in West Africa. Guinea confirmed a single case in an outbreak that was declared over on 16 Sep 2021, 5 weeks after the initial case was detected.

Previous outbreaks and sporadic cases of Marburg in Africa have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. WHO has reached out to neighbouring high-risk countries, and they are on alert.

Marburg is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces, and materials. Illness begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache, and malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic signs within 7 days. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks depending on virus strain and the quality of case management. Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat the virus, supportive care -- rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids -- and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies, as well as candidate vaccines with phase 1 data are being evaluated.

[The 2 suspected cases now have been confirmed. The Ghana health authorities' decision to get a head start before confirmation was issued was prudent. As noted above and in the previous post, this is not the first time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the first confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit, bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman B R, Bird H, Bakarr I A, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11:510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
