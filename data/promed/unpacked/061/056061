[B] Travel: Olympics
Date: Mon 24 May 2021

The U.S. said Americans should avoid traveling to Japan, with the country under a state of emergency over a widening COVID-19 outbreak that has sown doubts about Tokyo's plans to host the Olympics in less than 2 months.

The State Department raised its travel advisory to level 4 on [Mon 24 May 2021], putting Japan in a category with a broad swath of nations from Latin America to Europe that Americans are urged to avoid due to coronavirus concerns. The action is a fresh blow to a country struggling to convince its own public and the international community that it's ready to host the Summer Olympics beginning on [23 Jul 2021], following their delay in 2020.

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this month [May 2021] extended a state of emergency that covers Tokyo and expanded it to 2 more regions hit by rising virus cases, in an attempt to stem infections ahead of the Olympics.

The latest COVID-19 wave has largely been driven by more infectious strains from abroad, adding to concerns about inviting thousands of overseas participants, including athletes and officials. Some competitors have expressed safety concerns, with the U.S. track and field team canceling pre-Olympics training in the country.

The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee said on [Mon 24 May 2021] that American athletes won't be at undue risk if they compete this summer in Tokyo. "We feel confident that the current mitigation practices in place for athletes and staff by both the USOPC and the Tokyo Organizing Committee, coupled with the testing before travel, on arrival in Japan, and during Games time, will allow for safe participation of Team USA athletes this summer," the committee said in a statement.

Initially, 600 000 fans from abroad had been projected to attend as well, but organizers ruled out that possibility in March [2021]. They are set to decide soon if even local spectators will be allowed to watch the competitions in person. They already have reduced the number of officials and others expected to attend from overseas to about 78 000, not including athletes.

Japan's reticence concerning vaccinations has allowed the virus to gain ground after the country kept infection rates low for months. Just over 3% of the island nation's population has been inoculated, the lowest among the 37 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Bloomberg's vaccine tracker. That compares with more than 40% in the U.S. and in the U.K.

Japan began its immunization effort with health-care workers after the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine was approved in February [2021]. The companies also donated vaccine for use by Olympic athletes and delegations, though immunizations aren't required.

Progress at getting the virus under control in Japan has been hindered by a conservative medical culture, with local safety trials required before vaccines could be approved and only doctors and nurses allowed to administer shots. A law giving responsibility for inoculations to local municipalities and the testing of a new online reservation system have added to delays.

Japan last week finally approved vaccines developed by Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc, and the pace of inoculation has picked up to almost 500 000 doses administered daily. That's still behind the one million goal set by Suga. The Japanese Consulate General in New York didn't immediately reply to a request for comment on the U.S. move.

["With less than 3% of its population vaccinated, and Tokyo and several other prefectures under extended states of emergency because of the spread of a new and more contagious strain of the coronavirus, there's no justification for diverting medical resources from an already strained healthcare system.

"Japan has very few intensive care beds, about 5 per 100 000 people in 2019, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Germany has almost 34 and the United States nearly 26.

"As it is, the pandemic has claimed more than 11 000 Japanese lives, more than double the reported total of any other East Asian nation."
(https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2021-05-18/tokyo-should-not-be-forced-to-host-olympics)

"Despite having one of the oldest populations in the world -- almost a third of the country is 65 or older -- Japan has one of the world's lowest vaccination rates. Only [3%] of the population has received at least one dose of vaccine.

"And though Japan has done a relatively good job of controlling the virus, virus mutations are appearing and cases are on the rise.

"It does not seem like an ideal time to throw open the doors and hold what could be a superspreader event.

"The Tokyo Games are scheduled to bring together more than 11,000 athletes from more than 200 countries, plus a multiple of that number with the addition of coaches, support staff, sponsors and media. It is meant to be a massive, peaceful global celebration, bringing together humans with differing lifestyles and beliefs and backgrounds.

"And in this case, people with very different coronavirus exposure and vaccination rates."

[2] India
[A] Case count
Date: Mon 24 May 2021
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57224565


The number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in India has moved past the 300 000 mark as the country continues to grapple with the pandemic. Experts warn that the real number of fatalities might be much higher as many deaths are not officially recorded.

India has recorded 26 million cases - 2nd only to the US - and is now the epicentre of the global pandemic. The country is also only the 3rd in the world to record more than 300 000 deaths - behind the US and Brazil. It took less than a month to record its last 100 000 deaths.

A deadly 2nd wave in recent weeks has overwhelmed the country's healthcare system, with hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of patients and with critical drugs and oxygen running out.

Nearly half of India's virus deaths occurred in the last 3 months. In the last 26 days alone, the country has recorded 102 533 COVID-19 deaths.

Some experts say the number of daily deaths may rise further. Dr. Murad Banaji, a mathematician at Middlesex University London, has been tracking the pandemic closely. "We expect a delay between cases peaking and deaths peaking. But also, as with cases, we know there are huge variations in death surveillance and recording between states, and between urban and rural areas," he told the BBC. "Even once recorded fatalities start to fall, we'll need to be wary of reading too much into this until we stop hearing reports of large numbers of rural deaths," Dr. Banaji said.

Over the past days, concerns over a rising number of deadly fungus infections linked to COVID treatment have added to the overall crisis.

In some places, even crematoriums have run out of space and have been forced to expand to makeshift sites in public parks.

Mortality data in India is poor and deaths at home often go unregistered, especially in rural areas. There are reports of journalists counting bodies at morgues themselves, to try to get a more accurate number. Some models speculate that about a million people may have actually died.

The country's vaccination drive is also not nearly making enough progress to ease the current crisis.

[B] Mucormycosis
Date: Sun 23 May 2021
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57217246


India has reported more than 8800 cases of deadly "black fungus" in a growing epidemic of the disease.

The normally rare infection, called mucormycosis, has a mortality rate of 50%, with some only saved by removing an eye.

But in recent months, India saw thousands of cases affecting recovered and recovering COVID-19 patients.

Doctors say there is a link with the steroids used to treat COVID. Diabetics are at particular risk. Doctors have told the BBC it seems to strike 12 -- 18 days after recovery from COVID.

The western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have reported more than half of the reported cases. At least 15 more states have reported between 8 and 900 cases. Following the rise in cases, India's 29 states have been told to declare the disease an epidemic.

Newly opened wards to treat patients suffering from the disease around the country are filling up fast, doctors say. At the 1100-bed state-run Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital in the central Indian city of Indore, the number of patients had leapt from 8 a week ago, to 185 on [Sat 22 May 2021] evening.

More than 80% of the patients need surgery immediately, Dr .VP Pandey, head of the hospital's department of medicine, told the BBC. Dr. Pandey said the hospital had set up 11 wards with a total of 200 beds to treat black fungus patients: "This surge in patients was definitely unexpected," he said. "We used to see one or 2 cases a year previously."

He reckoned that there were at least 400 patients with the disease in Indore alone.

"The black fungus infection has now become more challenging than COVID-19. If patients are not treated in time and properly, than the mortality rate can go up to 94%. The cost of treatment is expensive, and the drugs are in [short supply]," Dr. Pandey said.

Doctors say amphotericin B or "ampho-B" is an anti-fungal intravenous injection which has to be administered every day for up to 8 weeks to patients diagnosed with mucormycosis. There are 2 forms of the drug available: standard amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin.

Dr. Pandey said he had collected data concerning 201 patients from 4 hospitals in the city. The majority of the patients had recovered from COVID-19 and were male. Most of them had been treated with steroids, and all had underlying conditions, mainly diabetes.

A separate study by 4 Indian doctors has looked at more than 100 cases of COVID-19 patients who had contracted mucormycosis. It found 79 of them were men, and 83 of them suffered from diabetes.

Another study of 45 black fungus patients in 2 Mumbai hospitals found that all were diabetics or diagnosed with diabetes on admission. They all had very steep blood sugar levels.

"No patient of mucormycosis has normal blood sugar," Dr. Akshay Nayar, an eye surgeon who has treated a number of patients, told the BBC.

Mucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. "It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people," says Dr. Akshay Nair, a Mumbai-based eye surgeon. It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs, and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immuno-compromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with HIV/Aids.

[3] Low Oxygen levels and COVID19 mortality
Date: Mon 24 May 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy) [abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/low-oxygen-levels-shallow-breathing-tied-COVID-death


A blood oxygen level below 92% and fast, shallow breathing were associated with significantly elevated death rates in a study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, suggesting that people who test positive for the virus should watch for these signs at home, according to a study led by University of Washington at Seattle researchers.

The study, published today [Mon 24 May 2021] in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, involved a chart review of 1095 adult coronavirus patients hospitalized at University of Washington hospitals or Rush University Medical Center in Chicago from 1 Mar - 8 Jun 2020.

Almost all patients with low oxygen levels (99%) and rapid breathing (98%) were given supplemental oxygen and glucocorticoids to quell inflammation.

Of the 1095 patients, 197 (18%) died in the hospital. Relative to those hospitalized with normal blood oxygen saturations, those with low levels were 1.8 to 4 times more likely to die in the hospital. Likewise, patients with high respiration rates were 1.9 to 3.2 times more likely to die than those with normal rates.

Few patients reported shortness of breath (10%) or cough (25%), even if their blood oxygen levels were 91% or lower or they were taking 23 or more breaths per minute. "In our study, only 10% of hospitalized patients reported shortness of breath, and admission respiratory symptoms were not associated with hypoxemia [low blood oxygen] or mortality, underscoring that respiratory symptoms are uncommon and by themselves may not accurately identify at-risk patients," the authors wrote, adding that delays in recognition could lead to poor outcomes.

Higher body mass index was linked with both lower oxygen levels and faster respiratory rate. Body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure weren't associated with death.

The most common symptom at hospital admission was fever (73%). Mean patient age was 58, 62% were men, and many had underlying illnesses such as high blood pressure (54%), diabetes (33%), coronary artery disease (12%), and heart failure (12%).

"These findings apply to the lived experience of the majority of patients with COVID-19: being at home, feeling anxious, wondering how to know whether their illness will progress and wondering when it makes sense to go to the hospital," co-lead author Neal Chatterjee, MD, said in a University of Washington news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uows-cma052021.php).

The authors said that the findings suggest that even asymptomatic people who test positive for COVID-19 and are at high risk for poor outcomes owing to advanced age or obesity should count their breaths per minute and obtain a pulse oximeter to measure their blood-oxygen concentrations at home, the study authors said. Pulse oximeters, they said, clip on to a fingertip and can sell for less than USD 20. But even without a pulse oximeter, fast breathing rates can serve as a marker of respiratory distress.

"An even simpler measure is respiratory rate--how many breaths you take in a minute," co-lead author Nona Sotoodehnia, MD, MPH, said in the release. "Ask a friend or family member to monitor you for a minute while you're not paying attention to your breathing, and if you hit 23 breaths per minute, you should contact your physician."

Sotoodehnia pointed out that glucocorticoids and supplemental oxygen can benefit COVID-19 patients. "We give supplemental oxygen to patients to maintain blood oxygen saturation of 92% to 96%," she said. "It's important to note that only patients on supplemental oxygen benefit from the life-saving effects of glucocorticoids."

The researchers also called for revision of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 guidelines, which recommend that coronavirus patients seek medical care when they have overt symptoms such as "trouble breathing" and "persistent pain or pressure in the chest."

Patients might not experience these symptoms, even when breathing rates are fast and blood oxygen levels have dropped to dangerous levels. This guidance would be particularly important for first-line clinical contacts such as family practice doctors and telehealth providers.

"We recommend that the CDC and WHO consider recasting their guidelines to account for this population of asymptomatic people who actually merit hospital admission and care," Chatterjee said. "But people don't walk around knowing WHO and CDC guidelines; we get this guidance from our physicians and news stories."

Abstract
COVID-19 has significant case fatality. Glucocorticoids are the only treatment shown to improve survival, but only among patients requiring supplemental oxygen. WHO advises patients to seek medical care for "trouble breathing," but hypoxemic patients frequently have no respiratory symptoms. Our cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients shows that respiratory symptoms are uncommon and not associated with mortality. By contrast, objective signs of respiratory compromise--oxygen saturation and respiratory rate--are associated with markedly elevated mortality. Our findings support expanding guidelines to include at-home assessment of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate in order to expedite life-saving treatments patients to high-risk COVID-19 patients. - Mod.LK]
