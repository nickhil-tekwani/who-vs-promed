New Data Establish Link Between 'Mad Cow Disease' and Fatal Brain Damage in
Humans
A new study now provides the most compelling evidence to date that
infectious proteins called prions from cattle with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, have infected
humans and caused fatal brain damage.
Recent epidemiological findings, along with studies of the prion protein and
transmissions to inbred mice and primates, have increased the possibility of
a link between BSE and a new form or variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) in humans, both characterized by an ultimately fatal perforation of
tissue in the brain.
Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, and Western
General Hospital in Edinburgh, Scotland, were cited as presenting the first
compelling data to indicate the particular strain of prion implicated in BSE
is the same strain causing nvCJD. By creating a genetically altered line of
mice carrying prion protein genes from cows, the researchers successfully
eliminated the "species barrier" thought to afford members of one species
some degree of protection from prions derived from a different species.
Approximately 250 days after being inoculated with prions from diseased
cows, the transgenic mice developed the disease.
A second group of mice inoculated with prions from the diseased mice became
sick after a virtually identical period of time, confirming that transgenic
mice transmit BSE prions with no detectable change of strain or properties
specific to the species and attributable to the mice themselves. Inoculation
of the transgenic mice with prions from human cases of the new form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease also produced the same incubation period and
pattern of brain damage as inoculation with prions from diseased cows.
Inoculation of transgenic mice with prions from sheep with scrapie --
another prion-related disease causing neurological damage -- produced prions
with dramatically different biological properties.
This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the G.
Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Foundation.

Researchers are reporting what they call the most compelling evidence to
date that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has
infected humans. Health authorities say the new data is interesting, but has
no impact on the public because health measures put in place since 1996 to
protect both the food and the blood supply were based on the assumption
such infection was possible.
When people began developing a new variant of the degenerative brain illness
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD or vCJD) in the late 1990s, doctors quickly
made the connection to cases of BSE that first surfaced in England in 1986.
People exposed to tainted meat, cosmetics or medical supplies were thought
to be in danger of contracting this human form of the disease. But the
evidence for this connection has remained circumstantial.
Now researchers from the University of California, San Francisco say that
when they inject specially engineered mice with brain tissue from either mad
cows or people with the new variant of CJD, the mice develop an identical
disease. In particular, the mouse prions, the natural proteins thought to
cause the disease when they adopt a "pleated" shape, are indistinguishable.
In contrast, mice injected with brain tissue from sheep with scrapie,
another prion-caused disease of the brain, develop a dramatically different
illness.
"This is the first direct evidence that the BSE and nvCJD is (sic) caused by
the same strain of agent," says Stephen DeArmond, a professor of
neuropathology at UCSF. He and Stanley Prusiner, winner of a 1997 Nobel
Prize for his work on prions, are the senior authors of the study. Lawrence
Schonberger, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), says that while the study confirms suspicions, "We've been
acting on this [assumption] since 1996 as if it were true." To date, BSE
hasn't been discovered in the United States. Nevertheless, the FDA (Food and
Drug Administration) and the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)
have put in a series of firewalls to make sure cows and, in turn people,
don't become infected.
According to Caroline Smith De Waal, director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, "If there is any amount of disease that
is not recognized in this country, it is not getting into the food supply."
The FDA has also banned blood donations from anyone who has spent 6 months
or more in England since 1980, when mad cows may have first begun infecting
people. What this study still does not prove, according to Scott Ratzan,
author of The Mad Cow Crisis: Health and the Public Good, is that eating
tainted meat is what gave people new variant CJD, since the mice did not eat
the infected tissue but had it injected directly into their brains. "It
seems next to impossible right now to explain how people got the nvCJD," he
says. "Some are vegetarians, some eat meat, some may have gotten it through
transfusion."

Initial wire coverage notes that while BSE and nvCJD have been strongly
linked, little experimental evidence proves the two are the same. Scott's
group showed this link by creating mice carrying a bovine version of the
prion protein, a brain protein believed to cause BSE and CJD.
The AP story says the study, appearing Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, makes clear people in Britain who developed
nvCJD could have gotten it from eating meat from cattle infected with BSE,
the so-called mad cow disease. The brain disease has not been found in
America.
Dr. Donald Price, a neurological disease researcher at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, was cited as saying although a link between BSE and
nvCJD had been suggested, there were experts who questioned the connection
and contended a true scientific link was lacking. But the new San Francisco
study virtually removes doubt, adding, "This lends new credence to the idea
the new variant CJD is a direct result of consuming products from animals
with BSE. It is something the European community should be concerned about."
