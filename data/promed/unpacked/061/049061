The Dominican Republic's Official Commission for the Control and Eradication of Outbreaks of African Swine Fever declares they are in permanent session to strengthen the measures implemented in the country and optimize inter-institutional coordination with the field teams who have the tasks of identifying, controlling, and eradicating ASF. The teams under the command of the regional directors of the Ministry of Agriculture and the General Directorate of Livestock continue with the plan protocol for the elimination of the outbreaks, according to a recent release from the Dominican Republic's Ministry of Agriculture.

On Sunday [1 Aug 2021], backyard pig farms located in Cevicos, Fantino, Villa la Mata, Quita Sueno and the main municipality of Sanchez Ramirez were intervened to eradicate the disease that affects the pig population. Until the early hours of Sunday morning [1 Aug 2021], some 14 135 pigs raised in the backyard were identified in these locations.

5 work teams made up of a veterinarian from the Directorate of Animal Health of the DIGEGA of the Ministry of Agriculture, an expert from the Agricultural Bank, assistants, workers and members of the national security went to the different farms to proceed with the slaughter of the pigs, which is the only sanitary measure to eradicate the disease according to the protocol established for the control and eradication of African swine fever.

The Dominican Government is applying all the recommendations that international organizations regulate to contain the advance of the ASF by implementing the regulations that the existing sanitary situation requires.

High-tech equipment donated by the United States government is now in the country and has been installed in the molecular biology unit of the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LAVECEN) to increase the diagnostic response and obtain timely results in support of the epidemiological surveillance of the ASF control and eradication plan. LAVECEN has all the necessary logistics installed to respond to this health emergency, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

The provinces with positivity for pig disease are Sanchez Ramirez, Santiago, Hermanas Mirabal, La Vega, Montecristi, Elias Pina, San Juan, the National District, Dajabon, Duarte, and Santiago Rodriguez.

Contingency work and vehicle disinfection continue to be carried out throughout the province and in a preventive manner in nearby towns, and are carried out in conjunction with the Emergency Operations Center (COE), the Fire Department, National Police, Armed Forces, among other organizations.

[The 1st reported outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in the Dominican Republic started on 1 Jul 2021 in the province of Monte Cristi. 2 weeks later a second outbreak was reported in the province of Sanchez Ramirez. These outbreaks were reported officially to the OIE on 29 Jul 2021. See 20210729.8555087.

Unfortunately, ASF has rapidly spread in the country, now affecting the provinces of Sanchez Ramirez, Santiago, Hermanas Mirabal, La Vega, Monte Cristi, Elias Pina, San Juan, Distrito Nacional, Dajabon, Duarte y Santiago Rodr√≠guez (https://agricultura.gob.do/noticia/plan-contingencia-erradicacion-peste-porcina-africana/, in Spanish). According to the Dominican Republic Ministry of Agriculture, on 6 Aug 2021, suspected cases have been detected in the provinces of Monte Plata, San Pedro de Macoris and Espaillat (https://agricultura.gob.do/noticia/activacion-dajabon-plan-contingencia-erradicar-peste-porcina-africana/, in Spanish). If the suspected cases are confirmed in these provinces, 14 of 31 provinces of the Dominican Republic would be affected.

A follow-up report to the OIE with update information, is anticipated.

"The Regional Steering Committee of the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs), met with members of the Americas Region with the objective of providing an update on the ASF disease event in the Dominican Republic and to coordinate actions within the GF-TADs framework". The meeting was held (virtually) on 30 Jul 2021 (https://rr-americas.oie.int/en/events/gf-tads-of-the-americas/). In this meeting, the decision taken by the Standing Group of Experts on ASF to create an Emergency Management Regional Team, under the coordination of the OIE Regional Representation for the Americas was communicated. One of its first actions will be to establish formal contact with the authorities of the Dominican Republic and Haiti to know the support needs and to manage its provision in a coordinated way and avoiding actions duplication. The full report of the meeting is available at https://rr-americas.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/web_-esp_eng_rsc-gftads-july-30-2021-1.pdf.

In a press release dated 30 Jul 2021, the OIE called on countries in the Americas Region to strengthen their surveillance efforts. It was noted that "While the Americas Region is no longer free of ASF, controlling the spread of the disease to new countries is still possible through proactive, concrete and coordinated actions by all the regional stakeholders, including the private as well as the public sectors. Achieving this will be critical to protecting food security and livelihoods of some of the world's most vulnerable populations from this devastating pig disease".
