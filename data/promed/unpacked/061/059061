From: Vincent Deubel <vdeubel@pasteur.fr>

The sequence of the West Nile virus (WNV) strain we (the National and
WHO Collaborating Reference Center for Arboviruses and Hemorrhagic
Fevers) have isolated from an Italian horse presenting with encephalitis
is now completed. The nucleotide sequence of the E-protein gene fragment
of the Italian WNV strain was aligned with those previously analysed in
the article from Berthet et al. (J. Gen. Virol., 78, 2293-2297). It
appears that this strain shares 99.2% nucleotide identity with
Senegalese strain ArD93548 (isolated in 1993 from _Culex neavei_ ) and
therefore belongs to lineage I with North African and European strains
(France 1965, Algeria 1968, Morocco 1996).
This result supports the hypothesis of an introduction of WNV by
migratory birds
crossing the Mediterranean Sea. However, the Italian episode involving
horses but few? (none reported) human cases seems to differ from the
Romanian epidemic in 1996, in which numerous human fatal cases were
recorded. This deserves further epidemiological and entomological
studies as well as laboratory analyses on both the WNV isolates.

[Fascinating! Thanks to Vincent Deubel for responding so thoroughly and
for sharing his results with our readers in such a timely fashion.
Perhaps Armindo Filipe will share with Vincent his Portugese isolate of
WNV. If anyone knows of any other European isolates of WNV, please let
me know. It appears that West Nile virus infection in Europe is not
only emerging but may be underdiagnosed, in equids and perhaps in
humans. If anyone has a viable hypothesis as to why this may be
(ecologic degradation, decreased mosquito control activities, etc.),
please let us know. - Mod.CHC]
