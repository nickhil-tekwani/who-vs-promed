Although recent published research (Donaldson et al., 2001- Vet.
Record 148, 602-604) has suggested that the role of aerial transmission
of foot and mouth disease virus in the UK was overemphasised in
MAFF's dispersal model, circumstantial and anecdotal evidence for this
route of transmission continues to be cited in the media. In view of
this, it is surprising that there is little accessible information about the
aerobiology of the virus.
Several aspects of aerial transmission ought to form part of the public
debate about the spread of the disease and the choice of control
measures. This information is very difficult to find in the scientific
literature. We would be interested to know if answers to the following
questions are publicly accessible:
a) Do aerial dispersion models, including the one employed by MAFF
in the present UK outbreak, include an estimate of the rate of viral
killing in the air by sunlight- and ozone-generated oxygen free radicals
in the air? These effects were reviewed at the VI International
Symposium on Aerobiology, 1973 (ed. Hers, J.F.P & Winkler, K.C.,
Oosthoek Publishing, Utrecht). And what about the consequent large
fluctuations in aerial survival rate dependent on climatic conditions?
b) The aerial dispersion model depends heavily on the aerial
concentration of virus particles at source (Donaldson et al., 2001). Does
it take into account the exceptionally high concentrations likely at a
culling site, where a large number of distressed animals may be in close
proximity to each other for many hours? Is it known whether
distressed animals, with high respiratory rates, emit more virus into the
air? If so, do risk assessments for culling operations take these factors
into account?
Information of this kind is necessary to allow a balance to be struck
between the risks of prolonging concentrated virus emission at the
culling site and the risks of shortening the culling period by restricting
the designated area and hence the number of animals killed.
c) To what extent are virus particles aerosolized during disinfectant
spraying, and how efficient is virus killing in this state?

[This epidemic was different in so many, many ways from previous
FMD epidemics, so it is not surprising that aerosolization of the FMD
virus has been reconsidered. Back then, pigs were seen as the major
disseminator and dairy herds thought to be of secondary importance.
Sheep were essentially ignored. This sheep-based epidemic has
provided a mighty opportunity to re-examine virus production by
species, chronic infections, genetic drift, and circumstances. Hancock
& Ellwood have raised good questions. Comments are sought to clarify
what the thinking is now and what is known. - Mod.MHJ

Large number of new sheep infections found in Brecon Beacons
--------------------------
Destruction of 4000 sheep will begin immediately in the Brecon
Beacons common grazing area of Wales. Blood samples taken last
weekend have revealed FMD antibodies in sheep from 5 areas of the
Beacons. Several thousand more sheep are to be tested.
