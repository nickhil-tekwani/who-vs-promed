Suspected case of malaria in St. Catherine
--------------------
Officials at the St. Catherine Health Department are locked in a
meeting concerning Thursday's discovery of a suspected case of
malaria in the parish.

A representative of the department told RJR News that Anthony Thomas,
Chief Public Health Inspector for the parish as well as doctors and
other personnel are in the meeting.

The officials are reportedly discussing approaches to deal with the situation.

At the Council's monthly meeting on Thursday, Mr. Thomas disclosed
that a team of health officials had been dispatched to Ferry
following the report.

At the time he stated that as an interim measure, the health
department would start fogging the area.

[Given the outbreak last year, this may well represent continuation
of transmission with geographic extension. The earlier outbreak was
in Kingston. St Catherine is the next parish to the West of
Kingston. (see map

More information, including speciation, would be appreciated.
