A 39-year old Omani returned from New Delhi, India, on 18 Oct 2018, after spending 6 months in Delhi, where his son underwent medical treatment. In Delhi he stayed in a hospital in the Gurugram district (formerly known as Gurgaon) and never left Delhi during his stay. He did not take any malaria prophylaxis and noted many mosquitoes in the area.

Fever started on [19 Oct 2018] and the man went to 2 health clinics and a hospital and was finally diagnosed with _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria on [23 Oct 2018], on the 4th visit to a healthcare facility (hospital). On admission he had a low parasite density of 3200 _P. falciparum_ per microliter with thrombocytes of 101 declining to 70. Temperature on admission was 39.5 deg C [103.1 deg F]. The patient was started on oral artemether/lumefantrine.

[ProMED thanks Drs. Al-Zuabaide and Pandak for reporting this case.

ProMED has reported an increasing number of malaria cases from Delhi during July and August 2018. This patient never left Delhi and did not use malaria prophylaxis and it can be argued that the risk of malaria in Delhi justifies the use of malaria prophylaxis for all visitors. The case also illustrates the lack of awareness of malaria in healthcare facilities, even when patients present with fever and a travel history to a malaria endemic country.

Gurgaon, officially named Gurugram is a satellite city of Delhi located in the northwestern Indian state of Haryana and is part of the National Capital Region of India. It is 32 km (20 mi) southwest of New Delhi. In 2017, a report in Hindustan Times (26 Sept 2017) reported a 5-year high number of malaria cases at 273 https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-malaria-cases-at-five-year-high/story-rA7EFxNpOaaYPOI8vXZwIO.html. - Mod.EP
