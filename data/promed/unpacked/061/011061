West Nile Virus will spread throughout US: A Prediction
-------------------------------------------------------
Mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), which can cause mild flu-like
symptoms but can sometimes be fatal, is already more widespread in the US
than it was last year, researchers report "We know that the virus has
spread and will continue to spread, " Dr. Lyle Petersen with the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, told Reuters Health. "For
all we can tell, nothing is going to stop it from spreading throughout the
entire US," he added. The latest statistics on the spread of West Nile
virus were published in the November 24th issue of the CDC journal
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR 2000;49:1044-1047.
According to the CDC in 1999 the virus was detected in 4 states -
Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. By 2000, however, viral
activity in birds and/or mosquitoes was reported from 12 states -
Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
West Nile virus first appeared in the continental US in New York City in
September of last year. In rare cases, infection with the virus, which is
transmitted through bites from infected mosquitoes, develops into an
inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis and can be fatal. "There's
absolutely no way to predict what will happen next year," said Petersen.
"One of the problems with WNV is that it is unpredictable." "There may be
more potential for humans to become infected in future years than
currently," said Petersen, who advised that during the summer months people
take precautions to avoid mosquito bites by wearing mosquito repellent,
long sleeve shirts or pants and avoiding being outside at times around dusk
or dawn when mosquitoes are more active. He also suggested that people
should try to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds on their own property.
"Mosquitoes don't fly very far and so just by getting rid of mosquito
breeding areas on your own property can do a lot to reduce your risk."
