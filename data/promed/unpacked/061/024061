Update 21, 4 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_04/en/>
Flash report: new data from China as Ministry of Health begins daily
electronic reporting
Disease Outbreak Reported
------------------------
Data just received from the Chinese Ministry of Health have changed the
cumulative number of reported cases posted earlier today at the WHO SARS
web site.
The new data have been submitted as the start of daily electronic reports
of cases and deaths nationwide, broken down by Province. Data submitted
today report cases for 1 and 2 Apr 2003 and show an increase of 30 cases,
with 3 deaths, when compared with the previous cumulative total for 31 Mar
2003.
For 1 Apr 2003, 10 cases, with 1 death, occurred in Guangdong Province, and
7 cases and no deaths were reported in Shanxi Province. For 2 Apr 2003, 10
cases, with 1 death were reported in Guangdong Province, 2 cases and no
deaths in Shanxi Province, and 1 case and 1 death in Hunan Province.
The new data increase the cumulative number of cases in China, up to 2 Apr,
from 1190 to 1220 cases, and from 46 to 49 deaths.
Today's table showing cumulative cases and deaths for all countries
reporting suspected cases is being updated to reflect the new figures.
Update on cases and countries
--------------------------
As of today and including the new data from China, a cumulative total of
2353 SARS cases and 84 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This
represents an increase of 83 cases and 5 deaths compared with yesterday.
The deaths occurred in Canada (1), China (3), and Singapore (1).
New cases were reported in Canada (7), China (30), Hong Kong SAR (27),
Taiwan, China (1), Singapore (2), and the United States of America (15).
Situation in Hong Kong SAR
-------------------------
The Department of Health has reported that 27 additional patients with
symptoms of atypical pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals today. The
new patients include 5 health care workers and 8 residents of the Amoy
Gardens housing estate. The remaining 14 were new patients and contacts of
patients with atypical pneumonia.
Of the 26 new patients reported yesterday, 2 were health care workers, 2
were residents of Amoy Gardens, and 22 were new patients and contacts of
patients with atypical pneumonia.
Health authorities are current investigating sewage samples at a
construction site adjacent to Block E apartment building in Amoy Gardens,
which has been the source of a large cluster of new SARS cases. New cases
have been associated with vertically linked apartments.
A second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in
block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens
who was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital in
early March 2003 and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his
visit.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 4 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 4 Apr 2003, an additional 27 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 5 healthcare
workers and 8 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 14 were new
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 99 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have been
discharged from public hospitals. Of them, one was discharged today. Most
of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses to the
new treatment protocol. 103 patients are receiving treatment in intensive
care unit.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Total No. cases/ Total No. Discharged Patients/ Total No. of Deaths *
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 182 (182)/
53/ 17
Patients, family members & visitors: 579 (579)/ 46/
Total: 761 (761)/ 99/
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively
late stage of infection.
With the approach of Ching Ming Festival, the Department of Health called
on grave-sweepers to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene to
prevent atypical pneumonia. They should avoid touching the eyes, nose, and
mouth, and if necessary, wash hands before touching them. Wearing a
facemask properly also offers satisfactory protection against respiratory
tract infections. They should also avoid visiting crowded places and using
public transports that are poorly ventilated.

Situation update 3 Apr 2003
------------------------
As of 3 Apr 2003, there were 2 additional SARS cases reported, which
includes 1 more death. The total number of people who have recovered from
SARS and have been discharged from hospital is 63. 32 patients are
hospitalised, out of which 12 are in serious condition (including the
fourth imported case). The cumulative total number of SARS cases [is] 100.
5th SARS Death
--------------
The first new case is a 78-year-old woman who was admitted into Tan Tock
Seng Hospital from 20-24 Mar 2003 for steroid-induced gastritis. She has
multiple medical problems including severe lung disease unrelated to SARS.
She was admitted to NUH from 25-27 Mar for chest pain and she received
treatment for this. She did not have fever at that time. She was again
admitted to NUH on 31 Mar 2003. The diagnosis at the time of her latest
admission to NUH was a worsening of her lung disease. She did not have any
fever prior to this admission to NUH. It was only on 1 Apr 2003 that she
developed a fever and was transferred to an isolation room at NUH. In view
of her fever, worsening medical condition, and history of being admitted to
TTSH, a diagnosis of SARS was made and she was transferred to TTSH on 2 Apr
2003 and passed away just before midnight.
Update on Ngee Ann Polytechnic Student
---------------------------------------
The second new case of SARS is a 20-year-old Malay student of Class 6B03
Ngee Ann Polytechnic, who was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 30 Mar
2003 for suspected SARS. He is the son of the 4th SARS patient who died in
NUH on 31 Mar 2003. The deceased was diagnosed as a SARS case on 30 Mar
2003. The Ngee Ann student was diagnosed to be a SARS case today, and is
currently in intensive care.
On 29 Mar 2003, he called up his project teammate to inform him that he was
not attending class as he was unwell. He then walked to the Bukit Batok
Polyclinic. At the Polyclinic, he was immediately triaged according to
standard procedure. As he was having fever, he was separated from the rest
of the patients. The doctor and staff who attended to him in the isolation
room were masked, gowned, and gloved. He was seen by the polyclinic doctor
at about 9.20 AM. During the consultation with the doctor, he told the
doctor that his mother was in intensive care at the National University
Hospital.
He was then transferred to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan
Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) by ambulance at about 10.20 AM. During the
consultation with the doctor, he told the doctor that his mother had
travelled to Sarawak and that she was in NUH. There was no indication at
that time that his mother had visited a friend in TTSH. In view that there
was no contact history for SARS, he was discharged with advice to return if
he continued to feel unwell. He was also put on daily telephone
surveillance by TTSH. On 30 Mar 2003, TTSH called him at home. Since he was
still unwell, an ambulance was sent to bring him from his home to the A&E
Dept of TTSH at about 17.30 PM. He was then admitted to TTSH.
So far, 25 close contacts have been identified and Home Quarantine Orders
have been issued.
Safeguarding Public Transport
-----------------------
To minimise public exposure to SARS, MOH has made special arrangements for
4 categories of persons with a higher likelihood of being SARS patients to
be transported to TTSH by private ambulance, so that they would not need to
use the public transport system. The 4 categories are :
(a) Persons on Home Quarantine Order who develop SARS symptoms;
(b) Cases identified by General Practitioners and private dentists;
(c) Incoming Passengers who receive Travel Advisory and develop SARS
symptoms subsequently; and
(d) Cases identified during medical screening at Changi Airport and
Singapore Cruise Centre.
On notification of above cases, MOH will arrange for a private ambulance to
pick them up and send them to TTSH directly for medical assessment.
Summary of SARS cases
---------------------
Both new cases are linked to the first index case. To date, 93 cases have
arisen from the first index case, comprising 47 family members, friends or
close contacts, and 46 hospital staff. Among these are 3 children below 18
years of age.
So far, apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have
not given rise to any SARS cases.
The number of suspect cases admitted is 38, including 2 children (below 18
years old).

SARS: the situation in France - 3 Apr 2003
---------------------------------
Since an epidemic alert was released in France on 13 Mar 2003 (1), 216
people with symptoms of respiratory infection returning from Vietnam,
China, Hong Kong, or Singapore were notified to the national Public Health
Institute (Institut de veille sanitaire, InVS) (2). Of these, 201 were
excluded after clinical, radiological, biological, and epidemiological
evaluation of their compatibility with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS).
As of 3 Apr 2003, 12 patients are still under surveillance. 3 probable
cases of SARS have been identified and are currently hospitalised in
isolation. The first case was a traveller who returned from Hanoi (Vietnam)
on 23 Mar 2003. The date of onset of symptoms of the latter 2 cases was 26
Mar 2003 and 30 Mar 2003, respectively. Their link with other SARS cases is
under investigation.
In France, the health authorities and the ministry of foreign affairs have
advised against travel to Hong Kong and China (Beijing, Guangdong, and
Shanxi provinces) and recommended postponing travel to other affected areas
(3). Travellers returning from Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangdong,and Shanxi
provinces in China, Taiwan, Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore are asked to fill
in an identification form upon arrival at the international
Charles-de-Gaulle airport in France. A similar surveillance procedure was
implemented for charter flights landing in other airports in France. People
returning from southeast Asia who develop respiratory symptoms with a fever
above 38 C within 10 days of landing are advised to contact the emergency
on-call service, and not to directly consult hospital emergency wards or
their physician.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 4 Apr 2003 4:00 PM ET
Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS
---------------------------------
As of 4 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 187
probable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Canada. There have been 7 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The information
contained in this update is based on the best available information Health
Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 71 probable and 78 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM ET 4 Apr 2003. For specific
information on the provincial numbers, please contact the appropriate
provincial health department.
[This represents a total of 74 probable cases and 113 suspected cases, an
increase of 5 probable and 4 suspected cases from 3 Apr 2003. - Mod.MPP]

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[Newswire reports continue to mention numbers of suspected cases
elsewhere. With the exception of the USA, all other countries are
reporting only probable cases of SARS to WHO; and even among these reports
we have seen probable cases eliminated as other etiologies are confirmed to
explain the clinical syndromes. For this reason we have been avoiding
posting these newswires. A good example of such was a report today on All
Africa of a "suspected case" in an individual transferred to a hospital in
South Africa from Maputo, Mozambique, with a history of recent travel to
Hong Kong. The newswire also goes on to say that it may be malaria, but is
being treated as a suspected case until test results were known.
<http://allafrica.com/stories/200304010749.html>
Again, until a definitive etiologic agent is identified, thus making
laboratory confirmation possible, there will continue to be discrepancies
in "case count" numbers and reports.
Today's reports reflect the beginning of daily reporting from China, which
will allow for a closer following of the outbreak. For those readers who
are going directly to this comment, the daily summary (from WHO [1][C]
above) is: "As of today and including the new data from China, a cumulative
total of 2353 SARS cases and 84 deaths have been reported from 16
countries. This represents an increase of 83 cases and 5 deaths compared
with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (1), China (3), and Singapore
(1). New cases were reported in Canada (7), China (30), Hong Kong SAR
(27), Taiwan, China (1), Singapore (2), and the United States of America
(15)."
The discussion on the investigation into possible sewage line break in the
Amoy Gardens is interesting. In an earlier update it was postulated that a
sewage backflow with formation of airborne fomites would explain the rapid
expansion in the numbers of cases reported from a single block of flats in
Hong Kong. We look forward to seeing the technical details of this
evaluation. - Mod.MPP]
