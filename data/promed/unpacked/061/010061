Comments
--------
Among the many intriguing aspects of the surveillance program in
Pakistan is the relatively high rate of acute hepatitis A that was
observed in persons over 20 years of age (82 percent of the cases) in
a country in which it was stated that "almost all persons living in
Pakistan have been infected with hepatitis A virus by age 15 years."

Obviously, there are a number who escaped being infected in their
early childhood and presented in adulthood with clinically overt acute
hepatitis A. Symptoms with or without jaundice occur in 75-90 percent
of adults (versus 5-20 oercent of children <5 years of age). Even
then it is noteworthy that only 18 percent of the surveillance cases
were <20 years of age. It would be interesting to know something more
about the adults with acute hepatitis A from an epidemiological
viewpoint. Any epidemiological shift in the age of infection should
have left the younger patients more at risk of acquiring disease, not
the older subjects (40 percent of the cases were over 30 years old).

Regarding IgM-specific anti-HBc, while it is can be a good marker for
acute hepatitis B, about 15-25 percent of patients with acute
reactivation of their chronic hepatitis B may present with a
relatively low level of IgM anti-HBc that can be confusing unless a
ratio is determined between the sample result and the cut-off value.
Among the chronically infected, this component is predominantly a 7S
IgM fraction as opposed to a 19S component in acute disease. These
surveillance programs can be useful, but only if they are
demographically designed.
