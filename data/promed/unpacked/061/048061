A south-central Pennsylvania dairy has again been ordered by the state Departments of Agriculture and Health to stop sales of raw milk because of a 3rd outbreak of campylobacteriosis infections.

There have been 2 confirmed cases of _Campylobacter_ infection in people who consumed raw milk from The Family Cow in Chambersburg, Franklin County, the Department of Agriculture announced after positive test results for the bacteria were confirmed on Mon 5 Aug 2013. The farm sells raw milk, which has not been pasteurized, to consumers at the farm store as well as retail stores in various locations, including Pittsburgh.

The department ordered The Family Cow to stop selling raw milk earlier in 2013 because 5 people, including 1 from Allegheny County, became ill between 30 Apr 2013 and 10 May 2013. It was given the go-ahead to resume sales in June 2013. Raw milk produced by the dairy sickened 38 people, including one from Allegheny County, in January 2012.

[As stated in the posting, this is the 3rd episode of human campylobacteriosis linked to the same Pennsylvania dairy farm in about 18 months. It would be quite interesting to know if isolates from all 3 clusters are genetically identical. If so, this would speak to the inherent difficulties in screening for enteric pathogens in unpasteurized milk.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk ingestion.

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A virus have also been associated with raw milk ingestion.

Other diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and infectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43(5): 610-15 (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/507035), with the citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:

Rabies
------
In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons received post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure associated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2).

Tickborne encephalitis
----------------------
Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or _Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4). A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).

Brainerd diarrhea
-----------------
A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among 122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota during the period December 1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal communication).

Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 per cent) of 394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (8).
