On 6 Jan 2020, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of 2 cases of equine abortion in Simcoe County. Both cases were confirmed to be caused by equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1). Both mares aborted during their 10th month of pregnancy, and both mares arrived from an out-of-province location in December [2019].

A 3rd mare was exposed to the infected mares, but she has remained unaffected.

The farm manager kept the new mares separate from the resident mares and in a small group. This type of management procedure reduced the risk of spreading the virus to the entire herd. Working with the facility's veterinarian, the farm manager isolated the affected mares and has voluntarily placed the premises under quarantine to reduce the risk of viral spread.

On 9 Jan [2020], officials at the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed a 21-year-old Quarter Horse gelding in Santa Barbara County with the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), also known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The gelding began showing clinical signs of ataxia (incoordination), fever, and recumbency (inability to rise) on 4 Jan [2020]. He was euthanized 9 Jan [2020] due to the severity of his signs. The 2 remaining horses at the index premises have been quarantined, and enhanced biosecurity measures [have been] enacted, including twice-daily temperature monitoring. No horses recently moved on or off the property, and CDFA continues to monitor the situation.

[The article does not tell us if these animals were vaccinated against the nasal form of the virus. None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
