[ProMED commends the Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki for sending this alert directly to us, and asks all health institutions seeing cases of significance to international health to consider doing the same through the SUBMIT INFO button at the top of the ProMED Home page <www.promedmail.org>.

Physicians in Nigeria or abroad who see febrile residents or tourists coming from Ebonyi State, Nigeria, in the last 3 weeks (the incubation period of Lassa fever), should consider testing for Lassa fever. I am sure that the Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki has swiftly implemented the proper procedures to avoid further spread of the disease from patients to staff. All health workers in Nigeria should wear proper protective gear when treating suspected Lassa patients, because you never know if they may have come from an endemic area.

*****Health workers in countries across Nigeria's borders should take the same precautions with febrile visitors from Nigeria.

The Summary Table on the front page of Nigeria's IDSR Weekly Report as at 27/09/2013 from Nigeria shows 16 cases of Lassa fever (1 fatal) for Week 37 in September 2013. Inside the report on p.4 appears the following:

"Lassa fever update for week 38 as 27th September, 2013
-------------------------------------------------------
2.1. In the reporting week (Week 38) 2013, no suspected Lassa fever case/death was reported
compared with 28 cases with 1 death (CFR, 3.57 percent) from Edo State same period in 2012.
2.2. Between week 1 & 38 2013, 1150 suspected Lassa fever cases with 154 lab confirmed and 34 deaths (CFR, 2.96 percent) were reported in 27 LGAs across 13 States compared with 1357 cases with 169 lab confirmed 107 deaths (CFR, 7.89 percent) in 42 LGAs (23 States) the same period in 2012 (Figure 5).

Abakaliki is the capital city of the present-day Ebonyi State in southeastern Nigeria. The inhabitants are primarily members of the Igbo nation. It was the headquarters of the Ogoja province before the creation of Ebonyi State in 1996. [A correction has been made regarding the location of Abakaliki.

Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The illness was discovered in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the first cases originated. Lassa virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.

The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the "multimammate rat" of the genus _Mastomys_. It is not certain which [of the 8] species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa fever; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. All these factors together contribute to the relatively efficient spread of Lassa virus from infected rodents to humans.

Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus. The virus cannot be spread through casual contact (including skin-to-skin contact without exchange of body fluids). Person-to-person transmission is common in both village and health care settings, where, along with the above-mentioned modes of transmission, the virus also may be spread in contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles (in-hospital transmission is called nosocomial).
