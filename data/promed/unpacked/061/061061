["Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is a virus that affects some farmed and wild shrimp species.

"Signs of IHHNV include sluggish swimming and motionless or sinking shrimp. Shrimp farms with infected shrimp may experience mass die-offs and an increase in shrimp with cuticular deformations.

"IHHNV may cause infection in yellowleg shrimp, giant tiger prawn, northern white shrimp, blue shrimp, and white leg prawn. The virus is not known to affect other crustaceans.

"A diagnostic test is required to confirm the presence of the virus in a facility or population.

"There is currently no treatment or vaccine available for IHHNV.

"IHHNV is not a threat to human health."
