Another Possible Diagnosis?
-------------------
In Rwanda, fever with bleeding is most often due to relapsing fever. The
tick-borne form due to _Borrelia duttonii_ and transmitted by _Ornithodoros
moubata_ is endemic in that country. Has this diagnosis been excluded in
the reported case?

[The differential diagnosis for fever with bleeding is quite broad. We hope
to receive information establishing the diagnosis for the patient discussed
above and in the previous posting. - Man. Ed. DS
