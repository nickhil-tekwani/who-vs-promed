More hepatitis cases follow Long Island needle scare
------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities say they have found more hepatitis infections among
patients of a doctor accused of spreading the disease through
slipshod injection techniques. But it may never be clear whether the
newly diagnosed cases are linked to the doctor's practices.

The Nassau County Health Department says recent tests have found 6
hepatitis B cases and 6 hepatitis C cases among Dr. Harvey
Finkelstein's patients. State Health Department spokeswoman Claudia
Hutton says that because the virus can mutate in people's bodies,
it's too late for genetic tests to establish whether the infections
stemmed from Finkelstein's needle technique.

Health officials have said an earlier investigation showed the Long
Island anesthesiologist infected at least one person with hepatitis
by plunging syringes more than once into vials of medicine,
contaminating the drugs. Finkelstein has said he has stopped doing so.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The 12 new cases of hepatitis described in this report are a
considerable increase over the 5 cases identified in June 2007,
although none can be unequivocally related to the original incident.
Hopefully this will mark the end of this tragic event, but continued
surveillance is warranted. - Mod.CP]
