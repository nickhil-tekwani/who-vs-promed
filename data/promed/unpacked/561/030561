A mysterious illness has attacked 15 members of a Hungarian family,
killing one of them Saturday [19 May 2007], reports nol.hu [Hungarian
news service].
A 49-year-old man from Kecskemet, a city 50 miles south of Budapest,
and 14 others in his family were admitted to Kecskemet County
Hospital Saturday [19 May 2007] morning with high fevers and flu symptoms.
The man's condition worsened, and he was transferred to the intensive
care unit where he died that evening.
Several members of the family are serving in the army, and one of
them has served abroad.
The family is being quarantined in the hospital's internal medicine
ward No. 2, which was closed off Sunday [21 May 2007] morning.
Patients are not allowed to leave their rooms, and doctors are
required to wear protective attire.
The condition of one of the 14 patients who is being treated at the
hospital with similar symptoms is serious, said Attilane Horvath,
spokesperson for the hospital. The patients are being given antibiotics.
Laboratory tests are currently underway to identify the illness, said
Gyula Mucsi, head of the South Alfold Regional Institute of the
National Public Health and Medical Officers Service (ANTSZ).

[The above newswire is very vague on the actual clinical symptoms,
other than high fever, as "flu-like" illness in lay terminology can
run the full spectrum of neurologic (headaches, encephalopathic
symptoms), pulmonary (respiratory symptoms/compromise) or
gastrointestinal symptoms (severe upper or lower gastrointestinal
symptoms). There is also the subtle suggestion that the illnesses may
have been associated with military duty elsewhere (internationally).
In the absence of clear cut information on the symptoms or possible
risk exposures, this moderator is opting not to speculate on possible
etiologies but rather to post this as a request for information,
hoping that one of our subscribers will have more knowledgeable
information on the above reported event and will share it with us.

Kecskemet is located to the south of Budapest and is near the
southern border of the Peste megye (county) - Mod.MPP]
