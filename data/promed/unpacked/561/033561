[1] Indonesia: new epicenter of pandemic
Date: Sat 17 Jul 2021

By the thousands, they sleep in hallways, tents, and cars, gasping for air as they wait for beds in overcrowded hospitals that may not have oxygen to give them. Others see hospitals as hopeless, even dangerous, and take their chances at home.

Wherever they lie, as COVID-19 steals their breath away, their families engage in a frantic, daily hunt for scarce supplies of life-giving oxygen.

Indonesia has become the new epicenter of the pandemic, surpassing India and Brazil to become the country with the world's highest count of new infections. The surge is part of a wave across Southeast Asia, where vaccination rates are low, but countries had, until recently, contained the virus relatively well. Viet Nam, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand are also facing their largest outbreaks yet and have imposed new restrictions, including lockdowns and stay-at-home orders.

In Indonesia, cases and deaths have skyrocketed in the past month as the highly contagious delta variant sweeps through densely populated Java island, as well as Bali. In some regions, the coronavirus has pushed the medical system past its limits, though hospitals are taking emergency steps to expand capacity.

Bekasi Regional Public Hospital, where some COVID patients have waited days for treatment, has erected large tents on its grounds, with beds for up to 150 people. Nearby in Jakarta, the capital, a long line of people waited for hours outside a small dispensary, hoping to fill their portable tanks with oxygen.

Among them was N.S.N, 28, who had been searching for oxygen for her aunt's family, all sick with COVID. "She is a doctor, and she is afraid to go to a hospital because she knows the situation," Ms. N. said. "There are many instances where patients do not get beds or oxygen. If we go to the hospital, we have to bring our own oxygen."

On [Thu 15 Jul 2021], Indonesian authorities reported nearly 57 000 new cases, the highest daily total yet, 7 times as many as a month earlier. On [Fri 16 Jul 2021], they reported a record 1205 deaths, bringing the country's official toll from the pandemic to more than 71 000.

But some health experts say those figures vastly understate the spread in Indonesia, the world's 4th most-populous nation, because testing has been limited. Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, estimates that the true number of cases is 3-6 times higher.

In India, where the delta variant was first identified, daily cases peaked at more than 414 000 in [May 2021] but have since dropped to about 40 000.

Despite Indonesia's mushrooming caseload, officials say they have the situation under control. "If we talk about the worst-case scenario, 60 000 or slightly more, we are pretty OK," said Luhut Pandjaitan, a senior minister assigned by President Joko Widodo to handle the crisis. "We are hoping that it will not reach 100 000, but even so, we are preparing now for if we ever get there."

Many Indonesians, however, have been facing their worst-case scenarios for weeks.

Family members describe nightmare scenes of trying to get a hospital to admit their sick relatives. Some hospitals were accepting only patients who brought their own oxygen, they said. At others, patients waited wherever they could find space to lie down.

In Bekasi, a city of 2.5 million that adjoins Jakarta, patients have flocked to the regional public hospital. To accommodate the surge, 10 large tents were set up on the grounds, equipped with beds for as many as 150 people.

L.W.'s husband had been in one of the tents since the previous day, waiting for space in a ward. After 9 days of sickness, she said, his oxygen saturation level had dropped to 84, well below the range of 95-100 that is considered healthy. The hospital was giving him some oxygen, but she had to arrange to get more. "We are waiting for an available room because it is full," she said. "What else can we do? The important thing is to get the oxygen, because he already had trouble breathing. It was scary."

Even being admitted does not make getting oxygen a certainty. At Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in the city of Yogyakarta, 33 patients died this month [July 2021] after the central oxygen supply ran out. The staff switched to tanks donated by the police, but it was too late for many patients.

Overwhelmed hospitals have added thousands of beds, but on average, 10% of their health-care workers are in isolation after exposure to the virus, said the secretary general of the Indonesian Hospital Association, Dr. Lia G. Partakusuma. Some hospitals are using 5 times as much liquid oxygen as normal, and distributors are having difficulty keeping up with the demand, she said.

"Some hospitals have said, 'If you brought your own oxygen tank, please use it first because we have a limited oxygen supply,'" she said. "But it is not a requirement for them to bring their own oxygen."

With hospitals so overcrowded, many people choose to stay home, and many die there. Lapor COVID, a nonprofit group that is tracking deaths from the disease, reports that at least 40 COVID patients a day are now dying at home.

Mr. Joko, the president, has stopped short of a nationwide lockdown but ordered restrictions in Java and Bali, including closing places of worship, schools, shopping malls, and sports facilities; reducing public transit capacity; and limiting restaurants to takeout. The restrictions are set to expire on [Tue 20 Jul 2021], but officials are weighing whether to extend them.

Only about 15% of Indonesia's 270 million people have received a dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and just 6% are fully inoculated. Indonesia has relied heavily on the vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese company, which has proved less effective than other shots. At least 20 Indonesian doctors who were fully vaccinated with Sinovac have died from the virus.

This week, the United States donated 4.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Indonesia. Officials said the 1st priority would be to give booster shots to nearly 1.5 million health workers.

Dr. Budiman, the Indonesian epidemiologist in Australia, predicted more than a year ago that Indonesia would become a pandemic epicenter because of its dense population and weak health-care system. He has urged more testing, contact tracing, and isolation of infected individuals. Indonesia's health minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, said on [Fri 16 Jul 2021] that the country had increased testing to about 230 000 people a day, from about 30 000 in December [2020]. His target is 400 000 a day.

But Dr. Budiman contends that testing is still woefully limited, noting that in recent days, the share of tests that came up positive had risen to more than 30%. Health experts say a high rate is a sign of too little testing.

"For more than a year, our test positivity rate has almost never been below 10%, which means we are missing many cases and we cannot identify the majority of infections and the clusters," he said.

Outside the small CV Rintis Usaha Bersama oxygen shop in South Jakarta, more than 100 customers lined up in the street with their oxygen tanks and waited hours for the chance to refill them.

A.A.R., 27, said he was getting oxygen for his grandmother, 77, who was being cared for by family members at home. He said that her condition had suddenly worsened and that her tank was running low.

"Now it has to be refilled," said Mr. A.A.R., who has had COVID twice. "There is no backup at home. That is why we need to refill it quickly."

[2] France and Germany: vaccine near-mandates
Date: Sat 17 Jul 2021 9:36 a.m. PT
Source: The Seattle Times [edited]
https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/how-vaccine-skeptical-france-and-germany-came-to-support-near-mandates/


When France and Germany launched their coronavirus vaccination programs late last year [2020], officials in both countries assured that the shots wouldn't be mandatory in their societies, where vaccine skepticism is widespread.

But more than half a year later, the 2 nations are going further than most other Western countries in granting privileges to people who have been vaccinated and making daily life difficult for those who aren't. These aren't mandates. Not formally. But in practice, some of the measures come close.

In contrast with the US states that have explicitly banned vaccination mandates or passports, the European Union is using digital COVID certificates, with scannable QR codes, that quickly show if someone has been vaccinated, tested negative, or recovered from COVID-19. The certificates were designed with the primary goal of easing movement across borders, but many EU countries are using them internally, as well.

In Germany, vaccinated people have gained privileged access to restaurants and bars that would otherwise require a recent negative coronavirus test. Some of those restrictions have now been lifted because of low caseloads. But rules could be tightened again, as the European CDC predicts incidence rates across the bloc to triple within the next 2 weeks because of the delta variant.

German officials have vowed that vaccinated people would not be significantly affected by a 4th-wave lockdown.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron announced this past week that people would have to flash their certificates before entering trains, planes, restaurants, cafes, and many other places starting next month [August 2021].

As in Greece and Italy, vaccination would become mandatory for health workers in France by fall. Most everyone else here would still be in a position to decline vaccines. But the unvaccinated would be largely excluded from social life unless they meet the COVID recovery exception or get tested every 48 hours. In addition, coronavirus tests would no longer be free, unless prescribed by a doctor.

Under a draft law, customers and business owners would risk hefty fines or even jail if they circumvent the rules, which still need to be approved by Parliament. The French government says the measures are essential to revive a flagging inoculation campaign -- which had stalled at around 53% for 1st shots -- and to prevent a deadly 4th wave of the virus.

"We must move toward the vaccination of all French people, because it is the only way to return to normal life," Macron said.

People seemed to get the message. Within hours of Macron's speech, vaccination booking platforms registered a surge in appointment requests. A record number of shots were administered in France on [Tue 13 Jul 2021], the day after the announcement.

But thousands of protesters rallied against the measures on [Sat 17 Jul 2021], demanding Macron's resignation and urging the government to reverse its plans. Protests were held in several cities, including in Paris, Marseille, and Montpellier, drawing the support of politicians from across the far-right and far-left of the political spectrum. Protesters in Paris chanted "No to the health dictatorship!" and "Freedom!"

The French plans constitute "an obligation in disguise," said Francoise Salvadori, an immunology researcher and author. She added that the proposed changes mark a "clear change in tone" by the president, who vowed in December [2020] that "the vaccine will not be compulsory."

Pharmaceutical industry scandals and a controversial influenza vaccination campaign in 2009 had turned France from one of the most vaccine-approving nations into one of the most skeptical over the past 2 decades. As a result, French officials launched an extremely cautious coronavirus vaccine rollout, a strategy that was widely criticized by scientists for sending mixed messages on the safety and benefits of vaccines.

Trust in vaccines has since been on the rise in the country, and surveys show a majority of French support the measures announced this past week. But some research suggests that vaccine mandates can decrease trust in government or in science, and Macron's announcement was met with angry protests from some groups.

In Paris, anti-vaccination demonstrators -- chanting, "Down with dictatorship!" and "Liberty!" -- clashed with the police on [Wed 14 Jul 2021].

The far right sought to capitalize on the discontent. National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen called mandatory vaccination for health workers an "indecent brutality." Former Le Pen ally Nicolas Dupont-Aignan said the expanded use of a health pass constitutes a "deprivation of freedoms" and a "health coup d'etat."

Macron also took criticism from the far left, with politician Jean-Luc Melenchon describing the plan as "presidential monarchy."

Salvadori said the debate risks politicizing science ahead of presidential elections in France next year [2022]. "I hope that political interests won't prevail over the discourse of scientific reason," she said.

There is a similar risk of deepening resentment against the government in Germany, where the anti-vaccine movement has attracted a wide range of supporters, ranging from far-right conspiracy theorists to hippie moms.

But both in Germany and France, experts said, the political risks associated with the recent changes are likely to be outweighed by the potential benefits of higher vaccination rates. Vaccines are now easily available in France, Germany, and other EU countries, meaning the ethical debate around preferential treatment for vaccinated people has shifted in those nations, too.

"At the beginning, I was shocked when this question came up," said Tobias Kurth, the director of the Institute of Public Health at the Charite hospital in Berlin. Allowing vaccinated people to resume their lives while their neighbors or colleagues still wait for their shots "runs entirely against my understanding of how society should work."

But Germany and France are quickly reaching a stage in their vaccination campaigns that resembles the United States' current dilemma, Kurth said. Whereas only a few months ago, German authorities went to great lengths to prosecute individuals who jumped the vaccine line, they are now trying to convince holdouts. Germans can get vaccines in front of supermarkets, in churches, or at the airport.

Still, vaccinations have slowed down.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel excluded the possibility of mandates for certain professions this past week. But earlier this year [2021], she voiced support for a privileged treatment of vaccinated people, saying in an interview that -- once sufficient supplies are available -- she might be in favor of an announcement that "those who don't want [the vaccine] perhaps won't be able to do certain things," she said in February [2021].

Unlike in France, where the president wields extensive powers, in Germany the 16 federal states are in charge of their own pandemic policies. In some states, there appears to be a growing perception that the scenario Merkel was referring to is quickly approaching.

Unvaccinated employees in the eastern state of Saxony need a negative coronavirus test to return to work after their summer holidays. Meanwhile, the leader of the southern German state of Bavaria has said that only vaccinated people may be able to party in clubs later this year [2021], and that -- as in France -- unvaccinated people may soon need to pay for their coronavirus tests.

Public health expert Kurth cautioned that putting a price tag on tests that are required to participate in social life risks doing more harm than good. "The social problems that were already exacerbated by the coronavirus will be worsened even more," he said.

The debate about tests is not the only controversial question that needs to be resolved. It's still unclear how vaccinated American tourists will be able to have their vaccination certified in Europe, to receive the QR codes, without first having to go to a French doctor or pharmacy.

Rules for minors remain in flux, with France saying that the planned regulations will be delayed for 12-17-year-olds. It is also unclear how French authorities would be able to control whether restaurants or bars are implementing the rules, leading some to wonder whether Macron's announcement could turn out to have been an empty threat that will be watered down in the weeks to come.

Didier Seyler, who leads a preventive health-care center in southern France, said the current proposals may not be far-ranging enough.

With French people once again partying in bars, clubs, and on the streets, "it seems like the lockdown -- and everything else -- it all happened 10 years ago," he said.

"I'm willing to bet that in 12 months, we will have a quasi-universal vaccination obligation, given the threat the virus poses to our freedoms," Seyler said.

[It is an impossible situation when a significant proportion of the population in France and Germany are strongly against vaccination. At the same time, other countries, Indonesia for one -- see above -- are desperate to obtain vaccines. Neither situation will allow for the pandemic to be brought under control to allow public gatherings to resume safely. In order to enjoy the freedom of open restaurants and events, people's attitudes need to change, or vaccine certificates are needed. - Mod.LK]

Vaccinated tourists will not be allowed to enter Israel on [1 Aug 2021], as had been previously planned, Health Ministry Director-General Prof. Nachman Ash said Sunday [18 Jul 2021], also announcing that the authorities will discuss measures to restrict all travel.

"We are postponing the date for the entry of tourists; it is not going to happen on [1 Aug 2021]," he said, adding that a new date has not been set. "Unfortunately, the current situation does not permit us to allow tourists to enter."

The director-general also warned the public that with the delta variant raging around the world, this is not a time to fly abroad. He said the authorities are examining how to restrict travel, either by expanding the list of countries under the travel ban or severe travel warning, or by other means.

Channel 12 reported that health official are considering several options for a recommendation to bring before the cabinet, including shutting the airport for nonessential traveling and requiring all travelers to enter isolation regardless of their immunization status and the country they fly from. However, according to the report, the most likely recommendation will be to significantly expand the list of countries under travel ban or travel warning, in both cases all returnees have to quarantine, for the 1st group Israelis are prohibited from visiting unless they obtain a permission from the devoted special governmental committee.

Earlier on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with ministers and officials to work on stepping up the enforcement of coronavirus regulations, which since last week has fallen under the Public Security Ministry's responsibility.

The authorities are working to ensure the enforcement system will combine the use of technological means as well as police officers and local inspectors.

"Our goal is to establish sensible guidelines, alongside aggressive and effective enforcement against violators," Bennett said. "Anyone who violates the guidelines endangers his health and the health of the rest of the citizens of Israel. We will not allow this. The delta variant is soaring all over the world; implementing regulations in the field is a critical element in fighting the pandemic to defeat the mutation."

It was decided that verified coronavirus carriers who breach isolation will be criminally charged.

In addition, Bennett instructed the ministry and the attorney-general to regulate the legal aspect of employing technological tools to monitor those in quarantine, including allowing the police to verify the location of individuals in isolation through an SMS system.

It was announced that priority in enforcement will be given to weddings and other events considered to be a high risk of spreading infections.

Starting from [Wed 21 Jul 2021], access to indoor weddings and parties with more than 100 participants will be limited only to individuals who are vaccinated, recovered, or have a negative corona test, or holders of what the government has dubbed a "Happy Badge."

Ash said that in the upcoming days, they will recommend that the cabinet bring back the full green pass system. Until the end of May [2021], the system was used for several venues and activities, including restaurants, synagogues, and gyms.

In addition, he said they are preparing for the school year, and hope that rapid testing will be an essential element of the outline to keep schools operating safely.

Also on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], the Health Ministry announced that participants in summer camps will be asked to show a green passport, a recovery certificate, or a negative coronavirus test taken within the previous 72 hours. The requirement applies also to outdoor programs.

As more and more people need to be tested, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz announced that the number of testing stations around the country will increase and their operating hours expanded.

While at the moment the only widely available tests are PCR tests, the government is also working on making rapid tests -- also known as antigen -- as well as at-home tests, easily available.

Earlier in the day, Horowitz said the possibility of another lockdown exists, but the government is not considering it as of now, and the goal is to avoid it.

"Of course, it is possible that there will be another lockdown, but we are not discussing it now," Horowitz told Army Radio. "Everyone can understand that if there is a huge outbreak here, including in serious morbidity, we will get there. We are taking measures so that we are not going to need it."

Some 430 new virus carriers were identified on [Sat 17 Jul 2021], with 1.47% of the 33 000 tests processed returning a positive result. The previous day [Fri 16 Jul 2021], there were 1120 cases out of 76 000 tests - the highest since March [2021].

At the beginning of June [2021], Israel was registering 10--20 new cases per day. The new outbreak apparently started in some schools and quickly spread.

While the increase in serious morbidity -- which is considered to be the most important parameter -- has remained limited, the number of patients in serious condition is nonetheless on the rise. As many as 63 patients were in serious conditions on [Sun 18 Jul 2021] morning. Four weeks ago, there were 19.

At the peak of the pandemic in January [2021], there were about 1200 patients in serious condition, a number that placed an unprecedented strain on the country's health system. Months before, experts were suggesting that hospitals could handle up to 700-800 serious patients without compromising the quality of the care.

Ash said the number of serious patients is expected to further increase.

On [Fri 16 Jul 2021], Bennett said the Pfizer vaccine is less effective against the delta variant, which currently represents the vast majority of cases in Israel.

"We do not know exactly to what degree the vaccine helps, but it is significantly less," he noted.

Israel is conducting research to understand what is causing the drop in efficacy, Ash said, and whether the time elapsed since receiving the 2 shots is the central elements, or other factors -- like age or background diseases -- have a significant role.

[4] Olympics
Date: Sun 18 July 2021

Two South African soccer players became the 1st athletes inside the Olympic Village to test positive for COVID-19, and other cases connected to the Tokyo Games were also confirmed on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], highlighting the herculean task organizers face to keep the virus contained while the world's biggest sports event plays out.

The positive tests came as some of the 11 000 athletes and thousands more team officials expected from across the globe began arriving, having traveled through a pandemic to get to Tokyo.

They'll all now live in close quarters in the Olympic Village on Tokyo Bay over the next 3 weeks.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week there was "zero" risk of athletes passing on the virus to Japanese or other residents of the village. But that bold statement was already being tested.

The Olympics, which were postponed for a year because of the pandemic, are set to officially open [Fri 23 Jul 2021] and run until [8 Aug 2021].

The 2 soccer players and a team video analyst who also tested positive had been moved to "the Tokyo 2020 isolation facility," the South African Olympic committee said. The rest of the squad members and officials had also been quarantined.

Those positive tests further stoked local fears, with the South African team scheduled to play against host nation Japan in its 1st game on [Thu 22 Jul 2021].

There has already been consistent opposition from the Japanese public to holding the Olympics during the pandemic, with fears that it could become a super-spreader event and cause a spike in infections among Japanese people.

Bach and the IOC have insisted it will be safe and have forged ahead against most medical advice. The IOC says it sees the Games as a chance to foster international solidarity during difficult times, but the IOC would also lose billions of dollars in broadcast rights if the Games were to be canceled completely.

Also on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], Team South Africa confirmed the coach of its rugby sevens team also tested positive at a pre-Olympics training camp in the southern Japanese city of Kagoshima. He was also in isolation there and would miss the entire rugby competition, the team said.

And there were other Olympics-related positive tests. Olympic organizers said that another athlete had tested positive, although they were not residing in the Olympic Village. The athlete was not named and only identified as "non-Japanese."

The 1st International Olympic Committee official was reported as positive. He recorded a positive test on [Sat 17 Jul 2021] when arriving at a Tokyo airport. The IOC confirmed the test and identified him as IOC member Ryu Seung-min of South Korea. He was reportedly being held in isolation, too.

Former distance runner and world championship bronze medalist Tegla Loroupe, the chief of mission of the IOC's Refugee Olympic Team, tested positive for COVID-19 before the team was to depart its Doha, Qatar, training base for Tokyo, 2 people with knowledge of her condition told the AP. The team delayed its arrival in Tokyo, while Loroupe is expected to stay behind, according to the 2 people, who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to reveal medical information.

Organizers say that 55 people linked to the Olympics in Japan have reported positive tests since [1 Jul 2021], but that figure does not include athletes or others who may have arrived for training camps but are not yet under the "jurisdiction" of the organizing committee.

The British Olympic Association said 6 athletes and 2 staff in the track and field squad are isolating at the team's pre-Olympic base in Yokohama after being deemed close contacts of a person who tested positive following their flight to Japan. US tennis player Coco Gauff didn't travel to Japan after testing positive for the coronavirus.

Tokyo reported 1008 new COVID-19 cases on [Sun 18 Jul 2021], the 29th straight day that cases were higher than 7 days previously. It was also the 5th straight day with more than 1000 cases. The Olympics will open under a state of emergency in Tokyo and 3 neighboring prefectures.

No fans, Japanese or foreign, will be allowed at any of the Olympic sports in Tokyo and the 3 neighboring prefectures. A few outlying venues may allow a small number of local fans, but it has effectively become a TV-only event.

About 200 protesters gathered on [Sun 18 Jul 2021] outside Shinjuku station in central Tokyo, waving signs that read "No Olympics." It was the latest in a series of small protests against the Games in the last few months.

"This is ignoring human rights and our right to life," protester Karoi Todo told the AP. "Infections are increasing. To do the Olympics is unforgivable."

Japanese and IOC organizers hope stringent testing protocols, where athletes, team officials, and others are tested daily, will mitigate the risks posed by the thousands of foreigners arriving at once. Visiting athletes, officials, and media will be in a "soft quarantine" situation and restricted to the Olympic venues, the village, and designated hotels, and will be kept away from the Japanese general public. The IOC also says more than 80% of the athletes set to compete in Tokyo will be vaccinated against COVID-19.

But, despite the assurances, the positive tests 5 days out from the opening ceremony showed the regulations aren't -- and can't be -- foolproof.

The South African team's chief medical officer said every member of the team had 2 negative tests before traveling to Japan "as per Tokyo 2020 requirements." They also tested negative on arrival in Tokyo, Dr. Phatho Zondi said.

"Team officials and management have followed all relevant Olympic Playbook rules, protocols, and procedures throughout the pre-Games and Games arrival routines," the South African Olympic committee said.

Coach Neil Powell and the entire South Africa rugby squad were held at a quarantine facility after arriving in Japan because of a positive COVID test on their flight, Team South Africa said. They were cleared to leave, only for Powell to test positive a few days later.

Powell had been vaccinated against COVID-19 with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in South Africa on [24 May 2021], team spokesman JJ Harmse told the AP.

South African Olympic and soccer officials didn't immediately confirm whether the 2 soccer players and official who tested positive had been vaccinated, although South Africa's Olympic committee said in May [2021] it would offer all its Olympic athletes the J&J vaccine.

The Olympics were effectively over before they began for the 2 soccer players and Powell, as they would have to remain in quarantine for 14 days under Japanese regulations.

The only way the soccer players might be able to play is if their team made the semifinals.

[Holding the Olympics during the pandemic when cases are increasing in Japan is such a risky venture, and unfair to the country's citizens who are mostly against it. The high risk is already becoming apparent. There's something very wrong with the decision to go through with the Games. There would be disappointment on the part of the athletes, and significant money lost, but one can only hope that this does not exacerbate the virus spread throughout the world in the manner of a superspreader event. - Mod.LK]
