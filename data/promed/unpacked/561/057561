Environmental experts are currently faced with a puzzle after a large number of flamingos and avocets died in the Walvis Bay Lagoon. For about 4 weeks almost daily, dead birds were picked up by residents.

"We've taken a lot of samples and sent them to various laboratories for analysis," said Susan Roux, a member of the Namibian coastal Environmental Fund (CETN). In recent weeks, more than 40 avocets and several dead flamingos were picked up. They have never experienced a phenomenon of this kind before.

The experts are not sure whether the culprit is a virus, biotoxins, or heavy metals. "The signs are strange behavior and difficulty keeping posture," said Roux. After about 3 or 4 days, the birds eventually die. The expert stressed that the birds represented easy prey for jackals, because they could not fly away in time. It is also noteworthy that only flamingos and avocets are affected (they have in common that both feed on phytoplankton). Fish or other marine animals were not affected.
