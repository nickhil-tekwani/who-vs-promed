The Institute of Public Health of the City of Yokohama (see
<http://www.city.yokohama.jp/me/kenkou/eiken/infection_inf/2008nen/rinji0805.pdf>)
reported the 1st Japanese cases of Tamiflu-resistant influenza virus
in the 5th week [28 Jan to 3 Feb 2008?] to the World Health
Organization. [Tamiflu is the trade name of the neuraminidase
inhibiter oseltamivir].

Five patients between 8 and 13 years of age all resided in the same
ward. A cluster of 3 children attended the same elementary school,
and 2 were treated in the same hospital. They had received no Tamiflu
treatment prior to testing. All showed positive results for Relenza
sensitivity. [Relenza is the trade name for the neuraminidase
inhibiter zanamivir].

[Our correspondent has provided the following background information
as a footnote]:
1) Yokohama is the 2nd largest city in Japan, a city of 3 630 000
inhabitants living in 19 wards.
2) In Japan, elementary school children are from 6 to 12 years of age.
3) The meaning of "the same hospital" is not clear from the text of
the newspaper article [same hospital as the 3 from the school, or same
hospital as each other?] But an official report stated that 2 cases
were reported from a designated hospital for periodic reporting.

[This is the 1st report of Tamiflu-resistant/Relenza-sensitive
influenza virus from Japan. Such viruses have been reported widely
throughout Europe and North America (see (ProMED-mail references
below) during the current influenza season. It is presumed that the
resistant virus isolated in Japan is the A/H1N1 serotype, as observed
elsewhere in the current influenza season. So far, there has been no
obvious explanation for the simultaneous appearance of
Tamiflu-resistant influenza virus across the Northern Hemisphere.

Tamiflu and Relenza are neuraminidase inhibitors. Tamiflu (oseltamivir
phosphate) is an oral anti-viral drug suitable for the prevention and
treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients one year and older
whose flu symptoms have not lasted more than 2 days. This drug is
approved to treat Type A and B influenza virus infections. Efficacy of
Tamiflu in the treatment of influenza in subjects with chronic cardiac
disease and/or [other] respiratory disease has not been established.

Relenza (zanamivir) is another anti-viral drug suitable for persons
aged 7 years and older for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza
illness. This drug is approved to treat type A and B influenza. For
the drug to be effective, patients needed to start treatment within 2
days of the onset of symptoms. Relenza is approved for preventive use
to decrease the risk of developing influenza illness for persons aged
5 and older. Relenza is a powder that is inhaled twice a day for 5
days from a breath-activated plastic device called a Diskhaler for
treatment of influenza.

Information confirming the A/H1N1 serotype identity (or not) of the
Tamiflu-resistant virus isolated in Japan would be welcomed. The
interactive HealthMap of Japan showing the location of Yokohama is
