FMD control program
-------------------
The director of veterinary services in Jenin district, Dr Ahmad
Jaradat, has confirmed today [Thu 26 Feb 2009] the detection of FMD
positive cases in a flock of sheep located in district of Jenin in
the northern West Bank area close to the [Israeli] city of Afula. In
addition he confirmed that 5000 vaccine doses would be distributed
during the next few days to control the outbreak. Also, the Israeli
Civil administration has decided to deliver 100 000 FMD vaccine doses
to the Palestinian government to aid in controlling the current
outbreak. Dr Jaradat pointed out that the FMD vaccination had started
in the autumn [2008] and has been continued during the winter
[2008-09].

[Between 15 Feb 2007 and 30 May 2007, the veterinary authorities of
the Palestinian Autonomous Territories (PAT) notified the OIE about
32 outbreaks of FMD serotype O in the West Bank. The epizootic had,
reportedly, started on 2 Feb 2007. The last follow-up report of 2007,
No 5, submitted to the OIE on 30 May 2007 by Dr Imad Mukarker, deputy
director general, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of
Agriculture, Nablus, PAT, included information about the last 5
outbreaks where, out of a total of 505 susceptible sheep and goats,
194 cases were recorded, of which 83 died. Reportedly, in all 5
flocks, the affected animals were young lambs/kids less than 30 days
old who showed clinical signs and lesions. There was a high mortality
among them, and the post-mortem examination revealed typical lesions
of "tiger heart." Adult animals did not show clear clinical signs,
except for lameness, which lasted 2 days. For a map and additional
details, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4851>.

On 16 Feb 2009, the head of the Veterinary Services and Animal
Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ramallah, PAT, Dr Saed Seyam, sent
follow-up report No 5 which has become a final report since it
included the following declaration of the disease becoming endemic as
of 16 Feb 2009: "The event is unlikely to be contained and is now
considered to be endemic. No more follow-up reports will be made, but
instead, information about this disease will be included in the
future 6-monthly reports". See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7792>.

The said final report included also the following details on applied
vaccinations in the West Bank (since 2007?):
sheep/goats -- 1 064 908, with inactivated doses of vaccine against
FMD serotype O virus;
cattle -- with 20 093 doses of inactivated vaccine against FMD
serotype O, A, Asia 1 virus.

The 2009 declaration of the 2007 event as becoming endemic is rather
enigmatic in view of the fact that, since May 2007, not a single
outbreak of FMD has been reported to the OIE from PAT. An explanation
will be helpful.

Though, according to the mentioned final report, the current outbreak
in the Jenin district will not be separately reported, its details
are of epidemiological importance, including the serotype and its
start date. Samples for confirmation, identification, and serotyping
should -- and, hopefully, have -- been forwarded to the laboratory.
This, particularly in view of the need to exclude the possible
introduction of exotic strains (such as FMDV-A ). As informed in the
recent update, small ruminants are routinely vaccinated in the PAT
with a monovalent vaccine (FMDV-O) while cattle are vaccinated with a
trivalent vaccine. The same vaccination policy prevails in Israel's
territory, where -- for decades -- cases have been limited to
incidentally unvaccinated ruminants.

Since 1989, only FMDV serotype O has been reported from Israel and
PAT; the last outbreak of FMDV Asia-1 was recorded in 1989, and of
FMDV A in 1981. In view of the fact that FMDV-A has been introduced
in recent years into Egypt (2006) and Jordan (2007), updated
information on the current situation there, as well as in other
regional countries, is of great importance while enhanced alertness
and intensified surveillance are advisable in all Middle Eastern
countries.

The serotyping of the recent FMDV epizootic in Lebanon is still
pending.- Mod.AS]
