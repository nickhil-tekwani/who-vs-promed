Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer has appeared for the 1st time in Buffalo, Custer, and Holt counties, according to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

There were 1565 lymph node samples collected from deer taken during the 2011 November firearm deer season, with 26 samples testing positive for CWD. In addition, samples were taken from 37 culled deer that showed clinical symptoms for CWD, with one male mule deer from Garden County testing positive. Those signs include a rough, emaciated appearance and a lack of fear of humans.

There were a record 51 positives from 3645 samples in Nebraska in 2010. However, the surveillance effort was reduced in 2011 due to a lack of funds. The 2011 effort focused on central Nebraska, the leading edge of the disease as it spreads from west to east.

Game and Parks confirmed CWD in the state's deer population in 2000. CWD is a disease that can affect deer and elk and always is fatal to the affected animal. Humans have never been known to contract CWD.

The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says chronic wasting disease has been found in 3 central Nebraska counties for the 1st time.

The commission says a total of 26 deer carcasses tested positive for the disease in Buffalo, Custer, and Holt counties during the November [2011] firearm hunting season. Nearly 1600 lymph node samples were taken. One mule deer carcass in Garden County tested positive.

In 2010, 51 positives were found in the more than 3600 test samples.

The 2011 testing was curtailed by budget issues, so it was concentrated on central Nebraska, which the commission says is the leading edge of the disease as it spreads from west to east.

The disease affects deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have ever been recorded.
