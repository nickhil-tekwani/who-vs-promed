[The Czech Republic has become Europe's 9th country infected by
BTV-8, following Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Luxembourg,
UK, Denmark and Switzerland. The continued activity of the vectors
and spread of virus throughout November 2007 in all affected
countries, in spite of falling temperatures, has been seen also in
the fall months of 2006.

The outbreak is adjacent to the German border within a previously
declared protection zone. A map of the protection zones in Europe,
updated on 28 Nov 2007, is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

It is likely that the virus will overwinter over this year's (2007)
winter as it did last year. Results of entomological surveillance in
the affected countries, to identify the vector species responsible
for the striking spread of the disease, are anticipated with great
interest and concern. - Mod.AS]
