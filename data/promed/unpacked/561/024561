African swine fever - News in Belgium (updated 2 Oct 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------
Since [13 Sep 2018], 28 cases of African swine fever [ASF] have been detected in wild boars found dead in the Etalle region, in the province of Luxembourg.

Coordinated actions between different agencies are being taken to prevent the spread of the virus at the level of wildlife and hog farms. The competences are indeed divided between the regions for all the wildlife and the FASFC for all that concerns domestic pigs.

Under a mutual agreement between the AFSCA and the Walloon Region, an infected zone has been defined around the detected cases.[See URL above for map]. In this area, measures are taken for both wild boar and domestic pigs. The measures concerning wild boar and the use of forests are taken care by the Walloon Region and can be consulted at http://www.wallonie.be/fr/actualites/mesures-de-lutte-contre-la-peste-porcine-africaine (in French).

With regard to domestic pigs, all the enforcement measures are available at http://www.afsca.be/ppa/mesures/ (in French).

[The following situation assessment report of the Belgian ASF event in wild boars, published by the UK's DEFRA Advice Services Team/International Disease Monitoring on 28 Sep 2018, is available with map at https://tinyurl.com/y73ymq4s:

"In the Infected Zone there are few pig farms: 2 commercial breeding premises (1000 animals, and 400 animals) and 5-6 small commercial premises of 50 animals. In the Infected Zone, there is a ban on hunting and feeding of wild boar, collection and testing of all wild boar found dead, as well as limited access to the forest. Members of the public have been asked not to leave the main roads or to enter the forests. Additional national biosecurity measures have also been put in place, such as a ban on pig gatherings.

"At present, there is no further information on how the disease has been introduced into this area. The virus isolated in Belgium is thought to belong to genotype II, which is currently circulating in Eastern Europe. Current hypotheses include that infected meat products from ASF-infected areas has been brought and discarded along the main route through this area, but this has not yet been confirmed.

"In Luxemburg, there is a surveillance zone along the border with Belgium and commercial outdoor pigs are being housed, and Belgium is facing export bans from 13 countries outside the EU, despite having no cases in domestic pigs."

Extracts from a CNN report, published today (2 Oct 2018) follow: "As of [Fri 29 Sep 2018], Belgium had culled 4000 domestic pigs from the Etalle region, according to the country's national federation of slaughterhouses, cutting plants and wholesalers for pork. A total of 13 countries have banned some sort of pork imports from Belgium: Taiwan, South Korea, Serbia, Singapore, China, Belarus, Australia, Japan, Philippines, Mexico, Uruguay, Malaysia and India.

"An outbreak of African swine fever is a very serious event," said Matthew Stone, the World Organisation for Animal Health's [OIE] deputy director general for international standards and science. "The authorities of countries affected are under extraordinary pressure." Globally, more than 361 000 infected wild boars and domestic pigs have been reported to the organization, with more than 119 000 deaths in 2018.

"The European Union issued a research grant in 2018 for the development of an African swine fever vaccine in its Horizon 2020 program, the biggest EU research and innovation program" https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/02/health/african-swine-fever-europe-china-spread-intl/index.html. - Mod.AS
