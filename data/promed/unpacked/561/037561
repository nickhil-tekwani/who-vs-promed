Epizootic summary (as of 20 Jun 2016); from OIE's archive:

Total outbreaks: 191 (Submitted)

The European ASF panzootic has already entered its 10th year. According to an expert report (see 20070920.3131) it started on 22 Apr 2007 around the harbor city of Poti, although already at the beginning of April 2007 an increased mortality of pigs was reported in Poti. The most likely hypothesis of introduction of the virus was via importation of contaminated pork or pork waste from international ships. According to genotyping results (obtained by Pirbright laboratory, UK; see 20070609.1886) it was assumed that the source of infection was from the eastern side of southern Africa rather than west or central Africa or Sardinia. The virus spread in Georgia, invading Chechniya and since then continued its spread, westwards and northwards, eventually reaching the dense wild-boar populations of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and western Poland.
