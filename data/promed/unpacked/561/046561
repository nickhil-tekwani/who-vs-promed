Biologists from the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) and
the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) report that white nose syndrome
(WNS) has been confirmed in a bat in Hellhole, Pendleton County, West
Virginia, by the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) in
Athens, Georgia. If the effects of WNS on the bats in Hellhole are similar
to those seen elsewhere, biologists expect that WNS will devastate the bat
population in this cave, including endangered species.

Hellhole is the largest and most important bat cave in the state. An
estimated 200 000 bats spend the winter hibernating in the cave. The cave
is also important on a national level as it is designated critical habitat
for 2 federally endangered species: the Indiana bat and the Virginia
big-eared bat.

Hellhole supports nearly 13 000 Indiana bats and 5000 Virginia big-ears.
The other bats in the cave are mostly the more common little brown bats.
This single cave supports more than 40 per cent of the world's entire
hibernating population of Virginia big-eared bats. Hellhole is privately
owned and is closed to the public.

WNS is a serious wildlife health crisis estimated to have caused the death
of more than one million bats during the past 3 years. It is named for a
white fungus that often appears on the muzzles of hibernating bats. Once a
cave is infected, the fungus spreads rapidly through the bat population,
and mortality may exceed 90 per cent. WNS was first seen in early 2006 in a
cave near Albany, New York. Since then, it has spread more than 500 miles
to caves in 10 states from New Hampshire to Tennessee. Last winter
[2008-2009], it was documented in 4 caves in Pendleton County, but not
Hellhole.

WNS is spread bat-to-bat as they cluster in caves and mines. In addition,
scientists have evidence that it could also be transferred from one cave to
another on the footwear, clothing, and gear of humans visiting caves [there
is very limited evidence of this. - Mod.TG] Infected caves and mines may
not initially show obvious signs of its presence, so cavers may be unaware
that their gear is contaminated.

Bats with WNS use up their fat stores too quickly and do not have the
energy reserves they require to hibernate the entire winter. The bats
exhibit unusual behaviors, such as flying out of caves during the winter,
even in the middle of the day. Unfortunately, few insects are available for
the bats to feed on, and eventually the bats starve to death.

There have been no reported human illnesses attributed to WNS, and there is
no evidence to suggest that WNS is harmful to any animals other than bats.

In January 2010, bats were observed flying out of the entrance of Hellhole.
Laboratory tests conducted on a little brown bat captured as it left
Hellhole confirmed that the bat was carrying the WNS fungus. WVDNR and
USFWS biologists, in cooperation with the National Speleological Society
and Germany Valley Karst Survey, are planning to conduct a trip into
Hellhole to further document the condition of the bats.

Bats play a key role in keeping insects, including as agricultural pests,
mosquitoes, and forest pests, under control. Between April and October,
each bat can eat its body weight in insects each night. Bats provide a
tremendous public service in terms of pest control. If we lose our bat
populations, we will lose the tremendous ecological and economic benefits
the bats provide.

The USFWS and WVDNR are working with other partners to find ways to treat
WNS and slow the spread. Because people may inadvertently transport WNS, in
March 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service recommended a moratorium on
caving in states with confirmed WNS and all adjoining states.

In addition, because scientists are concerned about the presence of WNS in
the vicinity of the most important Virginia big-eared bat caves, last year
[2009] a few of these bats were brought into captivity for the 1st time in
an attempt to establish a healthy population that could be used to restore
populations if that should become necessary. Although it is not unusual to
see an occasional bat flying on a warm day in winter, it is unusual to see
large number of bats or bats flying during inclement weather.

If you see bats flying during the day and feel something is "just not
right", please report those sightings to: Bat Report, PO Box 67, Elkins, WV
26241. Please mention the county, location, approximate number of bats,
time of day, weather conditions, and your contact information.

The continuing spread of this fungus is both sad and worrisome, especially
since it has now affected a very large cave and a large bat habitat. - Mod.TG
