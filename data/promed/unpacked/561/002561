The state of Minnesota is warning consumers about a threat to their health involving many hundreds of pounds of fish that have yet to be gutted and are being sold at ethnic grocery outlets in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis and St. Paul]. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said Tue 9 Apr 2012, that more than 1500 pounds of dried, uneviscerated fish are being recalled because of a "high risk" that the food is contaminated with botulism-producing bacteria. While no illnesses have yet to be reported in connection with this recall, consumers are advised to throw away any dried, uneviscerated fish they may have bought.

Import Foods Wholesale Inc., of St. Paul, is cooperating with the recall of smoked croaker, barracuda, big eye, and red snapper. Seng Ong Wholesale Inc., also of St. Paul, is cooperating as well and recalling dried mackerel and round scad.

State agriculture officials are working with the FDA to determine additional product origins and distribution channels.

Evisceration of fish involves the complete removal of all internal organs (viscera) in the body cavity, including the gills. Eating salted or smoked, dried, uneviscerated fish can result in potentially deadly botulism poisoning.

The FDA says that even fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Such items are hazardous regardless of packaging or storage conditions.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated [yet] with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
