A multi-agency investigation is continuing after a link has been
established between a batch of imported eggs and an outbreak of
_Salmonella_ [enterica serotype] Enteritidis Phage Type (PT) 14b
infection in England and Wales. 221 cases of _S._ Enteritidis PT 14b
infection have been reported since the beginning of 2011, the majority
of cases being in North West England (104 cases), the West Midlands
(36 cases) and the East Midlands (26 cases).

Dr Joe Kearney, a Health Protection Agency (HPA) director who chairs
the outbreak control team (OCT), said: "A strain of _S._ Enteritidis
PT 14b that is indistinguishable from samples taken from the human
cases was isolated from a small number of eggs that had the same batch
number. These eggs had come from a specific shed on a single farm in
Spain. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) alerted the Spanish
authorities, and measures were taken to eliminate the risk of
contamination from this source, including the culling of a flock of
hens, the cleaning of the shed and the heat treatment of eggs to kill
salmonella. No eggs with the implicated batch number have been
imported to this country since the end of June 2011. The FSA alerted
Environmental Health Officers throughout England and Wales to the
situation, and checks were made and continue to be made on the
distribution chain. Whenever eggs with the implicated batch number are
found in the system, these are removed from sale. In the meantime, our
investigations are continuing," said Dr Kearney.
