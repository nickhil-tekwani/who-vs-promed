A 3 km [1.9 miles] outbreak area and a 10 km [6.2 miles] area around the outbreak were established, and 3 other farms from the same company, that are empty, were identified in the area around the outbreak. The farm is under quarantine and the birds were sent to an authorized slaughterhouse near the site. Epidemiological investigation is on-going.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/ disinfestations; stamping out; official destruction of animals products

[On 9 Mar 2015, Mexico reported an event of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in which serotype H7N3 was identified. A total of 32 outbreaks were reported. The outbreaks were located in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, Jalisco and Veracruz. The event was declared resolved on [Fri 13 Jan 2017]. The comments made in the epidemiological section in Mexico's final report note that "the last affected production unit located at Acatic, Jalisco, has been depopulated. Cleaning and disinfection of the facilities as well as official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste were carried out. Since May 2016, no virus has been detected in the country. Therefore, and since more than 21 days have passed without evidence of the causal agent, the event is considered closed. However, epidemiological surveillance will continue at national level". (See http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=23014) An event summary and updated map are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17489

The immediate and follow-up reports of the 2015 event, as well as this actual event mentions that among the control measures applied, that vaccination is prohibited. However, during this current event, the comments in the epidemiological section indicate that "the flock had been vaccinated against the disease 18 weeks beforehand". Further, based on the 2016 semi-annual OIE reports, vaccination is a measure that was officially applied in 2016 during which 206,221,748 birds were vaccinated. A clarification of this inconsistency is needed. - Mod.CRD
