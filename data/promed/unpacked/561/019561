coconut palms (_Cocos nucifera_) with lethal yellowing-like symptoms
in Papua New Guinea. New Disease Reports (2011) 23, 9;
[DOI:10.5197/j.2044-0588.2011.023.009]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In October 2008, coconut plantations in the Bogia district of Madang
Province in Papua New Guinea (PNG), exhibited lethal yellowing-like
symptoms in both newly planted and old palms. Symptoms started with
premature nut fall, followed by leaf yellowing, and collapse of the
crown leading to the death of the plant. Inflorescence necrosis, a
symptom frequently linked with lethal yellowing (LY), was absent. The
disease spread rapidly from neighbouring affected palms, and farmers
have reported losses totaling over 5000 trees.

Apical buds of eight affected coconuts were collected and sent to the
Global Plant Clinic for testing for phytoplasmas. 3 samples tested
positive [by generic PCR]. For one of the amplicons, the partial 16S
rDNA sequence showed that the LY-PNG phytoplasma matched most closely
(96 percent) with members of group 16SrIV, Coconut lethal yellowing
(CLY). In phylogenetic analysis the LY-PNG phytoplasma clustered as a
single distinct branch related to group 16SrIV (Fig. 1).

CLY has previously been reported from the Americas and Caribbean.
Other closely related lethal yellowing-like diseases have also been
recorded from West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Cameroon), East
Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique), and the Far East (Kalimantan,
India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Malaysia). However, this is the 1st
report of the presence of a lethal yellowing-like disease of coconut
in Oceania.

Coconut is a very important crop for the coastal and island regions
of PNG with exports of copra and coconut oil bringing in USD 27
million and USD 43 million per year. The discovery of a LY phytoplasma
has important implications for the coconut industry as the experience
in Jamaica suggests that the disease is capable of destroying almost
the entire population of susceptible palms.

[Ref: R Vazquez-Euan et al: Occurrence of a 16SrIV group phytoplasma
not previously associated with palm species in Yucatan, Mexico. Plant
Disease (2011); 95: 256-62; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-02-10-0150]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The occurrence of 16SrIV group phytoplasmas in palm species _Sabal
mexicana_ and _Pseudophoenix sargentii_ is reported here for the 1st
time. Palm trees showed leaf decay and leaf yellowing syndromes,
respectively. An amplification product was obtained in symptomatic _S.
mexicana_ (18 of 21) and symptomatic _P. sargentii_ (1 of 1) palms in
different locations in Yucatan; 5 of the positive _S. mexicana_ and
the positive _P. sargentii_ trees died.

The identity of the phytoplasmas from these species was determined by
RFLP [restriction fragment length polymorphism] showing there could be
2 phytoplasma strains of the 16SrIV group. In one _S. mexicana_ palm,
the [RFLP] profile was the same as 16SrIV-A subgroup, previously
associated with _Cocos nucifera_ and, in the rest of the trees,
including the _P. sargentii_ palm, the profile was as for the 16SrIV-D
subgroup. These identities were supported by PCR and nucleotide
sequence analysis.

The association _S. mexicana_/16SrIV group phytoplasmas was found
widely dispersed in Yucatan State. A potential role of _S. mexicana_
as a permanent source of phytoplasma inoculum is suggested. Other palm
species (_Thrinax radiata_ and _C. nucifera_) coexisting with _S.
mexicana_ were also analyzed.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the
palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains
have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and
southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the
respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm
species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of
inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months.

The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the
Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY
strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be
excluded, and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs.
Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been
observed possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or
human activities.

Commercial control of LY diseases relies on replanting with resistant
varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used
Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons for the
resistance breakdown are still uncertain.
