Queensland cattle quarantined for disease
-----------------------------------------
Following the identification of animals possibly infected with Bovine
Johne's disease, or BJD, 2 cattle properties at Kingaroy in southern
Queensland are in quarantine.
Authorities have fined 2 Victorian cattle breeders more than 16 and a half
thousand dollars in court, for moving 32 Jersey cattle into the state from
Victoria and New South Wales, using false health certificates.
Department of Primary Industries stock inspector John Zigterman is
confident the incident won't threaten Queensland's Johne's protected status.
John Zigterman said: "It would create havoc if it got out, yes, at the
moment we've controlled it on these properties in Queensland. They're in
quarantine, these particular animals came up, but we don't want it in
Queensland and that's why we have strict regulations that people have got
to comply with before they bring stock into Queensland. And in this
particular case we actually traced the animals back to an infected herd in
Victoria."
