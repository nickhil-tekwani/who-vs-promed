Two more blue bulls in the Tanda Dam Wildlife Park in Kohat [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] died of anthrax, taking the death toll to 14 animals in the past 2 weeks. On 19 Mar 2014, 12 blue bulls were killed by anthrax.

Talking to The Express Tribune, a wildlife department official said owing to the possibility of panic and fear among the locals, the department has decided to call the disease a flu instead of anthrax. "We have received strict instructions that no dead animal will be taken out of the fencing. It will be buried within the fenced area as a precautionary measure to avoid the disease from spreading," he said, adding that the livestock department was even avoiding autopsy of the animals. "Around 14 animals are dead and more could die," he said, adding, "Treatment is now out of the question."

When contacted, a livestock department official said anthrax was curable and can be prevented from spreading. "The wildlife department should have vaccinated the animals after the 2006 anthrax attack. We have told them to bury the corpses of the animals inside the fence to avoid unnecessary risk," he added. The official, however, avoided commenting on the nature of the disease which has killed 14 animals until now.

[The fact that 2 more nilgai bulls have gone down in the past 2 weeks suggests that the wildlife department has done nothing about protecting any survivors by vaccination. This is not a large park, and it should be possible to corral these animals, bulls and cows, and vaccinate them. If 1/3rd of the bulls have died, I think we can expect that a cow or 2 will have succumbed.

One can have some sympathy with the livestock department wanting their wildlife colleagues to bury the dead nilgai within the park. But it is always better, when given the choice, to burn anthrax carcasses, along with any bloody soil. And the park authorities need to now start planning an annual vaccination of these valuable animals.
