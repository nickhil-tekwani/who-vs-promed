All 7 patients who contracted Japanese encephalitis in the Cordillera region are recovering, the Department of Health (DOH) has reported.

Doctor Julius Ceasar Alcala said a patient from Apayao is still being monitored but his condition has improved from last week. Alcala said that the 3 patients in Benguet and 3 in Kalinga have fully recovered. The patients in Apayao and Kalinga did not travel to areas affected by disease, while those in Benguet made trips to other areas before returning to their homes.

The DOH said there were no deaths reported from the disease, which is spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. It affects the nervous system and in rare cases could lead to death.

Japanese encephalitis [virus] infects not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes and frogs as well.

[There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.

Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 cases is fatal. Fortunately, none of the cases in the above report died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.
