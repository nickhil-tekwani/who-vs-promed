Unknown illness kills five, sickens 34 others in central Vietnam
-------------------------------------------------------
HANOI, Vietnam, 5 Dec 1998
An unknown illness has killed five people and left 34 others sick in
central Vietnam, local health officials said Saturday.
The fatalities occurred over the past week in Suoi Da village. Five
people were in critical condition with symptoms including headache,
chest pain, vomiting and coma, an official said.
Nguyen Thanh Binh, director of the Binh Dinh provincial health
department, said a medical team has been sent to the district clinic
to help.
Autopsy samples of two victims were sent for examination, Nguyen
said. Initially, some villagers fled their homes fearing an epidemic,
but local authorities have since persuaded others to stay.
It is uncertain whether the disease was related to water contaminated
by flooding two weeks ago that killed 14 people in the province.
