[This outbreak appears to be in the Liwonde National Park; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwonde_National_Park.

This is a truly extraordinary event. Anthrax, whether in livestock or wildlife, has not been reported latterly in Malawi. OIE has no records of the disease there. Whether it was seen when the country was a British colony is unknown, although back-checking the government records in Lilongwe may reveal something. Ecologically there is a potential for spore survival, especially in western Central Malawi, proximate to the Zambian border. But the Southern Province has a wide band of Mozambique between it and enzootic Zimbabwe.

There was a long delay between the 1st cases being noted (10 Oct 2018) and laboratory confirmation (late November 2018), which suggests only recent realisation of the problem. The Shire River comes from Lake Malawi in the Rift Valley in northern Malawi, and drains down all the way to Mozambique, in a real sense defining the shape of the country. There is river traffic. How this came about will have to await the investigation of the wildlife and veterinary services, as well as the genomic identification of the strain involved. Hypothetically one might speculate that it came from Zambia, infecting hippos to the north of this recorded outbreak and their carcasses floated downstream. A most interesting investigation. - Mod.MHJ
