[1] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado province)

Cholera has spread to the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, according to the Provincial Director of Health. Saozinha Agostinho, cited in Saturday's [4 Apr 2015] issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias". Cabo Delgado becomes the 6th province to be struck by the disease since December 2014. The others are Niassa, Nampula, Tete, Zambezia, and Sofala.

Agostinho announced that 38 cases of cholera have been diagnosed in the provincial capital, Pemba. Cases of severe diarrhea, particularly in the neighborhood of Cariaco, began to be notified a week ago. Laboratory analysis showed that the great majority of the victims were indeed suffering from cholera.

A cholera treatment center has now been reactivated in the Eduardo Mondlane neighborhood, and all people entering the Provincial Hospital in Pemba with symptoms of cholera are redirected to the center. So far no deaths from cholera have been reported in Pemba.

The latest report from the Health Minister, issued on Monday [30 Mar 2015] before cholera was confirmed in Cabo Delgado, was that since the beginning 2015, there have been 7408 cases, of whom 55 have died, which is a lethality rate of 0.7 per cent.

[2] Cholera - India (Odisha State)

Even as the State [Odisha] struggles to contain outbreak of communicable diseases, cholera has been detected in Kendrapara's Mahakalpada block.

With diarrhea reports pouring in from Kumbharpada and Baitisahi, the Health department conducted a house-to-house survey and found 44 cases. Of the 2 samples sent for investigation, 1 tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_.

The emergence of cholera in the block is attributed to leakage in the water supply pipeline. The district administration has gone on war-footing to repair the pipelines apart from providing drinking water to locals through tankers.

[3] Diarrhea - Bangladesh (Chapainawabganj District)
Date: Fri 3 Apr 2015

A sudden outbreak of diarrhea in the Chapainawabganj municipality has put hundreds of patients in hospital, with the number increasing at an alarming rate. The outbreak was caused by bacteria in the water supply. On average 60 to 70 patients are being admitted daily at the Chapainawabganj Sadar Hospital where 450 people have already been treated in the last week. With not enough room in the hospital wards, many patients are being treated in the corridors and balconies of the hospital. The limited number of hospital staff are severely struggling to keep up with the influx of patients.

Resident physician of the Sadar hospital Shafiqul Islam said: "Most of the patients with diarrhea are from ward number 13, 14 and 15." Although the number of diarrhea patients is increasing everyday, the physicians are saying there is no reason to panic.

Chapainawabganj Civil Surgeon Dr Alauddin said: "The diarrhea is being caused by bacterial infection through the water supply of the municipality. The poly flower [as written in the original text - Mod.LL] bacteria [were] found in a water sample sent to ICDDRB [International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh] in Dhaka." He said the health department issued a cautionary public announcement in the affected areas to use boiled water and stay away from stale food, and added: "Further necessary steps will be taken once the final report of the water sample test comes out."

The municipality authority is also issuing public announcements in the affected areas to use the supplied water carefully but is yet unable to provide an alternate water supply.

[Clearly the term "poly flower" does not refer to a particular bacterium but may reflect "poly" microbial "flora" as sewage contamination of a municipal water supply can, and often does, cause infections from different microbes.

Cholera in the Americas -- situation summary
--------------------------------------------
The last confirmed case of cholera in Cuba was reported by the Canada International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point in January 2015. The case was an individual with history of travel to Cuba.

In the Dominican Republic, in 2014 there were 597 suspected cholera cases recorded, including 10 deaths, which represents a 70 percent reduction in the number of cases and 76 percent reduction in the number of deaths in comparison to 2013. Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 10 of 2015 [3 Jan-13 Mar 2015], there were 185 suspected cholera cases registered, including 9 deaths. This represents an increase of more than double the cases recorded for the same period of 2014. This situation in the Dominican Republic is linked to the cholera dynamics registered in Haiti during the same period. Since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) to EW 10 [week ending 13 Mar] of 2015, a total of 32 257 suspected cholera cases, including 487 deaths, have been recorded in the Dominican Republic.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) through 21 Mar 2015, there were 734 983 cholera cases, of which 419 087 were hospitalized (57 percent cumulative hospitalization rate), and 8761 deaths. The cumulative case fatality rate remains at 1.2 percent. From EW 1 to EW 11 of 2015 [3 Jan-20 Mar 2015], there were 10 328 cholera cases, including 8124 hospitalizations (79 percent hospitalization rate), and 106 deaths. The number of cases and deaths in 2015 are above the number recorded in the same period of 2014. The number of cases reported during the first months of 2015, are equivalent to those reported in 2012. In addition, during the same period, outbreak alerts have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) in 8 out of 10 departments in the country, indicating an intense and widespread circulation of _Vibrio cholerae_ O:1 at the community level. The transmission of cholera in Haiti now presents an endemic pattern.

In Mexico, in 2014, there were 14 cholera cases registered in 2 states: Hidalgo (13) and Queretaro (1). Since the start of 2015, no new cholera cases have been registered.

[A dramatic increase in cases of cholera is reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Especially in Haiti, in the 5th year of the epidemic, seeing this upswing reflects the dramatic need for improved availability of safe water and a better sanitation system in this almost forgotten epidemic. - Mod.LL
