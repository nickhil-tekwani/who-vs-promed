[1] New Mexico: suspected case

A New Mexico man suffering from botulism poisoning is in serious
condition and is able to only wiggle his toes, state health officials
say. "We can communicate with him only by him basically moving his
toes," Deborah Busemeyer, New Mexico Department of Health spokesman,
said Wed 1 Aug 2007.
The 52-year-old Sandoval County man, whose name was not released, was
hospitalized 26 Jul 2007. The department received a preliminary
positive sample for botulism from the CDC, Busemeyer said. "We're
confident he does have botulism," she said.
The department is trying to determine whether the man became ill by
eating canned food that has been recalled, Busemeyer said.
The CDC said that as of 22 Jul 2007, 4 people had been hospitalized
with botulism poisoning: 2 from Indiana and 2 from Texas.
Castleberry's Food Co. has recalled more than 90 potentially
contaminated products nationwide, including canned chili, hash and
stew, over fears of botulism contamination.
The recall includes 2 years' production and tens of millions of cans
at the company's Augusta, GA, company.

[It appears that this case is indeed botulism but it is, as yet, to
be determined whether the case is neurotoxin type A and linked to the
recall. Sandoval County, NM, is in the north-central part of the
state as can be seen at:

[2] One of 2 Hawaii cases discounted

The Hawaii state Health Department has sent blood samples from a Maui
man for federal testing for botulism but did not send samples of a
2nd man who did not have the symptoms, said spokeswoman Janice Okubo.
Blood samples from one person were sent to the CDC in Atlanta, but
state health officials decided not to send blood samples from another
Maui resident.
Okubo said a determination was made to send only Stockton's sample
after a health investigator conducted interviews with the men.
The 1st case, a 33 year old man, said he ate a can of Cattle Drive
brand chili on 24 Jul 2007 and suffered symptoms similar to botulism,
including paralysis in the face and muscle weakness. He was admitted
to Maui Memorial Medical Center on Thu 26 Jul 2007. He was released
from the hospital on Sat 28 Jul 2007, and samples of his blood have
been sent to the CDC.
Okubo said the department officially has no confirmed case of botulism.

[It remains to be determined if either of the cases were actually
botulism, let alone whether the case(s) are linked to this multistate outbreak.
[There are 2 linked cases in Indiana and 2 in Texas. With the one
possible case in Hawaii, there are 11 possibly-linked other cases, 8
in Ohio, 1 in Indiana, and 1 in New Mexico (see above) along with the
Hawaiian case. - Mod.LL]
