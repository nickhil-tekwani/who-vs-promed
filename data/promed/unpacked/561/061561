As the worst Ebola virus disease [EVD] epidemic on record shows no signs of abating in West Africa, fear and ignorance are increasingly said to be playing a role in its continued spread. Meanwhile, local practices such as the consumption of bushmeat and deforestation are the go-to explanations for the epidemic's underlying causes. However, decades of anthropological research in the region by STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) and Institute of Development Studies (IDS) researchers indicates not only that this picture is an over-simplification but that disease control policies based on these ideas may be unhelpful.

The latest news from West Africa is troubling: outreach and surveillance officers have been attacked; rumours circulate that the disease does not exist, that medical staff are harvesting organs, and anyone going to hospital will not come out alive. Tear gas was reportedly used to disperse a crowd at Sierra Leone's Kenema Government Hospital who were demanding the release of family members admitted to the Ebola treatment centre there. As many as 57 patients are reported "missing" in the country, either fleeing treatment centres or avoiding them altogether. This seriously hinders contact tracing and infection control efforts.

Both the Sierra Leonean and Liberian presidents have said anyone obstructing suspected Ebola patients from receiving official treatment will be punished. But these announcements are unlikely to have much effect, being disengaged from the reasons behind the community suspicion and the complexities of the socio-cultural context.

An important lesson from early outbreaks in Central Africa was to include anthropologists in the response teams so that local knowledge could be used to strengthen control measures and minimise fear. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) have been using anthropologists as part of their team in this current episode too, but the rumours are proving hard to beat. IDS Director and STEPS Centre former Director Professor Melissa Leach has lived and worked in the region. MSF recently asked for her anthropological insights, so we at IDS and the STEPS Centre have been thinking about how to put the disease and responses to it in context.

Even the most remote rural populations should not be assumed to be unfamiliar with concepts of modern medicine, however, their engagement with them may be mediated by other logics. People are accepting of Western medicine but are ambivalent about the formal health system. The history of Lassa fever, another viral haemorrhagic disease which has been recognised as endemic in the area for decades, is relevant. During my doctoral research on Lassa fever, I was told of longstanding rumours about medical staff administering lethal injections. Patients have been known to avoid the Lassa ward in Kenema.

Underlying health seeking patterns is the fact that people hold multiple models for interpreting and responding to sickness. In Mende [tribal] areas, there are general categories of big and small fever, and ordinary and hospital sick, as well as specific biomedical diseases. Lassa was classified a "big fever" and EVD may well be too. Diseases can be understood as caused by multiple things, including germ theory or "witchcraft." These causes are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A diagnostic test which proves someone has an illness may not be viewed as conclusive. Key to understanding health seeking is to understand how disease categories shift as the illness progresses. The way people and those around them have behaved, the events leading up to the illness and circumstances surrounding its onset all influence the model which is applied and the treatment sought.

Traditional burial practices have been implicated in transmission as they involve mourners having contact with the deceased's infectious body. The importance of burial practices cannot be underestimated, as they are strictly controlled by the male and female societies (known as secret societies in English) who are central to local and regional politics. Medical teams wishing to prevent traditional burials will likely be intervening in domains of power and secret knowledge that lie at the heart of the socio-political fabric which society officials control.

Secret knowledge, and membership of particular societies which offer access to that knowledge (to different degrees) characterises this region of West Africa. Much about the medical response may resonate with these themes: hiding patients behind screens (in isolation), wearing masks (protective clothing). It may be that medical teams are interpreted as another secret society. Response teams should be sensitive to these possibilities and aware of why they may face resistance.

As with disease, there are multiple kinds and causes of death. Certain circumstances -- such as sudden death or that of a pregnant woman -- raise suspicion. Witchcraft is the most frequently discussed, but this confuses some distinct phenomena including malicious spirits, bad intent by sorcerers, and inappropriate behaviour. Such deaths may require special practices, and again secret knowledge is likely to be important. This may be an additional reason why funerals are proving a flashpoint in this epidemic. It is possible that by not allowing the secret societies to carry out the appropriate cleansing after unusual deaths, medical teams are perceived to be making the situation worse.

While the recognition of Ebola in the area is new, people are likely to be interpreting and responding to it in line with longstanding local frameworks. Public behaviours and attitudes that might at 1st sight appear to reflect ignorance, can and should be seen as part of cultural logics that make sense given regional history, social institutions and experience.

Viewing conflicts as stemming from opposing categories of traditional and modern does not capture the complex and emergent meanings which define life in this region and this epidemic. This blog highlights only a small part of this, but it illustrates the need for a social science perspective. That perspective should also include examining the politics of knowledge which are at play. Simple narratives that blame the epidemic on local people for eating bushmeat and deforestation are already appearing. Prof. Leach has highlighted how these overlook well-established patterns of land use and interaction with bat habitats and so are unlikely to explain why the disease has emerged in West Africa now.

It is hard to say much with great certainty about Ebola, except that it is terrifying and tragic for those affected; all the more need for researchers, health workers, policy makers and the media to be cognizant of the power and politics involved in responding to and controlling the disease.

According to CNN, health ministers from across western Africa and the World Health Organization are meeting in Ghana today [16 Jul 2014] to discuss how to combat the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak that has been the deadliest in history by far. The accompanying infographic shows the timeline of the outbreak [as of 1 Jul 2014] and which areas have been hit the hardest.

National Geographic reports that fighting the virus has become increasingly difficult due to victims being hidden by their families out of fear of isolation wards, from where so few return. Mistrust of outsiders and superstition have also hindered health officials, who are sometimes met with hostility and violence in areas where they are trying to help stop EVD from spreading.

Analysis of clinical samples from suspected Lassa fever cases in Sierra Leone showed that about 2/3rds of the patients had been exposed to other emerging diseases, and nearly 9 percent tested positive for ebolavirus. The study, published in this month's edition [July 2014] of Emerging Infectious Diseases, demonstrates that ebolaviruses have been circulating in the region since at least 2006, well before the current outbreak.

1st author Randal J. Schoepp, Ph.D. recently returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone, where he spent 6 weeks helping to set up an ebolavirus testing laboratory and training local personnel to run diagnostic tests on suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever [EVD] clinical samples. He is part of a team from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) that has been providing assistance to the EVD outbreak in West Africa since March [2014].

Three other USAMRIID personnel also have been involved in this ongoing effort: Wes Carter, who traveled with Schoepp to Liberia; Aileen O'Hearn, Ph.D., who recently returned from providing laboratory support to Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Sierra Leone; and Matthew Voorhees, who is currently onsite at KGH.

USAMRIID has been working in the region since 2006, when it began a collaborative project to develop and refine diagnostic tests for the Lassa fever virus endemic to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. As those assays have matured, the scientists have begun to optimize additional tests for a number of emerging diseases.

Because the team was working on disease identification and diagnostics and had pre-positioned assays in the region, said Schoepp, "we had people on hand who were already evaluating samples and volunteered to start testing right away when the current EVD outbreak started."

According to the publication's authors, between 500 and 700 samples are submitted each year to the KGH Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory in Sierra Leone. Generally, only 30 to 40 percent of the samples test positive for Lassa fever, so the aim of this study was to determine which other viruses had been causing serious illnesses in the region.

Using assays developed at USAMRIID that detect the presence of IgM, an early protein produced by the body to ward off infection, the research team found evidence of dengue fever, West Nile, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, chikungunya, Ebola, and Marburg viruses in the samples collected between 2006 and 2008.

In addition, of the samples that tested positive for ebolaviruses, the vast majority reacted to the Zaire strain, which was unexpected, according to the authors. "Prior to the current outbreak, only one case of EVD had ever been officially reported in this region, and it was from the Ivory Coast strain," said Schoepp. "We were surprised to see that Zaire -- or a variant of Zaire -- was causing infection in West Africa several years ago."

The laboratory testing site in Kenema is supported by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center-Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System. In collaboration with the host country, the site enables collection of samples that can be used in research toward new medical countermeasures and allows USAMRIID to evaluate the performance of previously developed laboratory tests using samples collected on-site. The institute hopes to eventually obtain viral isolates for medical countermeasure development and receive data on the performance of the diagnostic assays.

In addition to providing laboratory testing and training support for the current outbreak, USAMRIID has provided more than 10 000 Ebola assays to support laboratory capabilities in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The Institute also supplied personal protective equipment to Metabiota Inc., a non-government organization (NGO) involved in the testing.

Other contributors to the work include the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office-Critical Reagents Program, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program, and the DTRA Joint Science and Technology Office. Col. Erin P. Edgar, commander of USAMRIID, called the project "a great example of medical diplomacy at work. This collaboration allows USAMRIID to bring our expertise to bear in responding to an international health crisis," he said. "In addition, it enables us to test the medical diagnostics that we develop in a real-world setting where these diseases naturally occur."

USAMRIID's mission is to protect the warfighter from biological threats and to be prepared to investigate disease outbreaks or threats to public health. Research conducted at USAMRIID leads to medical solutions -- vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and information -- that benefit both military personnel and civilians. The institute plays a key role as the lead military medical research laboratory for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense. USAMRIID is a subordinate laboratory of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.

[The analysis of local culture is very relevant to the problems of prevention in these countries.

If the particular ebolavirus strain causing the current epidemic (actually pandemic, because it has crossed international borders) has been in West Africa at least since 2006, why haven't cases been seen before? Well, they have; they were viral hemorrhagic fever patients coming to the Lassa ward of Kenema General Hospital, where they were treated with the proper precautions and did not spread either in hospital or to the community. But since fatal cases were presumably buried with traditional rites, why didn't the carers and mourners get massively infected in past years as they are being now? It's looks as though we have a strain that is more virulent than the Zaire strain has been in the past in West Africa yet not as virulent as it is in the Congo, where up to 90 percent of victims died.

The media should stop repeating there is no treatment and that the death rate is 90 percent. There is no "specific" treatment, but over 30 percent of known cases have recovered so far, a great tribute to MSF and the other NGOs working in hospitals in the 3 countries. - Mod.JW
