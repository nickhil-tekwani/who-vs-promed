Health authorities have put Dhalai district in Tripura on high alert
after nearly a dozen people died mysteriously in the last fortnight.
The state health department has sent a medical team to the affected areas.

The medical officers have reported that the disease was marked by a
sudden onset of fever. "When we went for field visit, we found that
people died within 10 to 24 hours after experiencing high fever and
some red spots on their bodies," said Paul N Darlong, a medical
officer. The epidemic is affecting the people living in impoverished
tribal hamlets with scant health facilities. At least 70 more people
are suffering from a similar disease in Longhthorai Valley, an
inaccessible area dominated by tribal people, which is some 90 km
away from the state capital Agartala.

The federal health department has reported that at least 165 people
have died of meningocococcal meningitis, a contagious disease, in 3
of India's northeastern states -- Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram --
in the past one month.

[ProMED-mail has heard unofficially that the cause of the meningitis
epidemic in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Mizoram and
Meghalaya, as well as Delhi, is said to be serogroup A _Neisseria
meningitidis_.

However, the cause of the outbreak in Tripura of a rapidly fatal
illness with fever and "red spots" (i.e., petechial rash) that is
mentioned in the news report above could be due to either certain
viral infections, rickettsial infections, or bloodstream infection
with a variety of bacteria, for example, commonly _Neisseria
meningitidis_. ProMED requests information about any laboratory tests
done in these cases in Tripura and further information about the
outbreak as it becomes available.

Patients with acute meningococcal infection can present clinically
with meningitis, meningitis with meningococcemia, or meningococcemia
without obvious meningitis. Up to 95 percent of patients with
meningococcal disease have meningococcemia and/or meningitis. The
case-fatality rate is up to 10 percent for meningococcal meningitis
and up to 20 percent for meningococcemia despite therapy with
antimicrobial agents
(<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/221473-overview>).

Fulminant meningococcemia with bleeding into the skin (purpura
fulminans) and elsewhere, low blood pressure, and multi-organ failure
occurs in up to 15 percent of individuals with meningococcal disease
(<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/221321-overview>)
and has a mortality rate that can be as high as 70 percent in
developing countries.

states of Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram can be found at
