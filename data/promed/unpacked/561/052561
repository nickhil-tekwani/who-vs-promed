Jack Woodall's summary presented previously appears accurate from what I
know. I did want to comment on one aspect, as one of our papers was
referred to in an earlier post.
Since we knew H5 subtypes were important poultry pathogens, we designed a
short study to see how sensitive to amantadine were the various H5's we had
on hand. Earlier studies (Beard et. al.,1987 Avian Diseases 31:533-537) and
(Webster et. al. 1985, J. Virology 55:173-176) at our lab had shown the 1983
Pennsylvania H5's generated resistant mutants fairly readily, although the
drug protected against disease. This is essentially what we found as well.
We did find that there was significant variation in sensitivity among the
different H5's and that cell culture sensitivity did not necessarily reflect
sensitivity in ovo.
So, regarding [the usefulness of amantadine and derivatives, the drug will
protect against disease by H5's, but not necessarily against shedding of
infectious resistant virus. There is a wealth of information on this
phenomenon in other subtypes but it really isn't known whether the H5's as a
subbtype exhibit significantly higher levels of resistance in natural
populations.
Although I am not a human health professional, my [opinion in this scenario
would be to exercise extreme caution in widespread use of amantadine and its
derivatives in response to these virus isolations and cases.

To add to Jack Woodall's chronology of the H5N1 situation posted 13 December:
1. September - "Thousands" of chickens die from an outbreak of disease
termed "normal" and unreported; by farmers in Jiangcum village, Guangzhou.
2. December - a third of the chickens at a market stall in Fanling, New
Territories, are found to have died from avian influenza.
3. The latest (7th) case of suspected H5N1 is a Filopino maid, 24 years
old. She is in critical condition.
4. The 5th case, now recovered, was a 37 yr-old man.
5. The Swiss shipment of the antiviral, amantadine, has arrived in Hong
Kong, and private doctors rushed to obtain some of the supply.
