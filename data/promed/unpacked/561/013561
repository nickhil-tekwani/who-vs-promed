["Leishmaniosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus _Leishmania_ and transmitted through the bites of female phlebotomine sand flies. More than 23 species of _Leishmania_ have been described, most of which are zoonotic. The most important _Leishmania_ parasite to affect domestic animals is _L. infantum_, also known as _L. chagasi_ in Latin America. Dogs are the main reservoir host for human visceral leishmaniosis caused by _L. infantum_, and the disease is potentially fatal in dogs and people. Because the internal organs and skin of the dog are affected, the canine disease is termed viscerocutaneous or canine leishmaniosis. Cats, horses, and other mammals can be infected by _L. infantum_ or other _Leishmania_ species. The disease in cats is rarer than in dogs and may manifest in cutaneous or visceral organs. _L. braziliensis_, the cause of tegumentary canine leishmaniosis, is widespread in regions of South America and may geographically overlap with _L. chagasi_.

"Canine leishmaniosis is a major zoonosis endemic in more than 70 countries. It is prevalent in southern Europe, Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and sporadically in the USA. It is also of concern in nonendemic countries where imported disease constitutes a veterinary and public health problem."
