A man died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo virus, at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on [Sun 30 Sep 2018], raising the death toll due to the disease to 11 in Karachi in the ongoing year [2018]. "Pir Bux, a resident of Sanghar district who had been shifted from Aga Khan University Hospital to JPMC, has died due to complications of CCHF this evening. He had tested positive for the viral disease and his condition was very serious due to low platelets count", Executive Director JPMC Dr. Seemin Jamali told The News.

CCHF is a lethal viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals, especially cattle and livestock. Patients are kept in isolation wards to prevent other patients, doctors and paramedics from contracting the viral infection.

A couple of weeks back, H.A.J., a young resident of Mehmoodabad, also died due to complications of CCHF.

There is currently no vaccine for the virus and patients are given symptomatic treatment along with anti-viral drugs to save their lives.

Dr. Jamali said the deceased was a goat trader by profession, who probably contracted the viral disease from his cattle. She added that people who deal with cattle, such as butchers and shepherds, are prone to the tick-borne disease.

"There is another patient who has also been tested positive for CCHF and currently he is battling for life in the isolation ward at our Medical ICU as his condition is also serious," the JPMC executive director said. The patient has been identified as A.S., 45, a resident of Thatta and clerk by profession. His condition is critical as his platelets count is very low.

According to health officials, 11 people have so far died of CCHF in Karachi this year, of whom 6 were admitted to JPMC. Meanwhile, over 60 patients have been tested positive for the viral disease in the city in the ongoing year [2018].

However, many of the Congo virus cases reported in Karachi did not belong to the city as patients were shifted to Karachi from Balochistan and various districts of Sindh.

Sindh health department officials said they asked the livestock department to spray animals coming from Balochistan with insecticides, as most of the CCHF-infected animals are coming from different areas of Balochistan. They also asked all the health facilities in Karachi to update their surveillance cells to report Congo fever cases on a daily basis.

Provincial health minister Dr. Azra Pechuho also asked all the major public and private tertiary-care hospitals to provide data of 18 notifiable diseases to the health department on a daily basis. However, only 2 private hospitals, Aga Khan University Hospital and Liaquat National Hospital, provided the required data, said health department officials.

[CCHF is caused by a tick-borne _Orthonairovirus_ belonging to the Nairoviridae family with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The CCHF virus is transmitted to human population by _Hyalomma_ tick bites or through contact with CCHF virus infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Human-to-human transmission may also occur through lose contact with the blood, body secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Nosocomial spread can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment and devices, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.

The incubation period following infection by a tick bite is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. CCHF virus acquisition following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days but may extend up to 13 days. The patient suffering from CCHF has a sudden onset of fever, myalgia (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). The patients may also present with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on leading to sharp mood swings and confusion, and later to sleepiness, depression and lassitude. The cases may also have upper right quadrant abdominal pain with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). The classical hemorrhagic signs includes petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin followed by larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. The advance cases may have the evidence of multi-organ failure after the 5th day of illness [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/].

Both the reports above are about fatal cases of CCHF, and the case from Karachi in [2] had history of exposure to cattle which is a positive risk factor. - Mod.UBA
