Rabies cases are skyrocketing in Wyoming this year [2014], as 2 distinct strains of the deadly virus converge on the south east portion of the state. Rabies was first discovered in Wyoming in 1984. Dr Myrna Miller, a veterinary virologist at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie, said the surge in animals testing positive for the disease is because of 2 regional varieties of rabies entering Wyoming for the 1st time. "Since 1984, rabies has been primarily up in the central part of the state," Miller said. "The type of rabies we've had is north central skunk rabies." However, Miller said that south east Wyoming -- an area of the state previously unaffected by the virus -- is now under siege.

"In 2011, for the 1st time, there was skunk rabies in Laramie County of the south central variety," she said. "The genotype indicates that it was coming up from Colorado. There are small creeks and drainages coming north out of Colorado into Laramie County and that's almost certainly where the skunks were coming from."

Across the country, there are 8 variants of rabies, each occurring in a specific geographic region and tied to a specific host species. In the eastern United States, for example, rabies is specific to raccoons. In the south west, rabies is primarily found in foxes.

"In this year [2014], for the 1st time ever, we've had skunk rabies in Goshen County," Miller said. "It's also south central, but this genotype indicates it's from Nebraska, so it's coming across the Platte River drainage."

The effects are evident. This year [2014], from January through July, there were 52 documented cases of rabies found in animals across the state, 48 of which were found in skunks. In the 3 years prior, there were only 27 skunks that tested positive. Last week [week of 25 Aug 2014], the 1st case of south central skunk rabies was found in Natrona County, a county with no confirmed rabid animals since 2002.

Experts agree that although there has never been a documented case of human rabies in Wyoming, the virus still poses a public health threat. "It's definitely got our attention," said Dr Karl Musgrave, the state's public health veterinarian. "These new strains of skunk rabies we're seeing are coming into counties that haven't dealt with rabies for a long time."

Rabies is monitored and managed by a cooperative effort between many state agencies, including the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, Wyoming Department of Health, the Wyoming Livestock Board, and the US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services.

Kent Drake, the predator management coordinator for the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, said that in most cases, rabies in livestock is not a concern. "We're more concerned with the human health and safety part of it," Drake said. "Typically, skunks will infect feral cats and stray dogs, which have the most contact with humans. What we find typically in livestock is that they often find it in horses because they are in contact with other domestic animals."

The largest threat to humans is found in domestic animals. Domestic animals that have become infected can transmit the disease to humans through bites or scratches via the animal's saliva. According to Wyoming Department of Health Statistics, animal-to-human bites are more abundant during the summer months.

The frequency in which animals test positive for rabies is also higher during the summer. Once an individual is potentially exposed to the virus, he or she must undergo post-exposure prophylaxis treatment, which entails a number of injections over a 30-day period. Musgrave said Goshen County has been a hot spot for prophylaxis treatment this year [2014]. "In Goshen County alone, we've had up to 14 people," he said. When it comes to prevention, vaccinations are the most effective method. "When there's an outbreak, and typically, horses are close to people's homes, we'll recommend those people get a vaccine," Drake said.

Musgrave also stressed the importance of vaccinations. "The typical message is vaccination of pets," he said. "That's the 1st thing we mention."

[In the USA several wildlife variants of Lyssavirus exist, which circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bat rabies is found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Skunk rabies prevails in central US, but there are 2 variants, north central and south central. Both are found in Wyoming (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2012-surveillance/reservoirs.html).

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior.
