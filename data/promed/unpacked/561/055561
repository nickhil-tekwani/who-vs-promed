Seven people have died after eating contaminated food during a family meal in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, local authorities announced on Sat 10 Oct 2020.

The food poisoning occurred on 5 Oct 2020 when W, a resident in Jidong County, dined with 8 family members at home and had sour noodles, a local food made of fermented corn flour, which had remained frozen for a year.

Police have ruled out homicide by poisoning since no toxic substances were detected from the extracts on the premises. A preliminary investigation suggested aflatoxin poisoning, as hospital lab test results showed the level of aflatoxin in the food was far higher than normal.

[The article says the resident dined with 8 family members, meaning 9 people ate the meal. Seven are deceased, and what about the other 2? Are they hospitalized? What is their condition?

Aflatoxin, a naturally occurring chemical coming from a fungus (_Aspergillus flavus_, _A. parasiticus_, and _A. nomius_) sometimes found on corn and other crops, can cause severe liver damage. The fungus would have been gone, or certainly inactive, after the long freezing time; however, the chemical compound produced by the fungus would have been unaffected by the freezing time.

Aflatoxin poisoning can cause sluggishness, a lack of appetite, and, in severe cases, severe vomiting, fever, and jaundice, and if left untreated, it can lead to death from liver failure. The level of aflatoxin would have been extremely high to have caused liver failure and death in approximately 5 days. The severe vomiting usually drives individuals to seek medical assistance.

Our sympathies to the family. - Mod.TG
