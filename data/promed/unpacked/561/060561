New Theory on 16th Century Mexican Epidemics
--------------------------------------------------
David Stahle, a geologist at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville,
has claimed that 2 of the most devastating epidemics to hit the native
population of colonial Mexico, contrary to the conventional view, were not
imported by Europeans. Rather they were caused by an indigenous virus and
magnified by a mega-drought and the stress of colonization.
Hantavirus-like hemorrhagic fever [epidemics spread across the Yucatan
peninsula in 1545 and again in 1576, killing 17 million people, including
80 percent of the native Indians, the same proportion of the population
that died in Europe during the Black Death. "It shows that natural hazards
like drought can interact with social conditions to amplify an epidemic,"
said Stahle at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
The traditional view is that native peoples in the Americas succumbed to
European diseases to which they had no natural resistance. Although the
1520 epidemic that killed 8 million is still thought to have been smallpox,
a European disease, the [1545 and 1576 epidemics now appear to have been
caused by a rat-borne hemorrhagic fever called Cocolitzli. Medical
journals have already published 2 articles this year arguing that the
symptoms recorded at the time most strongly resemble those of an aggressive
hantavirus infection. They include blood gushing from every orifice, black
tongue and green urine.
Hantaviruses can by carried by rats. Stahle noticed that in both epidemics
the disease was completely absent from the arid coastal lowlands where rats
do not live. He then plotted the amount of precipitation in the epidemic
regions based on a 2000-year tree ring database covering all of North and
South America. He found both Cocolitzli epidemics occurred at the peak of
a wet period preceded by severe droughts.
During the drought, Stahle argues, rats would have stayed near limited
sources of water, thus forming a concentrated reservoir of virus. When the
rains returned, the rats spread around the countryside to forage and took
the virus with them. The population would certainly have been more
resistant if these droughts hadn't coincided with the period of conquest
and colonisation by the Spanish. This left the native people hungry and
poorly clothed. The Cocolitzli virus has never been found, but Stahle says
of virus hunters from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in the field searching for a candidate virus in rats of the region: "I
would bet they find it in the next 5 years."

[If the word "rats" is replaced by the word "rodents" throughout the text,
the hypothesis advanced by David Stahle has some interest. Hantaviruses
occur worldwide and hundreds of thousands of cases of "Hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome" (HFRS) are recorded annually in China, Korea and
Russia. Death rates range from less than 0.1 percent for Puumala virus to
up to 10 per cent for Hantaan virus. However, mortalities of greater than
40 percent are recorded in the clinically distinct "Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome" (HPS) recently recognized in North and South America. At least
174 of the approximately 250 cases recorded in the USA and Canada have been
associated with infection by a single virus, Sin Nombre virus.
Consequently outbreaks of hantavirus infection could have attained the
fatality rates observed in 16th-Century Mexico. A difficulty of the
hypothesis is that it draws inferences from the potential population
dynamics of a presumed vector. Rodents can be vectors of many pathogenic
agents; it was the bacillus _Pasteurella pestis_ in the case of the Black
Death of medieval Europe. Isolation of novel hantaviruses in Mexico will
not support the hypothesis; nothing short of a catastrophic
hantavirus-associated outbreak would be sufficient. - Mod.CP
