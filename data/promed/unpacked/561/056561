The DIVE (Directorate of Epidemiological Surveillance) this Wednesday [10 Mar 2021] registered 17 more monkey deaths from yellow fever in Santa Caterina.

The deaths occurred in the municipalities of Sao Martinho (1 case), Campo Belo do Sul (10), Sao Jose do Cerrito (5), and Lages (1). In total, the state has counted 56 dead monkeys from the disease in 2021.

The monkeys live in the same habitat as the mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever [viruses] (_Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_) and because of this are the 1st victims of the disease, explained a note issued by DIVA.

The death of the animals signals where the virus is circulating. Thus, it is important for the population to report to the Municipal Health Department when they find a dead or sick monkey.

Yellow fever in Santa Catarina
------------------------------
In addition to the zoonotic [monkey] cases, now there are 2 confirmed human cases of yellow fever. The 1st was registered in January [2021], who was a 40 year resident of Taio in the region of Alto Vale do Itajai. The 2nd was confirmed in March [2021], a 62-year-old man, resident of Aguas Mornas, in Grande Florianopolis. Neither had registration of yellow fever vaccination.

Yellow fever is an acute infectious disease. The principal symptoms are abrupt febrile onset, chills, intense headache, back and body pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness and tiredness, abdominal pain, and jaundice (yellowish skin).

Vaccination is the best way to prevent yellow fever. However, the current vaccination coverage in Santa Catarina is 76%.

"All the Santa Catarina residents, from 9 months of age, must be vaccinated against yellow fever. A dose of this is available at the health posts." stated Arieli Fialho, chief of immunizations of DIVE of Santa Catarina.

On presenting with any sign or symptom [of yellow fever], it is important to get medical attention.

[No surprises. The possible (probable ...) confirmation of yellow fever among the non-human primates under investigation should not be a surprise; on the contrary, it will only ratify the intense circulation of the virus in Santa Catarina, as reported by ProMED-PORT (see https://promedmail.org/?lang=pt. - Mod.RNA

The human deaths are not surprising, given the number of monkeys dead of this disease in the area. The deaths of monkeys in a given area over a short period is characteristic of the sylvan (forest) yellow fever virus transmission cycle. Active transmission of the virus among monkeys carries with it the risk of spillover to humans and ongoing transmission in the urban cycle, which could spread rapidly in a human population with inadequate vaccination coverage. The prompt response of local health authorities to call for yellow fever vaccination of the local population is prudent. - Mod.TY
