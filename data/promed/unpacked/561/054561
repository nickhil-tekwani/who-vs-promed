Haiti's cholera epidemic will inevitably spread to the Dominican
Republic but is likely to cause less devastation there, WHO said on
Fri 19 Nov 2010.

Many Haitians work in the Dominican Republic and because cholera
infections often do not show symptoms, the waterborne disease could
easily cross the border, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told a UN news
briefing in Geneva.

"It is completely expected that there will be cases in the Dominican
Republic. We are seeing the 1st signs of these cases and we are
working with the government of the Dominican Republic to prepare,"
Hartl said. He estimated the number of infections as "still in single
digits, probably".

More than 1110 people have died in Haiti from the cholera outbreak,
and more than 18 000 have become sick.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said that in the Dominican Republic
better sanitary conditions meant the diarrheal illness should be less
dangerous. "We don't expect it to be as high as it is in Haiti," he
said of the severe illness and death rate.

[Although not directly stated, the posting suggests that the number
of cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection in the Dominican Republic is
not one. As stated above and in previous postings, the better
sanitary conditions in Haiti's neighbor will serve to minimize
secondary cases. - Mod.LL]

[2] Haiti (Port-au-Prince): prisoners

The deadly cholera epidemic that has claimed more than 1100 lives in
Haiti has now spread to yet another vulnerable community: the largest
prison in the country. "The situation is becoming very worrying in
Port-au-Prince National Prison," said a statement from Riccardo Conti
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The organization said 30 new cases of cholera have been reported in
the last 3 days and 7 inmates have died. It fears that the death toll
could significantly rise in the facility that houses 2000 inmates.

"It's overcrowded and it can spread very, very fast," said Olga
Miltcheva, the UCRC's spokeswoman in Haiti. "Our teams are supporting
the authorities in the prison. They have been working several days
there from morning to night."
