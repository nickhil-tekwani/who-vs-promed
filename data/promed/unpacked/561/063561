Slaughtered pigs infected with _Trichinella_ have been confiscated
from a businessman in Severo-Eniseysk (Krasnoyarskiy kray).

City police informed Interfax-Sibir that they confiscated 9 pigs.
However, several residents had already bought and consumed the pork.
Infected people have been identified and are under medical observation.

[In a press release dated 31 Mar 2009, the Krasnoyarsk Regional
Administration of Rospotrebnadzor reported on the epidemiological
situation in Krasnoyarsk kray due to pork contaminated with
_Trichinella_. Meat and meat products have been forbidden for sale in
non-identified places, and/or without veterinary examination, in
order to prevent the spread of trichinellosis. - Corr.BA]

[Trichinellosis in wildlife meat (for instance, bear) is well known
in Russia. Trichinellosis in pork usually comes from small scale
farms that feed the animals kitchen waste and deliberately avoid
veterinary inspection before bringing the slaughtered animals to market.
