A total of 3 regencies in Bengkulu Province have been affected by bird flu
(avian influenza or H5N1) virus, according to a local official. The 3
regencies were Kepahiang, Central Bengkulu (Benteng) and Bengkulu city,
Emran Kuswadi, a coordinator of the bird flu eradication program, said here
Thursday [12 Aug 2010]. Thousands of chickens and ducks have been culled so
far in order to prevent the spread of the bird flu virus, he said.

Local authorities have also carried out disinfectant spray in areas where
bird flu cases were found. Bird flu virus has spread at 30 urban villages
in Bengkulu city. The latest case was found in Tanjung Jaya, Sungai Serut
sub district, Bengkulu city, where 85 chickens were found dead suddenly.

Meanwhile, some 4559 chickens have died of suspected bird flu virus over
the past 2 months in Bengkulu. Some of the chickens had died suddenly due
to bird flu virus (H5N1), Emran Kuswadi, bird flu disease control
coordinator, confirmed recently. Over the past one month in Kepahiang
District (Central Bengkulu) and Bengkulu City, 559 chickens had been
confirmed of being infected with bird flu virus and had died, he said.
However, 4000 others had died suddenly 2 months ago in Seluma District,
Bengkulu Province, but no bird flu virus was confirmed in the poultry's
deaths, he continued.

Last 17 Jul 2010, a Sukuharjo district health official in Central Java,
confirmed that the death of 14 year old girl a few weeks ago had been
caused by bird flu. The official said samples of the patient's body fluids
had been sent to the Health Ministry's laboratory in Jakarta for tests. The
test results had shown the junior high school student had been positively
infected with the bird flu virus. The victim was a resident of Menjing
village, and had contact with a dead chicken before.

[Indonesia continues to report the majority of new outbreaks in poultry
that occur in the world. This emphasizes the magnitude of the problem
there, although the intense efforts made through Participatory Disease
Surveillance Programs may lead to higher number of reported cases in
Indonesia as compared to other countries that don't engage in such
intensive surveillance activities.

Nonetheless, it is clear that both Indonesia and Egypt remain separate but
significant foci for outbreaks in poultry populations. See the FAO EMPRES
H5N1 HPAI Global Overview - May and June 2010, Figure 7 for details at
<http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/ak775e/ak775e00.pdf>.

In this regard it is interesting to note that the number of human cases and
deaths in Indonesia has moderated substantially this year [2010] compared
with the previous 2 years. In 2008, there were 24 cases resulting in 20
deaths, in 2009 there were 21 human cases resulting in 19 deaths. So far
this year, there have been only 6 cases and 5 deaths. - Mod.PC
