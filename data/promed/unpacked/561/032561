The number of confirmed Campylobacter illnesses linked to raw milk from Your Family Cow dairy in Chambersburg, PA has risen to 60, according to the latest report Friday, 10 Feb 2012, from the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

Since Food Safety News last reported on Tuesday that the dairy had resumed production after passing a state health inspection, an additional 17 people have been confirmed ill from Campylobacter jejuni infection. The latest breakdown of illnesses by state is as follows:

Pennsylvania (51 illnesses), Maryland (4), West Virginia (3), New Jersey (2).

According to a Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture spokesperson, the dairy passed its health inspection on Monday after its unpasteurized milk tested negative for pathogens over a 24-hour period.

In its February 3 update on the outbreak, the Pennsylvania health department said that approximately half of 36 confirmed cases were individuals under the age of 18.

The health department plans to continue updating the number of ill as cases surface.

[Since the last posting on ProMED of this outbreak 3 days ago, the number of cases has risen from 43 to 60, all but 1 of the newly reported cases were from Pennsylvania, the home state of the, now reopened, dairy that is the source of the unpasteurized milk vehicle. This is certainly one of the largest outbreaks of infection linked to raw milk that been posted by ProMED since this moderator has been been involved. The age distribution of the cases has not been recently stated.

There remains little peer-reviewed scientific evidence that raw milk is healthier than its pasteurized cousin. On the other hand, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, EHEC E. coli infection and a host of other pathogens can clearly, without question, be linked to the ingestion of raw milk. All of these infections are potentially life-threatening. - Mod. LL]
