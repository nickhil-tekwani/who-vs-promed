The San Joaquin County Mosquito and Vector Control District has detected _ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in Stockton.

The 1st detection was from a sample of mosquitoes collected on 6 Aug 2019 in the vicinity of Brookside. "Our goal is to control and limit the presence of this invasive mosquito species," said Ed Lucchesi, Manager of the District. "We are doing everything possible to ensure these mosquitoes do not become established in our communities; however, this type of mosquito can be very difficult to eliminate," said Lucchesi.

The district is increasing surveillance efforts by placing additional traps used to collect adult mosquitoes and mosquito eggs. Additionally, the district's staff is conducting door to door inspections of the residential area near the recent _Aedes aegypti_ detection. The boundaries for the inspections are north to March Lane, south to the Diverting Canal, east to I-5, west to the Stockton Deep Water Channel.

_Aedes aegypti_ is not native to California; however, it is a common mosquito in some urban areas of the southeastern United States and Arizona. Recently, this species was detected in Stanislaus County [California]. Elsewhere in California, _Aedes aegypti_ have been found in Fresno, Madera, Merced, and San Mateo counties and numerous areas in southern California. _Aedes aegypti_ has the potential to transmit several viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. These viruses are not currently transmitted by mosquitoes in California. _Aedes aegypti_ is a small (about 1/4 inch [7 mm]) black and white mosquito that bites aggressively during the day. The public can help prevent the spread of these invasive mosquitoes by calling in daytime biting mosquitoes to the district.

The public's help is crucial in controlling the spread of this mosquito population. _Aedes aegypti_ lays its eggs just above the water line in small containers and vessels that hold water, such as dishes under potted plants, bird baths, ornamental fountains, tin cans, or discarded tires. Residents should inspect around their yard and outside their home and dump out even the smallest amount of standing water. Be sure to clean and scrub bird baths and pet watering dishes weekly and dump the water from overflow dishes under potted plants. Also, remove any unnecessary containers and trash around properties.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have now been found in another locality in California, in Stockton in San Joaquin County. The areas in California where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found continues to expand. So far, there has been no local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever or Zika viruses, probably because the populations of this mosquito have not been sufficiently numerous to support ongoing transmission. Local residents in San Joaquin County should heed the advice to eliminate breeding sites of this mosquito. However, as the report above indicates, this mosquito can be very difficult to control because it can breed in a wide variety of water catchments, many of which are not easy to find. - Mod.TY
