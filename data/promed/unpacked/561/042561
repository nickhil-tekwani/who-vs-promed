[According to information obtained from the WAHID database, during 2013, Russia reported 2 events of FMD serotype A. A total of 21 outbreaks were reported, 6 of which were located in Zabaykalsky krai (Zabajkal'Skij Kray).

The 1st event started in March 2013 with 4 outbreaks reported in the Zabaykalsky krai. The event was resolved 29 May 2013. The serotype identified was FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage SEA-97. A summary of this event is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=13157 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013546_20130603_173107.pdf.

The 2nd event started in June 2013 where 17 outbreaks were reported. The event was resolved 23 Dec 2013. Although not mentioned in the OIE reports, in these outbreaks 2 separate serotypes A were identified. Mod.AS's comment on ProMED-mail (archive no. 20131101.2033466) noted that: "Since the beginning of 2013, 2 separate FMD serotype A epizootics are evolving in Russia caused by 2 different lineages of the virus; one in the south-west, namely in the Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, and the Krasnodar krai, where the circulating strain has been recognized as FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage Iran-05 (SIS-10). The other epizootic is located in the far east, namely in the Trans-Baikal krai and the Amur oblast, where the circulating virus strain is FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97, originating in China." A summary of both epizootics, with a map, is updated and available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014576_20131226_151559.pdf and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=13579.

Zabaykalsky krai has extensive international borders with China (998 km; 620 miles) and Mongolia (868 km; 539 miles) and internal borders with Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, as well as with the Republics of Buryatia and Sakha.
