For Immediate Release---
And Now There are 3; Texas Joins States with Vesicular Stomatitis in 2005
-------------------------------------------
Texas, on Fri 20 May 2005, joined New Mexico and Arizona as states with
confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis (VS) this spring. 2 Travis County
horses were hauled home 10 May 2005 from a trail ride in Arizona, where
they apparently were exposed to the virus that can cause animals to develop
blisters and sores in the mouth, on the tongue, muzzle, teats and
hooves. The year's 1st VS cases were confirmed 17 Apr in 2 horses in
southwest New Mexico. Since then, infection has been detected in 17 horses
on 11 premises in New Mexico, Arizona, and now, Texas.
A number of states and countries impose strict testing, permitting, and
inspection requirements for livestock that originate from VS-affected areas
or states. Check with the state or country of destination before hauling
livestock from Texas, said Dr. Bob Hillman, head of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory
agency. Phone numbers for other states' animal health regulatory agencies
can be obtained from the TAHC's Austin headquarters at 1-800-550-8242.
Staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Austin office can be reached
at 512-916-5565 for international shipping rules or restrictions.
VS rarely causes death, but an animal can suffer several weeks while the
lesions heal, said Dr. Bob Hillman, who also serves as Texas' state
veterinarian. To help prevent the spread of VS, an infected animal and the
other livestock on a premises are quarantined until at least 30 days after
the sores heal. Prior to releasing movement restrictions, a regulatory
veterinarian will examine the affected animal to ensure healing is
complete. Other livestock also will be checked. If infection is detected,
the quarantine will begin anew.
Dr. Hillman explained that the clinical signs of VS mirror those of the
dreaded foreign foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease. Horses are susceptible to
VS, but not FMD; however, both diseases can affect cattle, sheep, goats,
swine, deer and a number of other species. When sores or blisters are seen
in FMD-susceptible animals, we must immediately rule out an introduction of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). When horses have lesions, a VS test rules out
other possible causes for blisters and sores, including toxic plants,
chemicals or poison. Tests are run at no charge to the animal owner, and
the VS diagnosis in horses is confirmed at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, IA.
Dr. Hillman noted that the disease occurs sporadically, but outbreaks
generally follow a 10--15-year cycle. In l982-83, the country suffered its
worst recorded VS outbreak, when infection was confirmed on 617 premises in
9 states: Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana,
Nebraska and South Dakota.
Subsequent outbreaks in l995, l997 and l998 were limited to New Mexico,
Colorado and Texas, with a few cases in Arizona. In 2004, Arizona was
"spared", when Texas had 15 VS cases, New Mexico had 80, and Colorado,199.
Livestock owners and private veterinary practitioners are urged to report
suspected cases of VS to their respective state's livestock health
regulatory agency:
Texas Animal Health Commission -- 1-800-550-8242 (operational 24 hours a day)
New Mexico Livestock Board -- 1-505-841-6161
Colorado Department of Agriculture, State Veterinarian's Office
--1-303-239-4161
Arizona Department of Agriculture, State Veterinarian's Office
--1-602-542-4293
The TAHC's web site at <http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/> has additional
information on VS and a link to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where
situation reports, maps and movement restrictions and requirements are posted.
