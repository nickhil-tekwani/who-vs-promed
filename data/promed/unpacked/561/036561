Assam has reported 51 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis [JE] so far this year [2020], but the state health department described it as a success, as the death toll was 110 less than last year [2019].

Japanese encephalitis, a virus spread by the bite of infected mosquitos, has posed a serious challenge for the state health department in the past few years, as it caused more than 150 deaths almost every year.

According to a status report on Japanese encephalitis in Assam 2020, the state reported 318 cases till 9 Sep [2020], of which 51 persons died. Last year [2019], 642 cases were reported till December [2019], while 161 people died.

Most of the deaths this year [2020] have been reported from Darrang, Barpeta, Sonitpur, Morigaon, Sivasagar, Kamrup, and Golapara districts.

"The health department has been able to contain the spread of Japanese encephalitis this year [2020] due to rigorous awareness activities; advertisements through newspapers, TV, radio, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter; regular follow up with districts; and community participation by including the Panchayati Raj Institutions, religious leaders, youth, and women. The number of cases has come down, especially in the endemic districts such as Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, and Lakhimpur, and in the districts wherein adult JE vaccination has been conducted in 2020 (Kokrajhar, South Salmara, and Golapara)," said the report.

Another health department official, however, said the number of JE cases came down significantly this year [2020] as people remained indoors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "JE happens mainly in areas with agricultural activities, but this year, such activities were less due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also, people are more careful about their health this year due to the pandemic," he said.

The department also decided to provide an allowance of Rs 1000 [USD 13.60] to those infected with JE where the government ambulance service was not available. Financial assistance up to Rs 100 000 [USD 1360] is also being provided to patients undergoing treatment in private nursing homes.

"So far, 19 beneficiaries have been provided the financial assistance of Rs 100 000 [USD 1360] each," it said.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases continue to increase this year (2020) in Assam state, from 38 cases and 5 deaths reported on 9 Jul 2020, 184 cases and 24 deaths as of 22 Jul 2020, to at least 199 cases and 29 deaths on 27 Jul 2020, and now 318 cases with 51 deaths mentioned above. Interestingly, there is no mention of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in the report above, which have been more frequent than JE cases in the previous reports from Assam this year (2020).

Although mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors -- _Culex_ spp. -- are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. The reduction in cases and deaths is attributed to vaccination and behavioral changes that have reduced exposure to vector mosquitoes. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection.
