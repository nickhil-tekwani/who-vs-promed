Rare disease now affecting men who have sex with men
-----------------------------------------------
A rare venereal disease, a bacterial infection of the anus and genitalia,
is now "a significant" problem in European men who have sex with men (MSM),
a specialist journal has reported.
The disease, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), is caused by an invasive
strain of chlamydia. Previously known only as a rare disease in poor
countries, LGV was 1st reported in Europe in 2003, when an outbreak was
detected among 100 MSM in Rotterdam, the April 2005 issue of Sexually
Transmitted Infections reported.

But LGV was now "a significant problem" among MSM in Europe, the journal
reported. Outbreaks have occurred in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.
And in January 2005, the 1st 24 cases were reported in Britain, mostly from
sexual health clinics in London, a tally that had risen to 34 by
mid-February 2005. Other cases have been recorded in the US in New York,
San Francisco and Atlanta.
The British patients were all MSM, 17 of whom also had the AIDS virus. 4
were also infected with hepatitis C.
"It is likely that LGV has been present for some time in MSM in the UK,
with many cases going undiagnosed," the journal reported.
