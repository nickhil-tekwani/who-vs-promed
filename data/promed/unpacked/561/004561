[For further details, including data on additional 5 reference strains and
a dendrogram, subscribers may refer to the URL above. Similarly to the
recent serotype O isolates from China/Hong Kong and S Korea, the reference
strain found most related to the Japanese strain is "O/MYA/7/98
(DQ164925)". Details on the missing information (date of collection and
species sampled) will help to round up the Japanese picture. Genotyping of
the FMDV serotype O, currently circulating in Mongolia, is not yet available.

How did the virus reach South Korea and Japan, most probably from China?! A
recent FAO press release included the following statement: "The routes
taken by the virus have not been identified, but experts say it is possible
the infection occurred through food waste, with pigs eating infected meat
scraps. Understanding how biosecurity breaches occurred is important to
prevent similar events elsewhere" (see
