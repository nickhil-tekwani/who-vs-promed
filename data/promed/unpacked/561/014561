Three one-horned rhinoceroses have died, and another has fallen ill at Jaldapara National Park in north Bengal since Tuesday [18 Feb 2020], forest officials said. An elephant carcass was also found in Jalpaiguri, around 30 km [18.6 mi] from Jaldapara.

The deaths have triggered panic among forest officials who suspect that it could be an anthrax outbreak. Blood and tissue samples collected from the carcasses have been sent to government laboratories for tests. Forest officials have been asked to stay on high alert and increase patrolling. "While one rhino died on Tue 18 Feb 2020, 2 more died on Wed 19 Feb 2020. One rhino was found unwell on Thu 20 Feb 2020," said a senior forest official.

The rhino population in West Bengal has shot up from 22 in 1986 to more than 280 at present. Jaldapara has more than 230 of these animals, and Gorumara National Park, also in north Bengal, has around 50 rhinos.

"These are not poaching cases, and the animals have died because of some disease. We have sent their blood samples to at least 3 government labs to identify the disease. We cannot say whether it is anthrax as of now," said Ravi Kant Sinha, head of the state forest department.

Senior forest officials said that the panic occurred because never in the recent past had so many rhinos died within such a short span of time. A few rhinos had died in the early 1990s when there was an outbreak of anthrax at Jaldapara. Following the incidents, forest guards have been asked to remain on alert and find the carcass of any animal within 24 hours.

Anthrax is primarily a disease of herbivores. Humans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products. It is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_.

[For a description of Jaldapara National Park go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaldapara_National_Park. There is also a map at the site.

Jaldapara National Park (formerly Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary) is a national park at the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in Alipurduar District of northern West Bengal and on the banks of the Torsa River. Jaldapara is at an altitude of 61 meters [200 ft] and is spread across 216.51 square km (83.59 square miles) of vast grassland with patches of riverine forests. It was declared a sanctuary in 1941 for protection of its great variety flora and fauna. Today, it has the largest population of the Indian one horned rhinoceros in the state, an animal threatened with extinction, and is a habitat management area (Category IV). The nearby Chilapata Forest is an elephant corridor between Jaldapara and the Buxa Tiger Reserve. Nearby is the Gorumara National Park, known for its population of Indian rhinoceros.

I would not be surprised if it turns out that there were anthrax outbreaks in livestock adjoining this park or grazing within the park. If anthrax is confirmed, we should hear more of possible sources. - Mod.MHJ
