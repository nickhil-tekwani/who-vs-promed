A cholera outbreak in Yemen has killed 686 people since the start of 2019, the SABA news agency reported on Monday [24 Jun 2019], citing Houthi health ministry spokesman Youssef Hadri.

Over 418 000 cholera cases have been reported in the country since January 2019, in addition to hundreds of malaria, denge, diphtheria, meningitis, and chicken pox cases, Hadri said. The WHO said the number of suspected cholera cases between 1 Jan 2018 and 9 Jun 2019 had gone up to 759 464 in Yemen, with 1163 associated deaths.

This year's [2019's] outbreak, the 3rd major flare-up since the war began in Yemen in 2015, has affected 22 of 23 regions. Children under 5 represented a fifth of suspected cholera cases.

[The cumulative reported cholera total in Yemen from 27 Apr 2017 to 7 Jan 2018 was 1 029 717 suspected cholera cases and 2241 associated deaths. Adding in this information, in about 27 months, the total number of reported cholera cases in this war-torn country has reached about 1 790 000 with about 3300 fatalities. The calculated case fatality rate from this is quite low, strongly suggesting that many of the cases are not cholera. Even with that, the numbers reported in this continuing catastrophe are difficult to wrap one's head around. - Mod.LL
