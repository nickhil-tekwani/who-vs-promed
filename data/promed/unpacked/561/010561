Harmony Chai of Eastsound, Washington, is voluntarily recalling its Concentrated Black Spiced Chai and Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai because it may not be properly processed. Although Harmony Chai has received no complaints of illness related to the consumption of the recalled product, there is a potential hazard that can occur when tea beverages are inadequately processed. These batches have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled. Illness due to foodborne botulism is extremely rare. According to Washington State Department of Health, during the last 10 years, Communicable Disease Epidemiology (CDE) has received 0-2 reports of foodborne botulism each year.

All lots of the following products have been recalled:
- concentrated Black Spiced Chai bottled in 22 oz (650 mL) amber glass UPC 0510501311 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301
- decaffeinated Rooibos Chai bottled in 22 oz (624.25 mL) amber glass UPC 9450402431 and 64 oz (1892.7 mL) amber glass jugs UPC 0510501301

Concentrated Black Spiced Chai and Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai were distributed through farmers markets, grocery stores, and cafes in Western Washington. Areas of distribution include the San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish, and King Counties.

It was discovered through Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) testing of routine samples that the tea was not properly processed. Harmony Chai and WSDA are working together to determine the cause of this problem. Harmony Chai has not had any reported illnesses to date but consumers who have purchased Harmony Chai Concentrated Black Spiced Chai or Decaffeinated Rooibos Chai recently are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

It should be noted that the FDA has recently approved the 1st heptavalent equine derived botulinum antiserum for the treatment of botulism disease http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm. - Mod.LL
