The [Costa Rica] National Animal Health Service (SENASA) has reported an outbreak of bovine rabies in Legua in Aserri [canton, San Jose province] with 5 animals dead. The service has set up the necessary sanitary response and animal quarantine.

At the same time they have initiated a vampire bat capture with the intention of reducing the local bat population. This animal is the major transmitter of rabies in Costa Rica.

The SENASA staff plan to vaccinate the cattle, horses, and dogs on the affected farm and on the neighbouring farms.

Vampire bats come out of the woods where they normally live and feed off the wildlife there when someone has the bright idea of harvesting timber. It will be quiet for a period and then the local ranchers will begin to report cattle deaths, such as this. - Mod.MHJ]
