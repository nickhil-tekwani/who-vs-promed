_Escherichia coli_ O157 cluster in Scotland
-------------------------------------------
A cluster of cases of _Escherichia coli_ O157 PT21/28 VT2 has been
identified, which is linked with the village of Applecross, Wester Ross on
the west coast of Scotland.
Six cases, including two from England, one from mainland Europe, and three
from Scotland, have been associated with premises with private water
supplies, and _E. coli_ O157 has been isolated from two different water
sources. Local control measures have included advice to boil water and the
provision of mains supplies, where possible.
This is an area with a large tourist population and those affected were
visitors. No additional cases have been identified in Europe through
Enter-net or in the United Kingdom through Epi-net.
