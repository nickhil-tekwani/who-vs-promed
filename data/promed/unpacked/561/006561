China's Ministry of Agriculture reported on [Mon 30 Oct 2017] a case of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in a pig breeding farm in southern Guangdong province.

The O-type strain of the disease was found in 30 pigs on a farm in Huizhou city last week, the ministry said, leading to the cull of 71 pigs to bring the disease under control.

Another case of the disease was found in Guangdong earlier this year [2017].

China is the world's top producer and consumer of pork.

[China belongs to FMD Pool 1, which includes 13 countries/territories in Southeast Asia/ Central Asia/ East Asia; there are 6 other pools, globally.

The conjectured circulating FMD serotype O viral lineages in Pool 1 during 2016 were, reportedly, O/SEA/Mya-98, O/ME-SA/PanAsia, O/CATHAY and (newly introduced) O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d; see maps 1 (page 4) and 3 (page 9) in the FAO/EC/EUFMD "Global FMD Situation" report for September 2017 (published 30 Oct 2017), at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/Sept2017.pdf.

Subscribers are referred to the following comments, by the guest editor of the monthly report, Dr. Donald King (WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK):

"During the past 3 months, we have continued to monitor the spread of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d lineage that has emerged from the Indian sub-continent (Pool 2), to cause field outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia (Pool 1) as well as Gulf States of the Middle East and North Africa. FMD virus sequences recently provided from the FMD Reference Laboratory in Russia (FGBI-ARRIAH) demonstrate that the range of this lineage has further expanded into Sukhbaatar Province in the eastern part of Mongolia. In view of the rapid spread of O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d lineage elsewhere in East Asia (reported during 2016/17 for the 1st time in Eastern Russia, China and South Korea), these latest reports are not completely unexpected. However, additional new FMDV sequence data from Bayan-Ulgii Province in the most westerly part of Mongolia (recently submitted by NIAH, Japan) indicates that this viral lineage has been present in the country since 2015 - prior to the reports of FMD cases in neighbouring countries. These observations raise obvious questions about the extent to which the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d lineage is currently distributed in East Asia, and routes by which FMD is transmitted between countries in the region".

It will be interesting to obtain the genotyping results of the current outbreak in pigs in southern Guangdong.

The 2017 Global Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Research Alliance (GFRA) Scientific Meeting has taken place in Incheon, South Korea, during 25-27 Oct 2017. The meeting's agenda included, among others, the papers "Current FMD Status in South-East Asia" (Qui, Yu) and "Recent Progress in Prevention and Control of FMD in Large Scale Livestock Farms in China"(Wei, Xuefeng). The proceedings of this important meeting are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
