The number of malaria cases in Bikaner's Sardar Patel Medical College
hit record levels with around 1400 patients being admitted to the
hospital in the last fortnight with 6 deaths.

In September 2011, the average weekly number of patients detected with
the disease was around 400 cases. "So far, the number of deaths in the
district has touched 22 since January 2011, while 60 per cent of them
were reported in the last 3 months alone," said a health department
official.

Reacting to the alarming rise of cases, department officials said the
surge is mainly because of cases coming from other districts.
"Patients from Nagaur, Churu, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and even from
some parts of Jaisalmer and Jodhpur are coming to Bikaner for
treatment, and this has increased the number," deputy chief medical
and health officer (Bikaner) Dr Devendra Choudhary said.

Moreover, the officials said that each year after the rainfall, the
number of malaria patients increases. "This is the period when the
cases increase," the official said.

The cases of malaria _Plasmodium falciparum_ (Pf), which is fatal, are
also on the rise. So far, 6 patients have died due to this form the
disease in the district, while 16 patients have died when they were
admitted to the hospital in a complicated situation with _Plasmodium
vivax_ (Pv) malaria, a health department official said.

Also, in Jaipur, the official death toll due to dengue is one person,
who died some 10 days ago. Also, the officials claimed that the number
of dengue cases have declined this year [2011] in comparison to last
year. "This year, the number of dengue cases so far is 52, while in
the corresponding period last year, the figure was 103. But to the
contrary, the malaria patients increased. Malaria Pf cases are 56, and
Pv cases are 1103, while last year [2010], it was 53 and 638
respectively," he said.

[The latest map of malaria in India is provided in the World Malaria
Report 2009
(http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/2009/mal2009_ind_en.pdf).
Here, Rajasthan has a malaria annual incidence rate of between 1 and
100 cases per 1000 population.

An article in the New Scientist (2010) estimates that the number of
malaria cases officially reported by the Indian authorities is 10
times lower than the real number. The article also provides a map of
malaria in India
(http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn19619/dn19619-1_1070.jpg)
in which the risk of death due to malaria increases towards the border
with Pakistan.

ProMED-mail has previously commented on the malaria situation in
Pakistan, where malaria seems to be increasing, and this could also
spread over the border into India.
