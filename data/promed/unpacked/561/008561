[The 3 named locations are in mid-northern Israel: Zalafeh and Adirim in the valley of Yezreel (Megido area), Sharona in Lower Galilee.

We are informed that the current outbreak in Sharona involves a lamb fattening unit; the lambs were imported.

Israel's recent PPR epizootic started 17 Nov 2018, affecting a dairy sheep and goat farm in Sharona (Lower Galilee), which included 1420 sheep and 120 goats. Among the sheep, 460 clinical cases were recorded (morbidity rate 32.4%), of which 40 died (case fatality rate 8.7%). The goats remained apparently (and surprisingly) unaffected. The outbreak was reported to the OIE on 22 Nov 2018) as "continuing;" for the report and additional comments, including the history of PPR in Israel and a map, see 20181123.6161411. No follow-up reports have been submitted since.

According to complementary information [Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Services, head veterinarian's weekly report no. 03/2019 dated Sat 19 Jan 2019], PPR has been recently spreading, particularly in northern Israel. Some cases were observed in imported lambs, when introduced into local lamb-fattening units. Other affected flocks were not properly vaccinated.

All imports of lambs to Israel originate in PPR-free countries. It will be interesting to note whether such animals undergo PPR vaccination during their stay in the Zofar quarantine station prior to their introduction into local farms, countrywide.

Notably, on 1 Jul 2016, Israel's State Veterinary Services and Animal Health published the discontinuation of compulsory, state-organized PPR vaccinations, declaring further vaccinations as privatized and voluntary. - Mod.AS
