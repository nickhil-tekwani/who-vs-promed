Some 420 people have been poisoned, 2 fatally, in Ha Giang Province
after eating anthrax-infected beef late last month [June 2008],
according to a local health center.

The provinces' Preventive Health Center said the infected people
belonged to nearly 90 families in Po Qua Hamlet of Meo Vac District.

On [21 Jun 2008], 2 families in the hamlet shared beef with the
affected families from their 2 cows, which died of unknown causes.
Those eating the meat started vomiting, complained of stomachache and
suffered from swollen legs. Two died on [29 Jun 2008] after being
hospitalized in a coma. Three others in critical condition are
undergoing treatment at Meo Vac Hospital.

Local health authorities said anthrax has broken out in the district
and they are mobilizing resources to contain the disease. The number
of affected animals is not known. They also warned residents against
eating meat from infected animals.

Anthrax is a highly infectious bacterial disease affecting mammals,
especially cattle and sheep. It is transmissible to humans and can
cause skin ulcers, pneumonia and even death.

[More information from knowledgeable sources on the current situation
regarding the anthrax outbreak in Viet Nam would be highly appreciated.

For a background on anthrax, the following information was excerpted
from the Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases
(DFBMD) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website,
which can be accessed at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/anthrax_gi.html>.

Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by _Bacillus
anthracis_. Wild and domestic lower vertebrates such as cattle,
sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores are the most
commonly infected, while it can also occur in human if exposed to
infected animals or their products.

Anthrax infection includes the 3 forms of cutaneous, inhalation and
intestinal. Cutaneous anthrax infections, which comprise about 95
percent of infections, can occur when the bacterial spore enters a
cut or abrasion on the skin. The symptoms manifest progressively as a
raised itchy bump, vesicle, a painless ulcer with a characteristic
black central necrosis and edema or swelling of the surrounding
tissues. About 20 percent of untreated cases of cutaneous anthrax
will result in death.

Inhalational anthrax infection begins with symptoms that resemble a
common cold. Later, it progresses to severe breathing problems and
shock. It is usually fatal in 45 percent of cases, even with
aggressive antibiotics and supportive therapy.

Intestinal anthrax can be transmitted by the consumption of
contaminated meat. Its symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite,
vomiting, and fever followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood,
severe diarrhea, lesions and soreness in the throat, difficulty
swallowing, marked swelling of the neck and regional lymph glands.
Intestinal anthrax results in death in 25 percent to 60 percent of cases.

Anthrax vaccines are available for both animals and humans. As
preventive measures, humans should avoid contact with livestock and
animal products and avoid eating meat that has not been properly
slaughtered and cooked.

[Anthrax is normally just sporadic in Viet Nam with most years
without any reported outbreaks. The commonest affected species is
working buffaloes, which carries a high cost for small farmers and in
the northern mountain areas where the government says that livestock
are not vaccinated. Human cases are reported erratically. For example
reports of cattle outbreaks for 2000 (0), 2001 (0), 2002 (2), 2003
(1), 2004 (1), 2005 (7 outbreaks with species affected not defined
but 15 cattle deaths), 2006 (0), 2007 (0); buffalo in 2000 (2), 2001
(1), 2002 (1), 2003 (1), 2004 (6), 2005 (+ but 5 deaths reported),
2006 (0), 2007 (3); sheep & goats 2002 (at least one outbreak with 85
goats dead), 2004 (1) and zero outbreaks in other years; horse
outbreaks 2004 (1) with zero in other years; and for swine 2
outbreaks in 2002 and 2 deaths reported in 2005, otherwise zero. - Mod.MHJ]
