The death toll in the recent spate of encephalitis [in Gorakhpur district, Uttar Pradesh] rose to 147 when 3 more children died of the dreaded disease during the past 24 hours.

An official said all the deaths are reported from BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur. "Of the 3 fresh deaths -- one each from Basti and Gorakhpur, one from adjoining Bihar state," official sources said. All the dead were children in the age group of 5-15 years, the official in Gorakhpur said.

Baba Raghav Das Medical College Superintendent NN Shukla said, "Since January [2015], 693 children suffering from encephalitis were admitted to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College [in Gorakhpur], of which 147 died." Patients admitted to the hospital who were suffering from encephalitis belonged to the districts of Gorakhpur, Deoria, Gonda, Basti, Sidharthnagar, Sankabrinagar, Kushinagar, Balrampur, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, while some patients came from Nepal and Bihar.

The area is endemic for Japanese encephalitis but in the past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear. One possibility is that the water-borne virus was present in contaminated water, doctors said.

The diseases cause headache and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizures, and inflammations of the heart and kidney.

Doctors say children between the age of 6 months-15 years are the worst affected and most of the victims are poor people from rural areas.

With this disease taking epidemic propositions every year, Convener of the National Encephalitis Eradication Program (NEEP) RN Singh has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to declare encephalitis eradication programme as national programme. "The need of the hour is to make encephalitis eradication programme a national programme.

The issue has been raised more than 20 times in the Lok Sabha by MP from Gorakhpur Yogi Aditanath. "A National Programme for Prevention and Control of Encephalitis was made twice -- first in 2011 and then in 2014. But it is very unfortunate that it is yet to come out of the drawing board," he wrote in his letter, which was released to the media today. He said, "The disease is 100 per cent preventable but does not have any specific treatment. Till now, government's major stress has been on the treatment only, but what is important is that the government should look after the prevention part too."

"Many countries where it was a major problem have almost eradicated it. Some decades back, countries like China, Japan, and Korea were ravaged by encephalitis. Now these countries are encephalitis-free. If these countries can do it, so can we," he said. The disease is predictable and preventable. The annual monsoon fills parched paddy fields, which bear the mosquitoes that spread Japanese encephalitis from pigs to humans, devastating malnourished children with low immunity.

Another strain of the disease acute encephalitis syndrome spreads through contaminated water. Residents defecate in the fields, contaminating the ground water.

A vaccine has long been available, but the disease killed more than 1500 children in 2005 and 431 in 2006. In 2006, a vaccination drive was launched. The government vowed to immunise every child in the worst-affected areas and to launch a massive drive to improve sanitation. For a couple of years, the numbers dropped also.

[Outbreaks of encephalitis occur regularly in north eastern India, where these cases occurred. Before an effective prevention program can be launched, it is necessary to know the etiologies responsible for these cases. Japanese encephalitis virus is responsible for some, but not all cases. Many reports associate contaminated water, presumably carrying enteroviruses, with these outbreaks.

Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES (acute encephalitis syndrome). Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved (under publication). A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. It has been proposed that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine. Until the etiological agents responsible for the cases are definitively identified, these unfortunate cases will continue.
