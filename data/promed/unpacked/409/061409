Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in a traveler visiting Zambia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) wishes to report a case of African
trypanosomiasis due to _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ in a traveler
who returned from Zambia in August [2010].

The diagnosis was proven by peripheral blood film and there was no
involvement of the central nervous system. The patient was treated
with suramin and has recovered.

Dr Devon Hale of the Salt Lake City (UTH) GeoSentinel Site reports
that the US traveler was on a hunting safari in a reserve in the
South Luangwa river valley in Eastern [province] Zambia just south of
the South Luangwa National Park. Of note, another case of
travel-related trypanosomiasis was reported in August [2010] in the
monthly bulletin of the South African National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (Communicable Diseases Communique
<http://www.nicd.ac.za>). That case was diagnosed in a Zambian
national living in southeastern Zambia and who had experienced
multiple tsetse fly bites on visits to his game ranch also in the
South Luangwa valley.

The last published case of travel-related trypanosomiasis from Zambia
was one acquired in the 1990s [Emerg Infect Dis. 2002 Jan; 8(1): 74-6
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol8no1/01-0130.htm>] and an enquiry
to the US CDC indicated that the last case in an American traveler
returned home from Zambia was in 1986. These 2 cases in close
temporal proximity may represent sentinel events for increased focal
activity in the South Luangwa valley, a known endemic area, or may
represent increased incursions by hunters and travelers into the
sparsely populated area.

Although most travel related cases of _T. brucei rhodesiense_ in
recent years have been acquired in Tanzania this is likely related to
the large numbers of photo safari tourists to Tanzania. The South
Luangwa valley sees more specialized tourism but may represent a
focus of risk that would be meaningful to the individual traveler.

We would be interested in hearing of any further recent cases from Zambia.

[Tsetse (_Glossina morsitans_) is widespread in most of Eastern and
Northern Zambia (see FAO map of distribution at
<http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAInfo/programmes/en/paat/documents/maps/pdf/SouthernAfrica/SouthA_morsV.pdf>
and _Trypanosoma_ has a reservoir in wild game, for instance
buffaloes. It is therefore not surprising that a hunter in close
contact with game in an area with tsetse flies becomes infected.
ProMED thanks Drs. Freedman and Hale for submitting this report. -
