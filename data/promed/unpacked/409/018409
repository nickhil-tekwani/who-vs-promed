Russia: 2 Cases of Rabid Fox Attack in Republic of Baskiria
-----------------------------------------------
In July 2006, 2 incidents of attack by rabid wild animals have been
reported in the Republic of Baskiria (now Bashkortostan). In one incident,
a rabid fox entered a house in one of the settlements in the
Karmaskalinskiy district and attacked a 3-year-old child. The child's
mother, who had rushed to protect her son, was also bitten. The results of
an examination confirmed that the fox was rabid.
In a 2nd incident that occurred last week in the Mechetlinskiy district, a
rabid fox bit 2 people (a man and woman) in the courtyard of their house.
In both incidents, the injured individuals were sent to the hospital
without delay and received timely post-exposure treatment and are
considered now to be out of danger.
In total, since the beginning of 2006, rabid wild animals have been
reported in 27 settlements in the Republic, whereas during the same period
last year [2005], they were reported in 205.
