As part of an ongoing investigation into an anthrax case in the Scottish
Borders, NHS Borders, Health Protection Scotland and the Health Protection
Agency have continued to work together. Some interim investigation results
have been received which confirmed that minute quantities of anthrax spores
had been detected in materials examined by the Health Protection Agency.
The items concerned were 3 drums and 2 imported animal skins used in the
making of African drums. All were recovered from a site in Northumberland.
The implications of these findings will be actively considered in an
investigation that is ongoing concerning a property in Scotland where the
anthrax case lived (Black Lodge, Stobs).
Discussions with leading UK experts regarding these findings have concluded
that the risk of being exposed to anthrax spores through drumming alone or
merely handling these drums is extremely low. For that reason we are not
advising antibiotics for those people who attended any drumming classes or
workshops where these drums were used. Also expert advice is clear that
there is no increased risk of anthrax to the general public as a result of
these findings. Current owners of drums or hides do not need to take any
action.
All persons who have been in contact with these drums and skins have been
contacted and provided with appropriate personal information. Helplines are
also available should members of the public wish to talk through any health
issues relating to anthrax and drumming. If calling from England the
helpline number is 0845 46 47. If calling from Scotland the helpline number
is 08000 28 28 16. General advice concerning anthrax, drums, and animal
skins can be obtained from:

Further results including those samples removed from Black Lodge are
awaited. The completed set of results will assist the investigation team to
draw conclusions about the source of the anthrax in this case and assess
requirements for decontamination.

[If "minute quantities of anthrax spores had been detected" is correct and
in some way reflects the true level of exposure of the 50 year old man who
died, one must therefore ask what host characteristics made this a lethal
dose in this instance. - Mod.MHJ]
