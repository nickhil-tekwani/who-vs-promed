I would like to comment on the Dr. Wilde's recent statement about _Vibrio
vulnificus_ being common in SE Asia and Mr. Hugh-Jones statement that its
range may spread due to global warming. It is interesting to consider how
this spread may be accomplished. My guess is that _Vibrio vulnificus_ range
has waxed and waned as global temperatures have fluctuated over time. The
extent of these ephemeral increases in range has probably increased in more
recent time as commercial shipping has expanded.
The bilge water of large ships are thought to be linked to the spread of
other exotic species (zebra mussels) and other _Vibrio_ species (V.
cholerae_), so why not _V. vulnificus_.
