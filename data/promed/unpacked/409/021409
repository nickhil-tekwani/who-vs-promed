Zientara S, Sailleau C, Bréard E. Trans-placentary infections with FCO serotype 8 virus in cows
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since mid-December 2018, cases of calves born blind, puny and dying in a few days have been reported in different departments in continental France. Since January 2019, the number of reported cases has increased considerably. According to analyses carried out in departmental laboratories (positive PCR on calf blood samples) and in the Maisons-Alfort animal health laboratory of the LNR-ANSES [Laboratoire nationale de référence - Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail] (positive PCR in the blood and calves' spleen), it is very likely these clinical signs are attributable to bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8).

Indeed, the LNR tested 3 brains of these calves which proved to be negative for the Schmallenberg virus [SBV], another possible cause of this type of clinical manifestation (additional tests would enhance the significance of SBV exclusion). The detection of PCR-positive calves, less than one week old and born during the vector inactivity season, suggests that they were infected in utero. It appears that in affected farms, 2% to 15% of newborn calves were infected. Investigations are under way to study this phenomenon more precisely, in partnership with local services. As of [Mon 11 Mar 2019], the LNR has received and analysed 418 blood samples from such calves (94% were serotype 8 RT-PCR positive).

[The above scientific report complements the information received earlier from several of France's departments, reporting numerous cases of calves born blind and dying within a few days since mid-December 2018. These cases would have started to appear concomitantly in mid-December [2018]. On affected farms, 2%-15% of the newborn calves were affected [20190214.6316637]. Information on gross and/or histopathological CNS changes would be helpful.

Congenital CNS changes in progeny of BTV-8 infected dams were reported during the major event in western Europe, 2006-2008 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01034.x). Such congenital malformations are not common in relation to field strains of other BTV serotypes, though sporadically documented. There were several reports of serious, plural congenital malformations in lambs born to sheep which had been vaccinated during pregnancy with live attenuated BT vaccines.

It would be interesting to note if similar cases have been observed recently in cattle offspring in other countries which have been experiencing BTV-8 circulation and infection, such as Switzerland and Germany. - Mod.AS]

Two cases of bluetongue also known as bluetongue disease have been discovered in a beef cattle operation near Paliseul, and confirmed on [Wed morning 6 Mar 2019]. The 1st case was discovered 3 to 4 weeks ago during a winter check on some animals on the farm. This was followed by a 2nd check on the whole herd, which revealed a 2nd [BTV-positive] case. At this stage, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain [FASFC] does not want to be alarmist and does not relate to a disease focus but of 2 isolated cases that would not be contagious by contact. No special restriction measures for animal movements have been applied, but the veterinarians of the region received this Wed 6 Mar 2019] morning a letter from the requesting all cattle, sheep and goats holdings, within a radius of 5 km [approx. 3mi] around the involved farm, to undergo a blood test.

This viral disease [bluetongue], transmitted by biting midges, affects ruminants and mainly sheep, but it is also present in cattle as [suspected] in the current case. A veterinarian in the region whom we have contacted was surprised to note just 2 odd cases within the entire herd. Since the virus circulates, normally, only when temperatures exceed 15 deg C [about 60 deg F], it was assumed that the positive test was vaccine-related.

[No official confirmation of the described suspicions could be found. Hopefully, the anticipated results of the complementary investigations and tests will exclude a recent (BTV-8?) circulation in Belgium. - Mod.AS
