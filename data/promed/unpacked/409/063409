[2] Diagnostic tests for pregnant women

Rosinger AY, Olson SM, Ellington SR, Perez-Padilla J, Simeone RM, Pedati CS, et al. Evaluating Differences in Whole Blood, Serum, and Urine Screening Tests for Zika Virus, Puerto Rico, USA, 2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2021;27(5):1505-1508. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2705.203960

Abstract
We evaluated nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for Zika virus on whole-blood specimens compared with NAAT on serum and urine specimens among asymptomatic pregnant women during the 2015-2016 Puerto Rico Zika outbreak. Using NAAT, more infections were detected in serum and urine than in whole blood specimens.

[Methods]
At collection, specimens were refrigerated at 4 C, transported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; San Juan, PR, USA) within 12 hours of collection, and stored according to Food and Drug Administration and CDC guidelines (13). For each specimen, 200 uL was tested by the Trioplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), by using previously described methods (13,14), including primer pairs specific to ZIKV, DENV, and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). According to surveillance systems in Puerto Rico, DENV and CHIKV circulation were minimal, and no confirmed cases were reported during the study period.

CDC (Fort Collins, CO, USA) performed quality-control testing by singleplex NAAT (13,14) on all ZIKV-positive specimens. In addition, whole-blood specimens were tested by the Hologic Aptima assay (Hologic, https://www.hologic.com External Link) at Vitalant Research Institute (San Francisco, CA, USA) (8). Because results of quality-control testing were consistent and did not change findings, we report Trioplex assay results only.

We also tested serum specimens by the Zika virus IgM capture ELISA (Zika MAC-ELISA) (15). We used a positive-to-negative optical density ratio of over 3 to determine sample positivity, suggesting previous ZIKV infection (15).

[Conclusions]
This study provides information about laboratory testing to maximize detection of ZIKV infection among asymptomatic pregnant women. In this small sample of ZIKV NAAT-positive asymptomatic pregnant women, no additional ZIKV-positive cases were identified by whole-blood NAAT beyond those identified through tests of other samples. This finding contrasts with other studies that note prolonged detection, higher viral load, and greater sensitivity of whole-blood NAAT versus NAAT on other specimens (6,8-10). Unlike previous studies that tested mostly symptomatic persons (6,10,11), we restricted our analysis to asymptomatic pregnant women.

All asymptomatic ZIKV-positive women had detectable ZIKV in NAAT of urine or serum samples in our study. Although previous studies detected ZIKV RNA in urine more frequently than in serum (5,7), we found that ZIKV RNA was detected in serum more frequently than in urine; 64% (18/28) tested positive by serum NAAT and negative by urine NAAT. However, serum and urine NAAT together are critical because urine alone identified only 21% (6/28) of pregnant women with a positive NAAT result.

This large study comparing NAAT for ZIKV on serum, urine, and whole-blood specimens is unique in that the study population is among asymptomatic pregnant women. Although studies have mentioned lack of overlap between different specimens tested by NAAT (7,10) and whole blood yielding fewer positive results in symptomatic persons (14), in this study NAAT on whole-blood specimens yielded fewer positive results than NAAT on serum or urine specimens among asymptomatic pregnant women. Because ZIKV-associated birth defects have been noted among asymptomatic pregnant women (1), identification of ZIKV infection is critical, especially when the virus is circulating in a community. Timely identification enables appropriate counseling and clinical management.

Our detection of acute ZIKV infections by NAAT is likely low because the study occurred 2-3 months after the peak of the Puerto Rico outbreak (12), and false-negative results in pregnant women are possible (11). Further, ZIKV RNA-positive results have been reported days or months after symptom onset or 1st positive test (6,9), and other cases were reported in Puerto Rico during the study period. Our analysis was among asymptomatic pregnant women, and we could not determine infection onset or whether infection occurred at all. False-positive results were also possible, but samples tested by singleplex NAAT revealed similar results, and results were independently validated in multiple laboratories.

These findings support CDC guidance to perform NAAT on asymptomatic pregnant women during outbreaks when ZIKV is widely circulating (3,4). Identification of infections among pregnant women who reside in or travel to areas at risk for ZIKV infection is critical for prenatal and postnatal counseling and clinical management (2,4). Although our understanding of viral persistence in various specimens is growing and the percentage positive in this study was small, NAAT of urine contributed to additional diagnoses, and NAAT on serum and urine combined yielded more positive results compared with whole-blood testing among asymptomatic pregnant women. Timely and accurate prenatal screening and notification of infection can optimize pregnancy and infant care during Zika outbreaks.

Abstract
Zika virus diagnostic testing and laboratory research increased considerably when Zika virus began spreading through the Americas in 2015, increasing the risk for potential Zika virus exposure of laboratory workers and biomedical researchers. We report 4 cases of laboratory-associated Zika virus disease in the United States during 2016-2019. Of these, 2 were associated with needlestick injuries; for the other 2 cases, the route of transmission was undetermined. In laboratories in which work with Zika virus is performed, good laboratory biosafety practices must be implemented and practiced to reduce the risk for infection among laboratory personnel.

[Diagnostic laboratories supporting clinical practice during the Zika outbreak were doubtless under extreme time pressure in dealing with a large workload. This kind of pressure can lead to haste and accidents. The fact of 2 cases of non-needle stick acquisition of Zika virus infection underscores the need for good laboratory practice when dealing with clinical specimens that contain the virus. - Mod.TY]

[4] No longer transfusion relevant

Information for Blood Establishments Regarding FDA's Determination that Zika Virus is no Longer a Relevant Transfusion-Transmitted Infection, and Withdrawal of Guidance titled "Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Zika Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Components"
-----------------------------------------
FDA requires blood establishments to test blood donations for new or emerging infectious agents that may affect blood product safety if certain conditions outlined in FDA regulations are met. Specifically, if a transfusion-transmitted infection "may have sufficient incidence and/or prevalence to affect the potential donor population" and meets certain other criteria described in FDA's regulations, then FDA may determine the transfusion-transmitted infection is a "relevant transfusion-transmitted infection" (RTTI). Testing for an RTTI is required under FDA's regulations if FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared screening tests are available and testing is necessary to reduce adequately and appropriately the risk of transmission.

FDA has determined Zika virus (ZIKV) is no longer an RTTI under FDA's regulations because, as discussed further below, the available evidence demonstrates that ZIKV no longer has sufficient incidence and/or prevalence to affect the potential donor population. Accordingly, FDA withdrew the guidance titled, "Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Zika Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Components," dated July 2018. Because ZIKV is no longer an RTTI, blood establishments may discontinue testing for ZIKV. Licensed blood establishments that discontinue testing blood donations for ZIKV must report this change to FDA in the annual report under 21 CFR 601.12(d), noting the date testing was discontinued. Corresponding changes to the circular of information must also be reported in the annual report under 21 CFR 601.12(d).

Ref: Aubry, F., Jacobs, S., Darmuzey, M. et al. Recent African strains of Zika virus display higher transmissibility and fetal pathogenicity than Asian strains
-------------------------
Abstract
The global emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) revealed the unprecedented ability for a mosquito-borne virus to cause congenital birth defects. A puzzling aspect of ZIKV emergence is that all human outbreaks and birth defects to date have been exclusively associated with the Asian ZIKV lineage, despite a growing body of laboratory evidence pointing towards higher transmissibility and pathogenicity of the African ZIKV lineage. Whether this apparent paradox reflects the use of relatively old African ZIKV strains in most laboratory studies is unclear. Here, we experimentally compare 7 low-passage ZIKV strains representing the recently circulating viral genetic diversity. We find that recent African ZIKV strains display higher transmissibility in [wild type _Aedes aegypti_] mosquitoes and higher lethality in both adult and fetal mice than their Asian counterparts. We emphasize the high epidemic potential of African ZIKV strains and suggest that they could more easily go unnoticed by public health surveillance systems than Asian strains due to their propensity to cause fetal loss rather than birth defects.

[Increased surveillance in Africa where local strains of Zika virus are circulating would be necessary to determine whether fetal loss in humans occurs as it did in experimentally infected mice. A major prospective study, with supporting laboratory participation, following pregnant women over their pregnancy would be necessary to determine whether Zika virus infection is causing fetal malformations and death. - Mod.TY]

Htay-Htay Han, MD, Prof Clemente Diaz, MD, Camilo J Acosta, MD, Mengya Liu, PhD, Astrid Borkowski, MD. Safety and immunogenicity of a purified inactivated Zika virus vaccine candidate in healthy adults: an observer-blind, randomised, phase 1 trial
--------------------------------------
Summary

Background
Zika virus, a flavivirus transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, is associated with cases of congenital malformations and neurological complications. Absence of specific treatment makes a prophylactic Zika virus vaccine an unmet medical need. We assessed safety and immunogenicity of 3 doses of a purified, inactivated, Zika virus vaccine candidate in healthy flavivirus-naive and flavivirus-primed adults.

Methods
This 2-part, multicentre, observer-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial was done at 7 medical clinics in the [mainland] USA and 2 in Puerto Rico. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged 18-49 years. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using a sponsor-supplied randomisation scheme, to 4 groups to receive 2 intramuscular injections, 28 days apart, of saline placebo or TAK-426 containing 2 ug, 5 ug, or 10 ug antigen. Participants, investigators, and vaccine administrating personnel were masked to group assignment. Part 1 of the study assessed flavivirus-naive participants and part 2 assessed flavivirus-primed participants. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity based on solicited local reactions and solicited systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose; unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events in the 28 days after each dose; and geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising anti-Zika virus antibodies at 28 days after the 2nd dose. Safety assessments were done in all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine. Immunogenicity assessments were in the per-protocol set, comprising all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine and provided valid serology results at baseline and at least one post-vaccination timepoint, with no major protocol violations. The trial is ongoing and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03343626).

Findings
Between 13 Nov 2017, and 24 Oct 2018, 894 volunteers were screened and 271 enrolled (125 flavivirus-naive and 146 flavivirus-primed participants). All TAK-426 doses were well tolerated with no deaths, no vaccine-related serious adverse events, and similar rates of mainly mild to moderate adverse events. TAK-426 elicited dose-dependent increases in antibody GMTs in both flavivirus-naive and flavivirus-primed participants. 28 days after dose 2, plaque-reduction neutralisation test GMTs in flavivirus-naive participants were 1130 (95% CI 749-1703) in the 2 ug TAK-426 group, 1992 (1401-2833) in the 5 ug TAK-426 group, and 3690 (2677-5086) in the 10 ug TAK-426 group. In pairwise comparisons, responses after two vaccinations in the 10 ug group were significantly greater than in the 2 ug group (GMT ratio 3·27 [95% CI 1·98-5·39], p less than 0·0001) and the 5 ug group (GMT ratio 1·85 [1·15-2·98], p=0·012).

Interpretation
TAK-426 was well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile, and was immunogenic in both flavivirus-naive and flavivirus-primed adults. Based on the safety and immunogenicity profiles of all TAK-426 doses assessed, the 10 ug TAK-426 dose was selected for further clinical development.

[Zika virus vaccines are being developed. Recently, Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, was promising, but the study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population (see Zika virus (02): Americas, Africa, research, observations 20210420.8317043). Neither of these 2 vaccines has undergone phase 3 trials. As noted earlier, conducting an extensive phase 3 trial of the vaccine will be difficult to accomplish without an ongoing outbreak in which to test it. Without a successful phase 3 trial, governmental health authorities are unlikely to approve its use. Not only would an approved vaccine be helpful in the face of an outbreak, but it would also be of significant value for travelers going to areas where there is a risk of virus transmission, especially for pregnant women and their partners concerned about the possibility of teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. Zika virus has not disappeared, and concern about infection may continue to have adverse effects on tourism to areas where it has been a problem in the recent past, especially in the Americas. - Mod.TY]
