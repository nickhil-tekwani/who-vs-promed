One might argue too that with the development of typhus in Rwanda last year
there is an even greater need for DDT, which has low mammalian toxicity,
which is poorly absorbed dermally, and which can be applied directly to
humans with low risk of acute intoxication. If I remember correctly, an
outbreak of typhus in the closing years of WWII was averted (for the first
time following a major conflict) by dusting body and hair of much of the
Italian population with DDT to eliminate lice. DDT is a good public health
pesticide with, unfortunately, a major potential for ecological damage.
Prescribed use would be of great value for more than malaria.
