New strain of influenza isolated in the United States.
A strain of influenza virus (A/Sydney/05/97, like [H3N2) similar to but
antigenically distinguishable from the H3N2 strain incorporated in the
influenza vaccine recommended for 1997/98, has been identified during an
outbreak among passengers and crew on consecutive voyages on the same
cruise ship between New York and Montreal (1). Thirty-nine (2.7 %) of the
1445 passengers and three (0.5%) of the crew presented with acute febrile
respiratory illness on a cruise that left New York on 31 August 1997 and
arrived in Montreal on 10 September. Nine passengers were referred to
hospital on disembarkation. Nineteen (1.3 %) new passengers and 17 (2.7%)
crew presented with influenza-like illness on the return voyage from 11 to
20 September. Thirteen isolates were later characterised by the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as influenza A/Sydney/05/97-like
(H3N2).
The outbreak was investigated and control measures were implemented by
public health officials from Health Canada and the CDC who boarded the ship
on 15 September. Ill crew members were confined to their cabins and given
the antiviral drug rimantadine, all healthy crew members were given
rimantadine prophylaxis for 14 days, and all vaccinated against influenza.
All healthy passengers were offered rimantadine prophylaxis. No new cases
of influenza-like illness were detected during the next cruise.
This (A/Sydney/05/97-like [H3N2 ) antigenic variant has not yet been
detected in Africa, Europe, South America, or the continental United States
(US) and represents an antigenic drift of the virus. It is antigenically
distinguishable from A/Nanchang/993/95, which is the A(H3N2) component of
the 1997/98 influenza vaccine currently in use in the US. The
A/Nanchang/993/95 strain is very similar to the A/Wuhan/359/95(H3N2)-like
strain which the World Health Organization recommended should be a
component of trivalent vaccines for the 1997/98 season in Europe (2). The
efficacy of the 1997/98 vaccines against this variant is unknown but the
protection of this year's vaccine could be reduced if this variant
circulates widely.

influenza season and are available at:
