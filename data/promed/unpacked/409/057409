In October 2007, a school health service in Antwerp reported 8
suspected cases of measles in 2 Jewish schools in the city. The
diagnosis of measles was confirmed on saliva and nasopharyngeal
samples for 5 cases. Investigation of the cluster has been carried
out by Public Health Surveillance of Flanders, in collaboration with
the Scientific Institute of Public Health (IPH). Data have been
collected through school health services in Antwerp and by contact
tracing (questioning parents and doctors who treated the patients).
The investigation is still ongoing and information presented in this
paper is preliminary.

To date, at least 15 other clinical measles cases have been
identified in this cluster, bringing the total to 23 cases. Many more
cases are believed to have gone unreported, since measles is not a
disease with mandatory notification in Belgium, and some doctors
refused to collaborate in the investigation. Additionally, not all
ill children were taken to a doctor, especially when several children
within a family fell ill.

The cases occurred in children aged 2 to 17 years. According to the
information provided by general practitioners (GPs), 9 cases (39
percent) had received at least one dose of measles vaccine. The index
case of the cluster was thought to be a 17-year-old American studying
in the United Kingdom, who had visited Jewish relatives in Antwerp
and was diagnosed as a clinical measles case by a Belgian GP at the
time of his visit. Transmission of the virus occurred within
families, schools and neighborhoods. The virus circulating in Antwerp
(D4) has identical genotype to the strain responsible for the
outbreak in Jewish communities in the United Kingdom [1].

The investigation of this cluster led to identifying a previously
unreported cluster of at least 10 clinical measles cases in the same
Jewish communities, starting in August [2007]. Samples for
confirmation of the diagnosis and genotyping were not collected at
the time, but a link with the United Kingdom was established. Belgian
children from a Jewish community participated in a summer camp in
London for Jewish schools from Antwerp, London and Manchester. Some
English children at the camp had fever at the time. In addition, 2
Belgian children developed fever and rash upon returning home. They
spread the infection to at least 8 other children. At the time, the
diagnosis of measles was made for all the cases identified so far
(n=10), based on clinical signs, by 3 different doctors. The 10 cases
of this first cluster were aged 8 months to 12 years. All were
unvaccinated. Information on hospitalisation and complications for
both clusters is not yet available.

The age distribution for all the measles cases identified so far
since mid-August [2007] (n=33) are is presented as a figure in the
original text, as is the epidemiological curve for both clusters. The
date of onset of rash is known for 16 cases (48 percent) and
uncertain for 17 cases. The last reported case fell ill on 31 Oct
2007, although more recent cases might have been unreported.

So far, the virus has not spread to the wider community. Vaccine
coverage for the 1st dose of measles vaccine (MMR) in Antwerp is 94
percent (vaccine coverage study in children aged 18-24 months, 2005)
[2]. Separate information on measles vaccine coverage in Jewish
communities in Belgium is not available. Apparently, reasons for
non-vaccination in these communities are diverse (lack of knowledge
about vaccination, misconceptions about possible side effects, etc.).

Information on the outbreak and on the importance of vaccination will
be distributed to the Jewish communities through local papers (in
Yiddish and in Flemish), with the help of Jewish doctors, rabbis and
Jewish organisations. Letters have already been sent to general
practitioners and pediatricians in Antwerp to inform them of the
outbreak and to invite them to perform laboratory testing (on saliva)
for confirmation of the diagnosis for suspected measles cases and to
report the cases to the division of control of infectious diseases of
Public Health Surveillance of Flanders.

Notification of measles in Belgium is only mandatory within the
framework of control of infectious diseases in school medicine. A
voluntary surveillance network of 40 percent of Belgian pediatricians
also reports measles cases. It is reassuring that both sources
reported some of the cases of the 2nd (larger) cluster, which allowed
for the confirmation of the outbreak. However, collection of
information would probably be easier if notification of measles cases
was mandatory.

[This report again illustrates the the vulnerability of unvaccinated
children living in certain religious groups to measles virus
infection even in host communities with high measles vaccine uptakes.
It also records the spread of a single strain of measles from the UK
to continental Europe and to the Middle East.
