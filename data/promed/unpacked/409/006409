22 Jun 2001: RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police helicopter [officer,
presumably notices 2 dead bison in the Peace Athabasca Delta (PAD).
26 Jun 2001: RCMP officer mentions observation to a Park Warden.
27 Jun 2001: Helicopter survey of PAD -- 8 carcasses found, all bulls. 4
carcasses are sampled.
29 Jun 2001: Samples shipped to Animal Disease Research Institute
Laboratory. An aircraft survey of historical anthrax outbreak areas and
other bison ranges is performed. No carcasses are found.
30 Jun 2001: Second helicopter survey of PAD -- 2 new carcasses found, one
bull and one cow.
2 Jul 2001: Third helicopter survey of the PAD -- 4 new carcasses found,
all 4 are cows. One calf found alive beside a cow carcass.
Total dead so far: 14
Sex ratio: 9 bulls, 5 cows.
On inspection, the more recent carcasses exhibited classic "sawhorse"
appearance with bleeding from the mouth and anus. The carcasses were in
various states of decomposition. Estimated time since death ranged from 14
[or more days to less than one day. Test results are awaited.
Please note, at this time we have not received confirmation of anthrax.
Next scheduled fixed wing survey: Tue 3 Jul 2001. Next scheduled helicopter
survey: Wed 4 Jul 2001.

[This area was affected last year. If the helicopters are fitted with a
properly calibrated heat-seeking device virtually all recently dead bison
can be located under the flight path, even if under a tree canopy. Budget
constraints however can seriously limit the extent of a search thereby, at
best, leaving some uncertainty as to the reality; at worst, other deaths
elsewhere in the park will be completely missed. Thanks are due to Jonah
for keeping us informed. - Mod.MHJ
