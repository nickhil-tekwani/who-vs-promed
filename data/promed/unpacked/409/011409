Livestock producers reminded of anthrax danger
----------------------------------------------
North Dakota's state veterinarian says the state's 2nd reported case of anthrax this year [2015] is a reminder to livestock producers to take action to protect their animals from the disease, especially in areas with a past history of the disease. The case was confirmed late last Friday afternoon [4 Sep 2015] by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a local veterinary clinic.

"Anthrax has been confirmed in a Kidder County steer," said Dr. Susan Keller. "Producers should consult with their veterinarians to make sure the vaccination schedule for their animals is up to date."

The state's 1st case of anthrax this year [2015] was confirmed in June in a Grand Forks County cow [see ProMED-mail post 20150622.3457043].

Effective anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week for immunity to be established, and it must be administered annually for continued protection. Producers should monitor their herds for unexplained deaths and report them to their veterinarians.

Anthrax has been most frequently reported in northeast, southeast and south central North Dakota, but it has been found in almost every part of the state. "With the excessive precipitation we have had in some areas and drought-like conditions in others, the environment is right for the disease to occur," Keller said. A few anthrax cases are reported in North Dakota almost every year. In 2005, however, more than 500 confirmed deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1000 head. The animals impacted included cattle, bison, horses, sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk.

An anthrax factsheet is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at http://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax.

Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. The bacterial spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as heavy rainfall, flooding and drought. Animals are exposed to the disease when they graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the spores.

For more information, please call Dr. Susan Keller, Dr. Beth Carlson or Dr. Sara McReynolds at (701) 328-2655.

Kidder County is in the central part of the state; look under the "D" in the digital map. Usually outbreaks are along the eastern counties bordering Minnesota, which is where you will find Grand Forks. The State Extension Veterinarian, Charlie Stoltenow, usually runs a very proactive and energetic spring advisory to all his ranchers to get their stock vaccination. This, over the years, has succeeded in minimising the number of outbreaks, which are effectively limited to those who fail to heed his advice. I am willing to suggest that the Kidder and Grand Forks ranchers fall into this group of procrastinators. - Mod.MHJ
