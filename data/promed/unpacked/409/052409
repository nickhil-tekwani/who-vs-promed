Panama disease detected in Pakistan, Lebanon
--------------------------------------------
Following outbreaks in Jordan [ProMED-mail post 20131107.2044265] and Mozambique [ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450] just over a year ago [2013], Tropical Race 4 (TR4) has now spread to Pakistan and Lebanon. TR4 was also reported in Queensland, Australia, in March 2015 [ProMED-mail post 20150305.3208525]. These events underline once more the extent of the threat TR4 poses to global banana production.

Banana plants with suspicious symptoms of wilt from Sindh, Pakistan, were analysed at Wageningen UR (University & Research centre) [WUR, in the Netherlands], and the team concluded that TR4 has indeed reached Pakistan. Further dissemination of the disease in the country is a grave concern: the pathogen was detected in an area which is prone to flooding and neighbours India, the world's largest banana producer, with an annual production of nearly 30 million tonnes.

A similar request reached WUR from Lebanon. Despite the small affected area of just a few hectares, alert growers raised the alarm and once again, the diagnosis was TR4.

Gert Kema, WAR, said "It is unclear how the disease got to Pakistan, but we do know that it spreads very quickly. While the initial infected area was only six hectares, we have reports that over 100 hectares [247 acres] are now affected. This is more than a local issue -- it is a threat to the entire region. The appearance of the pathogen in Lebanon is most likely due to local transportation of infected plants, possibly from Jordan, which underscores the need for quarantine and awareness campaigns."

Kema and his team are currently screening large numbers of bananas for resistance to Panama disease. "There are many local varieties. Our goal is to find plants resistant to TR4 and to identify the responsible genes [to] start developing resistant bananas."

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But Tropical race 4 (TR4), which is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia, has recently also been reported for the 1st time outside that area in Jordan (ProMED-mail post 20131107.2044265) and Mozambique (ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450). In Australia, a current outbreak has now spread to the main banana growing areas (ProMED-mail post 20150305.3208525).

TR4 is of great concern worldwide and consequently development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries.
