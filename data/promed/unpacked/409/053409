DARD [Department of Agriculture and Rural Development] has confirmed that tests conducted on a malformed calf in Co [County] Down by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) have identified the presence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Another calf from the same herd, while testing negative for SBV, displayed signs consistent with those associated with the disease.

This is the 1st case of the disease detected in Northern Ireland. The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine in Dublin [Ireland] reported the 1st case in the South, in Co Cork on 30 Oct 2012.

These developments are not surprising, given the rapid spread of the virus across northern Europe and large parts of Britain since it was first identified in late 2011. All the evidence to date suggests that the virus is spread by midges. The virus can affect all ruminant species and has been particularly evident in cattle and sheep populations.

This is not a notifiable disease, and as such there are no trade restrictions in place. There are no control measures in place in any of the affected countries in the EU. There are no human health implications associated with the disease, nor any food safety implications.

Farmers planning to import animals from mainland Europe should inquire about the health history of herds of origin.

DARD is continuing to monitor developments including discussions at the European Commission.

Farmers are asked to inform their veterinary surgeon of any stillbirth, malformation or nervous disease in newborn animals or foetuses born to ruminant dams. In addition, all farmers are asked to inform their PVPs [private veterinary practitioners] about any serious malformations or nervous signs in newborn animals in their herds or flocks.

As there is uncertainty about the method of spread, good biosecurity practices should be followed, especially when dealing with imported animals. This includes the single use of needles and good disinfection procedures when dealing with products of afterbirth.

[The following comments (by Helen Roberts, Christine Middlemiss, and Nigel Gibbens) have been selected from the 'Guest Editorial' in The Veterinary Journal. October 2012; 194(1): 1-2:

"Whilst safe effective vaccines are under development, the cost to the livestock industry of vaccination against such a low impact disease is relatively high when the low per-animal profit margins in sectors such as sheep farming are considered. Good data on disease distribution and impact are important to enable farmers to make sound economic decisions based on their particular circumstances.

The level of surveillance carried out in different countries should be proportionate to the risk of the disease occurring in that country, so that the probability of detection is consistent across the globe, and gives the relevant authorities the best opportunity of early detection.

Successful disease detection is currently much more likely in developed countries, which have well-structured surveillance capabilities. Surveillance in the rest of the world is improving through international collaboration and funding and this effort needs to be maintained if we are to respond adequately to the threat posed by pathogens such as SBV.

The rapid dissemination of peer-reviewed data relating to emerging diseases through scientific journals plays a critical role, along with consideration of the economic and social impacts, in the development of appropriate, evidence-based responses by state veterinary and other services."
