At least 9 cases of Chagas disease were reported in the Pratinha neighborhood in Belém, informed the Municipal Health Secretariat (Sesma). Confirmation was made by the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) and the suspicion is that residents have ingested contaminated açaí.

"All patients report having consumed açaí before showing the characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease", informed the city hall.

In the entire city of Belém, there are 11 cases of the disease reported through mid-November [2022]. In addition to the confirmed cases, other cases are under investigation, according to the city hall, which did not detail how many.

"The Epidemiological Surveillance Division continues to notify and investigate possible other cases, while endemic disease control agents, from the Endemic Disease Control Division, collect blood samples for diagnosis in the area", informed the Health Secretariat.

Belém is the municipality that registers the highest number of cases of the acute disease in all of Brazil, according to UEPA - University of the State of Pará.

[Chagas disease remains a serious public health problem in Brazil and throughout Latin America, particularly in the Amazon Region. _Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection is classically transmitted when infected triatomine bugs bite and defecate on the skin of humans and other animals, after which the protozoans enter the bloodstream. However, accidental ingestion by contaminated food, particularly fruit juices, has become an increasingly important route of transmission of Chagas disease (1). The largest known outbreak of foodborne Chagas disease occured in 2007 in Caracas, Venezuela, with approximately 130 cases resulting from contaminated guava juice. Numerous outbreaks of Chagas disease due to the consumption of contaminated açaí berries and açaí juice have been documented in Brazil. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, 1034 cases of orally transmitted acute Chagas disease (ACD) were registered from 2000 to 2013 (2).

Belém (population of approx. 1.5 million) is the capital of the state of Pará in the country's north and the major gateway to the Amazon River. In the state of Pará, the açaí production industry involves approximately 300 000 people, and at harvest time almost 500 000 liters of açaí arrive in Belém and are sold at some 3000 points of sale (2). The contamination of berries by _T. cruzi_ may occur at multiple points following harvest. Açaí berries themselves are intimately associated with infected triatomines in the islands of the Guamá river where the açaí palm tree _Euterpe oleracea_ is grown (3). Açaí juice presses are illuminated at night and open to contamination by infected triatomine bugs that are attracted to light (2). The acai production chain in Pará thus presents innumerable opportunities for the oral transmission of Chagas disease, which is likely the major reason that Belém has more cases of acute Chagas disease than any other city in Brazil, even though it ranks only 11th in population.
