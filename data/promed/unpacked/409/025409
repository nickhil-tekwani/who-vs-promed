In [post 75 in this thread, 20051122.3390] you requested more information on
species involved in wild bird outbreaks. In the China (Hong Kong SAR) listing,
individual species were supplied for some birds, but for brevity, when sent to
FAO this list referred to "various wild waterfowl". Details of waterfowl
species involved and the incidence of disease in those species is
available in:
Ellis, T. M., Bousfield, R.B., Bissett, L., Dyrting, K.C., Luk, G. S. M.,
Tsim, S.T., Sturm-Ramirez, K., Webster, R.G., Guan, Y. & Peiris, J.S. (2004a).

[Thanks to Trevor for this helpful response.
The paper mentioned was one of the main references for the list of wild bird
species affected by H5N1 prepared by the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) and presented in posting
20051123.3403.
In the meantime, we have become aware of the paper "New Genotype of Avian
Influenza H5N1 Viruses Isolated from Tree Sparrows in China" by Z. Kou,
F.M.Lai et al, published in the Journal of Virology, December 2005, p. 15460-
15466, Vol. 79, No. 24.
The paper relates to tests carried out in Tree sparrows (_Passer montanus_)
collected in China in 2004. Their results suggested that H5N1 viruses might be
distributed widely in tree sparrows, adding the said species to the
aforementioned list. - Mod.AS]
