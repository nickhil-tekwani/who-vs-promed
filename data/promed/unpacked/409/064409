MEASLES - CAMBODIA: SUSPECTED

Ministry of Health officials are investigating 2 suspected measles cases -- 1 in Phnom Penh and another in Svay Rieng province. Ministry spokesman Ly Sovann yesterday [27 Jun 2016] referred questions to an official at the national program, who declined to give his name, citing the ongoing investigation, but said teams were dispatched on Sat [25 Jun 2015] to investigate the suspected cases and collect blood samples.

The 2 cases involve an 8-month-old in Phnom Penh's Por Sen Chey district and a 1-year-old in Svay Rieng province, he said. "Any suspected cases should be investigated," he said. "Right now it's not clear yet." Officials are still awaiting the lab results.

In March 2015, the World Health Organization declared Cambodia "measles free". Just 10 months later, in January of this year [2016], a case emerged involving a 7-month-old infant in Kampong Speu province. Another case was subsequently confirmed that same month [January], according to ministry documents, while a 3rd was uncovered in May [2016]. It's unknown where the other 2 confirmed cases this year took place.

[It is worth clarifying that the 1st 2 confirmed cases in January 2016 were from Kampong Speu and Takeo provinces, while the 3rd confirmed case in May 2016 was also from Phnom Penh's Po Sen Chey district.

The Cambodia Early Warning System (CAMEWARN) of the Ministry of Health operated by the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) Department uses syndromic surveillance, whereby any case of "fever with rash" should be promptly investigated to rule out measles or rubella. Once either is confirmed, a joint press release between the MOH and WHO will be issued.

With the support from the Skoll Global Threats Fund through its iLab in Phnom Penh, the CDC Department is in the process of a nation-wide rolling out of the Verboice (a tool to create and run projects that interact via voice) to facilitate a timely and complete disease reporting from the peripheral level as part of its leading role in Information, Communication Technology (ICT), among the 6 countries of the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) Cooperation (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam).

The CDC Department is also the Cambodia National Focal Point for the International Health Regulations (IHR).

A total of 13 cases of measles and another 10 probable cases have been found at a Devon [UK] secondary school. Parents at King Edward VI Community College (Kevicc) in Totnes have been urged to get their children vaccinated.

The outbreak was confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). It warned that while most people who catch measles recover within weeks, it can cause permanent disability and "occasionally even kill"
- Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known and can only be prevented through vaccination.
- About 1 in 5 children with measles experiences complications such as diarrhea, vomiting, pneumonia and meningitis.
- While measles can lead to life-threatening health problems in some people, it usually passes within 7-10 days
- Symptoms include a runny nose, coughing, sore red eyes, a fever and small grayish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks

The outbreak follows 1 case of measles confirmed in a Kevicc pupil on 3 June [2016]. There have been 785 cases of measles since the start of 2016 in England and Wales, compared with 646 in the same period last year [2015] said PHE [Public Health England]. PHE has also sent letters to parents at other schools in the area advising them to "ensure their children are fully protected" with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Concerns were raised in a controversial paper in the Lancet in 1998 about a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, which has since been comprehensively discredited. But in the wake of the publicity surrounding the Lancet paper vaccination rates fell sharply and some parents are still concerned about the effects, said PHE.

Dr Sarah Harrison, consultant in health protection for PHE in the South West, said: "Measles is a very infectious disease and can spread rapidly among communities such as schools if people have not been fully immunized." About 1 in 15 children with measles will suffer from complications such as pneumonia or ear or eye infections.

"I would appeal to any parents who have not yet had their children immunized to get them protected as soon as possible through their GP." Alan Salt, principal at Kevicc, said: "The college urges parents and carers to make sure they follow Public Health England and GP advice and ensure their children are vaccinated."

As of 1st week of June, the number of measles cases reported throughout Malaysia increased by 340 percent to 873, compared to 197 during the corresponding period last year [2015], said Health Department director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said on Sunday [26 Jun 2016].

In a statement which was uploaded on his Facebook page, he said the increase in cases was because the children were not immunized against the disease. Majority of the cases involved private homes (63.6 percent) followed by institutions (28.8 percent) and the community (7.6 percent).

"In 2015, there were 1318 cases of measles with 2 deaths, and this year [2016], there have not been any deaths," he said. Dr Noor Hisham said 66 outbreaks were reported during the 1st week of June [2016], a 5-fold increase compared to the corresponding period last year [2015]. "In 2014, there were only 11 reported cases of measles (first week of June) and increased to 57 cases in 2015."

In the case of chicken pox, Dr Noor Hisham said 109 cases were reported this year [2016], a 34.7 percent drop compared to the 167 in 2015 and 125 in 2014. No deaths from chicken pox were reported in the last 3 years. A majority of cases this year involve institutions (90 percent) such as nurseries, kindergartens, day care centers and detention centers.

He said measles and chickenpox were vaccine preventable diseases spread via the air and direct contact to an infected person's fluid droplets. Immunization against measles would be given to children between 9 and 12 months while chicken pox was not included in the National Immunization Program.

[The previous ProMED post on measles in Malaysia reported that the Pahang Health Department has confirmed that the incidence of measles in the state has risen to 29 cases as of 24 Jun 2016, while this report states 873 cases. The discrepancy could be due to state incidence vs country-wide incidence reported here. Regardless, the number of cases is increasing significantly over the 2015 case numbers.

[The number of cases in this detention facility has been gradually increasing. It would be good for the facility to vaccinate individuals to prevent further spread of measles. - Mod.LK

[Complications from measles are more common among adults. Approximately 20 percent of those with measles experience one or more complications including diarrhea, ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis, seizures, and death. Measles is extremely contagious; 90 percent of susceptible household contacts of a person with measles will become infected. Symptoms of measles include high fever, rash, runny nose, pink and watery eyes, coughing, diarrhea, and earache. The risk of death from measles is highest for adults and infants.

The US is experiencing a rise in measles cases related to unimmunized US travelers bringing the infection back from other countries - See more at: http://www.adultvaccination.org/vpd/measles#sthash.RgYiaE8e.dpuf
