The 1st fatal case of melioidosis in 2011 was reported in Kaohsiung in
southern Taiwan, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Thu 15 Sep
2011, urging people to keep the environment clean and avoid direct
contact with contaminated soil and water.

There have been 15 confirmed cases of melioidosis and 9 suspected ones
nationwide as of 15 Sep 2011, with most of them concentrated in
Kaohsiung City [Kaohsiung Special Municipality] and Pingtung County
[Taiwan Province], said CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi.

One of the 2 people who have died from melioidosis is a 69-year-old
diabetic living in Zuoying District in Kaohsiung, who was confirmed to
have died from the disease. The other is a 61-year-old from Nanzih
District with chronic illnesses who died from a suspected case of
melioidosis. Shih said the bacterium that causes melioidosis is found
in contaminated water and soil. Humans acquire the infection through
direct contact with the contaminated source, especially through skin
abrasions. It is very rare for people to get the disease from another
person.

Melioidosis has a latency period of 2 days to several years. Symptoms
include skin ulcers, pneumonia, or septicemia, according to Shih.
People should wear rain shoes or waterproof boots and gloves when they
are near a contaminated environment to avoid infection.

Melioidosis occurs mainly affecting people who have direct contact
with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition
such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis,
thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic
obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava
consumption. (Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can
be associated with chronic liver disease.) HIV infection, however, may
not a clear risk factor for more severe disease. Melioidosis may
present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life,
affecting males more than women. In addition, although severe
fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals,
severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without
risk factors.

In acute severe melioidosis, there is characteristically the rapid
progression of respiratory failure that is due to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or pneumonia. It has been suggested that
the ARDS to melioidosis sepsis is more rapid in progression than with
other bacteria and may be related to the intracellular interactions of
the bacillus and the leukocyte. Bacteremia without shock/hypotension
has a substantially better prognosis.
