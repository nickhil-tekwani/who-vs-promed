More than 3100 cattle have died from diseases in the 2013-14 summer season, the 1st round Crop and Livestock Assessment Report has revealed.

The report -- compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development -- shows that 1570 cattle died of tick-borne diseases and 75 from anthrax. Lumpy skin disease killed 537, and 980 died from black leg. Matabeleland South, Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central had the highest numbers of cases of reported cattle deaths.

During the same period, 1626 cases of foot and mouth were reported in Bikita, Chiredzi, Zaka and Chipinge. "In 2013, foot and mouth disease was mainly confined to the southeastern districts of the country with isolated cases recorded in Umguza. These districts are still under quarantine," reads the report. Manicaland, Masvingo and Midlands provinces also experienced outbreaks.

Zimbabwe Farmers' Union 2nd vice president, responsible for livestock, Mr Abdul Nyathi said farmers should always dip their cattle and vaccinate them against diseases. "Most animals succumb to tick-borne diseases, especially in summer; the best way to curb animal deaths is for farmers to spray the cattle themselves since the veterinary services may have challenges with chemicals," he said.

Department of Veterinary Services director Dr Josphat Nyika confirmed that sometimes they failed to vaccinate animals due to funding challenges. He said wet weather encourages proliferation of biting flies, some of which spread the lumpy skin disease virus. "For tick-borne diseases, dipping programmes for animals should be followed strictly to avoid cattle dying. Dip chemicals are needed to maintain the tick control programme," he said. The national herd is currently at 5.2 million. Furthermore, a shortage of dipping chemicals is affecting control of livestock diseases.

Deputy director for Veterinary Services Dr Chenjerai Njagu told The Herald on Wednesday [26 Mar 2014]: "Our major constraint has been the shortage of dipping chemicals. Tick-borne diseases have increased, and we are encouraging farmers with resources to spray their animals against ticks to avoid further livestock losses."

An outbreak in livestock diseases such as anthrax, lumpy skin, and black leg was reported in February 2014 when the country experienced incessant rains.

[To date, we have only reported 32 bovine cases of anthrax in Manicaland and 15 bovine cases in Masonaland West, in December 2013. Many of the Manicaland anthrax reports just had exposure to dead livestock, not otherwise specified, which might explain the missing 28 anthrax deaths.

Unfortunately, one cannot report what isn't reported. We try to report on lumpy skin disease and FMD, but somehow the Zimbabwean authorities have not revealed the current situation until now. They had not reported on these conditions to OIE in Paris either, but better late than never. - Mod.MHJ
