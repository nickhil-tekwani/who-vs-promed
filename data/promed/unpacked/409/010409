During the period 1 to 7 Sep [2006] 318 visits have been registered
in the health care facilities of the Novosibirsk Region in connection
with tick-bites, including 65 visits by children. According to Tamara
Ufimceva, the Deputy Head of the Territorial Agency for
Epidemiological Surveillance in the Novosibirsk Region, this number
is higher than for the same period of 2005, when only 123 cases of
tick-bite were recorded.
Five patients, all of whom are residents of [the city of] Novosibirsk
were admitted to hospital during this period. A total of 499
patients, including 29 children, have been admitted to hospital
during the tick season [in 2006]. Tick-borne encephalitis has been
confirmed in 87 cases, 2 of whom were children. Of the 71 ticks
submitted for laboratory examination, 4 were virus-positive. A total
of 3993 ticks from the city and the region have been submitted for
laboratory examination and 565 were found to be positive for tick
encephalitis virus.
Since the beginning of the summer, 18 913 patients sought medical
advice for tick-bites in the city and Region. Three fatal cases have
been registered due to tick borne encephalitis.

[This boils down to: 18 913 people sought medical advice for
tick-bites -- a huge burden on the health services; 499 admitted to
hospital; 87 cases confirmed ; 3 fatal, in the region in 2006 so far. - Mod.JW]
[Despite the fact that summer has passed, tick activity continues.
This is apparent as cases of tick-borne encephalitis are continuing
to be identified. The population of Novosibirsk should continue to
avoid exposure to tick-bites during outdoor activities. It is
necessary to self-check and check others for attached ticks, and if a
tick is found to submit it without delay for laboratory examination
and to arrange immune prophylaxis if appropriate. - Corr.VM.]
[Mod.CP posted a good summary of tick borne encephalitis virus
distribution, copied below. The Novosibirsk Oblast is located in the
southern part of the western Siberia socio-economic region. A map of
Russia can be accessed at:

[Tickborne encephalitis is caused by 2 closely related flaviviruses.
The eastern subtype of tickborne encephalitis virus causes Russian
spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes
persulcatus_. The western subtype causes Central European
encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The
eastern subtype occurs across Russia and northern Asia, whereas the
western subtype occurs in foci from Scandinavia in the north to
Greece in the south. The eastern subtype is associated with more
severe disease, and, in some outbreaks, mortality up to 25 per cent
has occurred. The majority of infections are a consequence of tick
bites, but, rarely, infection has occurred by consumption of infected
cow's or goat's milk. Inactivated vaccines are available for
protection against both subtypes. - Mod.CP]
