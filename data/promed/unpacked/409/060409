Colorado health officials are investigating whether an Adams County woman
may have contracted [a hantavirus infection at her home. State
epidemiologist John Pape said he would not be surprised if the woman did
contract the sometimes deadly disease at her rural home. "If you live in a
rural area anywhere in Colorado, potentially you have exposure risks," Pape
said. The 54-year-old woman, whose name was not released, was in critical
condition Monday at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver. She was admitted last
Wednesday with typical, flu-like symptoms that accompany the disease, Pape
said.
Pape said the investigation into where the woman contracted the disease is
ongoing. She had been in other parts of rural Colorado and Utah in the past
6 weeks - within the incubation period. But Pape said the woman was hiking
and recreating while away from her home. [Hantaviral infections in the
southwestern U.S. typically [are contracted when people clean out sheds
or barns [where infected rodents have left their droppings.
Pape said it is unclear what activities the woman may have been doing at
her home if she contracted [the hantavirus there. Last year, a Loveland,
Colorado area man became the first person along the Front Range [the
eastern side of the Rocky Mountains to contract [a hantavirus infection.
He survived.
The Adams County woman is the 5th reported case in Colorado this year. Two
people have died.
[If I can determine what investigations are being done by the state, I will
pass on that information. - Mod.CHC

News reports on 29 Jun 2000 state that a possible case of Hantavirus
Pulmonary Syndrome may have been detected in an elementary school employee
in the Houston suburb of Missouri City, Texas. The employee was said to
have been cleaning out a storage closet and became ill some time later.
Laboratory results are pending to confirm the presence of [a hantavirus.
The reports state that no [illnesses due to a hantavirus infection have
ever been confirmed in Harris County [Houston. In fact, only 15 cases
have ever been confirmed in Texas, the majority of them in the western
regions of state.

[If someone at the Texas State Health Department would let us know whether
this illness has been confirmed as having been caused by a hantavirus,
ostensibly Sin Nombre virus but possibly another hantavirus, please let us
know. Age, sex, onset date, and outcome are among the data that would be
welcomed. - Mod.CHC
