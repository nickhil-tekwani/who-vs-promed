[Xinjiang is the 7th province in China reportedly infected by FMDV
serotype O since Feb 2010, following Guangdong (outbreaks on 22 Feb,
4 Mar); Gansu (14 Mar, 7 Apr, 17 Apr); Shanxi (25 Mar); Jianqxi (28
Mar); Guizhou (13 Apr); Ningxia (23 Apr). From the map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>,
showing the locations of the 10 outbreaks, it is apparent that the
virus, which infects ruminants and swine, is circulating throughout
vast parts of the mega-state.

Infections in Xinjiang may have started earlier than 20 Apr 2010.
According to an official report (see ProMED-mail 20100403.1072), on
25 Mar 2010, a consignment of 98 cattle, shipped from the eastern
Shanxi province, were found infected while being transported on a
Xinjiang (western China) highway. Investigations in Shanxi and in
Xinjiang failed to reveal the source of infection. The very fact that
a consignment of infected cattle travelled on land along a distance
of 2000 km (1200 mi) or more, and the possibility that this was not
an exclusive event, illustrates the grave FMD situation in China.

The difficulties of China's central authorities in obtaining full,
accurate, and timely information on animal disease outbreaks, in
particularly FMD, can be explained by the size of the country, its
complex, decentralised administrative structure and -- possibly --
the reluctance of regional administrations to admit "problems" to the
central government. Farmers, professionals, and the public at large
deserve, indeed, should be encouraged to report immediately suspected
disease cases in order to enable their investigations as well as
timely and effective control measures. In this context, it is of
concern to note that according to recent local press reports, a
person who published on 26 Mar 2010 a posting on an Internet forum,
mentioning diseases (including FMD) in pigs in the Hanzhong area,
which is a part of Shanxi, has been arrested for "inciting panic". As
informed by ProMED-mail rapporteur DS, who scans Chinese media, the
event -- following its coverage in the local press -- has recently
reached the Internet pages of People's Daily, China's national
official newspaper (see, in Chinese, at
<http://society.people.com.cn/GB/11490558.html>). Among others, this
website wrote: "After this news was found on web searches in Europe
and America, related European and American organizations used this as
evidence to raise questions about the safety of China's livestock
products, sending an official memo to China's international commerce
organizations.... ---- becoming a diplomatic issue involving China's
central leadership." An earlier item on the issue is available (also
in Chinese) at
<http://news.163.com/10/0420/12/64NALL8J00014AEE.html>. Blaming the
bearer of bad tidings?!

The FMD situation in China, including its current non-vaccination
policy and the spread of the virus into the huge pig industry, is
indeed a cause for grave concern. This may already be reflected in
the introduction of a similar genotype into S Korea; genotyping of
the Japanese FMDV, serotype O virus, is still pending. - Mod.AS]
