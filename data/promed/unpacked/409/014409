A "challenging" outbreak of the deadly [Ebola virus disease] in West Africa is expected to take from 2-4 months to contain, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday [8 Apr 2014]. The virus is still spreading in 3 "hotspots" of Guinee Forestiere [Forest-Guinea], a south eastern region some 900 km (560 miles) from Guinea's capital of Conakry, a city which has itself reported 20 cases to date, the United Nations agency said.

But WHO said it was not recommending any travel restrictions for Guinea, which has a total of 157 suspected and confirmed cases including 101 deaths, or for Liberia, which has 21 suspected and confirmed cases, including 10 deaths. "We fully expect to be engaged in this outbreak for the next 2 to 3 to 4 months before we are comfortable that we are through it," Dr Keija Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, told a Geneva news briefing. "This is one of the most challenging outbreaks of ebolavirus we have ever faced," he said. It is also the first to strike West Africa, where some people have become infected from burial practices that involve direct contact with body fluids of the deceased.

WHO medical officer Stephane Hugonnet, just back from Guinea, said: "In Guinee Forestiere, the outbreak is not over, this is the epicenter. As long as it is not over there, there will be cases exported to the rest of the country."

Some 50 foreign experts have been deployed to help with infection control measures at hospitals and to trace 600 known contacts of infected patients, he said. Most new cases were linked to known transmission chains, which he said was "reassuring".

[The numbers of cases and fatalities from Ebola virus disease continue to climb in Guinea. Before 4 Apr 2014 there were 143 suspected cases and 86 deaths, on 4 Apr 2014 there were 151 suspected cases and 95 deaths, and in this report (8 Apr 2014) there are reported 157 cases and 101 deaths. Tracing the 600 known contacts will be an enormous job, but it is essential if the outbreak is to be halted. Public education will be critical in order to obtain good collaboration and compliance with recommended practices -- something never easy in an environment of fear and rumors in a population spread over a large geographic area.
