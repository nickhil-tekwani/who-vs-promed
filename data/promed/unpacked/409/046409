A Comment on Aspects of the Current Outbreak of HFRS in Tatarstan
-------------------------------------------------
Though I am not a local source (Finland is quite far from Tatarstan), I
would like to comment on this report, because Finland is highly endemic for
the same virus.
The Moderator is most probably correct in inferring that it is an outbreak
of Puumala virus infection. These regions along the Volga River are
well-known for Puumala virus-caused epidemics of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS).
But the original message contained some misunderstandings. "He said that
almost everyone who visited forested areas to collect mushrooms, berries,
or firewood had become ill." This is an exaggeration. Based on extensive
observations in Finland (we have between 700 and 2600 diagnosed cases
annually among 5 million people), and comparing seroprevalence and
incidence data, we know that about 20 percent of people infected (being
seropositive), succumb to an acute form of disease. And not everyone going
into forests becomes infected.
[The posting also stated] "Forests had been damaged in 22 locations in the
Republic by unregulated felling of timber. One consequence has been a
considerable increase in numbers of the red-backed vole, the vector of HFRS."
Local logging is probably not the cause of the present bank vole increase.
In these regions along Volga and eastward to Udmurtia and Bashkortostan,
bank vole populations fluctuate naturally, and the peaks seem to follow a
3-year pattern. Indeed ProMED-mail has reported epidemics of HFRS in these
regions according to this pattern. Just remember the huge epidemic along
Volga with thousands of human cases in late 1990's.
