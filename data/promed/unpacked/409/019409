Diarrhea Vaccine Pulled From Market
------------------------------------------
American Home Products pulled its vaccine against the leading cause of
childhood diarrhea off the market today, because of concerns that it may
increase infants' risk of bowel obstruction.
The government in July [1999 advised doctors to temporarily stop giving
children the vaccine against rotavirus after counting at least 20 infants
who developed a bowel obstruction. But the vaccine's manufacturer took the
bigger step today of withdrawing the vaccine from the market because reports
of bowel obstruction possibly linked to the product have reached about 100,
said spokesman Doug Petkus.
Doctors who still have doses of the vaccine in their offices should
immediately return them to the manufacturer.
The obstruction occurs when one part of the bowel becomes enfolded within
another. Symptoms include vomiting, bloody stools and abdominal pain.
Surgery is often needed to clear the blockage if it isn't caught early.
An estimated 1 million infants were vaccinated with RotaShield since it
received government approval to sell a year ago. The three-dose series is
given at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.
Before its approval by the Food and Drug Administration, 5 cases of the
bowel obstruction were reported for every 10 000 vaccine recipients. As a
result, the bowel obstruction was listed as a potential adverse reaction on
the package insert. But concern arose when doctors discovered that the rate
of the problem appeared much higher.
