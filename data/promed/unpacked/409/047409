According to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, 2 horses in Horry County, South Carolina contracted eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) within the past 3 weeks. They are urging North Carolina horse owners to vaccinate their equine.

EEE is a mosquito-borne disease that is preventable in equine by vaccination. Horry County is the northern-most coastal county in South Carolina and borders Brunswick County in North Carolina.

EEE causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord and is usually fatal. Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

"If your horses exhibit any signs of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately," said [North Carolina] State Veterinarian Doug Meckes.

Meckes recommends that equine owners talk to their veterinarians about an effective vaccination protocol to protect horses from EEE and another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile virus [WNV]. The combo vaccination initially requires 2 shots, 30 days apart, for horses, mules, and donkeys that have no prior vaccination history. Meckes recommends a booster shot every 6 months.

Mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts for more than 4 days, so removing any source of standing water can reduce the chance of exposing animals to WNV or EEE. Keeping horses in stalls at night, using insect screens and fans, and turning off lights after dusk can also help reduce exposure to mosquitoes.

Insect repellents can be effective if used according to manufacturers' instructions. People, horses, and birds can become infected from a bite by a mosquito carrying the diseases, but there is no evidence that horses can transmit the viruses to other horses, birds, or people through direct contact.

[The most effective EEE prevention is vaccination. The vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. Most owners usually vaccinate in the spring, but immunity to EEE is the shortest and wanes within about 3-4 months. Owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months to protect against EEE.

"In the United States, equine vaccines are available for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (or eastern equine encephalitis EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile virus (WNV) encephalomyelitis.
