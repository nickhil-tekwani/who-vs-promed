A media news article (below) on [Sun 13 Jun 2021] by the official Iranian News Agency (IRNA), reported that anthrax has been suspected to be the cause of an outbreak in livestock in the Province of Ilam.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Director General of Veterinary Medicine of Ilam said: the province is suspected to have anthrax in a village located in the Majin section of Darhshahr city and that all animals of this village were quarantined. In an interview with IRNA on [Sun 13 Jun 2021], Dr. Ramin Poranjef said: "according to the report of unusual losses of a number of cattle in a rural rancher, groups of veterinarians were sent to the site and began to investigate the current situation."

He added: "This rural rancher has 170 head of livestock, 9 of which have been lost due to some reasons that are still under investigation, and in the research performed, the possibility of anthrax is more likely than other reasons. Although most of the symptoms indicate the occurrence of anthrax, samples have been sent to the country's reference laboratories, and the cause of death of these animals cannot be determined until the final results and results of these tests are obtained," Poranjef said.

"Currently, all the animals in this village are under full quarantine to prevent livestock or livestock products from leaving the village, and the dead animals have been buried deep in the ground in compliance with hygienic and environmental standards using limestone. It has also been ignited and disinfected."

He added that the issue has been reported to the relevant officials of the province and a crisis management leadership has been formed to prevent its spread among other fields.

"Given that many diseases exist in cattle and can only be identified by veterinarians, consumers of protein products should buy their meat and poultry from authorized centers," Poranjef said.

According to IRNA, anthrax is a bacterial disease of domestic herbivores such as sheep, goats, and cattle and caused by Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria that spreads this disease is very resistant and can survive for many years and enters the animal's body through a scratch or wound and then be transmitted to the consumers. More than 800 common diseases have been identified to affect both humans and animals.

[Ilam Province is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is located in the western part of the country border with Iraq, and also bordering the Iranian provinces of Kermanshah, Lorestan, and Khuzestan (Map: https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-political-map-of-iran-with-the-several-provinces-where-ilam-is-highlighted-48983473.html.

This is a puzzler as Iran has not reported any anthrax outbreaks in cattle or sheep in a number of years. But an absence of anthrax would explain the significant veterinary response and the need for laboratory confirmation of whatever the cause of these 9 deaths. Fortunately, so far, no human cases have been reported.

Our heartfelt thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
