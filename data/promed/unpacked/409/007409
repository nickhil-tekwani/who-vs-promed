Fascioliasis -- a disease caused by an infestation of parasitic liver
flukes -- is affecting more people in the central and central
highlands regions, with some 3000 cases recorded this year [2009],
according to the health ministry's Institute of Mariology,
Parasitology and Entomology in Quy Nhon.

Trieu Nguyen Trung, the institute's director general, said the latest
figure was 45 percent more than the number a year ago.

Fascioliasis is spread by cattle that are allowed to wander freely in
the region and disperse larvae into water environments. Since the
local people are in the habit of eating water vegetables and drinking
water without boiling it first, it's easy for them to be infected,
Trung explained.

It is estimated that 40 to 70 percent of local cattle are infected
with the disease, he said.

[The liver flukes _Fasciola hepatica_ and _Fasciola gigantic_ can
infect a range of livestock and other species. The final hosts
include sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, goats, alpacas and deer. People
can be infected by eating water cress from creeks in fluke-infested areas.

A recent study from Viet Nam found that both _F. hepatica_ and _F.
gigantica_, and hybrids of the 2, are found in Viet Nam (Itagaki et
al. Occurrence of spermic diploid and aspermic triploid forms of
Fasciola in Vietnam and their molecular characterization based on
nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Parasitol Int. 2009;58:81-5). An
increase in fascioliasis in humans may reflect higher infections in
livestock and changed exposure to contaminated water cress.
