Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been detected in the southern Mozambican
province of Gaza, reports Thursday's [3 Apr 2008] issue of the Maputo daily
"Noticias". The outbreak of the livestock disease was notified on 26 Mar
2008 in herds at Nhamavila and Manjacaze. The provincial authorities
decided to slaughter and incinerate 45 head of cattle found to be infected.

They also launched an emergency vaccination campaign to cover about 14 000
animals in the contaminated and surrounding areas and ordered restrictions
on cattle movements until the area is declared clear of FMD as a measure to
prevent the spread of the disease.

The animals found to be infected had come from the western province of
Tete. They had been brought to Nhamavila and Manjacaze by an NGO to be
distributed among those communities to promote cattle raising. The
livestock authorities have thus also ordered restrictions on the movement
of cattle in Tete while they try to locate the main focus of the disease.

The head of the Gaza Provincial Livestock Services, Sara Macie, told
"Noticias" that the disease was diagnosed on the act of inspecting the
animals before they were distributed to cattle farmers. This, she said,
suggested that inspection work was not properly undertaken in Tete before
the cattle left that province. "As soon as we confirmed the signs of FMD,
namely lesions on the mouth and the hooves, we immediately slaughtered the
sick animals and restricted the movement of livestock in Nhamavila and
Manjacaze so that FMD will not spread to areas believed to be still free of
the disease," she said.

An FMD outbreak is a serious setback to Mozambique's efforts to rebuild its
livestock herd after it had been decimated during the war of
destabilization. The latest statistics show that there are now about 1.6
million head of cattle in the country.

"Noticias" makes the sensationalist claim that the outbreak has "serious
consequences for public health." In fact, it is very rare indeed for humans
to contract FMD, and almost impossible to catch it by eating meat from an
infected animal [See comment].

Animals are culled not to protect human health but to protect the economic
value of the surviving cattle. The policy is controversial, since although
foot and mouth has a high mortality rate among juvenile animals, most adult
cattle infected will recover.

[Mozambique sent to the OIE an immediate notification on an FMD outbreak in
Tetene, Nhamavila, Xai-Xai, Gaza on 1 Apr 2008 (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6928>).
Samples were sent to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa
(National laboratory); the test mentioned was antibody detection ELISA;
their results were pending.

The final results, and particularly the FMDV serotype involved, are
anticipated. According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory at
Pirbright, the last reported serotypes in Mozambique were as follows: SAT1
(2002), SAT2 (1983), SAT3 (1959), O (1980); the laboratory further notes
that "all 3 SAT types are probably endemic in the buffalo population".

The statement of All Africa indicating the fact that FMD does not
constitute a risk to public health, infecting humans only in extremely rare
cases, is fully supported. For example: during the major FMD 2001 epizootic
in the UK, which was meticulously documented, not a single case in humans
was confirmed, in spite of the extensive spread of the virus and the large
number of people exposed to it on farms and within the disease-control and
eradication teams. Specimens from 15 suspected cases reported to the Public
Health Laboratories were tested; all were found eventually negative to FMD
virus.

News reports may have, at times, the tendency to create considerable
anxiety among some members of the public, especially where animal FMD is
prevalent. There continues to be confusion between animal FMD and the
common human viral infection "hand, foot, and mouth disease", which is
caused by a completely different human enterovirus. - Mod.AS]
