The studies carried out by the Wildlife Center for Analysis and Diagnosis (CAD) indicated that the mortality of deer observed in the Sierra de Baza Natural Park [Andalusia] was due to severe pulmonary congestion caused by _Mannheimia haemolytica_, formerly known as _Pasteurella haemolyticala_, an agent that is usually present in the respiratory tract of these animals that, due to a decrease in defenses or weakness, can cause their death.

The sudden changes in the weather in the area throughout the 2nd fortnight of March [2022], with episodes of heavy rain -- 400 liters per square meter between [21 and 25 Mar 2022] -- after a persistent drought and a drastic fall in temperatures that covered part of the protected area with snow would have generated a situation of stress in these ungulates, triggering the disease and, therefore, their death.

In fact, it was as of [26 Mar 2022] when the administration of the natural park began to receive the 1st reports of deer carcasses, immediately activating an Action Protocol in the event of a wildlife health emergency. This protocol is part of the Epidemiological Surveillance Program for Wildlife in Andalusia with the aim of detecting the occurrence of diseases, determining their prevalence, and establishing and coordinating the most appropriate intervention measures, whether they are prevention, mitigation, or control.

As a result of the activation of this protocol, the remains of 84 deer have been located and recorded in the park to date, with no defined pattern and the incidence being lower in the south-southwest of the protected natural area. In the last 2 weeks, no recent corpses have been located, although, to know the real impact on the deer population, the Directorate of the Sierra de Baza Natural Park has decided to intensify the summer surveys, to be able to assess the impact with more precision.

The Territorial Delegation for Sustainable Development of Granada today underlined the transparency with which these cases of death of ungulates due to pasteurellosis in the Sierra de Baza are being managed, an episode that is not the first to be recorded in Andalusia. Specifically, in 2007 there was an outbreak in the province of Cádiz that caused the death of more than 400 individuals.

In this sense, the territorial delegate, Manuel Francisco García, has detailed that at the end of March [2022] the carcasses were sent to the CAD for analysis and in parallel, the Directorate of the Sierra de Baza Natural Park informed the members of the Governing Board, who will have precise information from the surveys that are carried out in the protected area to try to estimate the real incidence of this pasteurellosis episode.

The report with the results of the CAD analysis arrived at the Territorial Delegation last Friday [6 May 2022]. The results of the analyses confirm that the death of these deer is not linked to the pathogens that cause bluetongue, brucellosis, paratuberculosis, or deer haemorrhagic disease.

[The agent that caused this die-off, _Mannheimia (=_Pasteurella_) haemolytica_, is an opportunistic bacterium that does not affect whole populations unless some predisposing conditions are prevailing. The underlying predisposing factor in this episode seems to be climatic stressors. - Mod.PMB
