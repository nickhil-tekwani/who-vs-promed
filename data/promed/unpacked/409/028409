New Zealand: Ross River Virus Confirmed in Waikato
--------------------------------------------------
A Waikato resident has a rare virus endemic to Australia. The Ross River
virus case was notified to the region's public health unit after the person
was diagnosed early in January 2005. The unit would not identify the person
for privacy reasons. Unit physician Anita Bell said the person had been
thoroughly questioned about their recent movements, and officials were
satisfied the virus was contracted in Australia. The person was recovering,
but symptoms could continue for some months, Dr Bell said.
The virus is endemic in Australia, and has been reported in Papua New
Guinea, the Solomon Islands and some Pacific Islands. The latest
Environmental Science and Research figures show there was one case in New
Zealand in 2003, with 11 since the 1st New Zealand diagnosis in 1980. The
most cases were recorded in 2001, when 3 people were diagnosed in New
Zealand. All reported New Zealand cases caught the virus overseas, but the
high number of Australian visitors meant some cases [of indigenous
infection?] might go unreported, Dr Bell said.
The southern saltmarsh mosquito, a known transmitter of the virus, was
first discovered in New Zealand in 1998. Government has approved $40
million [USD 28 million] over the next 10 years to eradicate it.

Ross River Virus Patient Worked in Australia's Northern Territory
--------------------------------------------------
Medical authorities have confirmed that a person in Waikato has contracted
the rare Ross River virus. The virus is spread by mosquitoes, and there
have been 11 cases of the illness in New Zealand since it became notifiable
in 1970.
However, authorities say the person did not contract the virus in New
Zealand and had been working in Australia's Northern Territory for over a
year before returning home.

[Ross River virus, isolated in Australia in 1963, is a mosquito-transmitted
virus belonging to the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family
_Togaviridae_. Ross River virus is endemic in most coastal regions of
Australia and since the 1980's appears to have extended its range to
include most of the island communities of the South Pacific. Ross River
virus has been associated with outbreaks of benign polyarthritis in humans.
The animal reservoir species are various, and humans exhibit a significant
viraemia such that some epidemics in Australia are maintained in a
human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. The mosquito vectors vary
according to the local environment. Fortunately, illness in humans --
although occasionally prolonged and painful -- is not fatal, and recovery
is complete. - Mod.CP]
