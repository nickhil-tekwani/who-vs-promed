The Takeo province Agriculture Office has ordered the farmers of
domesticated ducks across the province to incinerate their birds and
temporarily suspended the sale of the animals' meat until the results
tests for the H5N1 virus (also known as bird flu), come back from
Phnom Penh this week [week of 1 Feb 2010] following mass deaths of the
fowl. Nhib Sron, director of the Takeo agriculture office, said that
since the middle of January [2010], about 50 000 ducks in the
province's Koh Andeth district had contracted an unknown illness, and
that there were signs the disease had reached some communes in
neighbouring Tramkak district. "We haven't identified the virus or
other agent causing these deaths, but we sent some of the dead animals
to a Phnom Penh laboratory for analysis," Nhib Sron said. Thai Ly,
Takeo province's chief officer of domesticated animals, said that 16
442 ducks had died since the outbreak began, and that roughly 31 000
more have fallen sick.

Cambodia reported an outbreak of H5N1 in one backyard during December
2009; it was eradicated by stamping out. See the OIE summary,
including a map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8800>.

Confirmation of H5N1 as the cause for the current mass duck mortality,
or an alternative diagnosis, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
