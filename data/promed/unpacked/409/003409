Ebola hemorrhagic Fever cases in Uganda increase to 160
--------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: One death and a further 11 cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever were
reported in northern Uganda on Monday, bringing the total number of known
infected people in the outbreak, which has now killed 55 individuals, to
160. These latest figures, released by the World Health Organisation (WHO),
cover patients reporting to hospitals in the northern town of Gulu in the 24
hours leading up to 8.00am on Mon 23 Oct 2000. "Some of the new cases came
in by ambulance while some reported to hospital themselves. But there is
also an active search going on in the villages", said WHO spokesman Andy
Seale. On Monday health teams were due to travel to Opit camp, east of Gulu
town, and to Pawiro village to the north, to check out reports of suspected
new cases. Several suspected cases of Ebola fever have already been reported
in camps at Amoru, Atiak and Pabo, which house some of the thousands of
people displaced by an insurgency in the region.
On Sunday, scientists from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control
began testing blood from some of the infected victims to verify on a
case-by-case basis that patients were indeed suffering from Ebola fever. A
total of 15 patients in Lacor Hospital were tested, and all were found to be
infected with the virus. This is the first time in an Ebola fever outbreak
that a mobile laboratory has been brought to the scene to analyse the virus
on site. The CDC is working out of St Mary's Lacor Hospital, an
Italian-founded mission hospital, 5km outside Gulu town.

Ebola Virus Produces a Type-I Interferon Antagonist
---------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: In a report published in [the 10 Oct 2000 issue of the
Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences of the USA, a team of German and U.S.
researchers, at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York and Philipps
Universitat in Marburg, describe identification of a protein that the virus
uses to disable the production of [type-I interferon, the non-adaptive
component of the host's immune response
[<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/220398297v1>. They identified a
protein, called VP35, that seems to suppress production of type-I
interferon; i.e. it acts as an interferon antagonist. At least one case of a
person who was infected with Ebola virus without symptoms has been reported,
and the researchers, headed by Peter Palese at Mt. Sinai, said that this
patient produced a stronger [interferon? response than usually seen in
those who succumb to Ebola fever. "It is clear from the study of other
viruses that the presence of an interferon antagonist is required for full
virulence," the researchers wrote. They conclude that Ebola virus VP35
therefore is likely to inhibit induction of type I IFN in Ebola
virus-infected cells and may be an important determinant of Ebola virus
virulence in vivo.

[Viruses vary considerably in their ability to induce interferon and in
their susceptibility to interferon. Several viruses are able to block the
interferon response, and the mechanisms involved are diverse; e.g. see the
review by Goodbourn et al., in J. Gen. Virol. 81, 234-1-2364, 2000. Ebola
virus is by no means unique in possession of an interferon antagonist.
However, elucidation of the mechanism of interaction of this particular
interferon antagonist with the interferon response may lead to the design of
an antiviral drug that would release the interferon block and reduce Ebola
virus virulence. - Mod.CP
