Could this be a jelly fish?

[ProMED-mail thanks Susan Baekeland for her question.

It would be unusual for a poisonerous jelly fish or several jelly fish to affect so many at the same time. The so called "box jellyfish" or "class Cubozoa" are cnidarian invertebrates distinguished by their cube-shaped medusae, WikiPedia writes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish). Although the notoriously dangerous species of box jellyfish are largely restricted to the tropical Indo-Pacific region, various species of box jellyfish can be found widely in tropical and subtropical oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean and the east Pacific Ocean. Thus, it is possible that a swarm of poisonerous jelly fish could cause such lesions, but they would have to have a high density in the water and it would be expected that they would have been noticed by the fishermen.

Another possibility are toxic algae. However, an algae bloom in salt water would colour the water, which would be noticed and this is not included in the report so far (See: https://www.cdc.gov/habs/general.html). - Mod.EP
