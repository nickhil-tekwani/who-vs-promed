Residents at an apartment building in North Portland are still getting sick with Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia or lung infection, despite efforts to fix the building's water system.

The outbreak at Rosemont Court has dragged on for more than 6 months, and health officials don't know why. "It's really hard to pinpoint a source in this case," explained Dr. Jennifer Vines, Multnomah County Health Officer. The most recent case was disclosed just last week.

Since January [2021], at least 13 residents at Rosemont Court have been diagnosed with the illness. Several [3] residents have been hospitalized and one has died. [LS, age 74] died on 2 Jan 2021 of Legionnaires' disease, according to her family.

Nearly 100 seniors live in affordable housing at Rosemont Court. The apartment complex is owned by the non-profit Northwest Housing Alternatives (NHA). On 4 Jan 2021, Multnomah County Health urged residents to temporarily leave and put them up in hotels after several people became ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.

_Legionella_, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease, can form in stagnant water and then disperse through the air and be inhaled; for example, when a shower or tap is turned on.

Since January [2021], professionals have run chlorine through the water system to destroy any potential bacteria, installed a disinfection system and added filters on faucets in the apartments. Despite all the precautions, 3 additional residents have gotten sick since 17 Mar 2021. Health officials believe the 3 cases may be related to some residents not using faucet filters properly, but the source of this outbreak remains a mystery.

"It can hang around in pipes anywhere that water is slowed or stagnant and it can get shaken loose in ways that we may not completely understand and then come out of somebody's faucet or showerhead," said Dr. Vines of Multnomah County.

Several residents have wondered if the outbreak might be connected to nearby construction activity, involving the replacement of a fire hydrant on 10 Dec 2020. The Portland Water Bureau warned residents in the neighborhood to temporarily boil water, as a precaution. Water samples from that day came back clean for bacteria, according to the city.

It is not clear what role, if any, the 10 Dec 2020 incident may have played in the Rosemont Court outbreak. "I don't know that that's a smoking gun but that is part of the timeline and part of the larger picture that we're looking at," explained Vines.

Tracking down the source of an outbreak and fixing the problem can take months, or even years, experts explain. "Sometimes you get lucky, and it is easy to resolve. Sometimes it drags on for a while," explained Mark LeChevallier, who led research programs for 32 years at American Water, a multistate utility. LeChevallier, who works as a private consultant on _Legionella_ cases, said the bacteria can resurface even after the situation appears to be under control.

The bacteria can live in biofilm, or the thin, slimy film that lines the inside of pipes. "The bacteria can find that niche and regrow," said LeChevallier. "The issue isn't how bacteria got into water. It's more about right environment in a building that allows it to grow to high levels that becomes a health risk."

Nationwide reports of Legionnaires' disease have climbed in recent years. No one is sure why, but factors could include better reporting, aging infrastructure and climate change. Oregon has also seen an increase in Legionnaires' disease cases from 31 in 2018 to 55 in 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

There is concern among health officials that cases could really flare as buildings reopen after prolonged shutdowns during the pandemic. "That is a real consideration with water that has been sitting stagnant," said Vines. In September [2020], the CDC issued guidance for reopening buildings (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/building-water-system.html). Stagnant or standing water in a plumbing system can increase the risk of Legionnaires' disease.

Drinking fountains, hot tubs, sinks, toilets, showers and air-conditioning systems are among common sources. It tends to flourish when temperatures are warm, water is stagnant and nutrients are plentiful; for example, inside corroding pipes.

Many residents at Rosemont Court feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty that has consumed their daily lives. On 14 Jun 2021, Northwest Housing Alternatives announced it would offer permanent relocation assistance to those living at Rosemont Court. Residents will get one-on-one support to help move, if they choose.

"About half of the residents at Rosemont Court have expressed interest in [being] permanently relocated," said Trell Anderson, executive director of NHA in a written statement. "We will continue sharing updates with residents and will be calling on our partners to support residents through this difficult time."

The news report above says that there are now 13 confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease in an outbreak that involves residents of an apartment complex (Rosemont Court) for people 55 years or older in the city of Portland, Oregon. Three patients have been hospitalized and one has died. When ProMED last posted a report on this outbreak on 8 Jan 2021, there were only 5 cases.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

The news report above says that chlorine was run through the water system to destroy any potential bacteria, a disinfection system was installed, and filters added on faucets in the apartments. Despite all the precautions, 3 additional residents have gotten sick since 17 Mar 2021.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Rosemont Court is described as "an older historic building" with studio, 1-, and 2-bedroom apartments (https://www.rent.com/oregon/portland-apartments/rosemont-court-4-lnp001E000000nye2DIAQ).
