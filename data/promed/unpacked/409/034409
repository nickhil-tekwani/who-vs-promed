Croatian scientists have detected a bird flu virus in wild swans
found dead at a fish pond, the agriculture ministry said on Friday
[21 Oct 2005]. Croatia immediately banned hunting and transport of
wild fowl and poultry.
"We have sent samples to Britain for further checks. There were 6
dead swans found in Orahovica fish pond in eastern Croatia," ministry
spokesman Mladen Pavic told Reuters. [See map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/HR/17/Orahovica.html>].
A government statement issued by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the
results of those checks were expected in 2 days but added there was
no cause for alarm:
"We are taking all necessary measures to prevent the virus from
spreading. We don't think there is any danger for people."
"The European Commission is preparing a decision to ban the import of
live poultry and poultry products from Croatia which will be adopted
by urgent procedure on Monday [24 Oct 2005]," the EU executive said
in a statement.
The Croatian government had assured the Commission that no live
poultry and poultry products would be dispatched from the former
Yugoslav republic to the European Union, the Commission added.
The Croatian agriculture ministry banned hunting of wild fowl and
transport of poultry and told farmers to keep poultry indoors. It
also banned the slaughter and sale of poultry in an area of 20 km (13
miles) around the fish pond.
"I expect more indirect damage from this, as it will be difficult to
convince people that eating locally raised poultry is safe,"
Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic told an emergency news conference.
In Romania, which shares the Danube waterway with Croatia, and in
Turkey, hundreds of miles to the south, the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus has been confirmed in wild birds and poultry. This is the
strain that some experts warn could cause a devastating pandemic
among humans. [This should have been better phrased as
follows:"....that some experts warn might be involved, under certain
conditions and if allowed to spread among animals, in the emergence
of an influenza strain which could cause a devastating pandemic among
humans." - Mod.AS]
Cases in Greece and Macedonia, south of Croatia but closer, are still
being examined to determine exactly what virus may be involved in
bird deaths there.
Zoologists say the Danube is a natural pathway for some species of
migratory birds moving west and south for the winter, which may have
been in contact with the most recent flu virus to the east. It
originated in Asia several years ago.
"These swans almost certainly did not come from Romania or Turkey,
which means there is a source of bird flu somewhere else in Europe,"
ornithologist Dragan Radovic told reporters.

[The active involvement of ornithologists in the study of H5N1
epidemiology should be encouraged. An increasing incidence of
clinical avian influenza has been observed in various wild avian
species. Though members of the Anseriformes order (particularly the
Anatidae family, to which swans belong) have been traditionally
considered as the main reservoir and vectors of avian influenza
viruses, the role of Passeriformes should be studied as well. - Mod.AS]
