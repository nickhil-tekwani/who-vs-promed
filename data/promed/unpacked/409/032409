[1] Port-au-Prince confirmed
Date: Tue 9 Nov 2010
Source: The Associated Press (AP) [edited]
<http://www.nj.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/cholera-confirmed-for-resident-of-haitis-capital/d5cf89929c90475c990a496e28f6c99e>


A cholera epidemic has spread into Haiti's capital, imperiling nearly 3
million people living in Port-au-Prince, nearly half of them in unsanitary
tent camps for the homeless from the 12 Jan 2010 earthquake.

Health authorities told The Associated Press on Monday [8 Nov 2010] that
tests confirmed a 3 year old boy who hadn't been out of the city had caught
the disease. More than 100 other suspected cholera cases among city
residents also were being tested.

The outbreak has already killed at least 544 people in Haiti, Health
Ministry executive director Gabriel Timothee told the AP.

The boy was tested after being taken to the Bernard Mevs/Project Medishare
hospital 31 Oct 2010 suffering from severe dehydration, nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea. He was treated with oral rehydration, IV fluids, and
antibiotics and was released.

A stool sample tested by Haiti's national laboratory contained _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1, the bacterium causing the disease, the chief medical officer,
Dr Antonia Eyssallenne, confirmed to AP by email. The boy's family had not
traveled in more than a year or had contact with anyone from the Artibonite
Valley, where the epidemic was first registered and has wreaked its most
ferocious damage.

Timothee said many of the patients hospitalized in the capital with cholera
are believed to have recently arrived from the Artibonite Valley, an
agricultural area where more than 6400 of Haiti's known 8138 cases have
been recorded.

At least 114 of the people suspected of having the disease in the capital
are in the Cite Soleil slum, the expansive ocean side shantytown at the
capital's far north eastern edge and its closest point to the valley.

Since its discovery in late October 2010, the disease has spread to half of
Haiti's 10 administrative regions, or departments. More than 200 people
have been hospitalized in the West department, where Port-au-Prince is located.

[Petit Goave, Carrefour, and Les Cayes are all west of Port-au-Prince and
can be seen on the interactive maps in the blog postings. Le Cays is also
substantially south of the previously affected areas. - Mod.LL]

Cholera in Petit Goave: additional context
------------------------------------------
From an HEAS [Haiti Epidemic Advisory System] partner:
"We have 15 cases in the last 8 days: 1 confirmed by laboratory and 14 by
epidemiological nexus. The 50 beds CTC [Cholera Treatment Center] will be
operational in a few days, but for the moment we have a triage and
treatment 7 beds unit at the Petit Goave hospital, where we are taking care
of the patients who need it."

Carrefour: 6 cases of cholera, 5 without travel history from Artibonite
----------------------------------------------------------------------
HEAS partner reports 6 cases of cholera in Carrefour treated today [8 Nov
2010], only 1 of which had traveled from Artibonite.

Les Cayes: hospitalized family of 4 with suspected cholera
----------------------------------------------------------
From an HEAS partner:
A family of 4 persons from Gran Riviere outside St Louis du Sud (not to be
confused with the outbreak in St Louis du Nord) became symptomatic. They
are now at Immaculee Conception, the departmental hospital. Specimens have
been sent to the LNSP [National Laboratory of Public Health] in
Port-au-Prince for confirmation. This family had not traveled to the
publicly acknowledged affected areas.

[The predictions of spread of cholera are unfortunately confirmed and it is
likely that before long the infection will be all over the country. It is
probably only a matter of time that cases will be found in the Dominican
Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispaniola. - Mod.LL
