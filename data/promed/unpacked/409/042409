At least 66 people people have died of Japanese encephalitis this year across Assam, chief minister Tarun Gogoi on Monday [27 Jul 2015] said.

"So far, 66 deaths have been reported from various districts in Assam. Though the severity is lesser this year than the previous years, we are taking it very seriously," Gogoi told reporters here.

The government has taken all precautionary measures like vaccination, distribution of mosquito nets, insecticides among others to stop further spread of the disease, he said.

[This is the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season in northeastern India, and the number of fatal cases in Assam state has increased from 22 on 21 Jul 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150722.3529096) to 66 just a week later. It is not clear from the above report if the 66 cases cited above are all laboratory confirmed as JEV infections. The numbers of reported JE cases in Assam have been increasing over several years. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of annual cases rose from 154 to 744, with deaths rising from 41-160, according to data from the Assam health department. The disease, which in 2009 was recorded in only half of the state's districts, now is seen in all of them. Doctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appeared largely from May to July but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150128.3126931).

Although mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination, the vaccination status of the 66 fatal cases is not given in the above report nor is the JE virus vaccination status of the population in the affected area. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
