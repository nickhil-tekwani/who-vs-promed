In my last mail I described that "The near future results of sequencing
will show you the relation of the gene to O/JPN/2000 isolated in third
outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture".
This sentence means the characterization of the PCR products is now
analyzed. So far nobody knows whether the viruses causing FMD outbreaks in
Miyazaki and Hokkaido are closely related each other or not.
The epidemiology of FMD in Japan is being under investigation. I would like
to ask ProMED-mail to accept my opinions.
