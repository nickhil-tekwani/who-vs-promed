Dozens of people have been hospitalized in Italy after eating pesto sauce contaminated with botulism bacteria. More than 50 people, who had eaten jarred pesto from a local producer, sought help at local hospitals after suffering symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and high fevers.

Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which produces the botulinum toxin which when ingested causes a life-threatening kind of food poisoning.

Health and food safety workers were inundated with calls through the weekend requesting information on the scare. The victims are almost all from the area around Genoa, the birthplace of the famous pasta sauce, the Italian newspaper La Republica reported. Six of those admitted, including 2 children, were kept in overnight for observation as further tests are carried out.

The local producer responsible for the outbreak has been growing the area's renowned basil for almost 2 centuries, but only recently started selling pre-prepared jars of the sauce. Bruzzone and Ferrari alerted health authorities on Fri 19 Jul 2013, pulling the jars from supermarket shelves.

The company said: "We made the discovery during our own tests and analysis of our fresh product, non-pasteurized product, which contains no preservatives." Local newspaper Il Secolo XIX reported on Sat 29 Jul 2013 Stefano Bruzzone, one of the company's owners, as saying: "In one sample, we found a level of substances which forced us to recall a whole batch of the product."

Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which produces the botulinum toxin. He told the paper they have done everything they should do to take care of their customers, spending 25 000 euros [USD 33 000] a year on laboratory analyses to avoid such episodes. He added that the tests were still in progress.

The name pesto comes from "pestello", the Italian word for the pestle, which was once used to grind basil, garlic and cheese into the well-loved sauce. The earliest known record of the sauce is from an 1865 cookbook "Genovese Recipes", in which it is defined as "beaten basil and garlic which is used to season pasta."

It's better to rely on locals who know their stuff, so I turned to our Italian food safety friend, Luca Bucchini, to clarify the alleged-botulism-in-pesto story. He writes:

There was probably no botulinum toxin in the Italian basil pesto that sent more than 100 people to the emergency departments across Italy. Of the 100, 10 have been initially hospitalized, but 8 were later sent home: none had symptoms which suggested botulism. While tests on products and humans are still pending, the toxin has yet to be found in any sample.

The company, Bruzzone and Ferrari, which has been producing basil for pesto for 2 centuries, had identified a "potentially pathogenic microorganism" in a lot of its pesto: it is widely believed that the organism was _C. botulinum_, the bacterium which can, under certain conditions, produce the lethal toxin. The product, which is a fresh sauce requiring refrigeration, was already on the market; when the shelf life of a product is relatively short and time required for testing is relatively long, products are shipped before the results of the testing are known. This procedure is often required by retailers. When Bruzzone and Ferrari realized that they had a positive finding for the pathogen, though not for the toxin, they decided to issue a recall; a public recall is uncommon in Italy.

Italy's Ministry of Health, usually stingy with information, issued a press release (http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_4_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=salastampa&p=comunicatistampa&id=4053) on 20 Jul 2013, calling the incident an "alarm" and explained that the botulinum toxin is potentially fatal. However, it failed to mention the retail brands under which the product was sold and did not offer advice to consumers, for example on when to seek medical care. Only the lot, the sell-by date, and the producer's name were mentioned; it was assumed that consumers are able to scan the back of the label and identify the small print needed to identify the producer. The press release also suggested that products were mostly off the shelf and the recall was limited. Ministry of Health press releases are immediately taken up by the main press agencies and automatically become major news.

It soon became apparent that 15 000 jars were affected, and that many consumers had eaten the product, which had been on the market for at least a week; there was no information for them in the official communication. Panic ensued. Officials communicated sparingly, with the exception of Liguria, the region where the company is based. Hospitals were slow to explain that no cases were confirmed and that people without symptoms did not need hospitalisation; the Facebook site of Bruzzone & Ferrari was the only formal source of information, with only a few independent media outlets providing further details. The affected lot had been sold under several brands, including those of Italy's top supermarket chains. The supermarket chains posted alert signs in shops and frantically e-mailed and phoned customers with loyalty cards to inform them of the recall; they probably hoped to avoid going public. As consumers reported about the calls received on Facebook and on other sites, some eventually capitulated and published on their website a recall notice, while others are still silent.

At this point, it seems likely that there was no toxin in most or all jars and that people sought medical attention for reasons unrelated to product content. Some suspect that other pathogens may be present; however, no specific information supports this suspicion, and reported symptoms by few patients (vomiting, diarrhea) may be unrelated to the exposure.

Nevertheless, the presence of the toxin in some jars cannot be excluded. The product does not appear to be heat-treated; it is part of a broad global trend to produce raw, semi-raw fresh products which require refrigeration. The pH of the product is permissive for growth of _C. botulinum_ (specifications: 4.8-5.8); it is rich in oil providing anaerobic conditions; it is used on pasta as a sauce without cooking; it has a shelf life of 30 days. While the product is to be refrigerated, the cold chain, especially in summer, with ambient temperatures above 30 C [86 F], is often not reliable; retailers often don't prioritise temperature control. Consumers may not understand the difference between shelf-stable pesto (which is more common) and the refrigerated variety, or underestimate the importance of refrigeration.

Overall, it is early to draw final conclusions from this episode. Hopefully, the results of the testing will be made public and confirm that there was no outbreak. It is perhaps time to question products which, while nicely fresh, depend on the cold chain for being safe from botulinum. It is quite clear that the authorities, and particularly the Ministry of Health, need risk communication training; consumers need to reliably identify products, get quickly rid of them, and not rush to the ER if they don't need to.

[The Barf Blog (http://barfblog.com/) reports outbreaks of foodborne disease. It is run by Dr Doug Powell and associates at Kansas State University.

The illnesses reported to have occurred are not classical botulism, which is a neurological disease caused by one of the neurotoxins (type A-F) blocking neuromuscular transmission. Types A, B and E are generally the ones seen in humans. No cases of clear-cut botulism have, as yet, been reported. It should be noted, however, that there are reports of predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms in mild disease, as noted in Sobell J, Malavet M, John S. Outbreak of clinically mild botulism type E illness from home-salted fish in patients presenting with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms. Clin Infect Dis. 2007; 45:e14-e16. doi: 10.1086/518993.

Many food product recalls that are botulism-related, as this one is, involve inadequate preparation conditions that would predispose to the production of the disease neurotoxin, not necessarily the finding of the toxin in the food. Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food. - Mod.LL
