New York: Jamestown Canyon virus identified in Clinton county
-----------------------------------------------
Efforts to identify West Nile virus in Clinton County have led to the
discovery of a new mosquito-borne virus in the area. A mosquito pool,
collected in the Beekmantown area, tested positive for Jamestown Canyon
virus, which is very similar to the better-known West Nile virus. [In fact,
West Nile virus and Jamestown Canyon virus are similar only in that they
are transmitted by mosquitoes. West Nile virus is a positive strand RNA
virus classified in the family _Flaviviridae_, whereas, Jamestown Canyon
virus is a negative strand RNA virus with a tripartite genome classified in
the family _Bunyaviridae_. - Mod.CP]

"We conduct seasonal mosquito surveillance and send samples to the New York
State Lab for identification and testing for West Nile virus and other
arboviruses," said Paula Calkins Lacombe, director of public health for the
Clinton County Health Department. The department has several areas
throughout the county, where it collects mosquitoes for submission. A
mosquito pool represents several mosquitoes collected at a specific time in
a specific location. More than 70 species of mosquitoes live in New York
state, but only a few harbor viruses potentially dangerous to humans.
"Medical literature describes the symptoms of Jamestown Canyon virus
infection in humans as a mild illness with fever," Calkins Lacombe said.
"The virus rarely causes viral meningitis and encephalitis in humans."
Jamestown Canyon virus is carried by an _Aedes_ species mosquito that likes
breeding in standing water found in trees stumps and wooded areas," said
Adam Bouchard, who conducts mosquito surveillance in Clinton County. "It's
a much larger mosquito [than the vector of West Nile virus] which is quite
common in the area."

Jamestown Canyon virus is one of [14 related viruses belonging to the virus
species _California encephalitis virus_. [This species is one of a large
number of species comprising the genus _Bunyavirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_ - Mod.CP]. The Clinton County find was the 1st in New York
state in 2004. "We were not completely surprised, since it has been
documented in most states," Bouchard said.

The incubation period for the virus to begin causing symptoms is between 5
and 15 days. Early symptoms include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
headaches, and abdominal pain. There is no vaccine for the virus itself,
but early treatment for the symptoms of the virus is usually successful.
Mammals, such as mice, chipmunks, and whitetail deer, may be carriers of
Jamestown Canyon virus, so, it is likely that the virus is located
throughout the county, Calkins Lacombe said. "Although this virus is not
considered to be an imminent public-health threat, residents are requested
to remain vigilant, since the peak mosquito season is late summer," she
added. With the region's recent increased rainfall, mosquito numbers are
high and likely to increase.

[The detection of Jamestown Canyon virus in New York state is probably a
consequence of increased surveillance for the presence of West Nile virus
rather than evidence of an enhanced or novel risk. - Mod.CP]
