The number of cases of pulmonary plague is increasing in Antananarivo. The Ministry of Public Health is stepping up its efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. The Ambohimiandra anti-plague hospital (CHAPA) admitted its 6th case yesterday, [Thu 21 Sep 2017].The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for the pneumonic plague was positive.[Wed 20 Sep 2017], in the early evening, another case was admitted. Shortly before this, a young man living in Manjakaray was also hospitalized. In total, therefore, there are 6 undergoing treatment in this hospital right now. Still considered as suspected cases of pneumonic plague, their sputum analyses were sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM) for confirmation.

These patients all live in the agglomeration of Antananarivo, namely Manjakaray, Andraisoro, Ankaraobato, Soavimasoandro and Ambohimanarina. The route of infection remains an enigma in some of the cases, while for others, it was transmitted by victims of pulmonary plague that killed 5 people in Toamasina and Antananarivo earlier .

At this rate, the CHAPA carrying capacity, limited to 8 patients, will soon be exceeded. The Ministry of Health has, therefore, requested the National Bureau of Risk Management and Disaster (BNGRC) quickly install a tent in the grounds of the hospital, if other cases arise. The team, who works hard to support the sick, will also be strengthened. The doctors reassured that the plague is easily treated. "If the case is diagnosed and treated in time, there is no risk of death. Patients are already discharged healthy, "said a doctor who strongly advises medical consultation in case of high fever, fatigue, cough, sputum streaked with blood or lymph nodes.

Since the end of August until [Sun 17 Sep 2017], 60 cases of plague, throughout Madagascar, were confirmed by the IPM, according to Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, director of Health Promotion. "Fifty have been treated and are alive. Ten have succumbed," he said, after the daily meeting of ministry staff on the plague season yesterday [Thu 21 Sep 2017]. He did not specify the number of victims of pneumonic plague. The Minister of Health, Professor Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, said [Mon 18 Sep 2017] that the victims of this epidemic of pulmonary plague amounted to 30 and 5 died.

Since [Wed 20 Sep 2017], volunteers and the Ministry of Health teams have conducted campaigns of disinfection and disinfestation in neighborhoods where there have been suspected cases and in hazardous locations. The active search for people in contact with the infected and the dead is also underway so that contact chemoprophylaxis [can be undertaken].

[The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403 (available at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997;337(10):677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at, http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread.
