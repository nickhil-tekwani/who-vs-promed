Measles outbreak in Johannesburg
--------------------------------
There is an outbreak of measles in Johannesburg, with 48 cases reported
this month [September 2009], the City of Johannesburg said on Tuesday [29
Sep 2009]. "Since the beginning of September, 48 measles cases have been
reported in Johannesburg. All the regions in the city are affected by the
outbreak," said spokesperson Nkosinathi Nkabinde. From January to August
[2009] there were 11 cases of confirmed measles reported.

"Some of the persons affected had one or 2 doses of measles vaccine,
meaning all persons are at risk of contracting measles." Anyone with a
fever, rash, running nose, red infected eyes, or cough should be
investigated for measles. "Measles is a serious disease that can cause,
deafness, brain damage, pneumonia, and even death," said Nkabinde. "Measles
can affect anyone, including adults. All cases of suspected measles must be
reported to the health department as failure to control the spread of
measles will result in unnecessary suffering and even death."

The health department will immunise all [contacts of] identified cases at
home, school, and at the workplace. The vaccine must be administered as
soon as possible after exposure to be effective, Nkabinde said.

"Although the 1st measles vaccination given at 9 months protects infants,
immunity acquired is not optimal due to the presence of maternal
antibodies. The 2nd dose administered at 18 months of age, provides another
chance to protect the children against measles, especially for those
children who did not respond to the 1st dose of the vaccine. About one of
every 10 children does not respond to the 1st dose of vaccine." Nkabinde
said the 2nd dose also served as a booster to increase antibody levels in
those with low antibody levels. After the 2nd dose, 99 per cent of children
are protected against measles. "Parents who have younger children who are
not attending school should please ensure that these children are fully
immunised. If you are not certain that your child is fully immunised,
please visit your local clinic."

Members of the public, especially medical personnel, traditional healers,
and training institutions, were urged to report all cases of suspected measles.
