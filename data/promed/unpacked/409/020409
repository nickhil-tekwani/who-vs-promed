The city's health authorities on [Wed 11 Jul 2018] confirmed that a 14-year-old boy who was admitted to a private hospital suffering from _Naegleria fowleri_, commonly known as 'brain-eating' amoeba, died on [Mon 9 Jul 2018].

Dr. Zafar Mehdi, head of the committee on Naegleria, told Dawn that 14-year-old [MN], a resident of Nazimabad No. 1, who had been brought to a private hospital and was tested positive for the lethal disease died after 3 days. He said the teenager was brought to the hospital in a critical condition.

Experts said the fatality rate of the lethal disease was 98 per cent. He was the 5th person in more than 2 months who died of the deadly disease.

Officials in the health ministry said the single-cell microorganism had killed 6 people last year [2017]. Officials said they had tested the water being supplied to the area and had found "no traces of chlorine" in it. Dr. Mehdi said the boy might have died because of performing ablution with unsafe and _Naegleria_-infected water.

Chlorination of water is the key method to kill the germ and keep the deadly disease at bay.

[This is the 5th reported case of Primary Amebic Meningo-encephalitis [PAM] in 2018 thus far. As the climate gets warmer, the case numbers go up every year, and are mainly concentrated in Karachi. However, as chlorination of water supplies is not a regular practice, possibility of 'missed' cases in other areas is also a concern. - Mod.UBA
