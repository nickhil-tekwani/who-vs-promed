PARAGONIMUS - USA (CALIFORNIA): EX JAPAN (03)

There are a number of species of Paragonimus which can infect humans. These
are as follows (according to geographical locales):
China: _P. westermani_, _P. skrjabini_, _P. heterotremus_ and _P.
hueitugensis_
Japan: _P. westermani_, _P. miyazakii_
Cameroon: _P. africanus_ and _P. uterobilateralis_
Vietnam: _P. heterotremus_
Ecuador and Peru: _P. mexicanus_
However, these parasites may be found in other countries as well. _P.
westermani_ is endemic in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines
and has been detected in other countries including India. The life cycle of
this trematode includes 2 intermediate hosts. The first are snails and the
second are crabs and crayfishes, where the infective stage of the parasite
(the metacercariae) are encysted. The major intermediate hosts which can
transmit the infection to humans are crabs of the genera Eriocheir, Potamon
and Sundathelphusa and crayfishes of the genus _Cambaroides_. If cooking of
these is proper before eating there is no chance of infection being
transmitted. Generally, in the endemic countries, crabs etc. are eaten
either raw, in alcohol, or undercooked and this then can easily transmit
the infection to humans.
After the ingestion of the cysts (metacercariae), they excyst in the
stomach and the larvae come out, penetrate the gut wall, and migrate
through the mesentery and diaphragm to reach the lungs, where they mature
into the adult worms and after fertilization start to lay eggs. This
normally takes about 3 months. The worms can lead to pulmonary
paragonimiasis or can also reach aberrant sites and can cause cerebral,
cutaneous paragonimiasis.
Diagnostic tests
----------------
- Detection of typical ova in blood-stained sputum. These can be detected
only after adult worms are mature -- that is, 3 months after infection.
- Detection of ova in stool in children.
- Detection of antibody: ELISA test has been developed and the one
developed by the CDC gives almost 96 per cent sensitivity. The test uses 8
kda antigen of the worm.
- Detection of antigen: This is better than antibody detection and gives
100 per cent sensitivity. This should also be positive earlier than
antibody detection, which takes at least 2 weeks to become positive.
- Skin test: more of an epidemiological tool
Therefore:
1. For an asymptomatic person it would be better to go for serology, as
this would be positive well before the worms mature and lay eggs.
2. If initial serology is negative it can be repeated after 10-14 days.
3. If serology is positive in a non-endemic area, take it to be probable
infection and it would be advisable to follow up and treat.
4. Regarding the moderator's previous query, I have no knowledge regarding
cases after flash-fried crabs, but it would be possible, as temperature
inside the muscle tissue of the crab may not reach the level necessary to
kill the metacercariae.
5. Earlier treatment should prevent scarring and sequelae.
I hope that this answers some of the queries raised.
