Visiting experts list possible causes of spoonbill deaths
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ducks or sludge in the Chiku Lagoon could be the source of botulism killing
endangered black-faced spoonbills in Tainan County, Japanese experts
investigating the bird deaths said yesterday.
Dead spoonbills were found beginning 09 Dec 2002. As of yesterday, 68
spoonbills had died after being infected with _C. botulinum_ toxin.
Shunji Kozaki, a veterinary professor of Osaka Prefecture University, and
Masato Takeda, who has dealt with recent botulism cases in birds in Japan,
arrived in Taiwan on Monday to help the Council of Agriculture (COA) manage
the crisis.
After carrying out a 2-day field investigation at Chiku Lagoon, the bird's
wintering site, the visiting experts, speaking at the Tainan County
Livestock Disease Control Center yesterday, offered possible reasons for
the botulism outbreak.
"Ducks from somewhere else, contaminated sludge, or high temperatures could
be what triggered the botulism outbreak," Takeda said. Takeda suggested
the local government sanitize the lagoon regularly and remove contaminated
sludge as soon as possible.
After meeting with the Japanese experts, officials at the center said they
would launch a project aimed at monitoring the environment of the bird's
wintering site soon. According to officials, the project would include an
analysis of physical properties of the environment, a study of the species,
an ecological survey on wild birds and pathogens, and immunological control
of botulism. The project will be sent to the COA for approval within 5
weeks, officials said.
Experts involved in the project would hail from diverse universities,
including National Cheng Kung University, National Taiwan Normal
University, and National Pingtung University of Science and Technology.
Takeda said that the spread of botulism in birds was seen in several places
in Japan, including Tokyo, Hokkaido and Miyazaki Prefecture.
Kozaki and Takeda will return to Japan on Monday, and the results of their
sludge analysis will be sent to Taiwan as soon as possible. They did not
rule out the possibility of revisiting the lagoon for further
study. Meanwhile, some legislators have been consulting experts from the
US in an effort to speed up the investigation into the deaths.
Yang Jiao-yen, assistant to DPP Legislator Eugene Jao, said yesterday that
the legislature's involvement reflects the slowness of the COA when it
comes to crisis management. "The situation could be more complex, because
some experts suspect that inappropriate feed was used at fish farms near
the lagoon, leading to eutrophication," Yang said. Experts suspect that
the combination of high temperatures and eutrophication resulted in the
spread of the _C. botulinum_ toxin, Yang said.
Some fishermen in the area have reportedly changed their feed to young fish
this year. In addition, Yang said, young fish purchased from China should
be examined.
10 black-faced spoonbills are receiving medical treatment at the center. In
addition, experts at the Nantou-based Taiwan Endemic Species Research
Institute are looking after 2 sick spoonbills, which are in a stable condition.
