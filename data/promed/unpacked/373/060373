The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thu 29 Nov [2018] that a dangerous tick capable of spreading diseases in humans and animals has been found in the United States.

The tick is indigenous to eastern China, Japan, eastern Russia, and Korea and was introduced in Australia, New Zealand, and several island nations in the western Pacific region. Called _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, or the Asian longhorned tick, the CDC said it can lead to hemorrhagic fever, Lyme disease, and a 25 percent reduction of production in dairy cattle.

"The full public health and agricultural impact of this tick discovery and spread is unknown," said Ben Beard, deputy director of CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. "In other parts of the world, the Asian longhorned tick can transmit many types of pathogens common in the USA. We are concerned that this tick, which can cause massive infestations on animals, on people, and in the environment, is spreading in the USA."

According to the CDC, the tick was 1st discovered in the USA in New Jersey in August 2017 on a sheep and again in the spring of 2018 in the same location. It was later found in other counties in New Jersey and in several other eastern states and Arkansas on 6 species of domestic animals, 6 species of wildlife, and humans.

Following the discovery, the CDC "expanded surveillance to determine the evolving distribution" of the tick.

The USDA Animal and Plant Inspection Service worked with the CDC to monitor the tick in the United States and search for any additional infestations. The agencies found that from August 2017 to September 2018, 53 reports of the Asian longhorned tick were made in the USA, with 23 from domestic animals, 15 from grass or vegetation, 13 from wildlife, and 2 from humans.

In addition to New Jersey, which had the most incidences, and Arkansas, the tick was found in Virginia, West Virginia, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Maryland. No illnesses were reported in humans or animals.

Examining data from years ago, the CDC retrospectively identified a tick found on a deer in West Virginia in 2010 and one collected from a dog in New Jersey in 2013 as the Asian longhorned tick.

[The above report provides a good overview of the presence of the Asian longhorned tick in the USA. Detection of this tick in 2010 and again in 2013 provides evidence that it had been in the USA for several years before it was identified in New Jersey in 2017. By whatever means -- birds or livestock movement or both -- the tick has been spread around and now is found in 9 states. It doubtless is now established in the eastern USA. As noted earlier, either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. Fortunately, so far there is no evidence for this tick transmitting the tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. All tests for the presence of these pathogens in the ticks have been negative so far. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional longhorned ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
