Abdel Rahman Shahin, the official spokesman of the [Egyptian]
Ministry of Health, announced the death of a 40-year-old man, a
resident of Dakahlia province, as a result of bird flu [avian
influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection].

Shahin stated that the total number of cases of the disease in Egypt
is now 119, and there have now been 40 deaths since the onset of the
disease in Egypt in 2006. The death of the 40-year-old man from
Dakahlia is the 1st death in 2011.

[The same information was received from ProMED-mail correspondent
Mary Marshall, together with an additional comment from Michael
Coston that: "Details, such as the date of onset, length of illness,
or route of infection are awaited. This is the 6th human H5N1
infection reported by Egyptian Officials in the past 3 weeks."

A list of the cases and deaths occurring during 2010 (compiled by
FluTrackers) was included in the preceding post in this thread, see:
"Avian influenza, human: Egypt, 117 & 118th cases & list
20110102.0019". These data together with the current report indicate
that the frequency of human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus
infection in Egypt has increased in recent weeks, whereas it remains
relatively stable elsewhere.
