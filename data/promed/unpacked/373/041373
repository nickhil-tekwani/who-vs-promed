Dr. David Heymann, who formerly headed WHO's emergencies department, told The Associated Press (AP) that the leading theory to explain the spread of the disease was sexual transmission at raves held in Spain and Belgium. Monkeypox has not previously triggered widespread outbreaks beyond Africa, where it is endemic in animals.

"We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission," said Heymann.

That marks a significant departure from the disease's typical pattern of spread in central and western Africa, where people are mainly infected by animals like wild rodents and primates and outbreaks have not spilled across borders.

Health officials say most of the known cases in Europe have been among men who have sex with men, but anyone can be infected through close contact with a sick person, their clothing or bedsheets. Scientists say it will be difficult to disentangle whether the spread is being driven by sex or merely close contact.

"By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, whatever a person's sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission," said Mike Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London.

On Monday [23 May 2022], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Director Andrea Ammon said, "the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities among persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high."

To date, WHO has recorded more than 90 cases of monkeypox in a dozen countries, including Canada, Spain, Israel, France, Switzerland, the United States and Australia.

On Monday [23 May 2022], Denmark announced its 1st case, Portugal revised its total upwards to 37, Italy reported one further infection and Britain added 37 more cases.

US health officials said Monday [23 May 2022] they knew of one confirmed case, in the state of Massachusetts, and 4 probable cases -- 2 in Utah, one in Florida and one in New York City. All were men who had traveled outside the United States.

Germany has 4 confirmed cases linked to exposure at "party events...where sexual activity took place" in Spain's Canary Islands and in Berlin, according to a government report to lawmakers obtained by the AP.

Madrid's senior health official said Monday [23 May 2022] that the Spanish capital had 30 confirmed cases. Enrique Ruiz Escudero said authorities are investigating possible links between a recent Gay Pride event in the Canary Islands, which drew some 80 000 people, and cases at a Madrid sauna.

The monkeypox cases so far have been mild, with no deaths reported. Typically, the virus causes fever, chills, rash and lesions on the face or genitals. Most people recover within several weeks without requiring hospitalization.

Vaccines against smallpox, a related disease, are effective in preventing monkeypox and some antiviral drugs are being developed. In recent years, the illness has been fatal in up to 6% of infections [about 1% for the West African clade that is circulating currently in this outbreak. No fatalities have been reported yet. - Mod.TY].

Heymann chaired an urgent meeting of WHO's advisory group on infectious disease threats on Friday [20 May 2022] to assess the outbreak and said there was no evidence to suggest that monkeypox had mutated into a more infectious form.

The UN agency said the outbreak is "a highly unusual event" and said the fact that cases are being seen in so many different countries suggests the virus may have been silently spreading for some time. The agency's Europe director warned that festivals and parties could accelerate spread.

Still, at a public session on Monday [23 May 2022], WHO officials described the outbreak as "containable" and cautioned against stigmatizing affected groups, saying the disease can infect anyone.

The agency said the cases appeared to be linked to a monkeypox virus that was first detected in exported cases from Nigeria to Britain, Israel and Singapore in 2018 and 2019.

Authorities in Britain, Spain and Portugal have said most of the cases identified so far were in young men whose infections were picked up when they sought help for lesions at sexual health clinics.

Heymann, who is also a professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the monkeypox outbreak was likely a random event that might be traceable to a single infection. "It's very possible there was somebody who got infected, developed lesions on the genitals, hands or somewhere else, and then spread it to others when there was sexual or close, physical contact," Heymann hypothesized. "And then there were these international events that seeded the outbreak around the world, into the United States and other European countries."

He emphasized that the disease was unlikely to trigger widespread transmission. "This is not COVID," he said. "We need to slow it down, but it does not spread in the air and we have vaccines to protect against it."

Heymann said studies should be conducted rapidly to determine if monkeypox could be spread by people without symptoms and that populations at risk of the disease should take precautions to protect themselves.

Another 14 monkeypox patients have been spotted in England as the tropical virus continues to sweep the world amid fears it may have mutated to spread easier between humans. UK Health Security Agency bosses (UKHSA) have now confirmed 71 cases in the unprecedented global outbreak. At least one child has been sickened so far -- but no one has died. Officials have also warned the worst may still be to come.

Officials said a "notable proportion" have occurred among gay and bisexual men but have not provided an exact breakdown. No gender or age details have been shared either. Dr Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser, said new monkeypox cases were being spotted "promptly" due to "extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks."

There are 19 countries across the world -- mainly in Europe -- that have already detected the smallpox-like virus, sparking concerns it may have learned to spread easier among humans. Infections are only detected sporadically outside of west and central Africa, where the virus is endemic in animals. Although, imported outbreaks have always fizzled out naturally after a few cases.

Fears were fuelled today [24 May 2022] after analysis of the 1st few sickened patients suggested the virus has evolved "far more" than expected. Portuguese scientists warned an "evolutionary jump" -- like what happened with COVID -- may have created a "hyper-mutated virus."

Health chiefs are alarmed about the cluster of cases. Yesterday [23 May 2022] experts warned that monkeypox could spread to pets and wildlife and become endemic in Europe. A WHO official yesterday claimed the leading theory explaining the spread of the disease was sexual behaviour at 2 raves held in Belgium and Spain.

And Dr. David Heymann, who formerly headed the WHO's emergencies department, said the monkeypox outbreak was a "random event" that might be explained by sexual behaviour at 2 recent events in Spain and Belgium. The Gran Canarian pride festival, held between 5-15 May [2022] and attended by 80 000 people from Britain and across Europe, is being investigated after being linked to numerous monkeypox cases.

UKHSA teams are contacting people considered to be high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and advising them to self-isolate at home for 3 weeks and avoid contact with children. They are also being offered the Imvanex vaccine, which was designed for smallpox. Although not purposefully made for monkeypox, the jab -- made by Danish-based Bavarian Nordic -- is up to 85% effective because the 2 viruses are so similar.

[The report of a monkeypox (MPX) virus infection in a child is new. Previous reports of MPX outside of Africa during this outbreak indicate that the cases are in adult men and one woman. A positive case of monkeypox has been confirmed in Hertfordshire, health chiefs have said. What is believed to be the county's 1st case is now one of 20 confirmed in England as fears continue to grow over the disease (https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/20159329.monkeypox-case-confirmed-hertfordshire/). Presumably, this case is one of the new cases reported in the UK. - Mod.TY]

In a follow-up on the monkeypox clusters in Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) informs that 14 more cases of human infection by monkeypox virus have been confirmed in Portugal, with 37 confirmed cases so far in the North, Lisbon and Tagus Valley and Algarve regions.

The new cases were confirmed by the National Institute of Health Doctor Ricardo Jorge (INSA). Among the available samples, the West African clade (subgroup of the virus), which is the least aggressive, was identified through sequencing.

The identified cases remain under clinical follow-up, and are stable and on an outpatient basis. Epidemiological investigations of suspected cases that are being detected are ongoing, with the aim of identifying transmission chains and potential new cases and their respective contacts.

Individuals with ulcerative lesions, rash, palpable lymph nodes, possibly accompanied by fever, chills, headache, muscle pain and tiredness, should seek medical advice.

Measures to be implemented in case of suspicious symptoms are reinforced, and individuals must refrain from direct physical contact with other people and from sharing clothing, towels, sheets and personal objects while skin lesions are present, at any stage, or other symptoms.

The spread of monkeypox also affects France. So far in the country, 3 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported Public Health France (SPF) said Monday, 23 May [2022], in a statement.

Confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox have been identified in several European countries -- United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Denmark -- as well as in Australia, Canada and the United States -- a "unusual" spread according to experts.

There are currently "less than 200 confirmed and suspected cases" in non-endemic countries, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, in charge of the fight against COVID-19 at the World Health Organization but also emerging diseases and zoonoses, on Monday [23 May 2022].

The Czech Republic detected its 1st case of monkeypox on Tuesday [24 May 2022] in a woman returning from a festival in Belgium, officials said on Tuesday. The patient was being treated at Prague's Central Military Hospital, the head of the Czech Infectious Medicine Society (SIL) Pavel Dlouhy said, confirming the case, which had earlier been reported by news website Seznam Zpravy.

The National Institute of Public Health (SZU) said a sample from one of 3 people tested had been positive, although final testing results would be confirmed next week. The 2 other suspected patients' tests were also still being worked on, it said.

It said the 1st patient had attended a music festival in Antwerp at the start of May [2022] and began showing symptoms after her return. Several other European countries have reported their 1st confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox.

The outbreaks are raising alarm because monkeypox, which spreads through close contact and was first found in monkeys, mostly occurs in west and central Africa, and only very occasionally spreads elsewhere.

Slovenia's health authorities on Tuesday [24 May 2022] confirmed the alpine country's 1st case of monkeypox infection in a traveller who had returned from the Canary Islands in Spain. The man was not hospitalised because he was infected by a mild version of the West African strain of the viral disease, Mario Fafangel, the head of the national Centre for Infectious Diseases, told a news conference.

Fafangel said he believed the chain of transmission in Slovenia would be stopped quickly, adding that people who have been in contact with an infected person should be on alert over the next 21 days. There was no need for the wider population to get vaccinated, he added, except for those handling the virus in laboratories.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/norway-reports-visitor-to-oslo-had-monkeypox-infection-tracking-has-started-31661/


The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has received information that a foreign person who visited Oslo from 6 to 10 May 2022 has since had monkeypox confirmed in his home country. The infected person is a traveling person from a European country where there is an outbreak of monkeypox.

Oslo Municipality is now working with the National Institute of Public Health to map who may have been exposed to infection, in order to provide information to those concerned. The National Institute of Public Health is also in contact with the health service in the person's home country to further map where the person has been during their stay in Oslo.

Any close contacts of the infected person will be contacted and asked to be observant of symptoms of monkeypox. The most common symptoms are fever and general malaise followed by rash and swelling of the lymph nodes.

Infection with monkeypox most often occurs through direct contact infection, but indirect contact infection (via bedding and the like) and droplet infection can occur. In order for droplet infection to occur, close contact over a longer period of time (hours) is usually required.

It is not unexpected that people infected with monkeypox have been to Norway, and the health service must be prepared for that, says Preben Aavitsland, chief physician at the National Institute of Public Health. The National Institute of Public Health has made routines and recommendations for how the health service should handle people who may be infected.

"We now assist Oslo Municipality in informing those with whom the traveler had close contact during the stay. It is too early to assess the risk of any of them being infected. The risk of infection to the general population is considered very low," says Aavitsland.

In Morocco, 3 suspected cases of monkeypox have been recorded, but no case has been confirmed so far, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection announced Monday [23 May 2022]. "The 3 suspected cases are in good health, benefiting from the necessary medical supervision," said the coordinator of the National Center for Emergency Public Health Operations of the Ministry of Health, Mouad Mrabet, in a statement to the press.

He stressed that the 3 cases have been submitted to medical analysis pending the results, noting that the health executives have received training on the disease of monkeypox, which has never been detected in the Kingdom.

The Ministry of Health and Social Protection, he said, has established an emergency interaction system in response to the international alert on monkeypox. This system defines the cases of the disease as suspected, probable or confirmed, as well as the procedure to follow for the health protection and treatment of contact cases, he explained.

The establishment of this system comes, said the official, as part of the proactive strategy adopted by the Ministry to address emergency and warning situations related to public health.

Salt Lake County Health Department officials announced Monday morning [23 May 2022] that 2 adults in the same Salt Lake County household are suspected to have monkeypox based on preliminary testing. The 2 infected individuals traveled to an area in Europe earlier this month [May 2022] that is "currently experiencing monkeypox cases" and became symptomatic afterward, county health officials advised.

"Both individuals are in isolation and do not present a risk to the public," officials said in a news release. "They are experiencing mild illness and are expected to recover fully."

Dr. Angela Dunn, executive director of Salt Lake County Health Department, said Monday [23 May 2022] that the presumably infected pair went to a primary care doctor on Friday [20 May 2022] and were instructed to isolate. Within 24 hours, Dunn said, health officials knew the pair had some sort of orthopoxvirus -- the family of virus that contains monkeypox and smallpox. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing the samples to confirm a monkeypox diagnosis, Dunn said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/health/monkeypox-vaccines.html


As more than a dozen countries grapple with outbreaks of monkeypox, health officials worldwide are rushing to assess reserves of vaccines and treatments that may be needed to contain the spread.

The US emergency stockpile holds 2 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration that could be used to contain monkeypox, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters on Monday [23 May 2022].

The stockpile contains more than 100 million doses of the original smallpox vaccine. But that vaccine is associated with side effects and shouldn't be given to certain patients, including those who are immunocompromised.

A newer vaccine, called Jynneos, was approved in 2019 for prevention of both smallpox and monkeypox. More than 1000 doses are held in the stockpile, Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a deputy director at the CDC, said.

The situation overseas is more concerning. As of Monday [23 May 2022], there were more than 100 confirmed cases in 14 countries outside Africa, and dozens more under investigation. That day, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control urged health officials in Europe to assess the availability of smallpox vaccines, antivirals and personal protective equipment.

The World Health Organization is holding stockpiles of about 31 million smallpox vaccine doses, but they may have lost some potency in the decades since they were made.

In any event, mass immunization campaigns are unlikely in any country, including the United States, several experts said. And the outbreaks are unlikely to warrant such a campaign.

Instead, officials may recommend immunizing a circle of close contacts around those found to be infected -- an approach called ring vaccination that has been used to suppress other outbreaks of rare diseases.

In addition to vaccines for prevention, the United States has procured more than 2 million doses of an antiviral pill called tecovirimat, which is approved to treat smallpox in those who become infected, according to the CDC. The agency is also working with the drug's manufacturer to develop an intravenous form.

Monkeypox could spread to pets and wildlife and become endemic in Europe, health officials warned yesterday [23 May 2022].

In Africa, where monkeypox is endemic, or well established, the virus is often in rodents, including squirrels and dormice. [These are suspected but not proven reservoir species. The pouched rat _Crycetomys gambiensis_ is experimentally susceptible to infection with MPX virus, but objective evidence of maintenance of the virus in nature by them, rope squirrels and door mice is lacking. - Mod.TY]

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said rodents and squirrels could be "suitable hosts" and a "spillover event," where the virus spreads from people to pets to wildlife, could see monkeypox become endemic in Europe.

The report states: "Currently, little is known about the suitability of European peri-domestic (mammalian) animal species to serve as a host for monkeypox virus. However, rodents, and particularly species of the family of Sciuridae (squirrels) are likely to be suitable hosts, more so than humans (see disease background), and transmission from humans to (pet) animals is theoretically possible. Such a spillover event could potentially lead to the virus establishing in European wildlife and the disease becoming an endemic zoonosis."

However, it said the probability of this happening was "very low."

[The likelihood of MPX virus infecting pets with ongoing transmission to wild mammals such as squirrels is unknown. The susceptibility of pet mammals has not been determined, nor has the susceptibility of wild rodents with which the pets might be in contact. Spillover of the virus to wild mammals and maintenance in them is very speculative at this point and will remain so until laboratory studies of susceptibility or evidence of infection in wild populations has been determined. When MPX virus was introduced into the USA in rodents imported from Ghana, it spread to pet prairie dogs in contact with these imported rodents and then onward to their owners. There was no transmission from these infected prairie dogs or infected people on to wild squirrels, although grey and fox squirrels were common in the localities where infected people and prairie dogs were found. - Mod.TY]
