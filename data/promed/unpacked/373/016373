Pending final serology, 5 cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) have
been diagnosed in the vicinity of Thibodaux and Morgan City, Louisiana
(including St. Mary, Terrebone and Lafourche Parishes). Three cases were
diagnosed the week of 5/10/99 with two additional cases the week of 5/17/99.
Although serology is not complete, preliminary IFA (total IgG)
[immunoflurescent antibody was positive for EEE in all animals. (Testing
is being performed by the Louisiana Office of Public Health.) All of these
equines were in the age range of 11-40 months (approximately 1-3 yrs) and
were otherwise thought to be in good health prior to infection. One had
been vaccinated for EEE in Sept. 1998, reinforcing the recommendation here
of immunizing every 6 months, especially in young animals.
Dr. Melvin Elliott, of the Thibodaux Animal Clinic, reports classic EEE
symptoms in these horses, including lack of appetite, seizure, ataxia,
drooling, staggering (although most were unable to walk), hanging lower
lip, pressing of the head against fence or building, profuse sweating and
fever as high as 109F (42.78C).
Although Dr. Elliott personally treated only these 5 animals (all of which
died or had to be euthanized), he estimates that an additional 14-15 horses
with seizure or high fever have been euthanized in the Thibodaux area by
owners unable or unwilling to seek veterinary assistance.
This is an unusually early onset of EEE in Louisiana. Equine cases, if
present, typically begin to appear in late June or early July. Possible
climactic associations include a very mild winter in 1998-99 and relatively
dry 1999 so far. Entomological data are not yet available.

Elliott, veterinarian, Thibodaux Animal Clinic, Thibodaux, Louisiana.)
