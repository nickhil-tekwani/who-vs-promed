The FMD scare spread to central Asia Friday, when Russia joined Europe in
throwing up defenses to block the dreaded animal virus from jumping the
English Channel.
As the disease sprang up in virtually every corner of Britain, including
Northern Ireland, requiring mass incineration of herds, fears grew in the
rest of Europe that livestock may already have been contaminated by the
rampant infection. But as of Friday, no FMD cases had been reported outside
Britain.
After the first case was confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday, the
neighboring Irish Republic found itself in the front lines of the battle to
stave off the highly contagious "sub-type 0" strain of the virus.
Russia slapped a blanket ban on all cattle and meat product imports from
Britain, having already tightened control of meat imports from a number of
other European countries through which British products may have been imported.
In Austria, meanwhile, the government on Friday advised its citizens not to
travel to Britain until the current wave of disease has cleared up. "The
advice is not to go to Britain unless it is absolutely necessary," said
Austrian health ministry spokesman Gerald Grosz, as disinfectant carpets
were rolled out at Vienna airport to meet passengers arriving from Britain.
Foot-and-mouth is largely a financial scourge, spreading like wildfire
through herds of sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs, requiring their mass
destruction, but leaving human health relatively untouched, although humans
serve as effective carriers.
A European Commission spokesman meanwhile said no decision had been made
for the mass vaccination of EU herds against FMD, while London said at
least 36 [outbreak sites in the United Kingdom have now been confirmed.
"This would only be the worst case scenario," he said, adding that "so far
scientists and veterinarians say at this stage it's not necessary.
Vaccination would only be the very, very last step to take."
He said the EU has 50 million doses of FMD vaccine ready, but only 8.5
million for the "sub-type O" variety on the move in Britain, in addition to
several hundred thousand doses ready in Britain.
"From a scientific point of view, the situation is under control because
there are clear links between all these outbreaks," he added. "Vaccination
at this point is not necessary."

French Muslims cautioned over Foot-and-Mouth disease threat
-------------------------------------------
Muslims in France were urged to exercise extreme caution in the sacrificial
slaughter of sheep for the Eid al-Adha feast due to the threat of FMD. The
Union of Islamic Organizations in France (UIOF) asked Muslims to use only
abattoirs approved by government authorities to slaughter animals for the
5-6 Mar 2001 festival marking the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca.
The French government on Thursday suggested Muslims forego the ritual
slaughter in areas where there was a shortage of sheep due to a destruction
of livestock ordered to prevent the spread of FMD.
Earlier this week, the French government announced it would destroy some 50
000 sheep either imported from Britain -- where 32 separate outbreaks of
the highly-contagious disease have been confirmed -- or animals which had
come in contact with them.
Belgium banned the slaughter of all sheep and lambs, even for religious
purposes.
In Germany, the price of sheep more than doubled, prompting many of
Germany's 3.2 million Muslims to reconsider plans for the festival. "The
problem is that we can hardly find any sheep," said Hasan Oezdogan,
chairman of Germany's Islamic Council.
Members of the Muslim community in Britain were urged to carry out annual
sacrifices, or Qurbani, on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, outside the country
this year. The feast, also known as Eid al-Kebir, is the second biggest
holiday in Islam after Eid al-Fitr, celebrating the end of the month of
Ramadan.
France's UIOF said in its open letter to Muslims that it endorsed any
decision which would help protect consumers, although it deplored acts
"dictated by panic." "If a ban proves necessary, it should ... be imposed
for the appropriate length of time and not just until after the Muslim
feast," it said.
The French government said while there presently appeared no need to ban
ritual slaughter, there would likely be a shortage of animals this year due
to the large numbers taken off the market for destruction. The government
statement was issued after Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant met leaders of
the Muslim community in France.
After that meeting, the assistant to the head of the Paris Mosque, Sheikh
Al Sid, described the situation as "very dramatic." Al Sid said up to 200
000 sheep are slaughtered annually in France on the occasion of Eid al-Adha.
France has more than 4 million Muslim. Muslim charities such as Bait al Mal
al Islami have made alternative arrangements in a number of countries,
including encouraging believers to send money overseas to have a sheep
sacrificed on their behalf.
In the Netherlands, for example, a Muslim opting for this solution must
send 78 dollars to have a sheep sacrificed in Kosovo, while in Morocco the
sacrifice would cost 105 dollars, and in Somalia 36 dollars.
