At least 30 people died from cholera in Jigawa State in the past month, an official has said. The Jigawa casualties add to the increasing death toll from the disease across Nigeria. Other states that have reported deaths from cholera in the past few weeks include Enugu, Benue, Plateau, and Bayelsa.

The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health in Jigawa, Salisu Mu'azu, said the deaths were from the over 2000 patients who tested positive for the disease in 9 of the 27 local government areas [LGAs] of the state. Hadejia and Dutse LGAs are the most affected, he said.

He blamed open defecation for the spread of the disease. "Specifically, in Hadejia LGA, the outbreak was due to open defecation from a nearby almajiri school that contaminated a water source," he said.

The state government has shut down the water source pending further investigation, the official said. Rainfall washes faeces and other wastes into wells and water outlets that the residents use for domestic purposes. Mr Mu'azu said the state government has directed the release of free drugs to the victims for immediate medical attention. UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders have indicated readiness to partner with the state in mitigating the scourge from further spreading.

Ramatu Aliyu, minister of state for the federal capital territory (FCT), says the 6 area councils have recorded 604 suspected cases of cholera with 54 deaths. Speaking when she launched the community sensitisation on cholera and other disease outbreaks at the palace of Mohammed Bello Umar, Agora of Zuba on Saturday [17 Jul 2021], she expressed concern over the rising cases of cholera. According to Daily Trust, she said the FCT recorded the suspected cases and deaths along with 9 positive cases for cholera on rapid diagnostic test from May 2021.

Aliyu said more than 120 communities across the 6 area councils are involved, with AMAC having the highest number of cases followed by Gwagwalada and Bwari area councils. She called for good personal hygiene as well as proper disposal of sewage and refuse, good handwashing practices, and consumption of safe water, which, she said, is a means of curbing further spread of the disease in the territory.

Some states across the country have in recent times been battling cholera outbreak.

As many as 66 fresh cases of cholera were reported from Abheypur and Buddanpur villages at General Hospital, Sector 6, on Sunday [18 Jul 2021], taking the total to 409 cases in 4 days. Of the 66 patients, 47 were children, said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar. Those who have been discharged are under supervision of the onsite camp members, Kumar added. She said chlorine, ORS, and related medicines are being distributed at houses.

The public health engineering department and Huda on Sunday [18 Jul 2021] continued the work to repair water pipes in the villages. Water is being supplied in the villages through tankers. The team has also started examining the faulty water connections taken by villagers. Sources claimed many villages had punctured the pipes to draw water illegally, one of the probable reasons behind the contamination.

The inquiry report into the death of the 9-year-old child is yet to be submitted.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64)."
