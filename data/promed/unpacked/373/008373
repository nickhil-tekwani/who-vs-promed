Indonesia finds H5N1 infected but healthy chickens
--------------------------------------------------
Indonesian health authorities have found chickens which tested
positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus but which appear to be healthy,
a sign that the bug may become harder to detect, officials in Hong
Kong and Jakarta said.
Some species of waterfowl, like ducks and geese, are natural hosts of
H5N1 and do not fall ill from it. But the virus has always been known
to be virulent in chickens, which fall sick quickly and die within 24
hours of contracting it.
Hong Kong's Health Minister York Chow said authorities in Indonesia
had found infected chickens which were asymptomatic.
"As the virus may have spread so widely (in Indonesia), chickens have
now become hosts," Chow told reporters in Hong Kong on Wednesday [5
Oct 2005]. He did not give other details.
"We are worried that if there are infected chickens which don't show
any symptoms, then if we are in close contact with them, the chances
of humans getting infected will be higher."
Mathur Riady, director general of the poultry department at
Indonesia's agriculture ministry, confirmed the report.
"... we have also learned that, in the case of the virus in birds,
they can be affected, but they won't die," he told Reuters in
Jakarta. "They even show no clinical symptoms."
Leo Poon, a microbiologist at the Chinese University in Hong Kong,
said the discovery of the H5N1-infected but asymptomatic chickens was
bad news but that more information was needed.
There are many different strains of H5N1. Many have low pathogenicity
and are relatively harmless, and only some have proven to be deadly
for birds and humans.
"We don't have all the information, and they could have just found a
low pathogenic strain of H5N1 in the chickens. Or this could be a
highly pathogenic strain but which has adapted itself in chickens or
turned less virulent," Poon said. "But the more chickens are
infected, the higher the chance of the virus spilling over to
humans," he said.
Bird flu has killed more than 60 people in 4 Asian nations since late
2003 and has been found in birds in Russia and Europe.
Experts' greatest fear is that H5N1, which has a documented mortality
rate of about 50 percent, could set off a pandemic if it gains the
ability to be passed easily among people.
In Indonesia, officials have said that 5 people are believed to have
died from H5N1. The World Health Organization puts the number of dead
at 3, based on Hong Kong tests, and says there is a 4th case of a boy
who has the disease but is alive and in stable condition.

[It is not clear which test has been carried out in the "asymptomatic
chickens which tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu," and why. In
case the test was a serological one, there could have been various
reasons for the lack of clinical symptoms: a low-pathogenic virus,
natural resistance of the birds, or their immunity. Such an immunity
could have been established also by a heterologous H5 virus, either a
wild one or a vaccine strain (mass vaccinations are reportedly being
carried out in Indonesia). Obviously, background epidemiological
details, as well as data on the virus itself, are necessary before an
evaluation of the Indonesian H5N1 virus strain and hypotheses on
public-health implications can be made. It would help if such
information were obtained directly from Indonesia. - Mod.AS]
