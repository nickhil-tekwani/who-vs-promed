MENINGITIS & MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION - TEXAS, USA
==================================================
[This item refers to the query at the end of the report on
"Meningitis & invasive meningococcal infection - Florida, USA",
promed archive.960119, asking subscribers whether they were
recently seeing any increases in meningococcal disease.]

In response to the posting by Richard Hopkins, yes, we have seen a
substantial increase in meningococcal meningitis in eastern Texas
compared to previous years. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips
but this was well documented in 1995 and investigated by CDC. Anyone
from Texas Dept. of Health care to fill in the specifics?
