Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 26
----------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 29 Jul 2005, laboratory evidence now shows that the 8-year-old
girl from Tangerang, Banten Province, is a probable avian influenza A/H5
case, based on analysis of serological samples. 2 WHO Reference
Laboratories at the University of Hong Kong and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention USA, detected high positive rising
micro-neutralisation titres specific for H5N1 in 2 samples taken 3 days apart.
She was the daughter of the confirmed case reported previously:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_07_21a/en/index.html>. Laboratory results
for the 1-year-old daughter are still pending. Genotyping of the
PCR-amplified isolate from the confirmed case shows high homogeneity with
other H5N1 isolates from poultry in Java, and no evidence of reassortment
[of genome sub-units].
Extensive epidemiological and environmental studies are ongoing around this
family cluster. The Minister of Agriculture stated that laboratory results
detected H5-infected bird faeces in a bird cage on the side of the road
opposite the family's house; cloacal and throat swabs of the pet bird
inside the cage were negative for H5. This is the 1st, and, thus far, the
only, indication of a possible source of exposure. Other environmental
sampling was negative.
The Ministry of Health is continuing to monitor over 300 contacts. None
have shown any symptoms to date. Seroprevalence results are still pending.
Surveillance has been intensified in affected areas and throughout the
country. 44 referral hospitals have been identified and are being prepared
to receive possible cases. Health education campaigns are being conducted
nationwide.
The government has reinforced coordination between relevant government
bodies, including the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and is
monitoring the situation in close collaboration with the World Health
Organization.

[The 8-year-old daughter now testing H5-positive was the initial case. The
source of the infection remains a mystery, since the affected family live
in a suburb of Jakarta remote from rural areas, and tests on caged pet
birds in an adjacent dwelling, suspected to be carriers of the virus, have
proven to be negative. - Mod.CP]
