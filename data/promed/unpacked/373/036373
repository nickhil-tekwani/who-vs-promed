With the opening of school approaching, an outbreak of an infectious
intestinal disease in Hampden County has prompted state and local health
officials to issue warnings about the importance of proper hand washing.
Over the past 2 weeks, the number of cases of shigellosis has jumped from
24 to nearly 100 in several cities and towns within the county, according
to Dr. Bella T. Matyas, medical director for the state Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control.
"It can spread very rapidly," Matyas said Monday.
Shigellosis can cause flu-like symptoms including diarrhea, fever and
vomiting.
The main preventive measure is careful hand washing after using the
toilet. "That's really the key," he said. "It takes a very few organisms to
pass on the disease."
Some of this summer's victims have had to receive emergency room treatment
for severe diarrhea, but none has required more than an overnight hospital
stay, Matyas and other health officials said.
So far, all of the cases have involved person-to-person contact within
families or social groups, he said.
The spread of the disease is slower with that type of outbreak than when
transmitted through infected food or drinking water, he said, describing
the progression of the disease in Hampden County this summer as "very
typical."
A similar outbreak in 1991 ended up sickening more than 1000 people in the
county and was carried by victims to other states.
And as the number of infected people increases, the chances also increase
of someone being stricken who is in a position to infect large numbers of
people, such as food service, health and day care workers.
During the summer, state and local health officials kept a close watch on
summer camps, because of their vulnerability to the disease, he said. "It
was a success. We've had no outbreaks at summer camps," he said. "Now we
will be turning the focus on schools and day care centers."
Hampden County and Brookline have been the only areas of the state to
report outbreaks of shigellosis this summer, he said. The Brookline
outbreak was limited to about 24 people in a religious community.
