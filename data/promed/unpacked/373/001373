YELLOW FEVER - COTE D'IVOIRE

Two cases of deadly and untreatable yellow fever have been reported
in the Cote d'Ivoire in the last week, and health officials fear that
the outbreak could quickly spread if funds are not raised for a
widespread vaccination campaign.
Yellow fever is a viral disease spread by mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_
- Mod.TY]. Epidemics can spread to an average 20 per cent of people
in affected areas, 50 per cent of whom may die, according to the
United Nations World Health Organisation (WHO). There is no treatment
for people already infected, but a simple vaccination can stop the
disease in its tracks.
The early symptoms of the disease are similar to malaria, making it
hard to recognise, experts say. After experiencing fever, muscle
pain, and nausea, an infected person will either recover, or relapse
into jaundice, bleeding from the eyes, nose and mouth, kidney
failure, and death.
"The most important thing is to do an investigation, and then to
vaccinate all the population in the immediate zone. Then, there must
be a wider vaccination of other people who may have come into contact
with the infection," Kone Souleymane, WHO spokesperson in Abidjan
said.
Public health officials in the Cote d'Ivoire also need to be taught
how to manage the outbreak, a statement released on Wednesday by WHO
warning about the outbreak said.
The WHO has launched an appeal for CFA 430m (USD 806 000) to buy
sufficient vaccine to inoculate 650 000 people.
"If nothing is done in the next 3 months to stem the yellow fever
epidemic, the illness could spread, taking into account the mobility
of populations," Dr. Genevieve Saki-Nekouressi, yellow fever expert
at WHO said. "It is necessary to put a vaccination team in place as
soon as possible."
One of the cases discovered last week was recorded in a 30-year-old
man in Korhogo, which is in the rebel-held north of the country,
500km north of the country's main city Abidjan, WHO's statement said.
The 2nd case is in a 16-year-old girl in Ouragahio, which is in the
government-controlled central-west. Cote d'Ivoire has been split in 2
since a failed coup in September 2002 triggered a brief [?] civil war.
The Pasteur Institute in Abidjan and a WHO regional laboratory in the
Senegal capital, Dakar, confirmed both incidences.
WHO vaccinated 26 000 people against yellow fever in February 2006 in
Bouna, in the east of the country. A vaccination campaign was also
conducted in the main city, Abidjan, in 2001.
Yellow Fever is on the rise again in Africa, although an effective
vaccine has been available for 60 years. The disease is now deemed a
serious public health issue by WHO.

[This report is alarming, given the political turmoil in the Cote
d'Ivoire, and the fact that one these yellow fever [YF] cases is in
rebel-held territory, where response by public health officials is
likely to be difficult or impossible. The risk of a major YF epidemic
seems great, and ProMED would appreciate follow-up reports from
health personnel on the ground there. The Cote d'Ivoire - Burkina
Faso border is a YF-endemic area, and there is considerable
possibility of spread of this disease.
