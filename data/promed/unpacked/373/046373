In response to the request for further information on the above, an e-mail
reply from Dr.Santanu Chatterjee in Calcutta confirms that this is indeed
Japanese B encephalitis.
Another point he makes, for information only, is that malaria is currently
raging in Calcutta with an increasing number of cases of _Plasmodium
falciparum_ as well as many mixed infections (vivax and falciparum).
