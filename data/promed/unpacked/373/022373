Kuhlmann C, Mayer CK, Claassen M et al. Breakthrough Infections with SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant despite booster dose of mRNA vaccine

Abstract
Based on its genetic profile and preliminary in vitro and epidemiological data, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant is predicted to evade immune responses to some extent. We report a cluster of omicron variant infections in individuals who had received full primary vaccination series and booster doses with mRNA vaccines. All patients experienced symptomatic COVID-19 but clinical manifestations were mild to moderate. Their SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA loads and anti-spike antibody levels were determined. This series proves that even 3 doses of mRNA vaccines may not be sufficient to prevent infection and symptomatic disease with the omicron variant.

Discussion.
This case series is the first to report, and characterise, breakthrough infections with the omicron variant in individuals fully vaccinated and having received a vaccine booster dose. We include those with heterologous booster doses in line with what is becoming global practice. Booster doses were administered between 5 and 10 months after the 2nd vaccine doses, and breakthrough infections occurred 1 to 2 months thereafter.

All individuals experiencing breakthrough infections had high levels of viral spike protein binding antibodies. This is expected after receipt of booster vaccine doses (Demonbreun et al., 2021), even in the absence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Viral RNA loads in omicron variant infections have not yet been reported. It is thus unknown whether the viral loads observed in our group are different from those in unvaccinated, or differently vaccinated, individuals. During "wild-type" SARS-CoV-2 infection, an average viral RNA load of 6.76 x 105 copies per swab was found in samples taken up to day 5 post-onset of symptoms (Wolfel et al., 2020), with a maximum of 7.11 x 108 copies per swab. In this group of individuals, an average of 4.16 x 107 was observed and the highest viral load detected was 1.65 x 108 copies per mL of eluted swab on day 4 after onset of symptoms. This might indicate higher viral loads in samples from patients infected with the omicron variant but should be regarded as preliminary.

During the first week after onset of symptoms a mild clinical course was observed. This suggests that full vaccination followed by a booster dose still provides good protection against severe COVID-19. However, the observation period is short and does not exclude subsequent deterioration or long-term sequelae of COVID-19.

This case series proves that, as predicted, the omicron variant is able to evade immunity induced by mRNA vaccines in vivo. South Africa has yet to introduce booster vaccinations for individuals immunised with 2 doses of BNT162b2, so the presence of this group from Germany presented a unique opportunity to study omicron breakthrough infections in individuals with mRNA vaccine boosters. Hitherto unpublished in vitro data suggest lower titres of neutralising antibodies against the omicron variant, compared to other SARS-CoV-2 lineages, following BNT162b2 vaccination but increased titres after a 3rd dose (Cele et al., 2021; Wilhelm et al., 2021; Pfizer, 2021), supporting calls for booster doses while the omicron variant may be spreading globally. Our report, however, shows that this is insufficient to prevent symptomatic infection and emphasizes the need to maintain additional non-pharmaceutical interventions.

[This study demonstrated that while booster doses increased the level of protective antibody, omicron infection still may cause disease. Thus, even after receiving a booster dose, masks and physical distancing must still be part of personal protective measures, especially in indoor spaces. - Mod.LK

It is noteworthy that the cluster of breakthrough cases involved 7 individuals - 5 with confirmed omicron infections and 2 presumed to be omicron infections due to contact with confirmed cases.. - Mod.MPP]

Trinidad and Tobago has recorded its first case of the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.

This according to Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh as he spoke during [Mon 13 Dec 2021]'s COVID-19 virtual press conference hosted by the Ministry of Health.

"This morning, and this is the reason for my concern this morning if people don't heed the call to be vaccinated, we were informed of the discovery of our first case of the omicron variant in Trinidad and Tobago. So as we predicted, it was not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."

Deyalsingh said the case in question was imported and the affected person is female. "This person came into Trinidad and Tobago, flight originated in New York, and this is the disturbing part. In New York, the person was allowed to board a flight with a positive PCR test. The person travelled to Panama where they presented a negative Antigen test.

"So a positive PCR test in contravention of our TT Pass regulations, and the Minister of National Security and myself met this morning, we will be providing to the Minister of National Security the person's name, the airline, because they have some liability in this, and the person for doing what they did."

He noted that luckily the port in Trinidad helped pick up the fact that this person was allowed to board with a positive PCR test. "So the last check and balance in Trinidad at Piarco worked, and I want to congratulate our portal officers who again have been doing a wonderful job in screening passengers coming in."

He said the individual was immediately isolated in a Step-down facility and continues to be isolated. "In keeping with international protocols, when you have an incident like this on an aircraft, the protocols are that all persons within a 2-row radius, which is 2 rows ahead, 2 rows behind and 2 rows to the side, have been quarantined at home. Luckily, all those persons have negative PCR tests, all are fully vaccinated, and they are in quarantine and will be monitored."

Deyalsingh noted that if citizens continue not to access the vaccines which have been provided conveniently and free of charge, an omicron wave on top of a delta wave, bearing in mind that omicron is more transmissible, can be detrimental.

"With this Christmas with gatherings, with partying, with no state of emergency, if an omicron wave is layered and now sandwiched with a delta wave, the consequences for Trinidad and Tobago are in fact pretty dire. One way that we can work together in combating this potential calamity is to do the right thing, which is simply wear your mask, watch your distance and get vaccinated."

The Health Minister also appealed to parents to get vaccinated. "We have seen more and more children coming in to our ICUs (Intensive Care Units) and the majority of these children, some have comorbidities, there's one in ICU now with comorbidities, but one of the common features is the unwillingness of their parents to be vaccinated because they don't believe in vaccinations. So, they are bringing the virus home, infecting their young children, and many children do have comorbidities.

"But the message is all around the world that the unvaccinated, this pandemic of the unvaccinated is truly, truly getting very deep roots in Trinidad and Tobago," Deyalsingh said.

He stated further that the country's healthcare workers are stretched to the limit. "While you may feel your right not to be vaccinated is there, but think about healthcare workers who you're going to depend on to bring you back to life, sometimes not being successful because of your decision to be unvaccinated."

He also warned of a disturbing trend of ICU beds being continuously filled by a majority of unvaccinated patients. "As of this morning, the 29 ICU level beds in the Accident and Emergency Departments and the 77 ICU beds in the parallel healthcare system, gives you a total of 106 ICU beds. But what is important, is that 68 out of the 77 ICU beds in Trinidad this morning, representing an occupancy level of 88%, of that 90% is unvaccinated.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the burden being placed on the ICU by the unvaccinated is reaching some critical levels, and I'm appealing to the unvaccinated that the level of care that you may expect coming in to this Christmas period and the post-Christmas period, if people continue to make the decision not to be vaccinated, then that level of ICU care that you think is waiting for you, very soon may not be there."

He noted that of the 94 COVID-19 patients in the Accident and Emergency Departments waiting for transfer, 82 of them are not vaccinated.

"And the majority of these, as we have been alluding to for a couple months now, are being treated at home by remedies not certified, that have no scientific basis. When the ambulance goes, they refuse to be transported in a timely manner and it's only when they're literally at death's door that they come into our A&Es, and by that time they are too unstable to be transported to a medical facility, and this is one of the reasons why we have this unacceptably high daily average of 21 deaths per day mainly among the unvaccinated as the figures would show," Deyalsingh noted.

[4] DRC: 4th wave

The Minister of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention, Jean-Jacques Mbungani Mbanda officially announced this [Mon 13 Dec 2021] the occurrence of the 4th wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRC.

"All epidemiological reports attest to an exponential increase in the circulation of the virus. As of [Fri 10 Dec 2021], the country has registered 638 new cases. The city of Kinshasa tops the ranking of provinces affected by this new wave with at least 557 cases confirmed as of [Fri 10 Dec 2021]", said the minister in an official press release.

For Minister Mbungani Mbanda, "despite the increase in cases, the case fatality rate remains stable and care is provided effectively in all COVID centers. However, in view of the epidemiological data communicated by Congolese scientists, the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention wishes to officially inform both national and international opinion of the occurrence of the 4th wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in DRC."

The 4th wave is thus marked by the new South African variant, omicron: "Scientific data does indeed confirm the circulation of the omicron variant on our territory. To this end, firm instructions were given to the various services in order to double health vigilance in our airports, ports or any border post to limit the importation of the new variant into our country," the press release read.

Seasonal flu

Also in the same press release, Dr. Mbungani Mbanda also provided an update on the seasonal flu that is currently raging in the country.

"The onset of this 4th wave coincides with the resurgence of the seasonal flu, which also presents certain symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, in particular prolonged cough, fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, weakness, etc. Thus, the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention calls on the population to be consulted regularly in front of any cough associated or not with fever to determine their clinical state with a view to taking appropriate action, to observe the barrier measures. and to be massively vaccinated to allow our country to achieve collective immunity," he declared.

However, he calls on the population not to panic, but rather to be massively vaccinated in order to fight against this pandemic.

[4] UK: first death
Date: Mon 13 Dec 2021

At least one person has died in the United Kingdom after contracting the omicron coronavirus variant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on [Mon 13 Dec 2021], the first publicly confirmed death globally from the swiftly spreading strain.

Since the first omicron cases were detected on [Sat 27 Nov 2021] in the United Kingdom, Johnson has imposed tougher restrictions and on [Sun 12 Dec 2021] cautioned that the variant could overcome the immune defenses of those inoculated with 2 shots of vaccines.

Britain gave no details on the death or whether the patient had been vaccinated or had underlying health issues. Deaths from omicron may have occurred in other countries but none has been publicly confirmed yet outside Britain.

"Sadly at least one patient has now been confirmed to have died with omicron," Johnson told reporters at a vaccination centre in London.

The variant now accounted for around 40% of infections in the capital, he said.

"So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus - I think that's something we need to set on one side - and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population."

Before the death was announced, Britain said 10 people had been hospitalised with the omicron variant in various parts of England. Their ages ranged from 18 to 85 years and most had received 2 vaccination doses.

The UK Health Security Agency said omicron - first detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong in late November [2021] - can overcome the immunity of those who have had 2 shots of vaccines such as AstraZeneca (AZN.L) or Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N).

South Africa's health ministry said it was unable to say with certainty if any of its COVID-19 deaths were caused by omicron as deaths were not broken down by variant.

New lockdowns?
--------------
Johnson, who is grappling with a rebellion in his party over measures to curb omicron and an outcry over parties at his Downing Street office during last year's lockdowns, said people should rush to get booster vaccines to protect "our freedoms and our way of life".

After COVID-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, he faced criticism for initially resisting lockdown.

He has also been criticised for overseeing mistakes in transferring patients into care homes, and for building a costly test-and-trace system that failed to stop a deadly second wave.

Johnson has repeatedly said that while mistakes were made, the government was making decisions swiftly in the biggest public health crisis for generations and that his government was quick to roll out vaccines.

More than 146 000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.

Asked if he could rule out tougher restrictions in England before Christmas, Johnson avoided giving a direct answer.

Vaccine queues
-------------
At St. Thomas' Hospital Vaccination Centre in central London, a queue of hundreds of people snaked back onto Westminster Bridge. Reuters journalists also documented queues across London and in Manchester, northern England.

"The COVID vaccine booking service is currently facing extremely high demand so is operating a queuing system," the National Health Service said on Twitter. It suggested trying again later.
