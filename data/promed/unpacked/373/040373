Guatemala: Rotavirus Outbreak Death Toll Reaches 50
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of children [dead] as a result of rotavirus [infection]
rose to 50 on Thu 12 Feb 2004, as the health authorities continued
to struggle to contain the outbreak, which began [in January 2004].

"Since 29 Jan 2004, 50 children have died as a result of rotavirus,"
Health Ministry spokeswoman Raquel Leon told EFE News, adding
that physicians have treated nearly 35 870 cases of children with
symptoms of [rotavirus infection]. Of that number, Leon said, "6500
cases have tested positive for rotavirus" and those children have
received treatment at hospitals.

Leon said authorities have no plans to declare a national health
emergency as "only 0.74 of every 1000 children infected have
died." According to the Health Ministry, the rotavirus outbreak has
spread to 17 of the country's 22 provinces, and the measures
promoted by authorities have been unable to stem the illness. Leon
said those responsible for the spread of rotavirus "are the parents,
because they don't take the sanitary measures that we have
stressed so much."

Rotavirus infection is transmitted by fecal contamination of food
and water that affects mostly children under age 5. Its principal
symptoms are diarrhea, high fever, abdominal pain, and
dehydration.

300 People Fall Ill on Carnival Cruise to Mexico
-----------------------------------------------------------
A Carnival Cruise Lines ship returned from a 5-day cruise to
Mexico on Sat 14 Feb 2004 with more than 300 people sick with a
gastrointestinal illness. "Carnival" officials said preliminary tests
show the outbreak might have been caused by a norovirus. The
virus is spread through contaminated food, contact with infected
people, or poor hygiene. It can be prevented by regular hand-
washing.

"They did try to handle it very well, from a cleaning perspective and
disinfecting and sanitizing things," a passenger said after leaving
the ship.

The Celebration left Galveston on Mon 9 Feb 2004. On
Wednesday, "Carnival" contacted the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) to report an unusual number of ill
passengers, with predominant symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea.
By Fri 13 Feb 2004, 297 of 1576 passengers and 19 of 689 crew
members were ill, according to the CDC.

CDC investigators boarded the 733-foot ship after its regularly
scheduled arrival. They were conducting tests and inspecting the
ship. Miami-based Carnival said it plans to compensate
passengers who got sick.

[Note that the outbreak began before the ship arrived in Mexico,
most likely brought on board by passengers or crew boarding in the
USA. - Mod.JW]
