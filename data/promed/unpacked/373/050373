CHOLERA - THAILAND (02)

Henry Wilde writes from Bangkok:

There is no need to panic or to start tourists on cholera vaccine
when traveling to Thailand.
*******************************************************************
Sporadic cases of cholera are seen in this region from time to time.
They are not often reported. There are clusters of cases (Ogawa) in
refugee camps along the Burmese border. Some deaths have even been
reported due to lack of adequate care in that part of the border camps.
I recently encountered a hospitalized patient at a local teaching
hospital. He was a laborer living at a construction site and came in with
dehydration, moderate hypotension and the house staff found "shooting
stars" in his watery stools. He responded well to rehydration and TCN
and was soon discharged. He said that several of his coworkers also had
watery diarrhea but did not receive medical care and recovered by taking
traditional medications (rice soup with salt, antibiotics from the local
drug store).
