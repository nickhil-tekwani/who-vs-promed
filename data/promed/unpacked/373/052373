During week 9 (week ending 4 Mar 2018), 3 suspected cases of monkeypox were reported in Bria town in Haute-Kotto prefecture. Samples obtained from the 1st 2 cases tested positive for monkeypox at the Institut Pasteur Bangui. Further investigations are ongoing.

Public health actions
---------------------
A crisis committee has been revitalized in response to the monkeypox outbreak, being supported by WHO and partners. An isolation unit has been set up in Bria hospital, where the 3 patients are being treated, supported by the NGO IMC. The contacts of these cases are being monitored. Standard case definition for monkeypox has been disseminated to facilitate identification of cases and awareness about prevention is ongoing in the community and on the local community radio.

The Ministry of Health is in the process of developing a monkeypox outbreak response plan, following the confirmation of the disease in Bria.

[There has been a substantial outbreak of monkeypox (MPX) in Nigeria over the past 6 months. The above is the 1st report of monkeypox cases in the Central African Republic (CAR). The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and the one in Nigeria is not mentioned. With just one reported fatality in Nigeria, and that one in an immunosuppressed individual, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. That clade has the lowest case fatality rate. The question remains about the source of these infections within Nigeria and now in the CAR. One wonders if there is a MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope (or striped) squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. - Mod.TY
