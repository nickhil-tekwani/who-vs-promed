Foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks on the rise again
----------------------------------------
The number of new cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) is on the increase
again with outbreaks occurring in new areas and the cluster in North
Yorkshire and Lancashire getting worse.
The worst day since April, with 13 cases, was reported by the Ministry of
Agriculture with a new outbreak at Rainow, near Macclesfield in Cheshire,
an area previously free of the disease.
Since May 10, when the first case in the new North Yorkshire cluster was
reported, there have been 47 related cases in the area spilling over into
Lancashire. Of the 13 cases reported yesterday, 6 were in Lancashire and 3
in North Yorkshire. Most of the cases have been along the Ribble Valley in
a triangle between Settle, Skipton, and Clitheroe.
The disease has been in the area since February, before FMD [movement
restrictions? were first imposed. Although the ministry believed it had
traced all the infected sheep movements from Longtown Market near Carlisle
they had missed at least one. The farmer involved had not noticed his sheep
had been harboring the disease but they must have been spreading it for 3
months before it was discovered.
It was not until cattle were put out to graze after a winter in farm
buildings and they began contracting the disease that its existence and
widespread infection was realized.
A Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said: "The chief scientist, Professor
David King, has said this is quite a hotspot. We are confident it came from
Longtown and has been dormant, or at least not detected in sheep flocks in
the area. Some sheep do not develop symptoms but can breathe out the virus,
so infecting other animals. When the cattle get it, the disease becomes
obvious."
Although most of the cases in the cluster are in the Ribble Valley, there
were no cases before May 10, meaning there had been a relatively free flow
of people and vehicles servicing dispersed animals. This has spread the
cluster - and there has been a case as far away as Ilkley in West
Yorkshire. All movement of animals in the areas concerned has been stopped.
The new case near Macclesfield is another cause for concern. Although there
had been 14 cases in south Cheshire earlier in the epidemic, there had been
none in this part of the county.
Since May 17 when the government announced there had been no cases, there
has been a slight increase, which became far more marked last week. There
are still cases occurring in former hotspots such as Devon and Cumbria.
There were 2 in Cumbria on Saturday, bringing the overall total in the
county to 722 cases. The total in the country stands at 1687 since February
20, when the first case was diagnosed among pigs in Essex.
