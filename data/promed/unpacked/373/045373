Meningococcal meningitis in Sudan
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of meningococcal meningitis has been reported in the
Northern Darfur region. The first cases were reported on 12 December
1998, and the total of 126 for December 1998 is 5 times higher than the
number reported for the same month in 1997. Cases have continued to be
reported at an increasing rate, reaching a total of 169 by 6 Jan
[1999.
Over 20 deaths have been reported.
The organism has been identified as _Neisseria meningitidis_
serogroup A, and tests indicate that it is sensitive to first-line
antibiotics. Sudan lies in the so-called meningitis belt of
sub-Saharan Africa. A large epidemic last occurred in 1988-1989, with
over 40 000 cases and 7 500 deaths.
WHO is sending a team to assist with the assessment of the
epidemiological situation and needs. Other international partners, such
as UNICEF, Medecins sans frontieres and the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, are also making plans to support
control of the outbreak.
