Rotorua [Bay of Plenty region] preschoolers aren't escaping an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) -- but so far no children have been hospitalised with complications from the common childhood illness.

There has been an increase in cases throughout the country and Toi Te Ora Public Health Service medical officer of health Dr Neil de Wet said Rotorua hasn't escaped. While the disease isn't notifiable -- which means cases don't have to be reported to public health -- Dr de Wet said anecdotal evidence from doctors and child care centres was that Rotorua was seeing an increase in cases. He said the strain of the illness going around seemed to be causing a more widespread rash in children. Dr de Wet said outbreaks were quite common, especially in autumn, and pre-school aged children were most likely to be affected.

Symptoms included feeling unwell starting with a fever and then sometimes getting blisters on the throat as well as spots on their hands and feet. Dr de Wet said most adults had already been exposed to the illness and had built up an immunity. While most children recovered completely without having to see a GP, Dr de Wet said if parents had concerns they should consult with a doctor.

The biggest concern was dehydration, and while children might be reluctant to drink because they had a sore throat, it was important they had enough fluids, he said. Dehydration was the most common reason children were hospitalised because of HFMD. There were 6 cases of children hospitalised with the illness last year [2013], but there have been none so far this year.

[Reports continue to be received of outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) throughout the North Island of New Zealand. Rotorua, adjacent to the Bay of Plenty, can now be added to the list. It is likely that Coxsackie virus A6 is the virus responsible for all these outbreaks of HFMD. An isolate of this virus from the current outbreak, characterised in Auckland, was found to be identical to an isolate characterised earlier in Japan.

Rotorua is a city on the southern shores of the lake of the same name, in the Bay of Plenty region of the North Island of New Zealand. Maps of New Zealand can be accessed at http://www.meetnewzealand.co.nz/nzmap.asp and http://healthmap.org/r/1jUe. - Mod.CP]
