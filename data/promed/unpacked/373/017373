New Jersey health officials are warning about an outbreak of hepatitis A that's hit 3 counties hard, but it has also popped up in some unexpected places elsewhere, including a Dunkin' Donuts. The state Department of Health has supplied hundreds of vaccines to several health departments to immunize uninsured or underinsured individuals at risk of the liver disease, according to a department release.

Anyone can get hepatitis A, but recently, 3 counties have reported increased cases among those who have had close, personal contact with someone who has hepatitis A, according to the release. "Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine," health commissioner Shereef Elnahal said.

A cluster of 26 hepatitis A cases have appeared in Camden (9), Burlington (6), and Gloucester (11) counties, according to health officials. The cases have largely involved individuals who are homeless and/or drug users. Last month [February 2019], however, a worker at a Dunkin' Donuts in Ocean City was diagnosed with hepatitis A, the Cape May County Health Department and New Jersey Department of Health announced. The employee worked at the 962 West Ave. location while they were potentially infected between 27 Jan 2019 and 31 Jan 2019, officials said.

A letter also was recently sent home to parents of more than 1300 students at Nottingham High School-North in Hamilton Township in Mercer County informing them of the potential exposure of hepatitis A, according to [radio station] NJ101.5. The virus is typically transmitted from person-to-person when it is ingested from objects, food, or drinks contaminated by a stool from an infected person, according to the release. This can happen when infected people do not wash their hands properly after using the bathroom, and then touch food or items that are shared with others. Hepatitis A can also spread from close, personal contact with an infected person, such as through sex or caring for someone who is ill, according to the release.

[The CDC https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm is reporting serially on 17 states with recent and mostly continuing outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable infection.

To say that a restaurant is an unexpected place for HAV to pop up is silly. A day does not go by without reading on Google about a case in a food worker. - Mod.LL
