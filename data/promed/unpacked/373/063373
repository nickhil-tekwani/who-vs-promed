[Following the news on ASF in Mongolia, FAO's useful "ASF China weekly update" has become "ASF Asia weekly update."

On top of the information in the above excerpts, additional ASF-related information from China and Mongolia, including FAO's recommendations regarding other countries of the region, national considerations, interregional collaboration and solidarity, and a summary of FAO's actions so far, is included. There is also a table presenting a list of affected cities in each infected province since 3 Aug 2018, a figure illustrating the number of ASF-reported villages by region and onset month, and a map presenting the 103 outbreaks since the start of the event. The 3 new outbreaks, one in Jiangsu (Suqian City, 6 Jan 2019) and 2 in Gansu (Qingyang City, 13 Jan 2019 and Lanzhou City, 18 Jan 2019), are colored red.

OIE's interactive map, showing all ASF outbreaks reported from China and Mongolia since August 2018, as of 18 Jan 2019, is available at https://tinyurl.com/ya7eyzpm (click on the Chinese cluster; zoom in).

The high prevalence of the virus on China's mainland, as apparent from the above map, is underlined by reports from Taiwan on dead pigs, testing positive for ASF, found on the shores of its islands close to the mainland. In December 2018, a dead pig was found washed up on a beach in Taiwan's Kinmen Islands, about 10 km (6.2 miles) from China's Fujian province, where swine fever was reported earlier that month. Although the carcass tested positive for ASF, nearby farms were not affected. Today [Sat 19 Jan 2019] a 2nd such case was reported from Taiwan: The pig carcass was found on a beach on an uninhabited island near Matsu, close to China (see https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3621012). Earlier, Taiwan media reported the detection of ASF contamination in pork illegally introduced by passengers coming from mainland China. There were several such incidents. The government has slapped heavy fines on passengers who bring in pork products from countries with ASF outbreaks, with 1st-time offenders liable to be fined NTD 200 000 (USD 6500) and repeat offenders NTD 1 million (USD 32 500).

On Fri 18 Jan 2019, Australian media reported that "African swine fever (ASF) has been found in 6 pork products seized at Australian airports and mail processing centres." Dates and the origins of the consignments were not included (see http://www.pig-world.co.uk/news/asf-detected-in-pork-products-in-australia.html).

Mongolia's ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs, reported from 4 provinces and the capital Ulaanbaatar, present a wide dissemination of the virus. It is not clear how long this circulation has been going on and whether wild boars are involved. In March 2017, ASF was reported by Russia to be circulating in the Irkutsk oblast (see map: https://goo.gl/maps/7rpt4iyZbFv) facing Mongolia's northern border (20170328.4929925). Notably, wild boars are present on both sides of the Russian/Mongolian border; see Fig. 1 (map) in Ref. 1 below. - Mod.AS
