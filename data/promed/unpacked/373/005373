2004/018 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
-------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance for
2003, received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2003/175), from the
following countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland,
Germany, Guernsey, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been
re-exported, and the country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country
is indicated in brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country
is not known to the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, and missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.
Note: In EPPO RS 2003/124, the interception of Apple proliferation
phytoplasma on Malus was done by Germany on plants originating from France
(and not the opposite, as stated in the table).

[Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV) was detected in a shipment of tomato
seeds originating from China. PepMV is extremely contagious, and infectious
virus is present on seed surfaces, in seed pulp, and in wash water from
infected seeds. Transmission through seed is considered unlikely. As a
precaution, tomato seed in commercial production is treated with acid under
controlled conditions to eradicate any virions on the seed surface. - Mod.DH]
