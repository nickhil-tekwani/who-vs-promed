A person traveling from Liberia to the United States has been diagnosed with Ebola, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tue [30 Sep 2014]. The person, whose identity was not released, left Liberia on 19 Sep 2014 and arrived in the USA on 20 Sep 2014, he said. At that time, the person did not have symptoms. "But 4 or 5 days later" that person began to show symptoms, Frieden said. The person was hospitalized and isolated Sun [28 Sep 2014] at a hospital in Texas, he said.

A patient being treated at a Dallas, Texas, hospital is the 1st person diagnosed with Ebola in the USA. Several other Americans were diagnosed in West Africa and then brought to the USA for treatment. The person who first tested positive for Ebola in the USA is a patient at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, hospital spokesman Stephen O'Brien said Tue 30 Sep 2013.

The adult patient developed symptoms days after returning to Texas from West Africa, and was admitted into isolation on Sun [28 Sep 2014], according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The CDC was expected to provide more details on the case in a press conference at 5:30 p.m.

[It was bound to happen sooner or later, with an incubation period of 21 days. He had no symptoms on the plane or on arrival, so there was no risk to fellow passengers, aircrew or airport personnel, and his contacts since he came down with fever will be followed up, as CDC does routinely for other infections.
