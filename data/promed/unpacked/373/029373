West Nile Virus: Satellites track epidemiology in U.S
------------------------------------------------------
A NASA-funded study uses temperature and vegetation data from satellites to
help track and predict where West Nile virus is spreading in North America.
Scientists and public health officials hope one day to use near real-time
maps to focus resources and stave off the disease more efficiently. The
disease, first reported in the U.S. in 1999, causes flu-like symptoms that
can lead to fatal encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems,
like the elderly. Scientists believe that West Nile virus may be spread
across the country by infected birds traveling along their migration
routes, though this has not yet been proven. Mosquitoes act as a vector to
carry the virus and pass it on when feeding on hosts like birds, livestock,
other animals and people.
The satellite maps show nationwide temperatures, distributions of
vegetation, bird migration routes, and areas pinpointing reported cases.
The combined data help scientists predict disease outbreaks by showing
where conditions are right for the insects to thrive and where the disease
appears to be spreading. "The images are derived from satellite data that
capture a number of variables that are crucial for detecting whether a
habitat is suitable for a vector, like a mosquito that carries West Nile
virus," said David Rogers, the lead author of the study. Rogers is
Professor of Ecology at Oxford University in the United Kingdom and a
member of the International Research Partnership for Infectious Diseases
(INTREPID) group, based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
"It's not a single variable that tends to determine whether a disease will
occur, but rather a combination of variables," Rogers said. Satellite
sensors, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), provide information on
vegetation and peak and average annual temperatures. Mosquito populations
are constrained by different factors in different places. In the North,
colder temperatures hold mosquito populations back. In the south, where
temperatures are higher, the insects are more dependent on the availability
of moisture for survival. Lush vegetation provides a good indicator of
areas with increased levels of moisture. Mosquitoes tend to thrive in
warmer, wetter areas. Satellites let researchers see which areas have these
conditions, allowing for better prediction of disease transmission.
Similarly, satellites also help to plot patterns like the timing of peak
temperatures during a year. Mosquito populations appear to increase during
the first half of the year but only reach sufficient levels to transmit the
disease during the second half of each year. "The timing of a seasonal peak
of temperatures determines the increase of vector populations in that
place," said Rogers. "An early rise in spring temperature is likely to get
the mosquito off to a flying start."
The idea is to let the satellite capture where the disease is spreading
from year to year and make some predictions about where the disease is
going. Computer models can determine which areas have the right
combinations of temperatures and moisture levels most suitable for
mosquitoes and transmission. Then, efforts and resources can target those
high-risk areas.
The study suggests that a mild winter in 1998 to 1999 may have provided
favorable conditions for mosquitoes to survive the winter, leading to a
greater number of carriers in 1999. In that first year cases were reported
in 3 states. The number grew to 12 states in 2000, and more than 20 in
2001, despite the fact that the winters preceding these years were either
average or slightly below average [in temperature. "Once a disease like
West Nile virus establishes a foothold, and spreads, it will be very
difficult to eradicate," said Rogers. The methods used in this research may
be modified and applied to study a variety of other diseases like malaria,
dengue fever, Lyme disease, influenza, and even asthma.
