An outbreak of the cattle disease, theileriosis in the upper North Island is predicted to get worse and farmers are being warned to take precautions.

Theileriosis is caused by a blood-borne parasite transmitted by ticks and causes anaemia in cattle.

Upper north farmers are warned to be vigilant for tick activity.

It is estimated that the disease has been infecting 13 new herds per week. Chief scientist for Dairy NZ, Dr Eric Hillerton, says the disease has been around for a long time, but a more virulent strain started to appear 2 to 3 years ago.

He says at this stage the spike could be to do with better spotting and reporting of the disease by vets -- but risks lie ahead.

He says many cows, particularly in Waikato and Hauraki, have gone through drought and are a stressed as a result and now animals are about to be moved around the country, infected animals could be introduced into naive herds and naive animals into infected herds.

He says on top of this, calving is a stressful period and the rain is likely to see tick activity picking up.

He says farmers need to be prepared. "It's worthwhile inspecting your animals now and keeping an eye out for it. The message is really let's not let this catch us unawares."

Dr Hillerton says there's no vaccine available but with good care the cattle normally recover.
