2nd Statement - Ministry of Public Health - Chad - 21 Jan 2013
Republic of Chad
State Office
Ministry of Public Health
2nd Statement from the Government

2nd Statement
The independent international experts in charge of the in-depth investigation into the unusual reactions recorded during the vaccination campaign against meningitis between [11 and 15 Dec 2012] at Gouro (West-Ennedi) presented their preliminary findings on Friday [18 Jan 2013] at SEM. Their investigation was based on 4 axes:
- Analysis of available documents;
- Analysis of the organization of the vaccination campaign and vaccine quality;
- Interviews of the different parties involved;
- Medical examination of the 36 cases in the 2 hospitals in N'Djamena.

As a result from the different analyses, discussions among the team, and after meetings or contacting those implicated (or not implicated), in the event, the experts have come to the preliminary conclusions below:

Expert Findings:
The vaccination campaign organized in Gouro was conducted under normal conditions by staff who are experienced in implementing mass campaigns and routine vaccination programs.

The conditions of hospitalization, in particular the medical care at the psychological level, and the dialogue between the community and the health staff were insufficient.

The crises are triggered by noise, visits by foreigners, and the occurrence of crises among other patients.

Apart from these agitated periods, the children lead normal lives.

The patients are aged between 8 and 25 years, and with 77 percent of them being girls, i.e. 27 out of a total of 35.

A child that had not been vaccinated complains of similar symptoms.

All the different medical examinations performed on the patients were normal. The neurological examination on patients at the request of the experts also concluded that all was normal.

The same MenAfriVac vaccine lot 127M1033, used in Gouro, was used in the entire Ennedi region.

The expert reports from WHO on the vaccine lot at the level of the manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) showed no manufacturing defect.

The MenAfriVac vaccine, prequalified by WHO in 2010, has been subjected to all the required tests before being used. To date, more than 100 million people have been vaccinated in 10 countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, Senegal, Chad, and Benin). The vaccine will be further introduced in 16 African countries. Since the introduction of the vaccine, no case of meningitis "A" has been recorded in vaccinated individuals.

Expert Recommendations:
- Ensure the progressive but rapid return of the children to their families and a medical follow-up;
- Maintain a dialogue with the families and vaccination stakeholders and partners.
- Reinforce the medical structure at the local level through the addition of a doctor and a qualified nurse for a better health follow up in the populations and routine immunization activities.
- Reinforce the ability of the health staff in crisis communication and the management of rumors.

The experts wish to specifically state that analysis of the epidemiological, medical, clinical, and diagnostic tests data has not been able to establish a causal link between the clinical manifestations observed in the patients and the MenAfriVac vaccine.

The symptoms observed in patients are similar to those described in the literature under several names:
- Collective hysteria
- Collective obsessive behavior
- Mass psychogenic phenomenon

The independent experts thank the population and the authorities in Chad for their confidence. They request that the authorities be diligent in the implementation of the recommendations that will facilitate a return to a peaceful situation that will be to the benefit of the vaccination programs.

The full preliminary report has been submitted to the governmental authorities and will be finalized by the Health Service in Tunisia, where 7 of the 35 patients from N'Djamena were evacuated.

The Ministry of Public Health has worked in collaboration with the experts whilst guaranteeing the complete independence of the investigation. The Ministry welcomes the experts' conclusions in reassuring the patients, their families, and the general public of the health status of the evacuated patients from Gouro, the quality of the MenAfriVac vaccine, and the overall importance of vaccination.

N'Djamena, 21 Jan 2013
The Minister of Public Health
Dr Mamouth Nahor N'Gawara

"The description of the event following the receipt of vaccine in the above newswire as 'moan shortly after receiving their meningitis shot and then went into convulsions' is curious."

This does not seem like an allergic reaction. It could be a convulsive syncope, not because of the content of the meningococcal vaccine but from the mere vaccination (as a result of the puncture, or because of fear of being stuck by the needle, who knows?). It sometimes happens, especially in adolescent girls. There is some risk of injury from falling when they suddenly lose consciousness.

[The above report in [1] contains the detailed findings of the thorough investigation of this event by a team of experts. All aspects of the vaccination activities, the vaccine and the procedures used were investigated and were found to be correct and appropriate. The conclusion that this event was an event involving mass hysteria was drawn on solid grounds after all other possibilities were eliminated. ProMED-mail has posted reports on outbreaks of mass hysteria in the past (see the list of "see alsos" below).

The description of the involved individuals gave an age range old enough to be influenced by events they were seeing, and the composition of the involved group was 77 percent female. The fact that all involved individuals were at the same location, combined with the observation that the same lot of vaccine was used elsewhere without adverse events, and the inclusion of one affected individual who had not received the vaccine all strongly support the conclusion that the event was most likely a mass hysteria event.

(Borrowing from a prior ProMED posting, Undiagnosed illness - Bangladesh (02):
mass hysteria 20070720.2327:)'In a prior ProMED-mail posting from 2002, when there was a multistate outbreak of rash illness (see Unexplained rash illness - USA (multistate) (06) 20020605.4409), a reporter in a New York Times article, Margaret Talbot, had the following background material: "Well-documented outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness do occur. Between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass hysteria in medical journals; most took place in self-contained communities, like schools, barracks, and factories. Symptoms spread by "line of sight" -- people get sick as they see other people getting sick -- which is quite different from what happens with a viral illness. Adolescents and preadolescents are particularly susceptible, and girls are more likely to fall ill than boys. Girls' heightened susceptibility to mass psychogenic illness need not be seen as due to their more "hysterical" nature, but to their propensity to talk among themselves about their health. Additionally, women are more likely to seek medical attention, and presumably, therefore, to take note of their own symptoms, than men.'

There was a previous report of a mass hysteria event following vaccination with tetanus-diphtheria toxoid in Jordan in 2001. (see Kharabsheh S, Al-Otoum H, Clements J, Abbas A, Khuri-Bulos N, Belbesi A, Gaafar T, Dellepiane N. Mass psychogenic illness following tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in Jordan. Bull World Health Organ. 2001;79(8):764-70. Epub 2001 Oct 24. Available at: http://www.who.int/docstore/bulletin/pdf/2001/issue8/vol79.no.8.764-770.pdf.)

Abstract: "In September 1998, more than 800 young people in Jordan believed they had suffered from the side effects of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccine administered at school; 122 of them were admitted to hospital. For the vast majority, their symptoms did not result from the vaccine but arose from mass psychogenic illness.

The role played by the media, the children's parents, and the medical profession in the escalation of this mass reaction appeared, at 1st sight, to be unusual and even unique to the circumstances in Jordan at the time. A review of the literature showed, however, that this mass reaction was similar in many ways to previous outbreaks, even though the underlying causes varied. There are about 200 published accounts of mass responses to situations involving suspected poisoning or other events. Because such mass reactions are relatively rare and the triggers so diverse, individuals faced with responding to them are unlikely to have prior experience in how to handle them and are unlikely to take bold steps to prevent their escalation. Indeed, they may be unaware that such events have been recorded before. The lessons learned from this incident in Jordan may help other immunization programme managers to handle crisis situations elsewhere."
