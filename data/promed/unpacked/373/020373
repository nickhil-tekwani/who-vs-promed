Chikungunya, a relatively rare form of mosquito-transmitted viral fever,
has claimed 12 lives in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh, and the disease
has spread to 3 more districts.
With 3 more deaths Sunday -- 2 from remote Dunava and one from Multai --
the total number of deaths allegedly due to chikungunya fever in Betul
district has reached 12, a source in the medical fraternity here said Thursday.
Chikungunya, affecting over 60 000 odd people, is now spreading to other
districts -- Chhindwara, Badwani and Burhanpur. However, 70 blood samples
have been dispatched to the New Delhi-based National Institute of
Communicable Diseases and a report is expected next week, he added.
Chikungunya fever, which was first reported a month ago in the state,
reportedly entered Madhya Pradesh through villages in Betul district
bordering Maharashtra.
Health Minister Ajay Vishnoi admitted that Chhindwara, Badwani and
Burhanpur were affected with the fever. However, he said, "The situation is
under control and even the Maharashtra government has praised my
department's rapid action to tackle the disease."
On the deaths in Betul, he said: "It is yet to be confirmed whether they
were due to Chikungunya -- symptoms of which are quite similar to other
viral fevers."

Chikungunya, which has already infected 19 districts of Maharashtra, has
now got a fresh entrant on its list: Pune.
The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that there were a
large number of cases of chikungunya in Pune.
At least 100 samples of the 250 sent from Sassoon, Ruby Hall Clinic,
Deenanath Mangeshkar and Yashwantrao Chavan hospitals among others have
tested positive for the viral fever.
NIV director Dr A C Mishra said they had received at least 250 samples from
various hospitals in Pune in the last 2 months.
"Around 100 samples have tested positive for chikungunya. The report will
now be sent to the State government," he added.
The preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes by
cleaning their breeding grounds, says A S Bhosale, state entomologist.
Health officials have already taken preventive measures and have urged
villagers not to store water for more than 5 days.
At least 19 districts have been infected and outbreaks have been contained
in 1337 villages in the State. Presently, there are outbreaks at Nashik,
Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Pune-(Tatve-Wadgaon Maval) and Solapur, Bhosale said.

Nineteen districts of Maharashtra are affected by chikungunya. Among those
affected are Nashik, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Pune, Solapur and parts of
Marathwada.
Chikungunya is a viral fever that has gripped most parts of Karnataka over
the last few months. In the districts of Shimoga alone, over 19 000 people
have been affected.
In extreme cases, the patient finds it difficult to move, but experts say
the disease is not fatal.

The viral epidemic Chikungunya, which spreads through mosquitoes, has been
reported in a few districts of Maharashtra, an official said.
"About 7-8 districts are affected with the disease but the number of cases
has declined from what was reported in April and May," State Health
Directorate chief P P Doke said.
He said in April and May, health officials recorded around 2000 cases a day
in the state, "but now we have reports of an average of 300 cases a day".
Doke said local health officials are telling people to clean vessels in
which they store water and to dry them properly before filling them, as
mosquitoes breed in stagnant water.

Though the [Bangalore] State Government claims to have taken adequate
measures to prevent the spread of chikungunya, reports of its outbreak
continue to pour in from different places.
As many as 286 201 people in 26 districts were affected by the disease as
on 26 Jun 2006. The Health Department claims that the number of cases had
come down.
According to statistics, chikungunya has been reported in 2860 villages
affecting 286 000 people. Gulbarga, Bidar, Bellary and Gadag districts have
been the worst hit. Four official committees have been formed to monitor
the situation.
Cases are now being reported in the districts of south Karnataka also.
The southern districts where chikungunya cases have been reported are
Bangalore Rural (9190), Bangalore Urban (2863), Tumkur (34 312), Kolar (14
277), Chikmagalur (3827) and Shimoga (13 853) as of 26 Jun 2006. But the
number of people afflicted by the disease in Bangalore Urban has risen to
6950, according to Deputy Commissioner M.A. Sadiq. However, not one case
has been reported in Kodagu district.
The Government held a meeting of chief executive officers of zilla
panchayats and deputy commissioners of districts on Friday to monitor the
situation and take steps to tackle the disease. Committees have been formed
at district and taluk levels.
It has been noted that people in Bangalore Rural and Kolar districts are
not following the preventive measures advised by the department.

Chikungunya dominated the zero hour in the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation's (AMC) standing committee meet on Monday with Congress
alleging that the disease was spreading fast in certain eastern areas.
Following this, Municipal Commissioner I P Gautam instructed officials to
intensify efforts to control the spread of the disease.
Congress members claim that so far, 500 cases of chikungunya have been
reported from Saijupur ward, 270 from Naroda-Muthiya and 170 from
Thakkarbapanagar wards, besides around 300 cases from Nikol ward. However,
medical officer health Dr S P Kulkarni contested the claim later in the
day. "We fanned our teams to the areas mentioned and found that 15 cases
have been reported since July 5 while another 55 cases of joints pains were
reported," said Dr Kulkarni.
The cases being reported as chikungunya could be of simple fever, "because
we have confirmations from private doctors in these areas that they have
not come across any chikungunya cases," claimed Dr Kulkarni.
