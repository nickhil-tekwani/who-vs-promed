Summary
------------
Measles is a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Europe is far from the 95% coverage rates necessary for elimination of the disease, although a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available. We reviewed the literature on studies carried out in European countries from January 1991 to September 2011 on knowledge, attitudes and practices of health professionals towards measles vaccination and on how health professionals have an impact on parental vaccination choices. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were considered: a total of 28 eligible articles were retrieved. Healthcare workers are considered by parents as a primary and trustworthy source of information on childhood vaccination. Gaps in knowledge and poor communication from healthcare workers are detrimental to high immunisation rates. Correct and transparent information for parents plays a key role in parental decisions on whether to have their children vaccinated. Healthcare workers' knowledge of and positive attitudes towards measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination are crucial to meeting the measles elimination goal. An effort should be made to overcome potential communication barriers and to strengthen vaccine education among healthcare professionals.

Introduction
---------------
Measles is a highly contagious disease and a leading cause of death among children below five years-old worldwide, although a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available [1]. Although measles usually runs a simple course, serious complications can occur: the most common in industrialised countries are otitis media (in 7-9% of cases), pneumonia (1-6%), diarrhoea (8%), post-infectious encephalitis (1 per 1000-2000 cases), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (1 per 100 000 cases) and death (1-3 per 1000 cases) [2]. Women who are infected during pregnancy are at greater risk of miscarriage and premature delivery [2]. Individuals at high risk of developing complications are children under 5 years of age, adults and individuals with chronic diseases and impaired immunity [1,3].

The most common way of administration of the measles vaccine is in combination with the mumps and rubella vaccines (the trivalent mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine), which is a combination of the three live attenuated viruses. Since its introduction in the 1970s, an estimated 500 million doses of MMR vaccine have been administered in over 60 countries worldwide [4]. Some countries have adopted a quadrivalent vaccine (MMRV), which also includes varicella [5].

Before vaccines were available, measles affected most people by adolescence; today, thanks to routine vaccination programmes, the disease is not seen as frequently in Europe. Eliminating measles and congenital rubella syndrome -- that is, reducing to zero the incidence of infection [6] - is a goal that all European countries are committed to meet by 2015 [6,7]. In order to eliminate measles, it is necessary to reach and maintain measles vaccination coverage at 95% [1,7]. Currently, however, the vaccination coverage is still far from this level: in fact, a drop in vaccine coverage rates to suboptimal levels has been reported in Europe in recent years [8,9].

In the first eight months of 2011 alone, more than 29 000 cases of measles were reported in Europe. About one third of them required hospitalisation and in the first six months of the year, measles was responsible for eight deaths and 24 cases of acute encephalitis [9].

Currently there is no standard European policy of administration of the MMR vaccine: of 30 European countries, vaccines are administered at the paediatrician's office in 7, in healthcare centres in 12, and in multiple locations in 11 [10, and data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) experts for Malta and Romania]. There are also considerable discrepancies in the administration schedules of the MMR vaccine among European Union (EU) countries: although the first dose is always recommended by the age of 18 months in all countries, age at the second dose of MMR vaccine varies widely, from 12 months to 15 years [11]. Some EU countries have also implemented catch-up vaccination programmes, which are very heterogeneous in terms of age of those eligible.

In spite of the solid evidence base on the efficacy and safety of measles vaccination [2], attitudes and practices of healthcare workers in Europe appear at times erratic: the misconception that measles is not a serious threat to health persists, not only among the parents of young children, but also among healthcare providers [12]. In this sense, there is complacency towards measles that is not present with regard to other vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio, tetanus or bacterial meningitis, which are generally perceived as extremely serious threats to health [12]. Memory of diseases and their severity fades quickly: because of routine vaccination programmes, there are generations of doctors, nurses and parents who have never seen measles or complications caused by measles.

Especially after a British study linked the MMR vaccine to increased incidence of autism, Crohn disease and other disorders [13], coverage in some European countries dropped, resulting in measles outbreaks and consistent burden of disease and costs [12]. Although the vaccine-autism controversy was dismissed and the article retracted by the journal editors [14] and although all possible associations were repeatedly disproven [15-17], the misconception that the vaccine risks outweigh those related to acquiring natural measles immunity is still widespread among parents [16]. Practices such as measles parties are said to have made a comeback in recent years [18] and anti-vaccination groups are common and active, especially on the Internet. Furthermore, the ever-increasing recourse to alternative practices such as homeopathy has been associated with higher rates of rejection of vaccines [19,20].

The objectives of our study were: (i) to review the literature produced in European countries on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of health professionals towards measles vaccination and (ii) to assess how health professionals have an impact on parental vaccination choices.

Discussion
-------------
Measles is a serious threat to public health: elimination of the disease in the EU is not only feasible, but necessary. Europe failed to meet the goal of eliminating measles by 2010, because of lower-than-required vaccination coverage. The commitment has been renewed, to eliminate measles by 2015 [50]. However, instead of a progressive reduction of the disease in Europe, incidence and the number of outbreaks increased dramatically over the past 15 years, with unacceptable consequences in terms of mortality, morbidity and costs.

From our review, it is quite clear that doctors and other healthcare providers are regarded as the most reliable sources of information from parents. Healthcare workers are generally trusted and consulted on whether children should be vaccinated and they are in a good position to empower parents to take an informed decision about MMR vaccination for their children. If this is a reassuring thought, it has to be noted that trust towards healthcare workers on motives to vaccinate and safety and efficacy of the vaccine can be compromised if inadequate or vague information is provided or a conflict of interest perceived. For example, a history of safety issues cannot be denied but have to be explained in a clear and transparent manner. Parents need to be educated to make an informed choice.

Although a small percentage of practitioners, especially providers of complementary medicine, are against vaccines on principle, we found that the main problem among healthcare providers was lack of knowledge. In most cases, suboptimal vaccination rates resulted from inadequate knowledge among healthcare providers of vaccination schedules, as well as the benefits and side effects. In some cases, healthcare providers were even found to have misleading beliefs about immunisation and sent unclear or untrue messages to parents. Whenever healthcare workers' knowledge was found to be inadequate, vaccination coverage in the general population decreased. The same happened when healthcare workers were reported to have a relaxed attitude towards measles, which is itself a consequence of lack of knowledge of the disease infectivity and morbidity.

Even among providers of complementary medicine, medically qualified homeopaths tended to have a less negative attitude towards immunisation as compared with non-medically qualified practitioners [33].

A limitation of our study is related to the search strategy. Studies published in journals that are not indexed in MEDLINE and/or Embase (or cited in their references) were not included in the review: this might have caused us to overlook some evidence produced and published at a national level, especially in languages other than English. We know of at least one paper, published in the German Epidemiologisches Bulletin in 2008 [51], that was not included in the review for this reason, although the topic was relevant to our query. The authors surveyed attitudes and knowledge of childhood vaccination among 549 German midwives: about a quarter of the midwives interviewed did not support the administration of the MMR vaccine to children and over 40% considered diseases such as measles important for the personal development of the child. The survey also reported that over 10% of the sample disagreed with the statement 'measles infection can be fatal'. The survey showed a significantly lower support for MMR vaccination among midwives trained in alternative medicine (p=0.025); furthermore, midwives who declared that they were against the administration of the vaccine were less likely to inform parents about the availability of the vaccine (p=0.009).

Another potential limitation of this review is that all the studies considered were produced in western Europe (Table 2). This might warrant caution in the interpretation of the results. Attitudes and knowledge of immunisation among healthcare providers might not be the biggest problem in lower-resource countries, as in some Central and Eastern European countries, where low coverage rates might also be due to logistic and organisational issues in vaccine delivery. However, it should be noted that, with the exception of Romania (4015 confirmed cases), the major outbreaks of measles in 2011 were reported in western European countries: France (15 206 confirmed cases), Italy (5181 confirmed cases) and Spain (1986 confirmed cases) [52]. For these countries, low vaccination coverage rates, and thus the high incidence of measles, are unarguably, at least in part, a consequence of a general complacency towards the disease and of loose strategies for vaccination coverage. This is partly due to false myths and anti-vaccine propaganda and partly to the fact that vaccination has made measles an uncommon disease, diluting perceptions and memories of how threatening it can be.

In order to improve vaccination coverage, therefore, it is fundamental to raise awareness about the disease and fill any knowledge gaps of healthcare workers, providing them with evidence-based information on vaccines and educating them to communicate effectively with patients and parents; this could be attained through dedicated websites and by emphasising vaccine education in the medical and nursing curricula. The Council of the European Union [53] has invited Member States to make efforts along these lines.

Similar to the situation for healthcare workers, we found that there was a small proportion of parents who were very reluctant to have their children vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, regardless of proof of its efficacy and safety. However, most vaccine-decliners are simply under-informed or received misconceived information [24,28,36,37,43,48]. Better informed and trained health professionals could have a substantial impact on the vaccination choices of those parents. For example, the results of Ciofi degli Atti et al. are indicative of the fact that that more efforts are needed to educate mothers (as well as physicians) regarding the risks associated with measles, as well as the fact that intercurrent illness is rarely a contraindication to immunisation [49].

Reaching 95% vaccine coverage is a priority for Europe. Measles was eliminated in 2002 in the Americas through universal coverage and active case surveillance [54]. One of the reasons behind this successful story in the Americas was good coordination among a consortium of countries. The Pan American Health Organization developed an enhanced and, most importantly, integrated disease elimination strategy [55]. The successful experience in the Americas shows the added value of addressing measles elimination at the European level. No country in Europe can attain it individually: only a joint effort will succeed.

Cork measles outbreak worsens
---------------------------
The number of cases of measles in the current outbreak in west Cork has now risen to 64, according to the HSE [Health Service Executine]. This compares to 51 cases reported at the beginning of June. The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) says to date nationally, there have been 101 measles cases reported, and 64 of these are linked to the measles outbreak in County Cork The HPSC says while this outbreak initially affected mainly unvaccinated children, there is now some evidence of it spreading to children in younger age groups.

The HSE has again reminded all parents to ensure that their children, if one year old or over, are up to date with their MMR vaccination. The first MMR dose is usually given at 12 months and the second at 4-5years. Parents whose children may have missed either dose are advised to
contact their GP.

The HPSC believes the west Cork outbreak is linked to the reluctance of many parents in the area to have their children vaccinated. There are concerns that the Cork outbreak could spread to other areas of the country which have a lower than average vaccine uptake unless children get
vaccinated.

French blamed for measles outbreak in Britain as cases across Europe soar by 550% in a year
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Measles rates in Britain are more than five times higher than last year prompting concerns that an epidemic is spreading across Europe. There have been nearly 500 cases so far since January - mainly in children and university students -- compared to the same period in 2010 when there were just 90 cases. The figure is more an increase of 550 per cent. Health officials believe the disease is being spread by families holidaying on the continent, particularly France, which is currently in the grip of a major epidemic.

Measles cases have soared over the last year despite an increase in the number of toddlers having the MMR vaccine. Figures show that 90 per cent of toddlers have had the jab -- the highest level since the MMR scandal of the late 1990s when a study claimed the vaccine caused autism. The outbreak is believed to have started in France where there have been at least 7000 cases so far this year. Across Europe there have so far been more than 11 000 cases. The latest figures from the Health Protection Agency show there were 496 confirmed cases in England and Wales between January and May. But this is likely to be an underestimate as many cases will not have been reported.

The illness is highly infectious and will spread very quickly in schools, nurseries and university halls of residences if high numbers haven't been vaccinated. Health officials believe that children are catching the disease in holiday clubs and campsites in Europe and then bringing it back to school.

At one small private school near near Newton Abbott, Devon, nearly a third of pupils have been struck down. So far 20 of the 70 children attending Sands school, a small secondary school in Ashburton have caught measles this year and letters have been sent home to parents warning them about symptoms and the importance of being vaccinated.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of the immunisation department at the HPA, said: 'We're very encouraged to see that UK MMR uptake has reached 90 per cent in children aged two indicating increasing levels of trust by parents in the immunisation programme. We're on the way to reaching our goal of 95 per cent uptake. 'It's that time of year when children are traveling on school trips and family holidays and we are reminding parents and young adults of the importance of immunisation before they travel. We cannot stress enough that measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal.'

In 1998 a highly controversial study by Dr Andrew Wakefield linked the MMR vaccine to autism and bowel problems in children led to hundreds of parents boycotting the jab. His research has since heavily disputed and Dr Wakefield was last year struck off the medical register for the way he treated children who took part in his experiments.

Call for more vaccinations as Sussex measles outbreak continues
------------------------------------------------------
Health bosses call on parents to innoculate their children against measles An outbreak of measles across Sussex is showing no signs of slowing. Cases in Brighton and Hove so far this year have already outstripped the number recorded for the whole of 2011, sparking fears of another mini epidemic. Health bosses say the sharp rise in cases is concerning and are urging people to make sure vaccinations are up to date to try to control the spread of the virus. They warn that measles is potentially a very serious disease and can leave children with disabilities.

There have been 129 cases of measles in the city since January [2012], with 15 adults among those affected. Most cases are among school-age children but a significant number of under fives have also been struck down. It is the third outbreak of measles to strike the city in the last four years and it is accepted the virus is now back in the community. City Director of Public Health Tom Scanlon said: "This comes as a surprise as we did not expect things to be kicking off at such a high level. It has been mainly affecting schoolchildren so it is hoped cases may start to fall once the school holidays start. The numbers show there are still a significant number of people in the city who are not vaccinated against the virus and we would urge people to make sure they and their children have both doses of the vaccine."

At least 95% of a population should be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak but in Brighton and Hove the number of under-fives who have had both doses is below 80%. The city has one of the lowest take-up rates for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the South East. The virus is also spreading across the county with 74 cases reported in East Sussex this year compared to 67 in 2011. West Sussex, which has the highest MMR take up rate in Sussex, has had 29 cases, which is fast approaching the 37 it had last year.

Congo DR (Kasai Orientale) -- 5500 cases of measles with 100 deaths in Kabinda and Sankuru
-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
Measles killed more than 5500 cases with a hundred deaths since the beginning of the year in the districts of Sankuru and Kabinda in Kasai Orientale province. The Provincial Health Department (DPS), which published these figures emphasised that the health zones affected are among those which had not organised immunisation days in April. The Director said that only seven health zones of the 51 that make up the province of Kasai Oriental had vaccinated children. Local sources indicate that most patients resided in the Vangakete, Katako Kombe and Lomela Sankuru districts, which recorded alone some 5247 cases of whom 100 died. The same sources say that 269 other cases and five deaths were recorded in health areas Kabinda, Ludimbi, Lukula and Lubao. To explain the resurgence of this disease, an official of the provincial coordination [unit] of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) says that: "the target coverage of routine immunisation of up to 90 percent was not achieved. The measles vaccination timetable had not been followed. Instead of a four year vaccination interval, vaccination was organised at only six yeas after an outbreak. Inadequate resources did not permit vaccination days to be arranged in three areas of District Health Sankuru Health district;

Measles is becoming a cause of concern. This year, 5663 cases of measles were reported. Of these 77 children died. Dr Rahim said the reason behind the outbreak of measles is the suboptimal coverage of vaccination in some parts of the country. "Some places were inaccessible to the teams, while in other instances families refused vaccination."

Measles case reported in northern New Mexico
---------------------------------------
SANTA FE: A 9-year-old girl who had not been vaccinated against measles is the first case of the contagious disease in the state since early last year. The New Mexico Department of Health (DOH) reported it is now working with the girl's family to identify people who may be been exposed to the disease to prevent more cases. The girl had contacts in both Rio Arriba and Taos counties, according to the DOH.

"This case should serve as a reminder to all of us to keep our immunizations up to date, especially when it comes to children," state Secretary of Health Dr. Catherine Torres said in a statement released by the DOH. "Immunizations are the best tool we have to protect people from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases."

The last confirmed case of measles in New Mexico was reported in February 2011. The DOH described measles as a highly contagious disease easily transmitted from one person to another via droplets or through the air. Early symptoms of measles include: red eyes, fever, runny nose and cough. Within a few days following the cough and runny nose, a rash will begin on the face and spread down the body. Measles is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms and laboratory testing.

Infants under one year of age, pregnant women and people whose immune systems are compromised people exposed to the measles patient may need to receive other medications to protect them, according to the DOH. Additionally people exposed to measles and who develop an illness should call their medical provider to make arrangements to be seen without exposing other patients to the virus.
