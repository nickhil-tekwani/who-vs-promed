The Chinese government approved in principle on Wednesday [31 Oct 2007] a
new food safety law aimed at raising standards at every level of
production, a senior official said. The quality of Chinese goods has come
under international scrutiny following scandals involving products ranging
from toothpaste and pet food to toys and fish. Beijing insists the issue is
limited to a few errant companies and is being hyped by foreign media as
well as being driven by a protectionist agenda in some countries. But it
has also vowed to tighten checks and crack down on illegal behaviour.

The State Council, or cabinet, has now approved the food safety law and it
will be passed to the largely rubber-stamp parliament for the final nod,
product quality watchdog chief Li Changjiang told World Health Organization
(WHO) head Margaret Chan. "This law totally covers how to standardise our
food products' production, processing, sale, and supervision," Li told
reporters. "I believe that the promulgation of this law will certainly
effectively raise China's food safety situation and guarantee food safety
and people's health," he said, but gave no timetable.

The law mandates better release of information about food safety issues,
higher fines for wayward firms and punishment of officials who act
irresponsibly, and guarantees the public's right to compensation and to
sue, the central government said on its website (<http://www.gov.cn>). Food
imports and exports will also be more closely examined, it added.

Chan told Li that she was happy with the actions China had taken to raise
standards, especially the Cabinet-level efforts led by vice premier Wu Yi.
"In my meeting with Madame Wu Yi, I was very impressed with the work that
has been undertaken at the State Council level, coordinated by her," Chan
said. "So I'm confident that the way forward will be good for the world and
for China. This is exactly what we are looking to you for -- strengthened
efforts," she added.

Public fears about food safety grew in 2004, when at least 13 babies died
of malnutrition in Anhui province, in eastern China, after they were fed
fake milk powder with no nutritional value. Since then, the government has
taken a tougher attitude. In the latest crackdown, authorities have
"caught" 774 "criminal suspects" who made or sold fake or substandard food
and drugs, the watchdog said earlier this week [see 2].

Li showed Chan a high-tech surveillance system carrying live pictures from
border checkpoints and certain food processing factories, as well as his
department's website. Chan nodded approvingly as Li showed how easy it was
to access on the site a blacklist of companies banned from exporting food
from China, as well as those no longer allowed to import into China. "The
Chinese government has taken a highly responsible attitude towards food
safety," Li said. "The level previously was not so high, as China is big
and has a huge population." With the new law, Li said: "I believe that
China's food safety situation will change for the better."

The Chinese government revealed on Monday [29 Oct 2007] that it had
arrested 774 people over the last 2 months as part of a nationwide
crackdown on the production and sale of tainted food, drugs, and
agricultural products. Government regulators hailed the arrests as a major
step forward for food and drug safety, and said the "criminal suspects"
were detained during nationwide inspections of thousands of restaurants,
food and drug production plants, and wholesale food markets.

Determined to counter accusations that it has been producing and also
exporting tainted goods, China has vowed to revamp its food and drug safety
regulations and to close illegal manufacturers and exporters. In the summer
[2007], the government even executed the former head of the nation's food
and drug administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, after he was convicted of accepting
bribes and failing to properly supervise food and drug companies, some of
which had sold counterfeit drugs.

But the government also acknowledged Monday [29 Oct 2007] that problems
remain. In its announcement, it said that this month [October 2007] only 82
per cent of food tested in medium and large cities in China met safety
standards, and nearly 30 per cent of the restaurants surveyed by regulators
had failed food safety inspections.

The announcement of the arrests, which was made over the weekend [27-28 Oct
2007] but was not posted on a government website until Monday [29 Oct
2007], offered few details about the nature and seriousness of the food and
drug safety violations involved -- or, indeed, who had been arrested or the
size of their businesses. The government said only that it had investigated
626 criminal cases.

The arrests came after nearly a year of high-profile recalls involving
everything from tainted pet food ingredients to problem toys, and after
repeated promises on the part of government regulators to crack down on
tainted goods and restore confidence in the Made in China label.

As part of its effort, the government is also trying to counter widespread
concerns that the quality and safety of the food and drugs sold to its own
citizens are far worse than of the products it exports. In fact, China
acknowledged this year [2007] that while it believes 99 per cent of its
food exports meet safety standards, only about 80 per cent of food sold
domestically has passed inspections.

On Monday [29 Oct 2007], the government said that a 4 month campaign to
root out bad food and drug producers and sellers was paying dividends.
"This action of inspecting food safety demonstrates our determination, and
we should make every effort to further consolidate our previous work," Li
Changjiang, the head of the General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection, and Quarantine said, according to the statement published on
the website. "We will carry out inspections throughout the country to
safeguard our people's living standard."

In a separate announcement Monday [29 Oct 2007], the Ministry of
Agriculture said that it was revoking the registration of 11 highly toxic
pesticides because of food safety concerns. In several cases, the
pesticides were banned from use in China, but were nonetheless manufactured
in the country for export to places where their use remained legal.
Government regulators said they were worried that the banned pesticides
were finding their way back into the Chinese market.

The government also said this week that since July [2007], inspectors
working at Chinese ports have destroyed or recalled over 1000 tons of fake
products.

China is also working with American and European regulators to cooperate on
product safety and to put into place new methods to detect harmful
products. The government has called this a "special battle" to save the
Made in China label. The problems began this year [2007], after American
pet food makers recalled millions of tons of ingredients that were tainted
with industrial chemicals imported from China. Later, the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) blocked imports of some Chinese seafood,
including shrimp and eel, because of recurring problems with residues of
illegal chemicals, including cancer-causing substances. Then regulators and
safety inspectors around the world began turning up toxic toothpaste from
China and Chinese-made toys coated in lead paint, which can be harmful if
ingested by small children, leading to global recalls.

The crisis spurred calls worldwide for more stringent food safety
inspection regimes and toy safety regulations. It also prompted some
consumers to begin avoiding Chinese-made goods and led to calls in Congress
for a ban on some Chinese imports. Trade statistics, though, show that with
few exceptions, China's exports to the rest of the world continue to soar,
including exports of toys, seafood, and agricultural products.

[Improvements in China's policy, legislation, and State control upon the
safety of food, medicines and vaccines have been long awaited and will be
warmly welcomed by China's trade partners, though -- if/when materialised
-- the main gain will be for China's own population.

The growing international concern relating to food safety issues is
reflected by the recent decision of the OIE, an international organisation
traditionally engaged exclusively with animal health issues (epizootics),
to add food safety to its main objectives. In 2002, an OIE working group
(WG) on animal production food safety was established, after a request from
the OIE International Committee to strengthen OIE activities in the area of
food safety, as well as to further develop collaboration with the Codex
Alimentarius Commission (CAC; United Nations FAO/WHO Commission on Food
Standards to simplify and integrate food standards for adoption
internationally). The WG's reports on its 1st 6 meetings, as well as
additional Food-safety related information, are available on OIE's website
"Animal Production Food Safety" at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info_jw/en_APFS.htm#>. The WG's 7th meeting is
being held at OIE headquarters in Paris (France), on 6-8 Nov 2007.

Food safety aspects of animal disease and animal products have been raised
several times in China in recent years (issues such as SARS, avian
influenza, _Streptococcus suis_, PRRS). One of the issues is the control
upon animal vaccines, as prescribed by the OIE manual. 10 manufacturers of
avian influenza vaccines are officially certified in China, while several
(up to 30) others, uncontrolled and uncertified, have been reportedly
active until recently, according to unofficial but reliable sources. It is
to be hoped that this issue will also obtain now the desired attention.
