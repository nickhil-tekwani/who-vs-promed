Uttar Pradesh: Outbreaks of Fatal Febrile Illness Affecting Children
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Health experts have begun investigating a mysterious [illness] that has
killed nearly 100 children and sickened hundreds of others over the last 2
months in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh, officials said on Sat 30
Nov 2002. The children, mostly below 12 years of age, have died in hospitals
in small towns following what doctors and district officials said was high
fever brought on by mosquito bites.
At least 60 children have died in Saharanpur, the worst-hit district, said
Chandan L. Choudhury, the district administrator. The area is 120 miles east
of the state capital, Lucknow. Two teams of doctors and public health
specialists from the federal and state government have begun investigations
in Saharanpur to study the outbreak of the disease, said Navtej Singh,
another administrator in Saharanpur.
Children have also died in the neighboring Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad and
Meerut districts, he said. Doctors and government authorities were divided
over the cause of the [illness], which caused patients to show symptoms
similar to Japanese encephalitis (JE). That disease is spread from pigs to
humans through mosquito bites. It attacks the central nervous system,
causing flu-like symptoms, vomiting, paralysis and even death.
Poverty, illiteracy and a lack of hygiene lead to the death of hundreds of
children each year from diseases spread by mosquitoes and flies in Uttar
Pradesh, India's largest state in size and population. The disease had not
been widely reported by the news media as such deaths were common, local
officials said. "It's a regular phenomenon. Each year, after the rainy
season and before winter sets in, many, many children die in Uttar Pradesh.
This is nothing alarming," said Navtej Singh, the administrator. [This is a
sad state state of affairs. - Mod.JW]

"Mysterious" Disease Causes Death of Over 100 Children
------------------------------------------------------
Over 100 children are believed to have died due a "mysterious" disease in
Saharanpur and adjoining areas in north India's Uttar Pradesh in the past 4
to 5 days, a senior district health official said on Sat 30 Nov 2002.
However, reports quoting official sources in Lucknow put the death toll at
42.
Teams of doctors from Delhi and Lucknow have reached Saharanpur to
investigate the disease-causing agent and the nature of the disease,
Saharanpur Chief Medical Officer Ghanshyam Singh told local media. He said
that reports of deaths of children from various hospitals in the district
and neighboring areas of Baghpat district have been received and the toll
could have exceeded 100. The teams have collected blood samples, he said,
adding that the children who have succumbed to the disease are from both the
city and rural areas.
The Director General of Health Office in Lucknow said that as symptoms of
dengue, cerebral malaria and Japanese encephalitis are similar, it could not
be said that disease was encephalitis, the Press Trust of India reported.

Mystery Fever Kills 50 in North India
-------------------------------------
At least 50 children in north India have died of a mysterious fever in the
past month. A health official in the state of Uttar Pradesh says officials
do not know what disease has caused the deaths. According to local doctors,
the disease is a form of Japanese encephalitis, a deadly virus [disease]
spread by mosquitoes. The symptoms include high fever, tiredness, headache,
nausea, and vomiting.
Dr Sen, a doctor in Lucknow, says unhygienic living conditions in villages
in the districts of Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat and Muzzafarnagar allow the
virus to thrive. He says children are more susceptible to the disease as
their immune system was weak. [It is more likely that the adults in the area
have already survived the disease when they were children, & are immune. -

[Control measures will differ depending on whether the disease is JE, dengue
or something else. Laboratory tests are available for JE, dengue & viral
encephalitides. It should be possible to make a quick diagnosis, rather
than going from year to year without knowing what diseases are striking down
children at this season. As shown below, India has difficulty in diagnosing
some diseases, and could probably use some help. - Mod.JW]
