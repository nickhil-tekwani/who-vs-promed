Campaign to Eradicate Foot & Mouth Disease
----------------------------------
In a renewed move to control the spread of foot & mouth disease
(FMD), the Kingdom will coordinate efforts with some Arab countries
for a major eradication campaign this month.
A group of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia will establish a
laboratory for FMD diagnosis and produce suitable vaccines besides
embarking on a drive to disseminate information.
Livestock, valued at 18 billion USD, is one of the most vital assets
of the Kingdom.
The campaign is directed to ensure a concerted approach for the
eventual eradication of FMD in the region. Saudi Arabia detected more
than 2417 cases of FMD at over 40 infected sites in different parts
of the country during the last 2 years. A total of 13 infected sites
were identified by the Agriculture Ministry in Riyadh alone.
Since then, more than 170 000 animals, mostly cows, have been
vaccinated as part of a nationwide program to check the spread of the
killer disease in the Kingdom.
A high-level committee was formed under the chairmanship of Interior
Minister Prince Naif to take urgent measures to prevent the disease
and to educate livestock owners about the need to detect the disease
among their herds. The panel is composed of the ministers of
agriculture, health, commerce, finance, and municipal affairs.
Spelling out the features of the FMD campaign, a statement released
by the OPEC Fund for International Development said that the
initiative led by the Arab Organization for Agriculture Development
(AOAD) will establish control efforts to prevent future outbreaks
with the long-term goal of eradicating the disease. The OPEC Fund for
International Development has approved a grant of 300 000 USD to
support the first phase of the campaign.

[FMD is spread in the Middle East mainly by small ruminants.
According to FAO (FAOSTAT 2002), the ruminant populations of Saudi
Arabia are: cattle -- 307 000; sheep -- 7 931 000; goats -- 4 529
000; camels -- 415 000. (The estimated 18 billion USD value of the
Saudi livestock deserves clarification). To control FMD, mass
vaccinations of the large sheep and goat populations throughout the
Middle East will have to be carried out. - Mod.AS]
