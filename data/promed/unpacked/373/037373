I agree with the comments that this will certainly not make it easier for
the farmer. However food poisoning is only one aspect from the proposal,
proven zoonotic diseases as [those caused by _E. coli_, _Salmonella_,
_Campylobacter_, _Listeria_, [as well as tuberculosis, also come under
this heading. Diseases of which the zoonotic nature is not yet proven (like
BSE) may soon come in too.

The proposed extension of the application of the UK Consumer Protection Act
from food _products_ (already covered) to food _produce_ (as from the farm)
would not cover harm that, "comes from the consumer's home, not the
producer" or due to " processing plants, such as butchers, and restaurant
establishments" (those are already cover by the existing provisions of the
Act).
The journalist's "merely" was to stress that in the UK (and EU) liability
is _strict_ , meaning that the plaintiff does not have to prove negligence
by the producer, but "merely" has to prove that the harm was _caused_ by
the producer (unless the producer could prove in defense that at the time
science could not have known that harm would be caused). That is neither
"superficial" nor is it less than a firm requirement for proof.
[Such proof for the farmer may be no easy task and consequently an already
suffering portion of the economy is likely to suffer even farther. The
approach still seems casual to me, if the farmer is liable even if the farm
'contamination' is not apparent, whether _E. coli_ O157 or _Listeria_, in
the absence of government decreed regular testing. One of my concerns is
with increasing environmental pressures on water sources that are becoming
progressively more fragile, contamination of produce may be an unknown
situation until produce is at the market or the producer is also ill. For
example, a well becomes contaminated from a neighboring septic system that
has malfunctioned. - Mod.TG
Of course it would be difficult (maybe sometimes impossible) in the case of
bulked material, but even in a bulked milk supply, investigation can
sometimes trace the infection of the bulk back to the input from a
particular farm. However, it is particularly applicable in microbiological
food poisoning caused by food produce that will be neither processed by a
manufacturer nor cooked by a consumer. For examples of where it would work
well, consider an _E. coli_ O157 food poisoning outbreak conclusively shown
to be caused by infected lettuce, the infection traced back to the farm
where it was grown? Or an outbreak of listeriosis caused by infected
farmhouse cheese, where the infection is traced back to the farm where it
was made?
[There has been at least one case of a water source that became
contaminated with _E. coli_ 0157 and that water was used to spray the
produce at the market. It is not beyond the realm of possibilities that
similar situations could happen again. But I acknowledge you may have a
point, with some bacteria. - Mod.TG
The proposed change to the UK Consumer Protection Act reflects a similar
proposed change in EU consumer protection legislation.

[I appreciate our readers clarifying the possible misunderstanding as well
as keeping me alert. Thanks guys! Unless there is a substantial change in
the law or a resulting outbreak of disease, this thread is cut. - Mod.TG
