New Alabama rot [also known as CRGV (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy)] cases have arisen in the 1st 2 months of 2018, a worrying development. Dog owners fear the number of fatalities will continue to rise as mystified vets struggle to establish a cause or cure for the deadly disease.

There have been 135 cases of Alabama rot in the UK since the disease was first detected in 2012 and 2017 was officially the worst year yet with 37 deaths.

So far for 2018 there have already been 13 fatal cases, with more suspected cases that could not be confirmed because the grieving owners would not allow post mortem examinations to be carried out on their beloved pets.

Alabama rot originated in America among greyhounds in the 1980s but UK cases have only been reported in the last 6 years.

The disease causes dogs to vomit and develop skin lesions, and results in kidney failure and, in 80 per cent of cases, death.

The 13 deaths so far in 2018 are spread across the country with confirmed cases in West Sussex, Somerset, Wiltshire, Greater Manchester, Devon, Gloucestershire [England], Rhondda and Powys [Wales].

The latest case was confirmed by Longmead Vets in Shaftesbury, Dorset [England], on [Tue 27 Feb 2018]. They said a post-mortem examination confirmed a 3-year-old labrador had died from the disease.

Research is being funded by the New Forest Dog Owners Group and charity 'Stop Alabama Rot'.

Although many of the earlier cases occurred in southern England, in particular the New Forest, there have been dog deaths caused by it in 32 counties across the country.

The widespread nature of the flesh-eating disease along with the indiscriminate nature of it -- it affects numerous breeds of varying ages and both sexes -- has only led to more uncertainty among vets.

The 1st Alabama rot conference was held last year [2017] with vets across Britain discussing a number of theories about the cause of the disease.

Dr Kim Stevens of the Royal Veterinary College is carrying out research into geographical patterns as well as environmental and climatic risk factors. She is hoping to have the results of her work published by March [2018].

Specialist fish vet Dr Fiona Macdonald is investigating a possible link between Alabama rot and a bacterium found in fish that causes similar symptoms. She believes an organism, called _Aeromonas hydrophila_, which can be found in fresh or brackish water, infects the dog's skin and toxins produced by the bacteria travel to the kidneys and cause failure.

[A veterinarian] who works at Hampshire-based Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, said: "This is understandably very worrying for dog owners, but we hope the increase in cases is partially due to a higher awareness and understanding of the disease.

"It is important that dog owners remain calm, but vigilant for signs of the disease, particularly until March, as we are in the peak season for cases.

"The 1st sign of the disease that is normally seen is a skin sore that is not caused by a known injury.

"Most commonly these sores are found on the lower half of the leg and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin or are open and ulcer-like.

"While there is currently no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease, any concerned dog owners should visit the website https://www.vets4pets.com for advice and a map of confirmed cases."

[The findings of Fiona Macdonald and Kim Stevens are expected with interest. The latter was cited in October 2017 as follows: "There are limited cases over the summer whereas everything starts to pick up in November and at least 60 percent of the cases occur in the 1st 3 months of the year, so it's very much an autumn/winter pattern that we're looking at."
