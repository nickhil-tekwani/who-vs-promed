Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage

- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)

- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing

- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 7 new confirmed and 59 new suspected cases in week 16 (19-25 Apr 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 2 deaths among confirmed cases for week 16 of 2021. Unfortunately, there is one newly infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 16).

The report above confirms that, so far this year (2021), Edo, Ondo, and Taraba states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected remained the same at 14, and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case increased from 52 to 53. Nigeria may now be entering the period of case decline. The peak is not as high so far this year (2021) as in previous years, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years and will be the case again for the year 2021, but at a lower level.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. One hopes that this is why there are fewer cases this year (2021).

Summary
------
Background: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic in parts of west Africa. New treatments are needed to decrease mortality, but pretrial reference data on the disease characteristics are scarce. We aimed to document baseline characteristics and outcomes for patients hospitalised with Lassa fever in Nigeria.

Methods: We did a prospective cohort study (LASCOPE) at the Federal Medical Centre in Owo, Nigeria. All patients admitted with confirmed Lassa fever were invited to participate and asked to give informed consent. Patients of all ages, including newborn infants, were eligible for inclusion, as were pregnant women. All participants received standard supportive care and intravenous ribavirin according to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control guidelines and underwent systematic biological monitoring for 30 days. Patients' characteristics, care received, mortality, and associated factors were recorded using standard WHO forms. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to investigate an association between baseline characteristics and mortality at day 30.

Findings: Between 5 Apr 2018 and 15 Mar 2020, 534 patients with confirmed Lassa fever were admitted to hospital, of whom 510 (96%) gave consent and were included in the analysis. The cohort included 258 (51%) male patients, 252 (49%) female patients, 426 (84%) adults, and 84 (16%) children (younger than 18 years). The median time between 1st symptoms and hospital admission was 8 days (IQR 7-13). At baseline, 176 (38%) of 466 patients had a Lassa fever RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) lower than 30. From admission to end of follow-up, 120 (25%) of 484 reached a National Early Warning Score (2nd version; NEWS2) of 7 or higher, 67 (14%) of 495 reached a Kidney Disease-Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) stage of 2 or higher, and 41 (8%) of 510 underwent dialysis. All patients received ribavirin for a median of 10 days (IQR 9-13). 62 (12%) patients died (57 [13%] adults and 5 [6%] children). The median time to death was 3 days (1-6). The baseline factors independently associated with mortality were the following: age 45 years or older (adjusted odds ratio 16.30, 95% CI 5.31-50.30), NEWS2 of 7 or higher (4.79, 1.75-13.10), KDIGO grade 2 or higher (7.52, 2.66-21.20), plasma alanine aminotransferase 3 or more times the upper limit of normal (4.96, 1.69-14.60), and Lassa fever RT-PCR Ct value lower than 30 (4.65, 1.50-14.50).

Interpretation: Our findings comprehensively document clinical and biological characteristics of patients with Lassa fever and their relationship with mortality, providing prospective estimates that could be useful for designing future therapeutic trials. Such trials comparing new Lassa fever treatments to a standard of care should take no more than 15% as the reference mortality rate and consider adopting a combination of mortality and need for dialysis as the primary endpoint.

[One hopes that this information will serve as a baseline for future therapeutic trials. Nigeria would be an appropriate setting for such trials because the virus is endemic there and significant numbers of cases occur there every year. - Mod.TY
