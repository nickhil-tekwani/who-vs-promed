1st evidence for the spread of East African cassava mosaic virus -- Uganda
(EACMV-UG) and the pandemic of severe cassava mosaic disease to Burundi
S. Bigirimana <isabu-gitega@usan-bu.net> (Institut des Sciences
Agronomiques du Burundi, Gitega, Burundi); P. Barumbanze (as for
isabu-getega); R. Obonyo (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture,
Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Centre, Kampala, Uganda); J.P. Legg
(as for Obonyo); and J.P Legg (Natural Resources Institute, Chatham
Maritime, UK). Accepted for publication 27 Oct 2003.
Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is the most important constraint to cassava
(_Manihot esculenta_) production in Africa. Since the 1990s, the importance
of the disease has been greatly increased by the spread through East and
Central Africa of a pandemic of unusually severe CMD (Legg, 1999),
associated with the recombinant begomovirus, East African cassava mosaic
virus -- Uganda (EACMV-UG) (Zhou et al., 1997).
Following reports of the spread of EACMV-UG to Rwanda (Legg et al., 2001),
it became apparent that Burundi, to the south, was also threatened.
A survey of cassava plantings in Burundi was conducted in May/June 2003 to
assess the status of CMD and to identify begomoviruses present. 53 fields
were sampled in 10 of the country's 16 regions and CMD-diseased leaf
samples collected in each field for virus diagnosis. Assessments were made
of CMD incidence, severity (using the standard 1-5 scale), infection type
(either cutting or whitefly-borne) and abundance of the whitefly vector,
_Bemisia tabaci_ (Bt).
Viruses were diagnosed from leaf samples using both specific primer PCR
(Zhou et al., 1997) and restriction digestion with EcoRV and MluI of near
full-length DNA-A fragments amplified using universal begomovirus primers
(Briddon & Markham, 1994).
EACMV-UG, ACMV, EACMV and mixed ACMV?UG infections were identified from 17,
34, 1 and 3 sites, respectively. EACMV-UG occurred at all sites in the
north-eastern regions of Muyinga and Kirundo was present at some sites in
northern Gitega, Ngozi, Karuzi, Kayanza, Ruyigi and northern Rutana, but
was not recorded from southern Gitega, southern Rutana, Muramvya or Bujumbura.
The EACMV-UG affected regions of Muyingo and Kirundo were distinct from the
others in having higher CMD incidence (79 vs. 42 percent), a greater
proportion of whitefly-borne to cutting-borne infection (1.9 vs. 0.6), more
severe symptoms (4.17 vs. 3.26) and a greater abundance of Bt (4.9 vs.
1.0). This data set provides clear evidence for the rapid spread of severe
EACMV-UG associated CMD in the north-eastern regions of Kirundo and
Muyinga. The occurrence of EACMV-UG at sites in northern, central, and
eastern Burundi also suggests that similar changes in CMD epidemiology are
likely to occur here in the near future.
These results represent the first report of the expansion of the African
CMD pandemic into Burundi.

[It was just a matter of time before CMD would be reported from Burundi.
The most likely means of spread of EACMV-UG into Burundi would be via
viruliferous whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_) and movement of infected cassava
cuttings. CMD continues to spread. Research by scientists at the Centro
Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) in Colombia has resulted in
the development and deployment of microsatellites or simple sequence repeat
(SSR) markers which facilitate resistance breeding. SSR markers have been
successfully applied in tagging cassava genome loci involved in resistance
to CMD.
