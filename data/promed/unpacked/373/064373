Israel joined force with the Palestinians to fight a possible outbreak of bird
flu and foot and mouth disease [FMD], the Jerusalem Post reported on Wednesday
[22 Feb 2006].
Samples taken from suspected livestock and dead wild fowl have been delivered
by Palestinian officials from Gaza for tests in Israel, said the report.
The outbreaks of either disease will not only jeopardize Palestinians in Gaza
but also the public in Israel, said Uri Madar, who is the head of the
agricultural division at the Erez District Coordinating Office.
"It is in Israel's interest to ensure that agricultural standards in Gaza are
maintained," Madar told the Post as he prepared to transport the samples to
Israel's veterinary service laboratories in Beit Dagan.
If these diseases are confirmed, the situation could have fierce repercussions
in terms of finance and health, Israeli security officials were quoted as
saying.
Earlier this week, Palestinian officials spotted possible signs of FMD in a
number of cows in Gaza.
Israeli officials insisted that samples be transferred to Israel for further
testing, Madar said.
Despite the security situation, cooperation and coordination with the
Palestinians on such issues has been good, said Madar.
