CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE UPDATE 2006: USA (ILLINOIS)

16 additional cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have been
detected in northern Illinois through sampling of hunter-harvested
deer during the state's 2005-06 deer seasons.
The cases include 2 deer taken by hunters in Ogle County, the 1st
time CWD has been detected there.
"The (Illinois) Department of Natural Resources continues intensive
sampling for CWD as part of our effort to slow the spread of the
disease in our wild deer herd," said Paul Shelton, manager of the
IDNR Forest Wildlife Program. "We appreciate the support of hunters
who continue to voluntarily allow us to take tissue samples from
their deer to test for the disease. The sampling, testing and
surveillance are extremely important as we deal with CWD."
Chronic wasting disease was first discovered in Illinois in November
2002, and to date Illinois has detected 112 positive cases.
The disease had been confined to counties of Boone, Winnebago,
McHenry and the northern portion of DeKalb, until the 2 cases were
detected in nearby Ogle County this winter.
"We were somewhat surprised to find these 2 cases in Ogle County
because no cases had been detected there previously despite very
intensive sampling," Shelton said. "We've sampled nearly 2000 deer in
Ogle County since 2003 and these are the only 2 cases we have found
there to date.
"We are still awaiting the results of approximately 350 other samples
from Ogle County taken this fall."
Illinois biologists have collected samples from more than 2500 deer
in 7 northern Illinois counties so far during the 2005-06 firearm and
archery deer seasons and from suspect animals reported to the IDNR.
Hunters in Boone, Winnebago, and McHenry counties and a portion of
DeKalb County north of the East-West Tollway will participate in a
CWD deer season this weekend to help control deer densities and the
spread of chronic wasting disease. Hunters with unfilled 2005
firearm, muzzleloader, or archery deer permits valid for one of the
open counties may use those to hunt.
Hunters using unfilled permits from the 2005 firearm, muzzleloader,
or archery season may take deer appropriate for that permit
(antlerless-only or either-sex). Special CWD season permits also were
issued previously. Check stations will be manned in the 4 counties,
and successful hunters who submit samples for CWD testing will be
provided with an additional permit valid for the remainder of the season.
Confirmed CWD cases by county are: Boone (53), Winnebago (42),
McHenry (9), Dekalb (6) and Ogle (2).
While not thought to be contagious to humans or livestock, CWD is
known to spread from animal to animal among deer and elk. The disease
affects the brain of the infected animal, causing it to become
emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose coordination and eventually die.
Illinois expanded its chronic wasting disease surveillance effort in
2002 following the discovery of CWD in neighboring Wisconsin. For
updated information about CWD, check the IDNR Web site at:
<http://dnr.state.il.us/cwd>
Hunters who participated in the CWD sampling can check the status of
their deer at this site. Hunters who provided samples from deer that
test positive are notified by the IDNR.

[It is unfortunate that there were cases found in counties where none
were expected. This finding continues to highlight the fact that we
do not know the exact mechanism by which this malady moves. Certainly
more research is needed regarding this disease. There are more
questions than answers. - Mod.TG]
