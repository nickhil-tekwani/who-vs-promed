[Since ProMED-mail's last report of the latest accumulated testing results, on 24 Mar 2012 (posting 20120324.1079633), the total number of SBV outbreaks in the 8 countries reportedly infected has risen from 2552 to 3628; the majority of the added outbreaks involved cattle, as predicted, and subsequent to the approaching termination of the lambing season. Cases, particularly hydranencephalic (due to past infections during early pregnancy), may still appear in cattle throughout May. - Mod.AS]

[2] UK: SBV cases decline

Schmallenberg cases on the decline
----------------------------------
The number of new cases of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) continues to creep up a declining rate.

The latest figures from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) show the disease has now been confirmed on 249 farms in England -- 32 in cattle and 217 in sheep [one case in sheep has been added since; see item 1 above].

This represents an increase of just 6 new confirmed cases in the past week -- 4 in cattle and 2 in sheep -- and 10 new cases in the past fortnight.

The disease has been found in 24 counties in England, all recognised to be at risk from infection from midges blown over from mainland Europe last summer and autumn [2011].

AHVLA said the decline in the numbers of reporting farms was in line with all EU member states, where the sheep reports have declined as lambing in "at risk" sheep draws to an end. Any sheep still lambing now should be in the clear as the "critical time of gestation when infection can impact on the foetus" would have occurred after midges stopped circulating in the winter.

AHVLA said it continues to expect to see cases in cattle into early summer [2012], as cattle have a longer gestation period than sheep. A number considered at risk from autumn infection are yet to calve [see comment to item 1 above].

[The term "decline" and not the more common "peaked" is used to remind subscribers about the fact that cases of SBV (malformed neonates) are an expression of an infection which had, in fact, taken place months ago; the actual peak of infection is thus a past event.

The following additional information has been reported by Freddie Dawson in FoodManufacture.co.uk of 23 Apr 2012 at http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/content/view/print/630443:

"Peter Garbutt, National Farmers Union chief livestock adviser, told FoodManufacture.co.uk that the virus was unlikely to have a large effect on the food supply chain -- but that could change. If the virus started to spread out of its current localised area in the south east, or if it is discovered that the UK midge population is infected, the impact on the supply chain could be significantly worse, he added. Scientists hope that if domestic midges carry the virus, they could also effectively immunise sheep and cattle before the start of the next lambing and calving seasons.

Alberto Laddomada, head of the European Commission's animal health unit, acknowledged that the disease had spread "very, very quickly". He told Reuters: "It is certainly a warning for the whole world in the sense that, unfortunately, new threats may emerge."

The European Medicines Agency, London, UK, held a one-day workshop on 10 Apr 2012 to discuss issues related to the development of inactivated vaccines against SBV. Details of the discussions and conclusions are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
