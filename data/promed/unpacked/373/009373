During the weekly chikungunya meeting yesterday, the Prefect admitted that
the epidemic was getting worse, especially in the east and the south [of
the island]. An action plan has been launched, but the means provided by
Drass (Direction regionale des affaires sanitaires et sociales) are
insufficient. There was a change of tone during yesterday's press
conference about chikungunya, organized by the Prefect. Where there were
7600 officially reported cases on Wednesday, they had ballooned to 10 383
in 2 days, and Dr Philippe Renault from Cire (Cellule interregionale
d'epidemiologie) remarked that these numbers were undoubtedly an
under-estimation.
The explanation for this came swiftly. The actual reporting of new cases is
overtaken by the magnitude of the task, and only works outside of the
numerous infected clusters. It is estimated that there are 1200 new victims
per week, again mostly in the East and the South. Cire, together with
Institute for Health Control (l'Institut de Veille Sanitaire) has been
thinking about putting in place a new method of reporting in order to put
an end to this situation. Therefore the Prefect made it clear to the
doctors (and those who openly take issue with the official numbers) that an
efficient plan of action depends on their accurate reporting.
But at this moment there is no sign that Drass will send investigators to
help collect the exact numbers of new cases, which means fewer people on
the spot, while the ones who are there cannot handle the situation any
more. Thus, the detection and possible fumigation against mosquitoes of the
10 houses surrounding a residence of a reported victim is only possible in
new sites, in order to snuff out chikungunya before it ravages the whole
street.
In Saint-Louis or in other infested clusters, fumigation should be carried
out on a massive scale, from neighborhood to neighborhood. In any case,
human and financial resources need to be strengthened. A permanent crisis
center has been set up at the prefecture. There will be bi-weekly meetings
with the education officers and a general council. We will also create 11
special brigades; the first 4 (made up of 20 military people and an agent
of Drass, with a 4x4 vehicle and spraying material) will be operational as
of Monday. Finally, a specialist in health crisis management will soon be
added to the communication plan. The state has mobilized one million Euros
to date [USD 1.15 million].

[The chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island seems more serious than it
first appeared to be. The doctors on a chikungunya forum (in French) are
questioning the actual numbers and the magnitude of the epidemic. According
to the local newspaper, 2783 new cases were reported in just 2 days, which
would mean the epidemic is spreading at a speed of 58 new cases per hour or
one new case per minute. ProMED-mail would like to get further information
from readers who are familiar with the situation. - Mod.RY]
