Bird flu tests "negative" in Romania
------------------------------------
Fears that a deadly bird flu strain had spread to Romania
may be wrong. Experts believed H5N1, the strain behind 65
deaths in Asia, had entered Europe for the 1st time after 3
ducks died. But initial tests for avian flu viruses were
"negative," the [UK] Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs [Defra] said. Debby Reynolds, chief veterinary
officer, added that an EU team would fly to Romania today
[10 Oct 2005] to carry out more tests.

Bird flu threat spreads with outbreaks in Romania, Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
Europe awaited confirmation Sunday [9 Oct 2005] of its 1st
outbreak of the deadly bird flu strain, as Romania and
Turkey scrambled to cull infected birds and prevent the
virus spreading to people. Anti-flu vaccines were being
administered in Romania to thousands of people amid fears
that the avian flu detected there Friday may be the deadly
strain that has killed over 60 in south east Asia.
Romanian authorities said that on the basis of preliminary
tests, they feared that 3 ducks in the south eastern Tulcea
region had been infected with the H5N1 strain transmissible
to humans. "The analysis by Romanian experts shows that it
is the virus H5N1. It is quite possible that this form of
the virus is less virulent than the Asian one," said health
official Rodica Costina.
However, final confirmation of Europe's 1st contamination by
the virus was expected within 2 weeks from a laboratory in
Britain [see item 3].
Health Minister Eugen Nicolaescu said that no human cases
had been detected so far in the eastern European country.
Authorities said that migratory birds from Russia, stopping
over at the Danube delta, had carried the virus into the
country.
Meanwhile, officials in Turkey announced that some 2000
poultry had been slaughtered on a farm in north western
Balikesir province after avian flu was detected there.
Samples from the infected animals are being tested at a
laboratory in the western city of Bornova [in the province
of Izmir, neighboring the province of Balikesir - Mod.AS].
Regional officials have said the disease probably came to
Turkey from migratory birds attracted to a nature reserve
near the quarantined farm.
In Romania, 3400 people living in the Danube delta region
have been vaccinated for flu, and 125 000 are expected to be
vaccinated in the coming days, Nicolaescu said on Sunday [9
Oct 2005] [see comment further].
Romania does not have a specific vaccine for avian flu.
However, this anti-flu vaccine is important as it helps to
enhance immunity, health ministry spokeswoman Oana Grigore
told AFP. [If this news is accurate, it seems the Romanian
authorities have decided to apply a policy which somewhat
resembles the one attempted in the Netherlands in 2003; the
Dutch vaccinated with the then current influenza vaccine and
applied prophylactic treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors
to all people exposed to infected poultry. The main reason
was the need to prevent possible mixed infections with human
and avian influenza viruses which might lead to virus
reassortment; see 20030501.1092. - Mod.AS] "The risk of a
disaster is remote if the population is vaccinated against
influenza," Nicolaescu earlier told news media.

Britain sends bird flu team to Romania for tests
-----------------------------------------------
Britain is sending a team of experts to Romania to help with
tests for bird flu, after the disease was detected in
poultry in the Danube delta, officials said on Sunday [9 Oct
2005]. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: "Part of that might involve
bringing samples back ... We are ready to help if needed."
The spokesman said no samples had been sent to Britain for
testing as yet.
Romania earlier said further testing would take place in
Britain after its own scientists' tests. The Veterinary
Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, near London, is the
European reference laboratory for avian influenza. The
laboratory is an agency of DEFRA.
The spokesman said Britain was also in touch via the
European Commission with Turkish authorities to see whether
any assistance was needed there after Turkey reported its
1st outbreak of the disease on a farm near the Aegean Sea.
Romania culled hundreds of birds and quarantined villages on
Sunday [9 Oct 2005] to try to halt the spread of bird flu.
Medical teams were sent to test for possible human cases and
to vaccinate the population, but officials said there had
been no cases of flu among the delta's people.
Officials said scientists had so far been unable to isolate
the virus in the suspect birds, indicating it was less
likely to be a virulent strain, but tests would continue for
several days.
If the Romanian cases did turn out to be the deadly H5N1
virus, they would be the 1st evidence the strain has spread
to Europe from Asia, where it has killed 65 people and
millions of birds since 2003.

[According to Article 1.1.2.3. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal
Health Code, member countries are obliged to notify
immediately the 1st occurrence of a listed disease and/or
infection within their respective territories. According to
article 2.7.12.1, avian influenza in its notifiable form
(NAI) is defined as an infection of poultry caused by any
influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes, irrespective of
their pathogenicity. If, as indicated in the newswire citing
the Anatolia news agency, an H5 virus has been identified in
Turkey, this outbreak should be immediately notified to the
OIE. Such a notification should include a prescribed list of
data.
In the absence of official notifications from either
country, the following brief summary, based upon the
newswires available so far, is an attempt to review the
situation (accuracy is not guaranteed):
Romania: On Friday [7 Oct 2005] the country reported its 1st
case of the disease in the village Ceamurlia de Jos, in
south Tulcea (Danube delta, eastern Romania). Reportedly, 3
ducks were affected in the yard of a peasant family.
However, on Sat 8 Oct 2005, Romanian officials told AP that
dead birds were 1st noted in late September 2005; that
samples were sent to a laboratory in Bucharest, where
scientists found antibodies to bird flu, but -- unable to
find out the exact strain of the virus -- they allegedly
sent samples to Britain for testing at the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, Surrey, from where the
results "are expected in the next few days."
According to the current newswire, this information,
however, seems to be denied now by the British lab.
On Sat 8 Oct 2005, Ion Agafitei, the chief veterinarian, was
cited telling reporters that 3 (unspecified, additional?)
birds had tested positive for the virus in a 2nd village:
Smardan, in north west Tulcea region. Quarantines had been
imposed in the 2 villages and 5 others where suspicious bird
deaths had occurred in recent days. Additional information
referred to tests on several swans which had been found dead
nearby, "to be finalized in a couple of days".
Turkey: Disease cases (about 2000 dead turkeys out of an
unspecified population) in a commercial farm in an unnamed
village near Balikesir in the Asian part of Marmara region,
was brought to officials' attention on Wednesday [5 Oct
2005]. On Thursday [6 Oct 2005], officials went to the
village and destroyed all remaining (unspecified number)
birds on the turkey farm and buried them, then disinfected
the area. On Friday [7 Oct 2005], the Anatolia news agency
cited officials as saying that it was confirmed that the
birds died of the H5 type of bird flu. The 1st public news
item on the suspected outbreak appeared on Sat 8 Oct 2005.
It is not clear whether, what and when information on the
suspicion/confirmation of avian influenza was provided by
either country to international agencies (OIE, FAO, WHO),
the EU or trade partners.
The information is rather confusing; official notifications
are urgently needed. - Mod.AS]
