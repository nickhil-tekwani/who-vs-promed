Rates of Tick-borne encephalitis reported by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been strikingly similar for the past 2 decades (See graph at https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/TBEBaltic.png).

This phenomenon seems to have begun only after dissolution of the former Soviet Union, and could reflect similar ecology, weather or other regional factors.

[Interestingly, the graph cited above shows a marked peak in incidence of cases per 100 000 population between 1994-1999, with lower, but constant, incidence rates thereafter. As Dr Berger comments, changes in rates of TBE incidence in both Latvia and Estonia could be due to a variety of factors.

ProMED thanks Dr Berger for his comments, graph and reference.
