Farmers in [several] Dykundi [Daikondi province] districts had been
disappointed by their current year's [2011] harvest of fruits due to
the lack of water.

A resident of Khedir district said that the almond orchards had also
faced a type of plant disease. He said Dykundi farmers would face
broad economic problems if the government pays no attention to them.

[Almond (_Prunus dulcis), like other stone fruit (_Prunus_ species),
can be affected by a broad range of pathogens. A number of stone fruit
diseases have been reported from the region, but insufficient
information is provided in this report to speculate as to possible
pathogen(s) involved in Daikondi. Trees stressed by environmental
factors, for example by drought as described for the almond orchards
above, may be more susceptible to infections and/or symptoms of
pathogens may become more obvious.
