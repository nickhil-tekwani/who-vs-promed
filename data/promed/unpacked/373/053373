Dr. Cumming's assertion [see Lyme disease - USA (Massachusetts)
(02) 20020516.4231] that [in northwestern Connecticut] you see more Lyme
disease, erythema migrans and ehrlichiosis than streptococcal pharyngitis,
otitis media and pneumonia combined is shocking, and I hope that it might
serve as a wake-up call to other ER doctors as well as other MDs [in
endemic areas -Mod.LL].
In parts of northern California, we have a high nymphal tick infection rate
(averaging 12 percent, range 4-41 percent), but frequently patients
encounter either ignorance or skepticism at the doctor's office. An active
surveillance study done in 1988-1989 in my rural community of about 100
people showed that 24 percent of the study participants were seropositive
(by IFA) for Lyme disease and 37 percent had definite or probable Lyme
disease, 2 percent also had babesiosis, but we did not test for
ehrlichiosis. The researchers concluded that the annual incidence of LD was
1.7 percent, "comparable to or higher than the cumulative
frequencies/incidences from the Northeast." (Lane RS, Mannweiler SA, Stubbs
HA, et al : Risk factors for Lyme disease in a small rural community in
northern California. Am J Epidemiol 1992; 136:1358-68.)
In a recent follow-up survey I did of my neighborhood, all but 2 of 71
individuals reported multiple tick bites. With high nymphal tick infection
rates, it only seems logical that sooner or later people would get Lyme
disease or other tick borne diseases - but trying to get an MD to test and
then to treat adequately (they tend to discount relapses or persistent
infection) is a continual challenge.
Thanks for shedding a little more light on a complex and poorly understood
subject.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ms Mervine (an advocate for patients with Lyme disease
- Mervine P: Diagnosing Lyme disease. Patients have to learn to help
themselves. BMJ 2000; 320:121) for her comments about Lyme borreliosis in
California. Those of us on the east coast of the USA often do not think
of California as a 'hot bed' for the disease and, indeed, the most recent
yearly statistics (for 2000) from CDC (ref. 1) found that most cases were
reported from the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central regions.
State incidence (cases per 100 000 population) was higher than the national
incidence in Connecticut (110.8), Rhode Island (64.4), New Jersey (29.2),
New York (22.8), Delaware (21.3), Pennsylvania (19.1), Massachusetts
(18.2), Maryland (13.0), Wisconsin (11.8), Minnesota (9.5), New Hampshire
(6.8), and Vermont (6.6); these 12 states accounted for 16,877 (95 percent)
of nationally reported cases. California, although with an incidence of
0.3 per 100 000, had registered cases in counties throughout the state. 96
cases were reported for 2000 with a total number of 1 370 between 1991 and
2000. However, it is certainly likely that the disease may be
substantially under-reported. A study from the CDC's Fort Collins
Vector-Borne Unit (ref. 2) suggested that the risk of Lyme disease and
other tick-borne infections in northern California may be greater than
previously thought. In one recent report (ref. 3), the percentage of
infected Ixodes nymphs in parts of Mendocino County, California was 1.7
percent (range 0-4.2 percent) and in another from the foothills of the
western Sierra Nevada mountains found 7.3 percent _B. burgdorferi_
infection rate in _Ixodes pacificus_ adults and 5.4 percent in nymphs (ref. 4).
