The California olive industry has been alerted to an alarming new disease that appears to be spreading among olive cultivars commonly used for oil production. The pathogen _Neofabraea_ has been observed on both Arbosana and Arbequina [variety] trees. The pathogen was previously identified by UC [University of California] Davis in 2013 [see link below] on Coratina and Picholine varieties. Symptoms include defoliation, twig lesions, and leaf spots, and both humid areas and El Ni√±o appear favorable for the disease.

"It's alarming, for sure," said Florent Trouillas, UC Davis. "It appeared out of nowhere. This is definitely something the industry needs to be prepared for. You find the disease has affected entire rows of trees. And we haven't yet visited any groves where table olives are grown." Funding is likely to be sought to investigate the rot and its biology and come up with strategies to control it. California olive oil trade should be on high alert as more is learned about the new blight.

[Fungal species in the genus _Neofabraea_ have been reported to cause fruit rot, anthracnose and canker diseases on a number of tree species, including olive, apple, and pear. In olive, the disease is also called 'olive leprosy', but there is some confusion of common names with diseases caused by _Xylella_ and _Colletotrichum_.

_N. alba_ was found to cause olive fruit rot in California in 2013 but not cankers, but _N. vagabunda_ (shown to be closely related to, and possibly synonym with, _N. alba_) has recently been reported to cause cankers in olive in Spain (see links below). There still appears to be uncertainty about the causal species and epidemiology of the current canker disease in olives in California (see link below).

Symptoms of _Neofabraea_ spp. on olive may include spots, rotting, and/or mummification on fruit with up to 40 per cent yield loss and loss of oil quality; lesions, wilting and necrosis on leaves; defoliation and branch necrosis leading to loss of tree vigour; formation of cankers on twigs, branches and trunks which may lead to death of trees. The fungi are favoured by humid conditions and may be spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means. Disease management may include applications of copper compounds, phytosanitary measures and orchard sanitation.
