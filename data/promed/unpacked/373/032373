Ebola DRC: 7 cases, 4 deaths, 57 percent CFR
--------------------------
WHO, UN Agencies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and partners continue to support the Ministry of Health in the DRC to investigate and respond to the outbreak of EVD confined to Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the northeast of the country.

Two cases have been confirmed as positive for EVD by serology this week [27 May-2 Jun 2017]. These 2 cases were previously reported as suspected cases and are part of known transmission chains. Their contacts have been followed up. The date of the last confirmed case reported remains as 11 May 2017. Since the beginning of the outbreak on 21 Apr 2017, 4 confirmed and 3 probable cases have been reported, of which 4 have died (case fatality rate, CFR: 57 percent). Enhanced surveillance activities are ongoing in affected communities, and new suspected cases continue to be reported and screened. Predictive modelling suggests there is a low and decreasing probability of further cases; however, it is critical to remain vigilant.

Concurrently, differential diagnoses and laboratory investigations are ongoing into the causes of illness in persons who remain sick but have tested negative for EVD, and into the unusually high mortality in the local swine population in 8 villages in the Nambwa Health Area.

Ebola - DR Congo: 8 cases, 4 deaths, 50% CFR
-----------------------------------------
WHO, UN Agencies, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and partners continue to support the Ministry of Health (MoH) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to rapidly investigate and respond to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province in the northeast of the country.

On 5 Jun 2017, one case has been retrospectively confirmed as positive for EVD by serology with a date of onset of 29 Apr 2017. This case was previously reported as a suspected case and is part of the known transmission chain. The contacts for this individual have already been followed up and graduated from the contact follow up period. The date of the last confirmed case reported remains as 11 May 2017.

One new suspected case has been reported as of 5 Jun 2017 in the Ngayi health area, with 15 associated contacts being followed up daily; a sample has been taken to test for EVD. Therefore, there are currently a total of 5 confirmed, 3 probable and one suspected case. Of these, 4 survived, and 4 died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 50 percent.

The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Nambwa (4 confirmed and 2 probable), Ngayi (1 probable) and Mabongo (1 confirmed). The outbreak remains confined to Likati Health Zone.

Modelling suggests the risk of further cases is currently low but not negligible, and decreases with each day without new confirmed/probable cases. As of the reporting date, 76 percent of simulated scenarios predict no further cases in the next 30 days.

All 7 response committees are maintaining functionality at the national level, namely monitoring, case management, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and biosafety, laboratory and research, pyscho-social management, logistics, and communication. The 1st response teams, who have been in the field since the start of the outbreak, [are] being replaced this week. A response team will remain in the affected areas until the declaration of the end of the outbreak.

This EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was notified to WHO by the MoH on 11 May 2017. The cluster of cases and deaths of previously unidentified illness had been reported since late April 2017. Likati Health Zone shares borders with 2 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and with the Central African Republic (Figure 1). The affected area is remote and hard to reach, with limited communication and transport infrastructure.

[This situation may change due to updated confirmed numbers of cases and deaths, contacts being monitored, and the laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance, contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations, reclassification, and case, contact, and laboratory data consolidation.

Informative maps and figures are available at the URL above.

It was thought the DRC Ebola outbreak was successfully contained as of 23 May 2017, the date of the latest suspected case. The last confirmed case had been 11 May 2017. The blog PATH (http://blog.path.org/2017/06/path-at-the-shifting-front-lines-of-ebola/) attributes the rapid containment to an improved alert and response system, better mapping to get supplies and responders in place quickly and efficiently, and the use of a mobile laboratory and rapid diagnostic tests developed since the 2014 West Africa outbreak. Certainly, effective case management, effective infection prevention and control practices, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials, and social mobilization also played a role, as considered by WHO. - Mod.LK]

[3] Uganda: suspected Ebola
Date: Tue 6 Jun 2017
Source: Observer [edited]
http://www.observer.ug/news/headlines/53233-suspected-ebola-patient-suffering-from-bleeding-disorders.html


The patient who was recently admitted and isolated at Lacor hospital in Gulu district after profuse bleeding is suffering from a bleeding disorder, medical personnel have announced.

Dr Cyprian Opira, the executive director of the hospital says preliminary tests conducted on the patient indicate that she is suffering from lack of blood clotting factors, a condition that occurs when blood cannot clot properly.

The patient was isolated over the weekend after being transferred from Adjumani district with complaints of bleeding from her body openings.

Dr Opira says the hospital had a very difficult time managing the bleeding after the patient rejected blood transfusion on religious grounds. The patient is a follower of Jehovah's Witnesses, a religious group that bars its members from undertaking blood transfusions, donating, or storing their own blood for transfusion.

Jehovah's Witnesses' literature teaches that rejecting transfusions is an indisputable religious stand and that those who respect life as a gift from God do not try to sustain life by taking in blood, even in an emergency. To them, accepting transfusion is regarded as abandoning religious doctrines.

However, Dr Opira says that the bleeding has now subsided as the hospital waits for Ebola test results on samples taken to Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe. He called for calm, adding that health workers are well prepared to handle any emergency.

The Ebola fear came barely a month after the World Health Organization confirmed an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the DRC health ministry, 3 people had died after testing positive to the virus in the remote Likati health district [According to WHO, there were 4 deaths; see bulletin above. - Mod.LK].

Ebola is a rare but deadly virus that causes bleeding inside and outside the body. It spreads through contact with the skin or bodily fluids of an infected animal or person. Medical experts say that the virus wrecks the immune system and damages almost every organ. To date, the disease has no cure.

The last outbreak killed more than 11 000 when the virus swept through the West African states of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone last year [2016]. It remains the most severe outbreak of Ebola since the discovery of Ebola viruses in 1976.

Uganda has witnessed 5 Ebola outbreaks over the past 14 years, which have been quickly contained through a combination of epidemiological luck and a well-coordinated response system operating at several levels of the health service.

The most devastating was the 1st Ebola outbreak in Gulu in 2000, which infected 425 people and killed 224.

[According to http://allafrica.com/stories/201706050080.html: "The patient came for medical check-up at the Gynaecology Ward on 31 May 2017. However, her condition wasn't good; she later began bleeding a lot from all body openings. The doctors detected high fever and haemorrhagic manifestations before she was rushed to an isolation ward," Dr Emmanuel Ochola, an epidemiologist at the hospital said...

After the Gulu female patient was booked into isolation, doctors extracted samples, which they sent for analysis at the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe last Sat [3 Jun 2017]. The results are expected out today [7 Jun 2017].

Dr Felix Ochom, a WHO staff in the Emergency and Preparedness Unit at the Uganda office in Kampala, said yesterday [6 Jun 2017]: "We are aware of the suspected case, but we are working with the Ministry of Health. The samples were delivered to Entebbe using the Hub system, and we are going to test them."

"We are monitoring the patient closely in isolation as we wait for the test results from UVRI; we are on high alert at the facility and have taken all the necessary precautions. We caution other health practitioners in various health facilities to be on high alert and refer suspicious cases of haemorrhagic fever immediately," Dr Ochola added.

[4] Uganda: not Ebola

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health yesterday [6 Jun 2017] ruled out [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] after blood samples from the suspected patient tested negative at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).

"The results for the sample from Lacor Hospital are negative for the viral haemorrhagic fevers: Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, RVF and Sosuga," said Mr Innocent Komakech, WHO's officer in charge of disease outbreaks. Mr Komakech added that WHO will keep in touch with Gulu district on preparedness and readiness to respond to such occurrences. Dr Paul Onek, Gulu district health officer, described the negative Ebola test results as "good news" but added a caution. "While this is good news, both health workers and the population should be on the alert," he said.

The blood samples from the patient were taken to UVRI in Entebbe last Saturday after the person at St Mary's Hospital Lacor developed symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The patient was placed in an isolation section as the hospital awaited results from the virus research institute. Dr Emmanuel Ochola, an epidemiologist at the hospital, said upon admission that the patient was diagnosed with severe sepsis, a life-threatening condition that leads to deranged blood coagulation that varies from mild alterations to severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). "Our 1st diagnosis was sepsis, but we needed to be very sure, because it had turned out severe. The patient was bleeding a lot, and we had to isolate her and take her blood sample to UVRI for confirmation whether it was haemorrhagic fever or not," Dr Ochola said. "We are still keeping the patient in isolation, but generally speaking, she is fine now," Dr Ochola said.

7 Jun 2017: Possible explanation for unparalleled spread of Ebola virus discovered
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170607085537.htm

[Citation. He J, Melnik LK. Komin A. (2017). Ebola Virus Delta Peptide is a Viroporin. J Virol, 2017; JVI.00438-17 DOI: 10.1128/JVI.00438-17]

The world may be closer to knowing why Ebola spreads so easily thanks to a team of researchers from Tulane University and other leading institutions who discovered a new biological activity in a small protein from the deadly virus. The team's findings were recently published in the Journal of Virology.

The discovery comes as health workers try to contain another Ebola outbreak in a remote area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ebola, which is highly fatal, causes severe vomiting, internal bleeding and extreme gastrointestinal distress.

A compound known as the "delta peptide" is produced in large amounts in Ebola virus-infected patients, but its function isn't yet known. The investigators tested the effects of purified delta peptide on cells from humans and other mammals and found that it could be a viroporin, a type of viral protein that damages host cells by making the membranes become permeable.

"Our leading hypothesis is that the delta peptide affects the gastrointestinal tract by damaging cells after its release from infected cells," says William Wimley, George A. Adrouny Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Tulane University School of Medicine. "This effect may be a major contributor to the severe GI illness of patients with the Ebola virus."

During the West African Ebola that began in late 2013, the virus spread rapidly, principally because of the presence of the virus in GI fluids. The lack of effective countermeasures led to the deaths of more than 11 000 people.

Tulane researchers say the immediate next step is to begin developing therapies that target the delta peptide.

The research involved laboratories from Tulane University School of Medicine, which participated in the fight against Ebola virus on the front lines in Sierra Leone during the outbreak, as well as researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center.
