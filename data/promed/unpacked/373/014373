Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan today admitted that
chikungunya has caused some casualties in the state.
The Chief Minister said this while replying to a question in the
Assembly today which comes as a correction to State Health Minister P
K Sreemathi's earlier statement that the disease had not claimed any
lives in the state.
The Chief Minister who yesterday visited Alappuzha district from
where a large number of chikungunya cases were reported, said that he
could learn that some of the deaths reported from hospitals were due
to the disease.
He was replying to a clarification sought by Opposition Leader Oommen
Chandy on the statement of the Health Minister in the Assembly.
Achuthanandan said the Health Minister's statement was based on
report given by officials. He said he could understand the real
situation only when he visited the hospitals at Alappuzha and
Cherthala areas. He said as many as 3000 people have been admitted to
various hospitals in Alappuzha district due to the disease.
Chandy said his information was that as many as 40 people have died
due to the outbreak of the disease and demanded financial relief to
the families of the victims.

[Chikungunya is a virus disease of high morbidity but very low to nil
mortality. Some reports coming from the current Indian Ocean epidemic
(2005-2006) mention fatal cases but without stating that the deaths
were definitively due to chikungunya virus infection based on
laboratory confirmation. ProMED requests information about the cause
of death in those cases where mortality has been attributed to
infection with chikungunya virus.
