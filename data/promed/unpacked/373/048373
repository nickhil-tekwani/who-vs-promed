[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 28 cases with 2 new deaths, compared with 51cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (23 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 75 consecutive days. Today's (24 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: by Region, positive cases only: Seoul (9), Gyeonggi (9), Daejeon (4), airport quarantine (4), Chungcheongnam-do (1) and Incheon (1). Total newly confirmed cases (28). Unfortunately the breakdown of cases by type of transmission (imported vs locally transmitted was not available at the time of preparation of this update.

According to data from the 'ncov' website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative positive testing rate has been 1.1% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 239 410 cases, including 34 644 deaths, up by +190 cases and death numbers readjusted by -31 in the past 24 hours. Our calculation has an increase of +577 newly confirmed cases -- the website mentions Trento recalculation of cases (The Autonomous Province has made a recalculation on the deceased and the recovered). The previous day's (22 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +122 cases and 18 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 88 newly confirmed cases, up from 62 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4929_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4929_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (88). Also, 11 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), with only 3 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna 44 cases, Piedemonte 22 cases and Campagnia 11 cases). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 50 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 34 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 212 501 total cases, 9996 deaths
Date: Thu 25 Jun 2020 2:45:34 PM IRDT
Source: Radio Farda [edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/coronavirus-infection-rate-is-40-percent-in-two-provinces-in-iran/30688929.html


Iran's Deputy Minister of Health announced [Wed 24 Jun 2020] that "40% of residents in the provinces of Qom and Gilan have contracted the coronavirus, while the number in Tehran is about 15%.

At the same time, the spokeswoman of the health ministry, Sima Sadat Lari, announced that 9996 have so far died of COVID-19. She also announced the official number of people infected by the deadly virus has reached 212 501.

However, Iran's official COVID-19 figures have been repeatedly questioned by some members of parliament and other officials. They have asserted that the real coronavirus-related death toll in Iran is much higher than what the health ministry releases as official figures.

If 15% of people in Tehran are infected, that alone means more than a million cases. The health ministry officials did not explain the contradiction between the official numbers and their warning about such a high rate for the pandemic. Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Health have refused to provide separate statistics on the COVID-19 victims for different provinces since they started to report to the public. Soon, the provincial authorities were also banned from reporting their local numbers.

On the same day [Wed 24 Jun 2020], Iran's Deputy Minister of Health, Alireza Raeesi, announced that in some provinces, such as Qom and Gilan, "about 40%" of people, and in Tehran, nearly "15%" of the residents were infected with the coronavirus. Raeesi told at a video conference at the Ministry of Health that the extent of the pandemic in other provinces was between 4 to 5%.

At the same time, Raeesi denied the start of the 2nd wave of coronavirus in Iran, arguing that the country had not reached the "downward trend" of the 1st stage to experience the 2nd wave.

Iran's Deputy Health Minister also stressed that the government, under U.S. sanctions, could not extend the lockdown while people are economically suffering. "The United States has allocated USD 114 billion and Britain USD 22 billion to fight coronavirus," Raeesi lamented, adding that, for the same purpose, the government was promised to receive one billion EUR (approximately USD1.1 billion) from the country's National Development Fund. Nonetheless, he disclosed, "We should be realistic; 5 months after the coronavirus outbreak, the government has only received 30% of the promised money."
Moreover, Raeesi called on the people to respect health and hygiene regulations and announced that using face masks in public places will become compulsory in the coming days.

[As of 24 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 212 410, including 9996 deaths, an increase of 2440 cases and 133 deaths since 23 Jun 2020. No mention was made over the number of provinces currently considered as "red zone".

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a recrudescence (a challenge as to whether to call this a continuance of the 1st wave with transmission never having been interrupted, or to acknowledge there while had been relative control of the outbreak that was lost due to restrictions being lifted too early). As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 462 554, including 124 281 deaths, an increase from 2 424 168 cases and 123 473 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 210 185 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 24 Jun 2020, including 17 685 confirmed deaths and an additional 4680 probable deaths, representing an increase of 292 newly confirmed cases and 28 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Louisiana. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of today the percent positive testing results nationally is 10%, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.
