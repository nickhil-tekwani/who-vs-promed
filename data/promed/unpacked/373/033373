More than 200 head of cattle from the breeding farms in Shanhua, Tainan
County, were ordered to be slaughtered Saturday after it was confirmed
members of the herd had been infected with food-and-mouth disease (FMD)
[virus.
Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA), said that the
virus found in the 2 ranches in Shanhua, Tainan County, was the same strain
of FMD [virus found in cattle in Kinmen County last week. Peng said the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and quarantine under the COA
has instructed the Tainan County Government to wipe out the cattle herds of
[the two farms after FMD antibodies were found in saliva and blood samples
of the livestock.
The confirmation of FMD in the cattle in Shanhua proved true health
officials' fears that the O-strain that had affected bulls in Kinmen would
make its way across the strait, said Peng.
Not leaving anything to chance, Peng said his council has ordered the
extermination of all cattle suspected of [having been infected. A campaign
to immunize all cattle at ranches within a 6-kilometer radius of the 2
cattle farms whose livestock are infected with FMD [virus will be carried
out soon, COA officials said.

Taiwan's top agriculture official on Sunday called on mainland Chinese
authorities to join efforts by officials here [in Taiwan to curb the spread
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the
cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA), urged mainland China to fulfill
its responsibility as a member of the international animal quarantine body,
the International Office of Epizootics, to help arrest FMD on its side of
the Taiwan Strait as the disease has now made its way onto Taiwan.
Peng hoped that mainland Chinese authorities will face the reality that the
FMD epidemic has spread across the mainland, and will send virus samples to
the FMD Laboratory in Britain for a thorough examination so as to allow
other countries to be informed of the infection and contribute to
eradicating it.
Quarantine officials on Sunday slaughtered 194 head of cattle on 4 ranches
in southern Taiwan in an emergency measure to check a possible FMD outbreak
among the country's cattle population. FMD last affected Taiwancattle in
1929.
An across-the-board quarantine began on the 4 ranches Sunday after the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine confirmed
Saturday that the virus found on the ranches in Shanhua, Tainan County, was
the same strain of FMD found in cattle on Kinmen island last week.
Tainan County is Taiwan's largest cattle-raising region, with the cattle
population totalling 28 000, about one-fifth of all cattle on Taiwan.
Swine FMD ravaged Taiwan's hog population in 1997, crippling the country's
hog farming industry, the staple source of meat in Taiwan and a major
foreign exchange earner. The outbreak resulted in the slaughter of more than
4 million pigs.
