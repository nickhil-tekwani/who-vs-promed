KARNAL BUNT AND WEATHER
***********************

Karnal bunt - USA (California), Part 2 970715174239]

I have some comments in reference to Gerald Holmes' posting about Karnal Bunt
and weather conditions. There are some common misconceptions regarding
relative humidity. Relative humidity is dependent upon temperature and is
relative to saturation over a plane surface of pure water. It is not an
absolute measurement of the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Because
the fungus likely requires some minimum absolute amount of moisture, I would
suggest using the mixing ratio (grams of water vapor per kilogram of dry
air). Let's look at some of the temperatures and relative humidities quoted
by the author.
At 20 C and a relative humidity (RH) of 80 percent, there are 11.9 g of water
vapor per kg of dry air. At 24 C and a RH of 70 percent, there are 13.3 g of
water vapor per kg of dry air. Therefore, you can have a lower RH and a
larger amount of water vapor present.
The article states that 'During this period, temperatures were in the upper
70s to low 80s (higher than Singh's maximum range) and maximum relative
humidity was between 65 and 75% (lower than Singh's reported humidity
requirements).' However, assuming a temperature of 80 F and a RH of 65
percent, the mixing ratio is 14.6 g water vapor per kg of dry air. There
would certainly be sufficient moisture available to the organism even with
the lower relative humidity. Of course, the temperatures alone may have been
sufficiently high to restrict the organism's development.
Having a minimum relative humidity associated with KB is not nearly as useful
as having a minimum mixing ratio (or some other absolute measure). It is
somewhat like saying that one requires a minimum of a half a glass of water
without considering the different sizes of glasses.
The author is therefore correct in his statements about the spread of KB in
the Imperial Valley being limited by prolonged high temperatures. However,
based on the data presented by the author, there appeared to have been
sufficient atmospheric moisture available. The important point is that care
should be taken when describing atmospheric moisture requirements.
I hope this is helpful.
