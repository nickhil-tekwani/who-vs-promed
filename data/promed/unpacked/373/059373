New pathway discovered for the transmission of _Xylella fastidiosa_
_Xylella fastidiosa_ [Xf], a bacterium thought to be spread only by insect
vectors such as glassy-winged sharpshooters or contaminated budwood, is now
known to infect and colonize orange fruit tissues and seeds and to be
transmissible from seeds to seedlings. This is the first report of Xf
transmission through seeds. Various strains of _Xylella_ cause diseases in
economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis in
Brazilian oranges, coffee leaf scorch in South America, and Pierce's
disease of grapevines in North and Central America.

[In addition to insect vectors and contaminated budwood, Xf, which causes
citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), can be spread through root grafts
between healthy and Xf-infected roots. The disease is known as "pecosita"
in Argentina, and "amarelino de citros" or "amarelinho de citros" in
Brazil. Affected sweet orange trees are debilitated, their fruits are
smaller and lacking in juice, and they have no market value. Xf, which is a
xylem-limited bacterium, was detected by PCR in peduncles, in axial,
dorsal, and marginal bundles, and septa of diseased fruits. Seed
transmission of Xf is about 25 percent, efficient enough to perpetuate the
disease. Of considerable interest is that the bacterium that causes coffee
leaf scorch ("requiema do cafe") in Brazil is closely related to Xf, and
that citrus strains of that bacterium can induce coffee leaf scorch
disease. The possibility that Xf is seed-transmitted in coffee must be
investigated.
This study is an excellent example of how a long-standing perception of a
biological process can be overturned. Xf was found in peduncles in 1990
when it was first associated with the disease but the significance of its
involvement in pathogenesis went unappreciated. The use of PCR opened the
way for investigations that led to proof of seed transmission in citrus seeds.
