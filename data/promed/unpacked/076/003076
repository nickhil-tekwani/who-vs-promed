Nearly a dozen monkeys fell from the trees yesterday [13 Apr 2000] near the
German School in Bukit Tinggi Road, not far from the site of the old Turf
Club. Six later died, apparently from suspected poisoning, and 5 others are
barely alive. At around 8 am, a distraught resident in the area found the
first monkey breathing with difficulty and lying sprawled in the school
grounds and called the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).
SPCA executive officer Deirdre Moss said: "This situation is quite
abnormal. We have had monkeys of all ages and both genders affected
equally." The SPCA had to make three trips in all to pick up dead or dying
monkeys. Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) officials also went to
the school.
By 4 p.m., SPCA workers had caught 4 monkeys. One of the animals could
hardly sit up. It lay listlessly in a cage with its small pink tongue
sticking out. Another in the cage charged frantically from side to side.
Most of the animals looked drowsy and their eyes were glazed. They were
extremely dehydrated, said an animal expert at the scene, who said these
were symptoms of poisoning. All but 1 of the 7 taken to the SPCA for
treatment died within an hour of being caught. But monkeys in the forested
area near the school seemed unaffected.
AVA's head of public affairs, Mr Goh Shih Yong, said in a statement: "The
AVA has been working closely with the Zoo to trap the monkeys. So far, 40
monkeys have been trapped from that area." He said AVA's center for animal
welfare and control had earlier received 7 complaints about monkeys in the
area.
Last year, in Peirce Reservoir, 5 monkeys died in the same fashion, the
SPCA said. It is not known what killed them. [I wonder what kind of
toxicology testing was done last year to try and establish the toxin? -
Mod. TG] AVA will conduct post-mortem exams on 4 of the monkeys.
