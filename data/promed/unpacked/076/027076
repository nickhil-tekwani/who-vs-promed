SCHISTOSOMIASIS VACCINE
=======================
Date: Wed, 28 May 1997

It was announced on 27 May in Cairo that the W.H.O. has selected two U.S.
vaccines targeted at schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, for testing. The first
step will be research to test for toxicity, potential secondary effects and
carcinogenicity. This research will be done at the US National Institutes
of Health and at C.D.C., with specialists from Egypt participating. If the
vaccines pass the safety tests, they will then be used in trials of
volunteers in Egypt. Almost 10 percent of the Egyptian population is
infected by bilharzia -- blood flukes that can seriously injure the liver,
kidneys, bladder, lungs and central nervous system.
A spokesman for the Egyptian bilzarzia research program said that it will
take five years to determine if the vaccines are safe and effective.
The tests were chosen by a W.H.O. panel from 10 vaccines -- four from Egypt,
four from the U.S. and one from France.
