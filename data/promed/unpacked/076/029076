The moderators' remarks in the posting 20041125.3156 "Rabies, hamster -
Russia (Voronej): suspected," have prompted the following responses,
including supplementary information on natural rabies in rodents.

On 24 Oct 1997, one of 2 domestic rabbits kept together within a petting
zoo in northern Israel was found dead with severe bite wounds. A small hole
was found in the fence, large enough for a mongoose or fox to enter. 3
weeks later, the 2nd rabbit died, after exhibiting signs of central nervous
system damage. Laboratory investigation confirmed rabies, presumably
contracted when bitten by the same unidentified rabid intruder. The rabies
virus molecular characterization revealed the same antigenic pattern
demonstrated in wild carnivores within the surrounding area. [as published
by D David and others; for details, see commentary further. - Mod.AS].

I recall that, when working at a veterinary clinic in the early 1990s in
Blantyre, Malawi, a local gentleman presented himself, claiming to have
been awoken at night by a mouse biting his ear. He believed the mouse was
behaving very strangely and was concerned about rabies. Although I assured
him the rabies risk was negligible, he was adamant, and I was persuaded to
submit the mouse for examination for negri bodies. To my surprise, the
local lab (which I had full confidence in for this examination) reported a
positive result, and I duly authorized post-exposure rabies treatment.

[The CDC website <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/Ques&Ans/q&a.htm>
says the following about rabies in rodents:
"Q: What is the risk of rabies from squirrels, mice, rats, and other rodents?
A: Small rodents (such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs,
gerbils, and chipmunks) and lagomorphs (such as rabbits and hares) are
almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to
cause rabies among humans in the United States. Bites by these animals are
usually not considered a risk of rabies, unless the animal was sick or
behaving in any unusual manner, and rabies is widespread in your area.
However, from 1985 through 1994, woodchucks accounted for 86 percent of the
368 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC. Woodchucks or groundhogs
(_Marmota monax_) are the only rodents that may be frequently submitted to
state health departments because of a suspicion of rabies. In all cases
involving rodents, the state or local health department should be consulted
before a decision is made to initiate post exposure prophylaxis (PEP)."
Refraining from PEP of persons allegedly bitten by rodents might lead to
tragic consequences, as shown, for example, in a 1996 case in which a 20
year old man became ill 5 weeks after being bitten while asleep outdoors in
Northern Israel by an unidentified small animal, which, according to his
description, was a rat or a mouse. Since injuries by these rodents do not
require antirabies treatment, no antirabies PEP was given. The patient
subsequently died of rabies (Gdalevich, et al. Rabies in Israel: decades of
prevention and a human case. Public Health 2000; 114: 484-7). Later, it was
concluded, on the basis of homologic results of nucleotide sequences from
the patient and from animals in the same region, that a reservoir for
rabies in foxes was responsible for infection (D David, et al. Molecular
epidemiology of rabies virus isolates from Israel and Other Middle- and
Near-Eastern countries; J Clin Microbiol 2000; 38: 755-62). It was assumed
that the fatal bite was carried out by a small nocturnal carnivore which
might have been mistaken by the patient for a rat or a mouse, such as a
stone-marten (_Martes foina syriaca_), or even a small cat.
Rabies in palm rats (_Rattus palmarum_), reported from Sri Lanka and India,
is referred to in posting 19980113.0093. - Mod.AS].
