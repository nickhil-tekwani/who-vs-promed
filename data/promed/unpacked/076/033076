Belgian authorities have detected the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa in ornamental olive trees introduced into Belgium by a company from West Flanders. According to the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (Fasfc), it was a batch which came from Spain that had symptoms of this bacterium. Part of the infected lot had already been sold to garden centers. All the contaminated plants and all the olive trees in the company were destroyed. Investigations are continuing to determine whether the pathogen has spread.

The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) have stated that "in the nurseries of origin no positive cases have been found", that "no suspicious case" has been detected and that research work continues. A Special Surveillance Plan has been launched by MAPA in order to monitor and trace all plant species susceptible to the bacteria.

The Spanish Federation of Associations of Export Producers of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants (Fepex) will ask MAPA to confirm that the nurseries are officially ruled out as the origin of the outbreak in Belgium. Fepex has stressed its support of the Ministry in the actions that are being implemented.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. Several subspecies of Xf have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops. Initially, all strains of _Xylella_ had been classified into a single species, but a second species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, has recently been reported as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see link below).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497). That outbreak was thought likely to represent the first appearance of Xf in the European region due to contaminated imports of plant material.

However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals acting as reservoir host, subsequently suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time, in order to be able to affect a multitude of local hosts. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production and the pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

For Spain, the Balearic Islands were the site for the 1st reports of Xf in the country, on cherry (ProMED-mail post 20161125.4653479). However, earlier reports of 'wood decay fungus' killing almond trees on the mainland (ProMED-mail posts 20091022.3630 & 20110907.2728) are now likely to have been misdiagnosed outbreaks of Xf. Unfortunately, lack of diligence in "diagnosing" an unknown plant disease has prevented early eradication responses and thus has resulted in disastrous crop losses in Spain.
