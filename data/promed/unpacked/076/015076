UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, FISH - NAMIBIA (ZAMBEZI RIVER)

[Last Friday, 29 Dec 2006, we posted a newswire from Namibia, describing
disease and mortality in fish in the backwaters of the Zambezi river. We
had doubts about the alleged etiology of the syndrome as included in the
said newswire, which attributed the responsibility for the observed
symptoms in fish to coliforms, _E. coli_ and salmonellae. We subsequently
invited fish pathologists to evaluate the available information, take a
look at the 2 published photographs of affected fish and suggest possible
etiologies of the described syndrome. ProMED-mail is grateful to Brad
Chadwick, a Veterinary Pathologist (Fish Diseases) from Hong Kong, for
kindly accepting the challenge and sending us the following educational
commentary. - Mod.AS]

The undiagnosed fish kill reported from the Zambezi River has all the
features of organic "pollution" as the primary cause, which is the most
common cause of fish kills in freshwater systems, particularly if multiple
species are involved. The "pollution" does not have to be man-made; algal
blooms that are natural or semi-natural often cause similar problems. In
this case the high coliform counts implies possible sewage-derived
pollution, but whatever the source the high bacterial count is diagnostic
for high levels of organic pollution.
The most important effects of organic pollution are low oxygen tension in
the water and high carbon dioxide levels, which is a primary disease
"aetiology" in itself with respect to fish. A second important effect is
high levels of organic metabolites, particularly ammonia and nitrite. Such
poor water quality causes stressed fish, which rapidly become
immune-compromised fish, which are then very susceptible to secondary
diseases, such as bacterial skin disease and red anuses (as per the photos
in the original posting), proliferation of gill and skin parasites up to
very high loadings, and eventually bacterial septicaemias involving common
intestinal bacteria such as _Vibrios_, _Aeromonas sp_, _Plesiomonas sp_
etc. The process can snowball very quickly if the water is very fouled,
with high mortalities and virtually 100 percent morbidity.
The deep skin ulcers described are suggestive of one additional damaging
effect of organic pollution, which involves the carrion-feeding microbes in
the organic sediment on the river bed. There are a lot of nasty things that
live in the decaying organic matter and the anaerobic sediment when organic
pollution is a chronic problem, and they are highly pathogenic to live fish
if the sediment is stirred up. Microbes include Flexibacter-like
filamentous bacteria, and ciliated protozoa such as _Uronema sp_ (or the
freshwater equivalent). They cause damage by direct predation on exposed
skin and can cause large lesions. The ciliates can often be found in skin
scrapes and wet mounts of the gills. If the temperature is too high or too
low the Flexibacter-like bacteria can also cause a syndrome of severe gill
rot that can spread rapidly to in-contact fish.
Additional data that might support this diagnosis include:
-Oxygen level: should be 5-10 mg/L but is probably less than 2 mg/L if
organic pollution is the problem.
-Carbon dioxide: should be less than 10 mg/L, but is probably now 15-20 mg/L.
-Total Ammonia: should be less than 0.1 mg/L in waters with "normal" levels
of organic pollution. Foul water might have 0.5 mg/L or even much higher.
-Total nitrite: should be less than 0.1 mg/L. Foul water might have 0.3
mg/L or more. Nitrite is very toxic.
-Bacterial cultures from kidneys/spleens of sick fish: should be sterile,
but sick fish dying of secondary septicaemia will have moderate to heavy
growth of common bacteria, usually more than one species. (Only sick fish
can be tested by bacterial culture of internal organs..........dead fish
are always positive for Vibrios).
-Wet mounts of gills & skin scrapings: normally show a few parasites (gill
flukes, ciliates) in healthy fish. High loadings indicate that parasitism
is a major factor in the mortalities. (Also only useful on sick fish.......
dead fish lose the parasites quite quickly).
With respect to human disease, people that consume sick and septicaemic
fish will suffer similar consequences to food spoilage; it is basically a
form of food poisoning. Gastrointestinal upsets, with or without
diarrhoea, would be expected from the high exposure to Vibrios. Botulism
is unlikely unless the fish consumed are actually dead and rotten. The
worms described are probably an incidental finding; many wild fish have
_Anisakid_ nematodes free in the abdominal cavity, and there are many
free-living nematodes that will invade necrotic tissue but not otherwise
harm the fish, or people consuming the fish.
