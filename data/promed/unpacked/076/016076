Foxes are helping to spread a potentially fatal parasite that is threatening Britain's dog population, researchers have warned. Up to 50 percent of foxes are infected with lungworm, whose larvae can be found in the bodies and slime of slugs and snails. Once swallowed by a dog, the parasite travels through its body to end up in the heart causing sickness and possibly death.

A study by University of Bristol scientists found that lungworm was now present in more than one in 10 foxes (18.3 percent) in the UK.

The worm's prevalence was significantly higher than it was in 2008, when an earlier study showed 7.3 percent of foxes to be infected [see comment].

In southeast England, half of all foxes were now believed to be carrying lungworm -- a doubling of the infection rate in that region. Although no foxes in the north of England and Scotland were infected in 2008, an estimated 7.4 percent were today.

Further research has confirmed that lungworm can be transmitted to dogs that lick the slime trails left by slugs, not only by accidentally swallowing slugs and snails. The parasite's larvae are excreted in dog faeces.

A "Be Lungworm Aware" campaign has now been launched by urging dog owners to speak to their vet about the risk of lungworm in their area. Mark Bossley, chief vet at animal charity Blue Cross, said: "We regularly advise dog owners of the dangers of lungworm because, sadly, we see so many cases every year. It is a hidden killer so we urge dog owners to talk to their vet about preventative treatments and be vigilant with their dogs when in the garden or on walks."

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe, Africa, South America, and Canada. It is widely assumed that foxes act as a reservoir of infection for dogs.

Although clinical signs in association with _A. vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies, and neurological dysfunction. The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor.

For additional information please see ProMED-mail posting 20130716.1827306.

Ref 1 included the following concluding remarks:
"_A. vasorum_ is an emerging parasite of dogs, as it spreads from known endemic foci. Clinician awareness is an important defence against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, and current tests for parasitological diagnosis suffer from poor sensitivity, signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant. There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_, and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has excellent prognosis for full recovery. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease. While increasing numbers of dogs will be at risk of infection as the geographical range of the parasite expands, better epidemiological understanding and increasing options for diagnosis and treatment have the potential to improve prospects for disease prevention and management in the longer term."

Ref 2 (2015) addresses the fox-related issue in the UK; the summary follows:
"The nematode _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ is becoming more widely recorded globally, and is of increasing concern as a cause of disease in dogs. Apparent geographic spread is difficult to confirm due to a lack of standardized disease recording systems, increasing awareness among veterinary clinicians, and recent improvements in diagnostic technologies. This study examines the hypothesis that _A. vasorum_ has spread in recent years by repeating the methods of a previous survey of the fox population. The hearts and lungs of 442 foxes from across Great Britain were collected and examined by dissection, flushing of the pulmonary circulation, and microscopic inspection of tracheal scrapes. Sampling and parasite extraction methods were identical to an earlier survey in 2005 to ensure comparability. Prevalence of _A. vasorum_ was 18.3 percent (exact binomial confidence bounds 14.9-22.3), compared with 7.3 percent previously (5.3-9.9, n = 546), and had increased significantly in most regions, for example, 7.4 percent in the Northern UK (previously zero) and 50.8 percent in the southeast (previously 23.2 percent). Other nematodes identified were _Crenosoma vulpis_ (prevalence 10.8 percent, CI [confidence interval] 8.1-14.2) and _Eucoleus aerophilus_ (31.6 percent, CI 27.3-36.2). These data support the proposal that _A. vasorum_ has increased in prevalence and has spread geographically in Great Britain."

Earlier, "The Telegraph" reported that the fox population of London exceeded 10 000; fox hunting was banned as a sport in 2004, but in 2013 the Mayor of London Boris Johnson called for a crackdown on the pests after a spate of attacks.
