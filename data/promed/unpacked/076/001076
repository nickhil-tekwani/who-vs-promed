Wisconsin agriculture officials are investigating a rare outbreak of bovine tuberculosis on a Waunakee farm. [Waunakee is a village in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. - Mod.ML] Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection officials announced on [Tue 30 Oct 2018] tests showing 3 cows from Maier Farms LLC have tested positive for the disease.

Agriculture officials say the strain of bovine TB in the cows matches a strain found in a Maier Farms worker in 2015, indicating the worker may have infected the herd. Animals often don't show signs of infection until the disease reaches an advanced stage, which can take years.

DATCP officials are tracing all animals having moved off (trace outs) the farm over the last 5 years.

Federal agriculture officials typically record about 8 cases nationwide annually. The last instance of bovine TB in Wisconsin was in the mid-1990s.

A Dane County dairy herd has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP). This is the 1st reported case of bovine TB in Wisconsin since 1980.

Meat inspectors identified a carcass during a routine slaughter inspection and sent a sample to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory for testing. Through animal identification records, the carcass was traced back to a herd in Dane County that DATCP immediately quarantined. A quarantine prevents any animals from moving on or off of the farm.

"We are working closely with the herd owner, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health Services, area veterinarians, industry partners and other herd owners. We are taking aggressive measures to control and prevent the spread of this disease," said Dr. Darlene Konkle, DATCP's acting State Veterinarian. "Our staff and partners train for these types of responses and are taking the necessary steps to protect animal and human health."

Pasteurized milk continues to be safe to consume. The pasteurization process, which destroys disease-causing organisms in milk by rapidly heating and then cooling the milk, eliminates the disease from milk and milk products.

Bovine TB is most commonly spread to humans through consuming unpasteurized milk or milk products from infected animals, and close contact with infected animals or people. Also, infected people can be a source of infection to animals. More information about human TB is on the Centers for Disease Control website.

Food safety laws prevent meat from infected animals from entering the food chain. State and federal inspectors at slaughter plants evaluate live animals and animal products for signs or symptoms of disease and remove any from entering food production.

Bovine TB is a respiratory disease of cattle that does not spread easily. It is a chronic, slowly progressive disease meaning it can take months to years to worsen, grow, or spread. Infected animals may pass the infection to other animals even if they appear healthy. Animals often do not show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

The U.S. has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to the National Tuberculosis Eradication Program. Wisconsin has been certified as TB-free since 1980. With a thorough investigation and containment of an outbreak Wisconsin will maintain its TB-free status with USDA.

[The investigation into this case will be interesting. The 1st article implies the TB may have come from an individual as the strain in the individual as well the animal was apparently the same.

The 1st article indicates they are tracing all the animals having move out of that herd or trace-outs. However, they will also have to do trace-ins, trace the animals having moved into the herd. While it may test to be the same strain as an individual, at this point in time, one cannot be sure the same strain may not be residing in another herd. Perhaps the individual acquired the strain from unpasteurized milk.

So as can be seen there are unknowns regarding this case and until the trace-ins and trace-outs on the herd is completed, and perhaps testing of individuals on respective dairies, we can only say for sure tuberculosis has been found in a bovine, as well as a worker 3 years earlier.

Earlier this month [October 2018], a dairy in Michigan also had a positive. There may or may not be any link between these incidents.

More information on bovine tuberculosis may be found in the moderator's comments on ProMED-mail posting Bovine tuberculosis - USA (03): (MI) bovine, cervid, alert 20181012.6086231. - Mod.TG]

[The 1st news report above says that the strain of "bovine TB" isolated from the cows "matches" the strain isolated from a worker at that farm in 2015. However, we are not told if the match was on a phenotypic (i.e., the same species of _Mycobacterium_) or a genetic basis. Presumably the strain is _Mycbacterium bovis_, but if the worker was the source for the infection in the cows, the species could be _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.
