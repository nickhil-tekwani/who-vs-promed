Turkey: 1st Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in 2002/2004
--------------------------------------------------
Turkish researchers have reported that: In 2002 and 2003, a total of
19 persons in Turkey were suspected cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) or a similar viral infection. 6 serum
samples were tested; all were found positive for immunoglobulin M
antibodies against CCHF virus. 2 of the samples yielded CCHF virus
isolates. Genetic analysis of the virus isolates showed them to be
closely related to isolates from former Yugoslavia and southwestern
Russia.
These researchers state that these cases are the 1st cases of CCHF
reported from Turkey. 18 of the 19 patients handled livestock, and
[the other] was a nurse with probable nosocomial infection. The
case-fatality rate was 20 percent among confirmed CCHF case-patients
(1 of 5 patients), and the overall case-patient fatality rate was 11
percent (2 of 19 patients). S.S. Karti and colleagues, the authors of
the report, concluded that: In addition to previously reported
symptoms and signs, we observed hemophagocytosis in 50 percent of our
patients, which is the 1st report of this clinical phenomenon
associated with CCHF.
Karti and colleagues published their study in Emerging Infectious
Diseases (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Turkey. Emerg. Infect.
Dis., 2004;10(8):1379-1384). For additional information, contact S.S.
Karti, Karadeniz Tech University, School of Medicine, Department
