While most dog owners are well aware of the rising cases of Alabama Rot, a Midlands vet has urged people to be aware of another canine condition on the rise. Dog owners need to know the signs of lungworm - as it can prove fatal if not treated.

The parasite has been on the rise across in Staffordshire, where cases were previously rare. According to the website Act Against Lungworm there have now been 11 registered cases in the ST postcode area.

Will Jeffels, clinical director at Shires Vets, has asked dog owners to be vigilant in a bid to prevent further infections. He said:

"Prevention is the key and there are some very simple measures that dog owners can take. The main one is to be aware of the threat of slugs, snails and frogs which can all carry the lungworm larvae.

"Dog and fox faeces can also contain the parasite so it's important to try to keep your pet well away from all of these risks. Using the correct preventative treatment on a regular basis is also essential and your vet is the best person to advise you on the most appropriate one for your pet."

People who keep more than one dog and who believe their animal has contracted the parasite should also consider having their other dogs tested.

The Lungworm _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ is not currently known to be capable of infecting humans according to the Act Against Lungworm website, although both dogs and cats can carry [other] roundworms, which can cause illnesses in humans.

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe, Africa, South America, and Canada. The widely accepted view on red foxes as reservoir of _A. vasorum_ has recently been addressed (Ref 1). Juvenile red foxes were found to be fully susceptible, although severe clinical disease was not observed. Infections in red foxes appear to be chronic and moreover, to resemble infections in dogs. The red fox is thus a suitable model as well as a natural reservoir for the parasite.

Although clinical signs in association with _A. vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies, and neurological dysfunction. The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor.

Clinician awareness is an important defense against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, and current tests for parasitological diagnosis suffer from poor sensitivity, signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant.

There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_, and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has excellent prognosis for full recovery [see ref 2]. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease.
