Outbreak of Acute Respiratory Febrile Illness Among College Students --
Acapulco, Mexico, March 2001
------------------------------------------------------------
On 30 Mar 2001, CDC was notified by Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH)
of an acute respiratory febrile illness in 44 students from 2 colleges who
traveled to Acapulco, Mexico, for spring break vacation during 3 Mar to 18
Mar 2001. Within 7 to 14 days of their return from Acapulco, 21 students
presented to health-care providers with illness characterized by fever,
chills, dry cough, chest pain, and headache. 2 students were hospitalized.
On the basis of clinical symptoms and chest radiographs that revealed
bilateral, nodular patchy infiltrates, acute pulmonary histoplasmosis was
the suspected illness. While in Acapulco, most of the students stayed at
the Calinda Beach Hotel and participated in group activities at other
recreational locations.
All state health departments and selected travel agencies were notified to
identify additional students who traveled to Acapulco during March and
became ill. As of 9 Apr 2001, 37 colleges in 18 states and the District of
Columbia have reported 221 students who returned to the United States from
Acapulco with an acute respiratory febrile illness. 10 students in 6 states
were hospitalized.
A case is defined as an acute respiratory febrile illness characterized by
fever for at least 3 days and one or more of the following symptoms: cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain, or headache in a student who visited
Acapulco during March 2001. Preliminary laboratory test results suggest
histoplasmosis, an infection caused by _Histoplasma capsulatum_, a fungus
that is present in soil in areas where the disease is endemic, and is
acquired through inhalation. Gomori methenamine-silver stain of
transbronchial and thoracic lymph node biopsy specimens from a hospitalized
student revealed the presence of yeasts consistent with _H. capsulatum_. In
addition, of specimens from 27 students in 3 states serologically tested
for histoplasmosis using immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests, 5
were positive (1). However, convalescent-phase serum specimens will be
needed for confirmation. Testing continues for other possible causes (e.g.,
_Mycoplasma_, _Legionella_, and _Chlamydia_).

Epidemiologists, Atlanta, Georgia. American College Health Association,
Baltimore, Maryland. Mycotic Diseases Br, Respiratory Diseases Br, Div of
Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases;
and EIS officers, CDC.
MMWR Editorial Note:
CDC recommends that students who have traveled to Acapulco since 1 Mar 2001
seek medical care if they develop symptoms of fever and/or cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, or headache. Most cases of acute histoplasmosis in
immunocompetent persons will not require treatment; however, persons with
severe histoplasmosis can be treated with 200 mg of itraconazole, an
antifungal medication, once daily for 6 to 12 weeks (2). Physicians should
notify state health departments of acute respiratory febrile illness among
returning college students and other persons.
On 3 Apr 2001, PDH alerted other health departments of the outbreak through
EPI-X (the Epidemic Information Exchange); on 6 Apr 2001, CDC issued a
travelers'advisory at
<http://webdev.cdc.gov/travel/other/res-mexico-apr2001.htm>.
Information on histoplasmosis is available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo>
The Mexico Ministry of Health and CDC are conducting an investigation of
the outbreak. Additional information is available from CDC, telephone (888)
688-2732.
CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch (MDB) is interested in receiving reports
through state and local health departments of travelers to Acapulco since
March who have become ill. MDB will test serum and lung tissue specimens
for histoplasmosis received through state and local health departments.
