Cases of leptospirosis have increased to 659 since the beginning of the year in the Tumbes region. Attention has focused on Corrales district in the last month, where 11 of the cases were health care workers at the district health office, with this institution becoming a focus of the outbreak.

This health care facility will suspend services from 14 Nov 2017, beginning at 6 pm, in order to disinfect all of the rooms. Patients who are admitted to the hospital will be transferred to hospitals in Tumbes. On 15 Nov 2017 there will be no services in the emergency department or consultation rooms with the intent to eliminate the rodent carriers of leptospirosis.

The personnel working in the health center have taken infection control preventive measures. The chief of the Public Defense Office of Tumbes, Abel Chiroque said that the houses of the individuals diagnosed with the disease would also be inspected, since they may have been infected inside their homes.

In addition, it was reported that training of health personnel, municipal employees, community workers, and the general population will continue in order to inform on the situation and preventive measures.

[Maps of Peru can be seen at http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/peru-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5454094,53640. Tumbes is a coastal region in northwestern Peru, located on the border with Ecuador to the south and east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbes_Region). Tumbes Region is divided into 3 provinces (Tumbes, Contralmirante Villar, and Zarumilla) and Tumbes Province has 6 districts (Corrales, Tumbes, La Cruz, Pampas de Hospital, San Jacinto, and San Juan de la Virgen). Corrales, with a population of about 20 000 residents, can be located on a map of Peru at https://goo.gl/maps/gNqWXffxiKT2.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil, fresh water or food contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic leptospira. Leptospira may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Wild rodents such as sewer rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) and house mice (_Mus musculus_) sometimes infest health care facilities and could transmit leptospirosis to hospital staff and patients, which seems to be what is happening in Corrales, Peru (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199803123381110). - Mod.ML]
