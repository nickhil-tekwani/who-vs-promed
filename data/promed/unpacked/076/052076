Literature on the transmission of tuberculosis from humans to cattle
----------------------------------------------------------------
The moderator's comment that "the scenario of wide-spread human
infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_ as the source of infection in
cattle farms is rather doubtful" is very much on-target given the
large number of farms that humans infected with _M. bovis_ would have
had to infect and the relative infrequency of human pulmonary
tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_.
For those who are interested in the literature on the transmission of
"bovine" tuberculosis from humans to cattle, I know of 2 references
and would be interested if anyone knows of additional ones. In one, a
herdsman who had a pulmonary infection with _M. bovis_ was the likely
source of ongoing infections in a cattle herd (1). There has also
been a report in which 3 herds of cattle were slaughtered due to
continued _M. bovis_ infections despite the institution of strict
control measures. In this report, the source of the infections in the
3 herds was the owner of the herds, who had earlier contracted
pulmonary tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ and was then a patient in a
tuberculosis sanatorium prior to infecting the 3 herds (2).
While it is also uncommon, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ has been
transmitted from humans to cattle (3).
