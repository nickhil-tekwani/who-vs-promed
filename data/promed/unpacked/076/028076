Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease Confirmed in Sicilian Woman
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 25-year-old woman has been confirmed as Italy's first victim of the human
form of mad cow disease, according to research published on Fri 27 Sep
2002. The woman, who lives in Sicily, was hospitalized in November 2001
after suffering for 6 months with pain in her back and legs, a progressive
disturbance in her walking, and unpleasant sensations when her skin was
touched, said the report in The Lancet medical journal [see below].
Italian health authorities said in February 2002 that the suspected
diagnosis was the fatal brain-wasting condition variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail]. Experts
believe vCJD comes from eating products from cows infected with mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). vCJD has killed more
than 100 people since emerging in England in the mid-1990s. Most of those
deaths have been in Britain. The ailing woman in Sicily has never traveled
to Britain or any other country with reported cases of mad cow disease. On
Friday, Italy's Health Ministry reported that 73 cows have tested positive
for the disease [BSE].
vCJD can be officially confirmed only by examining the brain after death,
but Italian specialists say new tests make diagnosis before death more
certain. The woman had a brain scan and experts in Britain analyzed a
sample of her tonsils. British scientists recently discovered that traces
of the infecting protein can be found in patients' tonsils. "Tests have
confirmed the diagnosis. As neurologists, we are certain," said her doctor,
Vincenzo La Bella of the University of Palermo, Sicily, who reported the
diagnosis. "In this case, the MRI (scan) and the analysis of the tonsil
biopsy sample
were sufficient to make a diagnosis."
Italy detected its first case of mad cow disease [BSE] last year after the
European Union ordered mandatory tests on cattle older than 30 months
destined for slaughter.

[The Lancet Research Letter by Vincenzo La Bella, John Collinge, Maurizio
Pocchiari and Federico Piccoli (Lancet 2002; 360: 997-98) has the following
summary:
As of May, 2002, 128 cases of vCJD disease have been identified in the UK,
France, and Ireland. We report the first case of vCJD in Italy. The patient
was a young Italian woman who had never travelled to a country with BSE.
She was diagnosed by cerebral MRI and western blot analysis of tonsil
biopsy samples. The results of these analyses suggest that vCJD in
continental Europe and the UK share genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging
features, with similar western blot patterns. The identification of vCJD in
Italy could have important implications for public-health policy decisions
and clinical surveillance in Italy and other continental European countries
where BSE has been identified. The neurological and psychiatric features of
this Italian patient are clinically consistent with the cases identified in
UK and fulfill diagnostic criteria for probable vCJD used by the National
CJD Surveillance Unit. A diagnosis of definite vCJD [normally] requires
neuropathological confirmation. However, in this case, the MRI and the
analysis of the tonsil biopsy sample were sufficient to make a diagnosis,
avoiding the need for a more invasive procedure (i.e., brain biopsy). This
woman is the first case of vCJD in Italy, a country where, as of May 2002,
only 64 indigenous and 2 British-imported cases of BSE have been
identified. Thus, continuous support for surveillance programmes of TSEs in
human beings and animals is needed in Italy. - Mod.CP]
