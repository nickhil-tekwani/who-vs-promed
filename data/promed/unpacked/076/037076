In the 1st week of August 2014, 160 suspected measles cases were reported nationwide. 50 per cent were reported from the Amhara and Oromia regions. In 2014, the Government and its partners responded to 202 measles outbreaks across 189 woredas [an administrative sub-division, see below]. The majority were in Amhara (61 outbreaks), Oromia (75 outbreaks) and SNNP (31 outbreaks) regions. 69 per cent of the confirmed cases were children under 15 years old.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ota for extracting this information on our behalf. It would be useful to be able to relate this information to the current extent of measles vaccination throughout Ethiopia.

The Administrative Divisions of Ethiopia comprise 9 regions and 2 city-regions (Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa). Regions are divided into zones (this level has been abolished in most regions), Woredas (districts, and city areas) and Kebeles (municipalities, suburbs). Districts or Woredas are the 3rd-level administrative divisions of Ethiopia. They are composed of a number of wards (kebele) or neighborhood associations, which are the smallest unit of local government in Ethiopia.

Measles has killed at least 44 people, mostly children, in [2014], according to reports from the Department of Health (DOH). In Central Luzon, 35 people died from measles as the number of suspected cases in the region rose sharply to 5445 in the 1st 6 months of the year. The January-June 2014 cases were 3681.2 percent higher than the 143 cases for the same period last year [2013], the DOH said. In 2013, most of the Central Luzon victims were children ages 5 and below, many of them unvaccinated.

In Central Mindanao, 9 patients died from the disease in the same period, said the DOH regional director. The good news, according to a report by the regional epidemiologist, was that out of the 1575 suspected cases monitored in the provinces of Sarangani, South Cotabato, North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat and the cities of General Santos, Koronadal, Tacurong and Kidapawan, only 73 were confirmed cases. The DOH said the number of measles cases in Central Luzon increased from 13 to 1237 in Zambales province; 16 to 1190 in Bulacan province; 61 to 855 in Tarlac province; 15 to 821 in Pampanga province; 29 to 686 in Nueva Ecija province; and 9 to 598 in Bataan province. Aurora province registered 58 cases from zero last year [2013].

The Central Luzon cases confirmed by laboratory tests reached 902. Bulacan has the highest number of confirmed cases at 282. The DOH said the mass immunization in 2011 significantly reduced measles and rubella transmission, but there had been some significant outbreaks of measles cases in 2013 nationwide, prompting the agency to conduct a national measles, rubella and oral polio vaccine mass immunization (MROPVMI) program in September [2013]. "Notably, there is a high gap between the coverage with MCV1 (measles vaccine at 9 months) and MCV2 (measles and rubella vaccine at 12 to 15 months)," the DOH reported.

Vaccination programs against measles target 11 million children. In the 7 Central Luzon provinces, the DOH intends to vaccinate more than a million children, according to the DOH Central Luzon medical coordinator. According to the coordinator, many people in Central Mindanao who were afflicted with measles had no history of immunization. In July 2014, a measles outbreak downed 198 people in Sarangani, which prompted health authorities to launch house visits in at least 9 villages of Alabel town. The Alabel town health officer said 2 children had died of the disease since it was 1st detected there in April 2014. This year's [2014] measles rate in the town alarmed health authorities because in 2013, only one case was recorded there.

The DOH in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) also said 12 children died in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi between January and May this year [2014] due to measles.

According to the preceding report [2], the number of [measles] cases is now standing at 77 590 (40 169 suspected and 37 421 confirmed).

The number of measles cases in the Philippines continues to skyrocket, increasing by some 30 000 suspected and confirmed cases since June 2014. The latest numbers released on 4 Aug 2014 by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that the archipelago now stands at 77 590 cases (40 169 suspected and 37 421 confirmed). Numbers released by the WHO in June 2014 showed the Philippines at approximately 47 000 cases.

The large, ongoing outbreak in the Philippines has had an impact on the measles situation in the United States this year [2014]. This year, the United States is experiencing a record number of measles cases. From 1 Jan to 8 Aug 2014, there have been 593 confirmed measles cases reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says many of the cases in the U.S. in 2014 have been associated with cases brought in from the Philippines.

CDC recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

Parents are being urged to get their children vaccinated following an outbreak of measles at a nursery school in Port Talbot. Two children who go to the "Miles of Smiles" nursery in Baglan have been confirmed as having the virus, while 5 others are being tested. A vaccination session is planned at the nursery on Friday [15 Aug 2014] for children who have not had the MMR. Public Health Wales (PHW) said vaccination uptake at the nursery was good but some children were at risk because they were too young to have received one or both doses of the vaccine.

Last July [2014] saw the end of Wales' biggest outbreak of the infection in Swansea, which resulted in 1200 reported cases and one death. Dr Jorg Hoffmann of PHW said: "While 2 cases of measles may not sound a lot, we have 5 other children with symptoms, all attending a nursery school where there are children who are too young to be fully-vaccinated and could easily catch and spread measles." He said parents in the wider Neath area should also get their children vaccinated.

Measles has continued to spread after 3 travellers brought the disease into Tasmania in the past month. The Population Health Services' senior medical adviser said there had been 6 confirmed cases and 2 suspected cases of measles in Tasmania since the start of July [2014]. They are the 1st cases of measles in the state since 2009. The medical adviser said 3 of the infections were caught overseas or interstate, and the remaining 5 were caught in Tasmania through close contact with the known cases.

"Further cases of measles arising from the last of these recent cases remain possible for a few more days,'' according to the adviser. ''Information has been provided to people who may have had contact with recent cases so they can remain alert to measles symptoms."

Dr Veitch said the measles vaccine was recommended for children at the age of 12 months, with a 2nd dose at 18 months. He said anyone younger than 49 who was not sure they had received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine should discuss getting a booster from their GP.

Northland DHB has confirmed 6 further cases of measles in Northland. The unimmunised children affected reside in the Hokianga and had been in contact with the 1st case reported on 29 Jul 2014.

The Northland Medical officer of health strongly advises Northlanders to ensure their families are protected from measles. "The vast majority of the at-risk children and adults who were in contact with the 1st case stayed in isolation until the risk of infection was over. However, the non-immunised family members of the case have measles."

"The latest case had been asked to stay in isolation but has become infected. Unfortunately, the child attended an early childhood centre for some days last week. Children do not usually receive MMR (measles vaccine) until 15 months of age, so we are particularly concerned for the younger infants who have been in contact with this case, who are also the most vulnerable to complications such as pneumonia if they get measles."

The Northland Medical Officer of Health director said that while one in 10 on average requires hospitalisation, admission rates in the Hamilton outbreak have been higher. "Unfortunately there has been very low measles immunisation coverage in much of Northland until the last few years. This means that many children and young adults are susceptible to measles. Please double-check that your child is not at risk. There is a window of opportunity now, while cases are limited to one part of Northland, to catch up on any missed vaccinations.

Measles has arrived in Northland with health officials worried about a much wider spread of the potentially dangerous disease because of the region's historically low immunisation rate. A measles outbreak has hit Waikato, Hawke's Bay and Auckland, but Northland was clear of the disease until an unimmunised Northland child was diagnosed with measles on 29 Jul 2014 after contact with children from the Waikato. Five new cases have been diagnosed; all involved children who had not been immunised and had been in contact with the 1st case. Another ill child has been tested.

Northland District Health Board medical officer of health Clair Mills said she was worried that more cases would eventuate, given Northland's traditionally low immunisation rate. Dr Mills said measles is highly infectious, and if children are not immunised, there is a very high chance they will get sick if exposed to someone with measles. "Measles can be a very serious illness, with one in 3 sufferers experiencing complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis or diarrhoea."

Dr Mills says that, while one in 10, on average, requires hospitalisation, admission rates in the Hamilton outbreak have been higher and she urged parents and caregivers not to take their children to places such as day care or school if they show any symptoms of measles. Even children exposed to others with measles need to be isolated for 2 weeks, she said.

"Unfortunately, there has been very low measles immunisation coverage in much of Northland until the last few years. This means that many children and young adults are susceptible to measles," she said. "This is an avoidable disease where there is an effective vaccine. Immunisation protects, not only the individual, but also stops the spread of this disease within our communities and protects our most vulnerable, infants and people who are immune-compromised, such as those on cancer treatment. Please double-check that your child is not at risk. There is a window of opportunity now, while cases are limited to one part of Northland, to catch up on any missed vaccinations."

There has been only one case of measles notified to Waikato District Health Board's Population Health in the last week. The case was a household contact of a laboratory confirmed case and was already in quarantine.

Medical officer of health Dr Anita Bell said Population Health had been notified of 125 confirmed measles cases since the latest outbreak started in June 2014. Almost half of the confirmed cases are household contacts of a confirmed case and were already placed in quarantine before they were unwell. Approximately 80 per cent of cases are aged between 10 to 20 years. Of the others, 15 per cent are aged under 10 years, and 5 per cent over 30 years and are mostly close contacts of confirmed cases in quarantine as they were not vaccinated. Nine cases have been hospitalised but are now well.

Of the 125 cases, the vast majority are unimmunised; only 4 are fully immunised. Approximately 110 cases with a clinical illness and rash like measles have been investigated and were found not to have measles.
