Over the past week 7 people were diagnosed with HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] in Sterlitamak. This is reported by the territorial department of Rospotrebnadzor (Sanitary epidemiological surveillance center).

[Mod.CP commented (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150329.3263902), "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses -- family _Bunyaviridae_ [see http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs/]. HFRS includes diseases such as Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathis epidemica. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala. HFRS occurs found throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and western Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide. Saaremaa is found in central Europe and Scandinavia.

"Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. In addition, individuals who work with live rodents can be exposed to hantaviruses through rodent bites from infected animals. Transmission among humans to another may occur, but that is extremely rare.

"Rodents are the natural reservoir for hantaviruses. Known carriers include the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (_Myoides glareolus_), the reservoir for _Puumala virus_; and the yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_), which carries Dobrava virus.

"Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms, while Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months.

"Supportive therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with hantavirus infections. Care includes careful management of the patient's fluid (hydration) and electrolyte (such as, sodium, potassium, chloride) levels, maintenance of correct oxygen and blood pressure levels, and appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required to correct severe fluid overload. Intravenous ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been shown to decrease illness and death associated with HFRS if used very early in the disease.

"Depending upon which virus is causing the HFRS, death occurs in less than 1 percent to as many as 15 percent of patients. Fatality ranges from 5-15 percent for HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, and it is less than 1 percent for disease caused by Puumala virus. - Mod.CP"

On 10 Feb 2015, Hantavirus expert Jan Clement (in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150211.3159864) commented, in part, "...most HFRS cases, [have] very low fatality rates less than 0.1 per cent for NE, and only exceptionally higher rates up to 15 per cent for other HFRS infections, caused by some Dobrava virus (DOBV) species, prevalent however only in Central and South Europe.

"In this perspective, and since viruses, and even less so wild rodent-borne viruses, are not hampered by national borders or customs restrictions, the long-existing and impressive Russian hantavirus incidences should first briefly be mentioned. In the 1978-2014 period, and in European Russia alone, no fewer than 230 135 HFRS (mainly NE) cases were officially registered by the statistical department of the Russian Ministry of Public Health, with peaks of 11 247 cases in 1985, recently again 11 262 cases in 2014, but even 20 760 cases in 1997."

Dobrava virus is very likely the hantavirus responsible for the 66 cases, although Puumala virus could also be involved.
