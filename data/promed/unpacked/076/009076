The State Secretariat for Agriculture calls for wheat producers to
take precautions because the 1st outbreak of leaf rust of wheat in the
south of the state has been detected. On 15 Jan 2010, the 1st wheat
plot infected with the disease was detected in the region of
Huatabampo. It was treated and no new infections have been reported in
the area. Farmers are being advised to increase monitoring for the
detection of the disease.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. Different pathovars affect barley and rye. The
disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can
cause serious yield losses of over 40 percent in individual fields.
Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on
heads. As the crop ripens, spores are produced. Infection of the host
can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic
severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode"
suddenly during favourable weather.

The fungus is not soil-borne but spores are spread by wind and
mechanical means. It needs living tissue to survive between seasons
and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal
plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies
mainly on timely fungicide applications (which is presumably the
'treatment' referred to above), choice of crop cultivars and control
of volunteer crop plants. Monitoring programmes have been established
in many affected areas to detect emerging new strains. Crop monitoring
is also important for early discovery of infection (as suggested
above) so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as
build-up of inoculum.
