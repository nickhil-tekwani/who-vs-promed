Background information on _Taenia solium_ in South Africa
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tapeworm-related diseases are a serious clinical and public health problem
in South Africa. Dr John Fincham of the Medical Research Council has drawn
attention to a recent survey conducted in 21 villages in the Alfred Nzo and
Oliver Tambo districts in the Eastern Cape, which found that between 28.2
and 52.2 percent of free-ranging pigs had pork tapeworm cysts in their
muscles. The cysts are tapeworm larvae that develop into adult worms in
people who eat under-cooked or raw meat from an infested pig. The pork
tapeworm (Taenia solium) is the cause of most of the serious
tapeworm-related disease in South Africa.
Early in May 2005 several children at a remote village in the Eastern Cape
suffered from fits and other symptoms. This outbreak has served as a timely
reminder of the danger posed by cysts of the pork tapeworm in the brain and
other vital organs. Brain cysts are the main cause of epilepsy in children
and adults in the Eastern Cape. Records show that almost 90 percent of 239
patients with brain cysts seen in Cape Town hospitals were originally from
that province. Epilepsy was present in 79.5 percent of this series and 51.5
percent were children.
The situation in the village reflects the traditional practice of allowing
pigs to range freely when there is a lack of effective sanitation. While
the pigs are an important source of protein, they unfortunately scavenge
exposed human faeces containing tapeworm eggs. Numerous larval cysts
develop in the pig meat as a result.
During the recent outbreak at the village, one child died of an
uncontrolled epileptic-like fit, which might have been caused by tapeworm
cysts in the brain, and 26 were treated in hospital. There is an
unconfirmed report that 17 of the children had fits. A team investigating
the outbreak reported that pigs roamed freely through the village and there
was a lack of effective sanitation.
No definitive diagnosis has been possible because of the remoteness of the
village. A sensitive ELISA diagnostic test is available that detects
circulating antigen from cysts, says Dr Fincham.
The solution to the problem in this village -- and generally -- is to
develop effective sanitation and a reliable supply of clean water, as well
as to enclose pigs so that they do not scavenge waste.
Pork tapeworm cysts can also lodge and enlarge in the spinal cord, eye,
muscle or elsewhere in our bodies. Pressure from cysts can impair vision,
cause paralysis and have other seriously debilitating effects, says Dr Fincham.
Pig production by emerging farmers in resource-poor situations in all the
South African provinces has increased substantially. Prevention of pork
tapeworm-related disease can be achieved by means of effective sanitation;
provision of clean water; cooking all pig meat sufficiently to destroy
cysts; and regular, effective treatment of people against tapeworm in rural
areas where pigs are produced and eaten.
Hydatid disease caused by development of cysts of _Echinococcus granulosus_
(a tapeworm of dogs and wild carnivores) is another serious
tapeworm-related disease of humans in South Africa, says Dr Fincham. He
says that the cysts develop mainly in the liver or lungs, but also in other
organs. Hydatid disease is much less frequent than pork tapeworm-related
disease, but it is very serious because the cysts continuously enlarge.
Treatment often includes radical surgery, and cases are referred every year
from rural areas to hospitals in urban centres.
Dr Fincham mentions a few solutions, which are: treat dogs regularly with
effective anthelminthics, do not feed meat containing _Echinococcus_ cysts
to dogs, keep dogs clean, and practice good personal hygiene (especially by
washing hands after handling dogs).

_Taenia solium_ and hydatid disease is that these serious infections are
primarily due to poverty and lack of resources for safe farming. - Mod.EP]
