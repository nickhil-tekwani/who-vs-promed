Minnesota health officials say 2 children in the Twin Cities area got sick from salmonellosis after coming in contact with tainted pet food. The Minnesota Department of Health said Fri 9 Feb 2018 that testing found the same salmonella DNA patterns in the siblings. One of the children was hospitalized in January 2018 with a painful bone condition.

An investigation found the children's home contained Raws for Paws Ground Turkey Food and that the pet food was contaminated. The contaminated raw turkey pet food was produced on 12 Oct 2017 and sold online on the Raws for Paws website. The product was recalled Mon 5 Feb 2018 by the manufacturer.

The Star Tribune reports health officials are urging pet owners to discard or return pet food with this brand and to thoroughly clean bowls or surface areas.

Raws for Paws is recalling recalled 4000 pounds of its Ground Turkey Pet Food due to possible Salmonella contamination after reported illnesses, including 2 children who have been infected with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Reading. The food is sold online by Christofersen Meats Co. Inc., doing business as Swanson Meats, in Minneapolis, no relation to Swanson Meals.

The Minnesota Department of Health reports that 2 children in a single household got sick. One of the children ended up with septicemia, a blood infection, and osteomyelitis, a painful and serious bone infection, the FDA said. Testing done by the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture demonstrated that the same strain of _Salmonella_ Reading found in the children was also found in 4 samples of Raws for Paws "Ground Turkey Food for Pets" that was used to feed the family dog, according to an advisory that the Federal Drug Administration posted in addition to the company's recall notice. Christofersen Meats recalled the Raws for Paws product on 5 Feb 2018 and began directly notifying its customers on the same day.

The outbreak is of particular public health importance because of the potential hazard to both human and animal health, according to the FDA's outbreak advisory.

People who have handled the dog food are at risk of salmonellosis infection and are advised to seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea that is watery or bloody, fever and headache.

An FDA study unrelated to this recall found that raw pet food was more likely to be contaminated with _Salmonella_ or _Listeria_ compared to non-raw pet foods. In addition to _Salmonella_, handling raw meat at home can expose pet owners to parasites, viruses and bacteria including _E. coli_, _Campylobacter_ and _Listeria_.

The recalled Raw Paws branded food comes in 5-pound and 1-pound sealed plastic tubes often referred to as "chubs." The recalled Turkey Pet Food and Pet Food Combo Packs can be identified by looking for case codes: 9900008, 9900009, 9900014, and 9900015. The Turkey Pet Food, which ships direct to consumers in cases, was manufactured on 12 Oct 2017. The Combo Packs were manufactured from 12 Oct 2017 to 2 Feb 2018. The recalled lot codes and the manufacturing dates are not printed on the individual plastic chub packaging, so customers who have discarded the case have no means of determining whether they have the recalled products. So, the FDA advises anyone who bought the product since 12 Oct 2018 but cannot determine whether it is affected by the recall throw the dog food away.

Raw Paws food included in this recall was distributed throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. The company sells and ships its products directly to customers through online mail orders.

The FDA study, which ran from October 2010 through July 2012, tested more than 1000 samples of pet foods and pet treats for foodborne bacteria, including _Salmonella_. Of the 196 samples of raw pet food tested during the study, 15 were positive for _Salmonella_.

In 2013, FDA issued a "Compliance Policy Guide for Salmonella in Food for Animals," affirming a zero-tolerance policy for _Salmonella_ in pet food due to the risk to human health.

Raws for Paws urges consumers to stop using the ground turkey and contact the company at 612-465-0372.
