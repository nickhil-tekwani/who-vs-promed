NELSPRUIT: Although foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is of major agricultural
economic importance, it poses no risk to the general public. The FMD virus
can cause disease in more than 70 species of animals, particularly hoofed
animals. The domestic species most commonly affected are cattle and pigs,
and in these animals spread is usually by infectious droplets from infected
animals. In the Kruger Park FMD is common in buffalo and causes periodic
outbreaks in other animals, particularly impala.
A mild disease has been described in humans but this is exceptionally rare.
Disease has usually resulted from intimate contact with animals infected,
either by drinking infected milk or through the exposure of broken skin (of
veterinarians or other animal handlers) to infected animal fluids. No known
cases of human disease have followed consumption of infected livestock. In
the rare human cases a mild blistering rash on the hands, feet or tongue
occurred. This rash healed spontaneously and did not require specific therapy.
As the infected herds in Mpumalanga are quarantined, the chance of exposure
to members of the general public is insignificant. In addition, all
previously-described cases in humans have been due to the A, O or C types
of FMD. No human cases have been described due to the SAT types of FMD that
are responsible for the present outbreak in Mpumalanga. Despite
considerable exposure of Kruger National Park staff to the SAT types of FMD
virus, a recently-completed scientific review by the Department of Health
in collaboration with the Kruger National Park found no evidence of any
cases of human disease.
