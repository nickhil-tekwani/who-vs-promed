The measles epidemic continues to escalate in France. The Institute
for Public Health and the National Academy of Medicine are alarmed and
calling for an enhanced immunisation programme. According to
academician Prof. Pierre Begue, "Since 2008, more than 20 000 cases
have been recorded by the Institute for Public Health, with 14 500 of
these reports being reported during the period January to June 2011
compared with 5000 (2 deaths) during the whole of 2010."

The regions most affected by the epidemic wave are located in the
South of France. "This outbreak of measles is particularly serious
because it affects predominantly infants under one year and adults,"
said Prof. Pierre Begue. Indeed, in 2010, incidence rates have more
than tripled in infants and have increased 5-fold in those over 20
years of age when compared with 2009 data. "Hospitalizations reached
nearly 40 percent in the case of infants infected with measles and 50
percent for those over 30 years. Complications were observed in 26
percent of 20-29 year-olds and 41 percent in the case of over 30
year-olds." The complications included pneumonia, neurological
complications and acute encephalitis. During the 1st 7 months of 2011,
15 cases had a neurological complication, 639 had severe pneumonia,
and 6 died, according to the Institute for Public Health as of 9 Sep
2011.

The measles epidemic has raged throughout Europe since 2006, with 12
036 cases reported in 2006-2007, half of them in Britain and
Switzerland. But according to the WHO Office for Europe, France is now
experiencing the largest epidemic and is contaminating neighboring
countries. "This is due to the fact that vaccination coverage requires
at least 95 percent coverage of the population. This is a consequence
of the extreme infectiousness of measles virus, which defines the rate
of reproduction, which is 15 to 20 times higher than that of
influenza." However in 2006, vaccination coverage in France was 90
percent for the 1st dose. However in the case of the 2nd dose, the
figure was only 44 percent at 6 years of age, when it should have been
80 percent.

Pierre Begue stressed that to contain the outbreak, it will be
necessary to enhance infant vaccination coverage and strictly enforce
measures for catch-up vaccination of children, adolescents and young
adults up to age 31. A more sustained public information campaign
would be desirable.

Daadab [Dadaab] refugee camp has been identified as the source of the
current measles outbreak. Public Health Director Shariff Shaanaz
suspects the disease has spread from the camp where several cases have
been reported. He said they have launched an anti-measles campaign at
the camp to ensure the disease does not spread further.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is currently battling outbreaks of
cholera and measles in and around the town of Marere in southern
Somalia. Around 5000 Somalis fleeing conflict and drought in their
villages are now seeking shelter in Marere and the surrounding
villages of Jilib, Keytoy, and Osman Mo. MSF is trying to counter the
outbreaks but is finding that this effort is no different from its
other interventions in Somalia, which is to say that security and
other matters are limiting the organization's ability to respond to
the degree that is necessary.

"Since the outbreak of the measles epidemic among the displaced
people, we managed to treat over 150 cases," said Silvia Colona, MSF
Project Coordinator for Marere. "Ideally, we would do mass vaccination
of all children in these villages. That is the only way we know to
stop an epidemic among vulnerable people. Until now, this has not
happened. If the authorities grant us the possibility to do mass
vaccinations amongst the children in the affected locations, we can
prevent an epidemic and many unnecessary deaths."

Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have been on the move this year
[2011] seeking relief from a worsening humanitarian crisis marked by
war, violence, lack of development, lack of assistance, and drought.
Many are malnourished and weak, and opportunistic infections --
cholera and measles in particular -- are rife, given the lack of clean
drinking water and sanitary conditions.

This week, MSF also distributed relief items to the displaced people
in Jilib. Blankets, buckets and cooking pots were handed out to over
1600 households lacking the most essential items. MSF has worked
continuously in Somalia since 1991 and currently provides free medical
care in 8 regions. Over 400 Somali staff supported by approximately
100 staff in Nairobi provide free primary healthcare, surgery,
treatment for malnutrition, as well as support to displaced people
through health care, water supply and relief items distributions in 9
locations in south and central Somalia. MSF is also providing medical
care to Somali refugees in Kenya and Ethiopia.

Chiengi district in Luapula province has recorded an outbreak of
measles, with 10 more patients treated for the disease. Both District
Commissioner (DC) Freeman Kaputo and district medical officer James
Zulu confirmed the development in separate interviews. Mr. Kaputo said
although the outbreak was serious, no deaths had been recorded in the
past 14 days in which the health authorities had been treating measles
cases.

Dr Zulu said cases of measles were being recorded in areas between
Chienge and Nchelenge districts. "We have cases of measles recorded in
areas bordering Nchelenge district, Kabwe and Puta areas," he said. Dr
Zulu said health personnel had put in place measures aimed at ensuring
that the disease did not spread to other areas. He said most of the
measles-affected areas were those which were not covered during the
international medical volunteers' agency Medicine Sans Frontiers
(MSF)'s measles vaccines distribution and sensitization campaigns last
July [2011].

The health campaigns in which the MSF volunteers distributed free
vaccines and conducted measles prevention sensitization were
prematurely completed last July [2011] because of hostility from the
villagers who accused the MSF team of being Satanists. This happened
after word went round that the MSF medical practitioners had arrived
to collect human blood and were pretending to be distributing vaccines
and carrying out health campaigns.

With the mass vaccination of 209 000 adolescents and young people
between 10 and 19 years in the Atlantic Coast [Atlantica], health
authorities are seeking to contain the outbreak of measles that so far
has claimed 5 confirmed cases in Barranquilla. That 10-19 age group
would be the most vulnerable sector of the population because,
according to experts, these ages have low vaccination coverage for
this disease.

All children under 8 years, however, would be immunized in subsequent
campaigns to eradicate rubella and measles. As of November 2010, 6 854
805 children of 1-8 years throughout the country have been immunized.

Like the flu, the disease caused by measles virus has symptoms that
include high fever, cough, redness and peeling of the skin. It can be
acquired through contact with droplets expelled into the air when an
infected person sneezes or coughs.

According to the health authorities, the 1st case was imported from
Brazil, a 14-year-old who had visited Sao Paulo, between 21 and 25 Jul
2011. Shortly after the index case developed symptoms of measles, his
5-year-old brother fell ill, followed by the mother of 2 teenagers and
2 close family members.

The Institute's director recalled that the last outbreak of measles
occurred in 2002, with 6000 suspected cases. "At that time, 139 cases
were confirmed, a situation that generated a multi-faceted
epidemiological response and a vaccination campaign that managed to
contain this outbreak," said Lopez.

Six confirmed cases of measles (an increase of one since 13 Sep 2011)
in Barranquilla, the 4th most populous city in Colombia, has induced
the Colombian government to embark on a mission to vaccinate over 8
million people within the next 8 months. Deputy Minister of Health and
Welfare Beatriz Londono asked those who have not yet been vaccinated
against measles to do so immediately, according to Caracol Radio. "If
in doubt, there is no doubt, vaccinate!" Londono urged. "If the
mothers do not know where the vaccination card is, vaccinate! If the
mother is rummaging about for it, vaccinate!"

According to Londono, the Ministry of Social Protection is working
with the Ministry of Education to 1st vaccinate residents of the
Atlantico department, of which Barranquilla is the capital, and the
adjacent Bolivar and Magdalena departments. The minister has called on
educational institutions in these departments to "actively participate
in pro-vaccination campaigns and allow the entry of professionals to
carry out vaccination."

While efforts are being concentrated in Atlantico and neighboring
departments, the government also plans to target Bogota [the capital
of Colombia], because the traffic between the major cities of
Barranquilla, Cartagena and Bogota is high. The government's goal,
Londono said, is to vaccinate 8.5 million Colombians for measles and
rubella by 31 May 2012.

Meanwhile, physicians are advised to report any suspected cases of
measles immediately to the secretary of health. "Young doctors
probably have never seen a case of measles, because there hasn't been
a case in the last 9 years," she said.

The New Mexico (NM) Department of Health is investigating a
laboratory-confirmed case of measles in an infant male from Lincoln
County. The NM authorities say the origin of the baby's exposure still
is unknown. The child's name hasn't been released.

Health officials say it's the 3rd measles case in New Mexico so far
this year [2011]. They say they're working closely with the family to
identify anyone who may have been exposed to the highly contagious
disease so that more cases can be prevented.

The NM authorities recommend that anyone who is unsure of their
vaccination status or persons traveling outside of the country should
check to see whether they're up to date on all immunizations including
the measles vaccination.

As part of the ongoing investigation into a confirmed case of measles,
the Milwaukee Health Department is asking anyone who visited a south
side building on 2 Sep 2011 to speak with a public health nurse
because they may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease.
To date, there are no new confirmed cases beyond the single case in a
child confirmed last week, Milwaukee Health Department Spokeswoman
Raquel Filmanowicz said Monday [12 Sep 2011]. But public health
officials have not been able to contact everyone who might have come
into contact with the child.

The child visited the Social Security Administration office at 1710 S.
7th St. between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Sat 2 Sep 2011 and was contagious
at the time. The child is a refugee whose family moved to the city at
the end of August 2011. Because measles is highly contagious and can
be spread through coughing or sneezing while passing in a hallway,
officials also want to reach anyone who was at the Planned Parenthood
of Wisconsin offices in the same building at that time. Those who
visited either office between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on 2 Sep 2011 are
asked to call the Milwaukee Health Department at (414) 286-3521
between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, to speak with a
public health nurse.

Parents across the city also should be sure their children are
up-to-date with required immunizations in the coming weeks, Health
Department officials said Monday [12 Sep 2011]. Adults born on or
after 1957 who do not know their measles vaccination status should
consider getting vaccinated against measles at this time, since the
disease can cause serious complications, including death.

Vaccination provides 99 percent protection against measles. Anyone
with symptoms of fever and rash should seek care and a diagnosis from
a medical provider and self-isolate until symptoms resolve. People
with measles symptoms should call their health care provider before
going to a clinic to receive instructions to prevent possible spread
of the disease.

Questions may be directed to the local public health department
regarding measles vaccination, symptoms or disease. In Milwaukee,
residents can call (414) 286-3521 between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday
through Friday, or visit the website,
http://www.milwaukee.gov/health. Vaccination clinics will be held
this week at all Health Department satellite health centers.

[On Wed 14 Sep 2011, the Milwaukee Sentinel reported that Milwaukee
Health Department officials said they have another confirmed case of
measles and 3 or 4 more suspected cases. All of the new cases involve
people who were at a south side building where a refugee child with
the disease had visited, said Paul Biedrzycki, the city's director of
disease control and environment health. The exposures are believed to
have occurred between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on 2 Sep 20112 at the building
at 1710 S. 7th St., which houses a Social Security Administration
office and a Planned Parenthood office

Health authorities are urging rugby fans travelling to New Zealand for
the World Cup to make sure their measles vaccinations are up to date,
following reports that Auckland is experiencing a measles outbreak.

NSW [New South Wales] Health issued the advice on 6 Sep 2011,
encouraging anyone who had not [received] 2 doses of measles vaccine
to get immunised. Measles vaccine is included in the triple vaccine
called MMR (measles-mumps-rubella), which is recommended in Australia
for children aged 12 months and 4 years.

People going to New Zealand were advised to visit their GP for the MMR
vaccine before they travelled. "Two doses of the vaccine are
recommended to give lifelong protection. Many young adults are at risk
if they have never been immunised, or if they only received one
vaccine as a child," NSW Health director of health protection Dr
Jeremy McNulty said.

A New Zealand Ministry of Health release today [9 Sep 2011] stated
there have been 120 confirmed cases of measles since the end of May
2011 reported to authorities in Auckland and 202 confirmed cases in
New Zealand since January this year [2011]. "About 90 per cent of
confirmed measles cases this year [2011] have been in people who were
unimmunised or partially immunised against measles," Director of
Public Health in New Zealand Dr Mark Jacobs said.

The outbreak has raised questions in New Zealand as to whether measles
vaccinations should be compulsory for all children, according to
market research company Research New Zealand. They found nearly 1/3rd
of New Zealanders believe that immunisation in children should be
compulsory.
