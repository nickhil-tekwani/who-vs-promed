[1] Report from Tajikistan via ProMED-RUS
Date: Fri 23 Apr 2010
From: Nilufar Rakhmanova <promed-rus@promedmail.org> [edited]


[re: Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (03): Tajikistan, RFI 20100423.1314]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information has been sent by our health specialists from
Tajikistan:

"That is true. 120 cases [have been] detected in Khatlon, Dushanbe, and the
[Region] of Republican Subordination. 7 confirmed [cases] with the "wild"
PV1 virus. 11 deaths (including 2 adults). WHO is conducting the
investigation of the outbreak and one CDC representative is also coming for
this reason soon.

There is a WHO plan to vaccinate children under 5 starting from May [2010].

Cases have also been detected in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan."

A WHO team has been sent: see

WHO has confirmed this as the 1st wild-type polio outbreak in Tajikistan
since 1997:

Polio in Tajikistan, 1st importation since Europe certified polio-free --
23 Apr 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Poliovirus type 1 has been detected in diagnostic samples from cases of
acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tajikistan. This represents the 1st
importation of poliovirus in the WHO European Region since it was certified
polio-free in 2002.

As of 21 Apr 2010, 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis had been reported
from Tajikistan. The majority of these have onset of paralysis within the
past 2 weeks, prompting the Government to notify WHO of an outbreak. 10 of
the children have died. The vast majority of the cases are children less
than 5 years of age. Preliminary data suggests more than 45 per cent had 4
or more doses of oral polio vaccine [OPV].

To date, poliovirus type 1 has been isolated in diagnostic specimens from 7
of these cases. All cases are in the south west of the country, in an area
bordering Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Afghanistan is one of the 4 remaining
polio-endemic countries. No cases have been reported in the areas of
Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan.

The Government of Tajikistan has requested technical guidance and support
from WHO. Vaccine for 3 outbreak response rounds is being pre-positioned by
UNICEF Supply Division for Tajikistan.

Tajikistan's last case of clinically confirmed polio was in 1997; the last
case of polio confirmed by virological testing was in 1991. Reported OPV3
[oral polio vaccine] coverage nationwide was 87 per cent in 2008, the last
year for which complete data are available under the WHO/UNICEF joint
reporting process. AFP surveillance indicators in Tajikistan meet
certification standards at the national level. In 2009, Tajikistan reported
35 cases of acute flaccid paralysis, of which none were caused by wild
poliovirus. Globally, more than 90 000 cases of acute flaccid paralysis
were reported in 2009, of which 1606 were caused by wild poliovirus.

A total of 3 cases of acute flaccid paralysis have been reported in
Uzbekistan on the Tajikistan border; poliovirus has not been isolated yet
in laboratory testing. In addition, a child from Tajikistan travelled from
Dushanbe to Tashkent for medical treatment shortly after onset of
paralysis. The Government of Uzbekistan is planning one nationwide round of
vaccination; the Government of Kyrgyzstan, is immunizing children younger
than 5 years of age over the course of European Immunization Week (26-30
Apr 2010).

WHO is communicating with countries in the Region about the outbreak. It is
important that neighboring countries strengthen surveillance for cases of
acute flaccid paralysis, in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus
importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze
routine immunization coverage data to identify any sub-national gaps in
population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby
minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be
given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is
less than 80 per cent.

This outbreak demonstrates the need to maintain high population immunity
until transmission of polio has been interrupted worldwide.

Public health measures such as enhanced surveillance and immunization may
be put in place at the borders by Tajik health authorities and their
counterparts. It is important that international travellers to and from
polio affected areas are adequately immunized against polio as recommended
in Chapter 6 of International Travel and Health (see link at
<http://www.who.int/ith/ITH2010chapter6.pdf>.

WHO does not recommend the imposition of restrictions to the international
movement of persons as a control measure at this time.

[ProMED-mail gratefully acknowledges CAPT O'Connor's contribution.

The close geographic proximity of the outbreak to the border with
Afghanistan and the fact that polio is endemic in that country, do serve as
circumstantial evidence suggestive that the virus may well have originated
in Afghanistan, albeit no poliovirus transmission has been documented in
the border area in Afghanistan. Unfortunately there has also been probable
spread of poliovirus transmission to Uzbekistan with 3 reported suspected
cases. But that being said, we await genetic studies on the virus involved
in this outbreak as well as laboratory confirmation on the suspected cases
in Uzbekistan.

It is curious that this outbreak has apparently been ongoing since December
2009, somewhat beneath the surveillance radarscope. It will be interesting
to see the results of the epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak when
available. From the information given above one can speculate that there
were "sporadic cases" during the period December 2009 through the end of
March 2010, that may well have been missed and attributed to "AFP" in a
country where no polio cases had been seen in 13 years -- until there was
significant increase in AFP cases to flag an outbreak of something unusual.

While there is mention that more than 45 per cent of the cases have a
history of 4 or more doses of OPV, one wonders what the actual vaccine
efficacy is -- when there are higher levels of vaccination coverage, one
expects to find a higher proportion of cases among vaccinated individuals.
One of the many questions to be addressed here is whether this represents a
failure of the vaccine, or a failure to vaccinate (low vaccine efficacy vs
pockets of low vaccination coverage).
