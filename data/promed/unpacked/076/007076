A rare deadly deer disease was confirmed in New York State.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) confirmed 3 deer tested positive for a rare virus.

The 3 deer were all found in Southampton, Suffolk County. All tested positive for bluetongue (BT). This marks the 1st time the bluetongue virus was detected in New York deer, officials say. It was also detected in several other mid-Atlantic coast states this year [2022].

Bluetongue virus is closely related to the epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus and is transmitted in the same way.

"EHD virus and BT virus are often fatal to deer. They are transmitted by biting midges, small bugs often called "no-see-ums." EHD and BT outbreaks are most common in late summer and early fall when midges are abundant. Diseases caused by the viruses are usually not spread directly from deer to deer, and humans cannot be infected by deer or bites from midges," the DEC states.

Signs in deer include fever, difficulty breathing, dehydration, swelling of the head, neck and tongue, attraction to water and rapid death.

Infected deer will often seek out water sources and many pass away in or near a water source.

Once clinical signs of EHD or BT infection are apparent, deer usually die within 36 hours, officials say.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease confirmed in Dutchess County, Rensselaer County, Suffolk County

The DEC also reported 2 white-tailed deer in the town of Schodack, Rensselaer County, found dead in late August [2022], and 1 deer in Southampton, Suffolk County, confirmed positive for EHD.

Two deer found dead in the town of Dover Plains, Dutchess County, also died from EHD in mid-August [2022], officials say.

"There is no treatment or means to prevent EHD or BT in free-ranging deer. The dead deer do not serve as a source of infection for other animals. Both EHD and BT can infect cattle and sheep; cattle seldom exhibit signs of disease, but sheep can suffer severe disease and death from BT infection," the DEC states.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease identified in Dutchess, Ulster, Putnam, Orange, Rockland and Westchester Counties
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The disease is called by some a "zombie" deer disease because signs in deer may include difficulty standing, drooling, and emitting foam from the mouth or nose.

In August 2021, the DEC confirmed that 2 white-tailed deer in the town of Esopus died after contracting Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD).

The DEC is currently investigating reports of several other dead deer in Dutchess, Ulster and Westchester counties. From early September to late October 2020, a large EHD outbreak occurred in the lower Hudson Valley, centered in Putnam and Orange counties, with an estimated 1500 deer mortalities, officials say.

Several white-tailed deer in the towns of Nelsonville and Cold Spring in Putnam County and near Goshen in Orange County died after contracting EHD in 2020.

DEC wildlife biologists told Husdon Valley Post in September 2020 211 deer from Putnam County, southwestern Dutchess County and northwestern Westchester County as well as another 237 from Orange County, southern Ulster County and northern Rockland County died from Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease.

The virus has also been identified in Dutchess, Ulster, Putnam, Orange, Rockland and Westchester counties.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, EHD is a disease that deer and occasionally cattle acquire from biting midges. These animals seek water when they are affected by this disease.

Bluetongue is a closely related disease, but is not the same disease. These diseases are antigenically very different. EHD more often affects cervids. Bluetongue virus more often affects cattle. Either virus can and occasionally does cross into the other species. Generally, in deer, it is much more likely EHD is the cause of these animals dying. There is a PCR test which clearly demonstrates the differences between these 2 viruses. Since the state is announcing these deaths as bluetongue virus (BTV) there is likely some antigentic testing behind this announcement.

Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the EHDV or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6), and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although white-tailed deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886.

Bluetongue is an insect-transmitted, viral disease of sheep, cattle, goats, and other ruminants, such as white-tailed deer and pronghorn. It is particularly damaging in sheep; half the sheep in an infected flock may die. In cattle and goats, however, bluetongue viruses cause very mild, self-limiting infections with only minor clinical consequences. A bluetongue virus infection causes inflammation, swelling, and hemorrhage of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and tongue. Inflammation and soreness of the feet also are associated with bluetongue. In sheep, the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth become swollen, hemorrhagic, and may look red or dirty blue in color, thus giving the disease its name: bluetongue.

Bluetongue is a seasonal disease generally observed in the late summer and early fall in the United States. Virus transmission begins in the early spring with the onset of insect flight activity and continues until the 1st hard frosts.

Bluetongue viruses are spread from animal to animal by biting gnats or midges. In the United States, the disease is most prevalent in the southern and south western states. In recent years we have seen more of the biting midges in some more northern areas.

Animals cannot directly contract the disease from other animals. - Mod.TG
