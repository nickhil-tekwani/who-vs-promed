102 pigeons exposed to the bird flu virus have been seized by
Australian quarantine inspectors. Inspectors said 3 of the birds,
which were imported from Canada, had tested positive to bird flu
antibodies and would be put down.
A spokesman for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service,
David Finlayson, said the birds posed "no risk to human health, no
risk to bird life because quarantine facilities are a high-security,
purpose-built facility designed for this very purpose." He stressed
that the birds did not have the disease.
The birds arrived in Melbourne last month [September 2005] and were
put into quarantine for testing. The diagnosis was confirmed "some
days ago." A highly contagious strain of avian influenza, H7, was
found on a farm in Canada last year [2004].
The federal Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, who this week [3rd week
October 2005] said he was considering vaccinating Australia against
bird flu, would not comment on the incident, saying it was a quarantine issue.
The chief veterinary officer, Gardner Murray, said last night [19 Oct
2005] that the incident was not Australia's 1st brush with bird flu.
All NSW councils have been asked to identify possible sites to
dispose of dead birds and to plan their response in the event of a
bird flu outbreak in Australia.

[Although the birds were confined to the quarantine center and may
pose no risk to the general population, H7 has been found in human
beings (see WHO CSR report of 5 Apr 2004: Avian influenza A(H7) human
infections in Canada<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_04_05/en/> and

meant was that since the quarantine facility is secure, and since the
birds had only antibodies, there is only exposure, not necessarily
disease. - Mod.TG]

Australia bans bird imports from Canada
-----------------------------------------------
Australia imposed an immediate ban on live bird imports from Canada
after a group of racing pigeons were found to have been exposed to
diseases including bird flu, Agriculture Minister Peter MacGauran
said on Friday [21 Oct 2005].
The 7 pigeons imported from Canada will be destroyed, he said. None
of the birds actually had bird flu, but tested positive to disease
antibodies, quarantine officials said.
MacGauran said the birds, among a group of 102 racing and show
pigeons which arrived in the Australian city of Melbourne in early
September 2005, had been certified by Canadian authorities to be disease-free.
"Australia will be imposing an immediate ban on the importation of
birds from Canada until there is further and better reasons given for
the errors made by the Canadian quarantine authorities," MacGauran
told local radio.
"I am deeply concerned that the birds arrived in Australia with all
the certifications to show that they were disease-free," he said.
"Our import protocol requires that the birds undergo 55 days
pre-export quarantine, with testing and treatment, and certification
provided by the exporting country's veterinarian authorities."
All the birds were tested on arrival, and 3 were found to have avian
influenza antibodies, but did not test positive for the H5N1 strain
or any other avian influenza virus.
4 other birds tested positive for Newcastle Disease antibodies.
Newcastle Disease is also a highly contagious viral disease in
poultry, cage and aviary birds and wild birds. It is characterized by
digestive, respiratory and nervous signs.
"Thankfully, Australia's quarantine system worked as it was meant to.
We didn't take the certification on face value, even though it was
coming from an advanced country," MacGauran said.
"We have had apologies from the Canadian authorities but not yet an
adequate explanation of the testing anomalies."
MacGauran said the pigeons, now being held in a high-security
quarantine facility, would be destroyed and the remaining birds
returned to Canada. If Canada refused to accept the remaining birds,
then they would also be killed, he said.
The H5N1 strain, which 1st surfaced in Hong Kong in 1997, re-emerged
in 2003 in South Korea and has spread to Russia and Europe from
Southeast Asia, which the World Health Organization says will be the
most likely epicenter of any human pandemic.
It has killed more than 60 people in Asia.
