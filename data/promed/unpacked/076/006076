DIPHTHERIA - HAITI: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

We would like to point out an alert regarding a diphtheria epidemic in
Haiti that someone of our epidemic intelligence network communicated
to us yesterday [29 Oct 2009].

On 15 Oct 2009, the Department of Public Health and Population (MSPP)
of Haiti launched the alert during a press conference.

In 4 weeks, 11 cases of diphtheria have been recorded, including 5
deaths in 3 departments in the country. From 1 to 23 Sep 2009, 7
communes of 3 provinces of the country have been affected by this
disease.

The WHO standard for a national epidemic is that 3 departments in the
country are affected within 3 months.

If I am not mistaken, this event seems to have been reported only by
Medisys in the French language on 15 Oct 2009 but we didn't detect it.

Since the detection of the event, we got some complementary information:

From 1 Jan to 21 Oct 2009, 24 cases including 14 deaths (calculated
CFR [case fatality rate]: 58 percent) have been reported. At this
stage it is unclear whether these are biologically confirmed cases (or
clinically).

WHO estimates the lethality of diphtheria from 5 to 10 percent. Given
the very high calculated fatality reported during this episode, it is
likely that the number of cases is largely underestimated.

WHO reported: Year / Cases of diphtheria in Haiti
2008 / 10
2007 / 94
2006 / 260
2005 / 204
2004 / 37
2003 / 2
2002 / 6

We seek to verify that cases are biologically confirmed and to get
more information about the circulation of the disease in the country
and the apparent lethality. We will keep you informed of the update.

[ProMED-mail thanks Laetitia Vaillant for this report. It is likely
that most, and probably all, of the Haitian cases were unimmunized.
The following is a CDC Health Alert from 2003
(<http://www.scdhec.gov/health/disease/han/docs/RespiratoryDiptheria20031024Adv.pdf>),
which discusses diphtheria in Haiti as well as pointing out in which
countries the disease remains endemic:

"On 18 Oct 2003, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and CDC were
notified of a case of respiratory diphtheria in a 63-year-old male.
This Pennsylvania resident had reportedly never been vaccinated
against diphtheria. From 3-10 Oct 2003, this man and 7 other men from
New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia had worked in a rural
village in Haiti. On return to Pennsylvania, the man was admitted to a
hospital because of his severe sore throat and respiratory distress.
Respiratory diphtheria was suspected when, during a tracheostomy
procedure, a pseudomembrane was seen throughout his upper airways
consistent with respiratory diphtheria. Several days later, a sample
of the pseudomembrane was PCR positive for _Corynebacterium
diphtheriae_ tox genes. Based on his history of travel to Haiti where
diphtheria is endemic, his clinical symptoms, and the positive PCR
results, this patient has a confirmed case of respiratory diphtheria.

"Diphtheria is caused by toxigenic strains of the bacterium _C.
diphtheriae_. The mainstay of therapy is administration of diphtheria
antitoxin (DAT). DAT should be given when diphtheria is suspected
without waiting for laboratory confirmation. In the USA, DAT is only
available from the CDC. Suspected diphtheria case-patients should also
receive antibiotics to eradicate carriage of _C. diphtheriae_. When
respiratory diphtheria is suspected in a patient, Td [diphtheria
toxoid] vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts
(that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or
who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered
within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and
pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given
antibiotic prophylaxis. Contact investigations identified the
diphtheria case-patient's 7 travel companions, several health-care
providers, and his wife as close contacts, and they received these
interventions; other passengers on the commercial airliner that the
case-patient took while in the infectious period were not considered
to be close contacts.

"Diphtheria is uncommon in the USA. From 1980 to 2002, only 54 cases
of probable or confirmed respiratory diphtheria were reported to the
CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Diphtheria is
endemic in Algeria, Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa; Brazil, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, and Haiti; Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia,
China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal,
Pakistan, Philippines, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, Viet Nam, and Yemen;
and Albania and all countries of the former Soviet Union. Travelers
who travel to these areas may be at substantial risk for exposure to
toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_, especially with prolonged
travel, extensive contact with children, or exposure to poor hygiene.

"Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons
aged 6 weeks to 6 years of age. The 5 DTaP doses are administered at
ages 2, 4, and 6 months, at 15-18 months, and at 4-6 years.
Adolescents and adults should receive the adult formulation of tetanus
and diphtheria toxoids (Td) every 10 years [and now one dose of DTaP
substituting for one of the Td injections before the age of 64].

Health care providers should ensure that travelers to all countries
with endemic diphtheria are up-to-date with diphtheria and other
vaccinations according to the ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices] guidelines." - Mod.LL]
