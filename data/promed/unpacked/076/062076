From Wednesday [11 Sep 2019] to Thursday [12 Sep 2019], the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has received 8 new reports on isolated cases of dogs with similar symptoms of disease. One of the dogs has died. The cases are from Buskerud, Vestfold, Trondelag, Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark.

It is important to remember that, in dogs, these symptoms often undergo a less acute course of disease. Initially, most reported cases were located in the Oslo area.

So far, there is no commonality between cases of sick dogs with regard to age, breed, feeding, contact with other dogs, walking areas, and the like. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority works actively with the Veterinary Institute, the NMBU Veterinary College, and veterinary clinics to obtain information on illness cases. There is extensive work to systematize data on the sick dogs and to find any common features or connections between the cases. So far, about 60 responses have been received to a questionnaire sent out to veterinarians on cases of acute bloody diarrhea in dogs. Preliminary assessment of these shows no connection between the cases, which may give a clear clue to follow in the investigation.

In most cases where several dogs share the same household, only one dog has become ill. This may indicate that if a common disease is involved, it is not very contagious between dogs.

There are currently 12 dogs showing the same signs of gut inflammation. Several dogs will be autopsied in the coming days, and in addition, sample material from sick dogs will be analyzed.

The Veterinary Institute believes that, according to accumulated findings, algae poisoning, tick-borne illnesses, anthrax, and tularemia are excluded. _Campylobacter_ and _Salmonella_ are also excluded, along with rat poisoning and similar specific poisonings. This exclusion does not include all types of toxins that may occur naturally.

The Veterinary Institute has detected the bacterium _Providencia alcalifaciens_ in a total of 10 dogs (9 autopsied and one alive). The bacterium _Clostridium perfringens_ has also been detected in several of the dogs, though to date this bacterium cannot be termed as the cause of the symptoms.

The Veterinary Institute is now investigating the presence of the bacterium in samples from healthy dogs. This mapping of the normal situation has not been completed, but it seems that this bacterium occurs naturally in some healthy dogs. In the future, the Veterinary Institute will examine the _Providencia_ bacteria to see if they all belong to the same strain. This can clarify if the cases are linked in one single event, or if there are several individual, separate cases that got [incidentally] notified.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority follows several clues in collaboration with the Veterinary Institute in the hope of resolving the many cases of sick and dead dogs lately. The discovery of the bacteria does not limit the Norwegian Food Safety Authority's broad efforts to carry out examinations for other potential causes, as the work progresses.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority maintains advice for dog owners to limit close contact between dogs and to keep dogs on leash so that they are controlled. Dogs showing signs of disease should be brought to the veterinarian as soon as possible.

[_Providencia alcalifaciens_, a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae and a component of the normal flora of human feces, has been suggested as a possible cause of traveler's diarrhea. Information on past observations on the said bacterium in animals, including experimental, will be welcomed.

For recent papers addressing _C. perfringens_ type A-associated haemorrhagic/necrotic gastroenteritis (beta-2-toxin) in dogs, please refer to Refs 1 and 2.

Further observations and findings of the exemplary coordinated (field/state/university) investigations in Norway are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS
