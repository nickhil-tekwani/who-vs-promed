A senior Russian Health Ministry official announced last week that 2.5
million Russians are infected with tuberculosis. There has been an 8.5
percent increase in the number of infected people so far in 1998. TB
prevalence has risen from 7.7 cases per 100,000 Russians in 1990 to 17.7
cases per 100,000 in 1998, with rates reportedly 50 times as high among
prisoners.
According to Gennady Onishchenko, the first deputy health minister, health
authorities are losing the fight against tuberculosis as drug-resistant
strains are becoming more widespread. Furthermore, doctors are currently
debating the best method of treatment--imported Western techniques for TB
management or the national treatment developed
under the Soviet Union.
