Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 12
--------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 12 Apr 2005, 235 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have
been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 215 have died.
Uige Province remains the most severely affected area, reporting a
cumulative total of 208 cases and 194 deaths. The isolation ward at
the province's large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially
equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty,
despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in
the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community
does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to
report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under
conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission.
Measures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce
opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for
bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the
situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a
harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation
somewhat better. Family members and other care-givers who refuse to
allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being
informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given
appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants,
which are currently in short supply in Angola.
Today, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial
hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of
infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been
very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening
units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to
hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic
fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards.
Apart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is
poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and
correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the
assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun
pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in
these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should
cases begin to occur.
In a tragic development, 4 Red Cross volunteers freshly trained in
social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their
way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental
in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola
haemorrhagic fever. WHO recognizes the importance of this support and
deeply regrets the death of these volunteers.
