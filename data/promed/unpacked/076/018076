The u-turn regarding burning comes after pollution tests on a stream
---------------------------------------------------------
First Minister Rhodri Morgan has denied that Anglesey's mass cull of 40 000
sheep is in crisis after the carcass disposal site is switched amid public
health concerns. The u-turn followed pollution concerns and a protest by
residents close to the Mona airfield, where the animals were be stored
ready for burning.
Tests on a stream near the airfield have been conducted by the Environment
after "odors were identified." An agency spokesman said there was "no
doubt" body fluids found in the tributary of the Afon Cefni had seeped from
the airfield. "We are definitely saying the discharge from the Mona site
are definitely body fluids from animal carcasses."
Mr Morgan confirmed the operation would now revert to the assembly's
original plan to bury carcasses at the privately-run Penhesgyn landfill
site, near Menai Bridge. Farmers opposed to the Penhesgyn disposal have
agreed with Agriculture Minister Carwyn Jones to allow up to 10 000
carcasses to be buried at the landfill site.
Mr Jones has been asked to find alternative locations to dispose of the
remaining 30 000 carcasses on the island. An operation is being organized
to transport the carcasses from the airfield and it is reported
slaughtering will be postponed for a day at the abattoir at Gaerwen.

The Ministry of Agriculture has been accused of failing to install a
powerful computer system purchased 2 years ago with the intention of
preventing a foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic.
MAFF officials purchased a computer tracking system known as EpiMan in the
late 1990s. The system was designed to predict future cases of FMD in the
event of an outbreak of the disease. But government spending cuts meant
funding was switched to BSE and the computer system was instead designated
to track BSE.
The system had been developed by Roger Morris, an authority on FMD based at
Massey University, New Zealand. Speaking to Farmers Weekly, Professor
Morris claimed that the scheme would have been able to speedily predict the
scale of the epidemic. "Undoubtedly fewer cases of the disease would have
occurred. We could have damped the disease down much more quickly."
When the FMD crisis broke in February, MAFF experts decided the system
should be installed, but they could not work out how to do it. MAFF flew in
a team of specialists from New Zealand. Prof Morris said: "The team from
New Zealand took just 4 days to install the system."
However, MAFF denied the accusation, saying Prof Morris contacted MAFF and
offered to install his computer system. MAFF officials said his system was
working alongside their own at the ministry's headquarters.
Prof Morris's computer system holds detailed maps of the UK and information
on factors influencing the spread of the disease, such as weather and
terrain. He said the system could have raised the alarm earlier in the
crisis that MAFF alone could not deal with the outbreak.
The news comes on top of the revelation MAFF failed to undergo any
exercises on the possibility of a FMD epidemic.
