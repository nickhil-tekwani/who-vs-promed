First Dengue-related Death of 2001
----------------------------------
A 28-year-old woman died last Thursday morning [2 Aug 2001 from
complications after coming down with dengue fever; the first dengue-related
death this year. Three days after she was admitted to Changi General
Hospital with high fever, headache, and skin rash, the patient had a heart
attack and died at about 4:20 AM.
Four weeks earlier, a male Australian friend of the woman (51 year-old),
came down with dengue and was in hospital for 4 days. He recovered and was
later discharged.
According to the Environment Ministry (ENV), 892 cases of dengue fever were
reported in the first 6 months of this year, compared to 291 for the same
period last year. But this year's weekly average of 41 cases is still lower
than the 100 cases per week reported during the epidemic years of 1997-98.

[In the previous post(Dengue - Singapore 20010712.1345) the weekly average
from a 6 months total of 892 cases was given correctly as 34. If the weekly
average is now 41, the total number of cases must exceed 1000. - Mod.CP
