On 15 Sep 2014, reporters learned from the Regional Department of Animal Husbandry [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region] about the plans to apply a regional programme addressing H7N9 avian influenza virus in poultry. According to the plan, during the following 3-5 years the department will focus on live animal markets, poultry farms, wild bird habitat and other key areas, to carry out risk-based surveillance and epidemiological investigation. Once found positive, strict measures will have to be applied, including disposal of H7N9-infected poultry and retrospective epidemiological investigation [tracing back of infection source]. The program will include serological investigations of poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, other poultry, including yellow chicken) and testing of collected fresh faeces samples from selected live animal markets and from wild bird habitats. The monitoring activities are planned to be concentrated mainly in 2 periods annually, June and November.

Guidelines for the measures applicable to [low pathogenic] H7N9 in poultry have been published. Should H7N9 mutate and become a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain, it will become liable to the measures spelled out in accordance with China's "major animal epidemic emergency regulations" and the related technical specifications for disposal.

[The above report has been published simultaneously with a media report on human H7N9 in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (northwest China).

Information on the 1st human cases diagnosed as avian influenza H7N9 virus infection in Xinjiang has been officially reported on 3 Sep 2014 in the 'Avian Influenza Report' of the Centre for Health protection (CHP), Hong Kong, Vol. 10, No. 36, reporting the period: 7-13 Sep 2014 (week 36); see at http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/2014_avian_influenza_report_vol10_wk36.pdf.

The report addressed 2 patients, both residents of the capital, Urumqi. According to the CHP report and additional sources (WHO, Flutrack), the 1st patient, a retired 66-year-old female, became ill on 14 Jul 2014, was hospitalized on 17 Jul 2014, and died on 3 Aug 2014.

The 2nd patient, a 53-year-old male worker, had onset of symptoms on 5 Aug 2014, was admitted to a hospital on 9 Aug, was diagnosed on 16 Sep, and eventually recovered and was released from hospital on 5 Sep 2014. His entire H7N9 experience has been vividly described in a media report included in posting 20140917.2781676. Both patients had, reportedly, contact with poultry prior to their falling sick.

The official information on both, dated 3 Sep 2014, was published almost 7 weeks after the hospitalisation of the 1st (fatal) case and a month after her death. The information on the surviving patient was published 24 and 17 days after his hospitalisation and diagnosis, respectively. However, his case, including personal data, was published by the Chinese media earlier, namely on 20 Aug 2014 (e.g., http://news.163.com/14/0820/11/A43BKR9100014AED.html).

No information is available on the date when the fatal case was diagnosed. Interestingly, the regional veterinary services started collecting samples from designated H7N9 monitoring sites in early September 2014; no such activity had been applied during the previous 2 months. All monitoring activities and results, since April 2013, on national bases, are available at http://www.moa.gov.cn/sjzz/syj/dwyqdt/jczt/ (in Chinese; apply machine translation). Since January 2014, such monitoring activities are applied, in affected provinces, 3 times per month in line with nationally applicable guidelines.

According to currently available data (updated 16 Sep 2014), during early September, 84 sites in Xinjiang were visited, 801 samples for H7 serology and 1123 samples for H7N9 detection collected and tested, all with negative results (see also item 2 and further commentary).

A description and discussion of China's H7N9 monitoring programme is available at http://www.nlintelligence.com/2014/04/03/china-ministry-agriculture-publishes-h7n9-test-results/.

With 2 cases added in Xinjiang, the cumulative number of human H7N9 cases is 453. The affected territories are (with number of cases in parentheses):
Zhejiang Province (139), Guangdong Province (109), Jiangsu Province (56), Shanghai Municipality (41), Hunan Province (24), Fujian Province (22), Anhui Province (17), Hong Kong (10; all cases imported from Guangdong Province), Jiangxi Province (8), Shandong Province (5; 1 case imported from Jiangsu Province), Henan Province (4), Beijing Municipality (4), Guangxi Province (3; 1 case imported from Guangdong Province), Jilin Province (2), Hebei Province (1), Guizhou Province (1; imported from Zhejiang Province), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2; the cases discussed in this post).

The leap of H7N9 from eastern China to the northwest should cause a raised alertness beyond China's borders. - Mod.AS]

Abstract
--------
The recent outbreak of H7N9 influenza in China has resulted in many human cases with a high fatality rate. Poultry are the likely source of infection for humans on the basis of sequence analysis and virus isolations from live bird markets, but it is not clear which species of birds are most likely to be infected and shedding levels of virus sufficient to infect humans. Intranasal inoculation of chickens, Japanese quail, pigeons, Pekin ducks, Mallard ducks, Muscovy ducks, and Embden geese with 10 (to the 6th) 50 percent egg infective doses of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus resulted in infection but no clinical disease signs. Virus shedding was much higher and prolonged in quail and chickens than in the other species. Quail effectively transmitted the virus to direct contacts, but pigeons and Pekin ducks did not. In all species, virus was detected at much higher titers from oropharyngeal swabs than cloacal swabs.

The hemagglutinin gene from samples collected from selected experimentally infected birds was sequenced, and 3 amino acid differences were commonly observed when the sequence was compared to the sequence of A/Anhui/1/2013: N123D, N149D, and L217Q. Leucine at position 217 is highly conserved for human isolates and is associated with 2,6-sialic acid binding. Different amino acid combinations were observed, suggesting that the inoculum had viral subpopulations that were selected after passage in birds.

These experimental studies corroborate the finding that certain poultry species are reservoirs of the H7N9 influenza virus and that the virus is highly tropic for the upper respiratory tract, so testing of bird species should preferentially be conducted with oropharyngeal swabs for the best sensitivity.

[According to an earlier summary, between April 2013 and March 2014, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture performed 1.4 million tests for H7N9. Of these, 440 were serologically positive and 116 pathogen positive. Serological positives peaked in September to November 2013; pathogen positives peaked in December 2013. Generally where there were no positive results at all; there have also been no human cases reported (except for Beijing, which had no positives but 2 confirmed human cases). It will be interesting to see an updated analysis of the obtained data and to reassess the preferable sites and species to be targeted in light of the results published by the American team, giving preference to quails and chickens. - Mod.AS
