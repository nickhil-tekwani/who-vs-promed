Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) acting director of infectious diseases, Andrew Redmond, said Queensland is experiencing a spike in whooping cough cases.

So far this year [2019], Dr Redmond said there had been more than 1500 Queenslanders diagnosed. Of those, 190 presented to the emergency department, up from 124 the same time last year [2018]. "This year across the state we've had roughly a 50 per cent increase in diagnoses of whooping cough, which is really terrible news," Dr Redmond said. "[It is] an unexpected and unwanted rise." The condition causes severe respiratory problems and can be fatal for babies.

Dr Redmond said more education was needed to improve vaccination rates in pregnant women. "I think a lot of people engaging in good obstetric care know about it, but not everyone knows about it," he said.

(Only 34 per cent of women take up recommended vaccinations in pregnancy. Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in babies up to 6 months old. Pertussis (whooping cough) is the most common fatal infection in babies under 2 months. 42 per cent of babies hospitalised for pertussis are under 6 months old.)

RBWH obstetric physician and director of women's and newborn services, Karin Lust, said babies with whooping cough often got very sick with terrible coughing and reductions in their oxygen that could result in problems breathing and feeding. "It's very tragic for families and obviously it is awful to see your child unwell, it is very distressing," she said. Dr Lust said getting the vaccination while pregnant was the best protection, reducing the risk of infection by 90 per cent.

"Whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy boosts maternal antibodies, which are transferred to the foetus through the placenta, providing some immunity to the newborn baby until they can receive their 1st dose of vaccine around 6 weeks of age."

The vaccination schedule changed recently, meaning expectant mothers can get vaccinated earlier, from 20 to 32 weeks. "It gives women a greater window of opportunity to actually have their vaccination so that they don't miss out on the protective benefits for their newborn baby," Dr Lust said. "Also, it actually will afford babies who are born premature a level of immunity as well."

A 2nd Washington Elementary School student has a confirmed case of pertussis, the School District announced [Mon 2 Dec 2019]. The 1st case of pertussis, or whooping cough, was announced Tuesday [26 Nov 2019?].

The Arkansas Department of Health requires students in the same school with a student who has a confirmed case of pertussis who have an exemption for the pertussis vaccine or no record of the vaccination to be excluded from school for 21 days from the date of exposure.

At least 6 students in the School District have been diagnosed with pertussis since last spring [2019].

The state Department of Health will hold a free whooping cough vaccination clinic [Thu 5 Dec 2019] in Indiana, Pennsylvania, after a rare whooping cough outbreak spread through 4 school districts in Indiana County, infecting as many as 45 people since August [2019].

Though there was one early case in the county in early August [2019], the outbreak spread quickly in the 4 school districts, sending staff scrambling to understand what whooping cough -- also known as pertussis -- is and how it spreads.

"This was my 1st experience," said Robert Heinrich, director of education for Indiana Area School District, which has had 6 or 7 cases of the disease, including one faculty member.

Penns Manor Area and Marion Center Area school districts -- which both border Indiana Area School District -- have had whooping cough cases, too. The 4th school district is Blairsville-Saltsburg School District, which straddles both Indian and Westmoreland counties.

The free, walk-in vaccination clinic will be administering the "Tdap" vaccination shot -- for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis -- from 2 to 6 pm [Thu 5 Dec 2019] at the Indiana County State Health Center, 75 N Main St, Indiana.

The state is encouraging anyone from 10 to 64 years old in the county to take advantage of the clinic, particularly anyone who is pregnant or works or lives with or around pregnant women or infants, who are the most susceptible to the worst effects of whooping cough.

But the vaccine's potency can fade after that without an adolescent or adult booster shot. That may be what explains the outbreak's spread in Indiana County, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the state for the Tdap vaccine at 97.6% for kindergartners and 99% for 12th graders, but a lower 88.8 % rate for the county's 8th graders. Indiana Area's 6 or 7 cases have all been of students who had previously been vaccinated, though they may not have been vaccinated since kindergarten.

"There does appear to be a gap for students there between kindergarten and 12th grade who are headed to college," said Nate Wardle, a department of health spokesman. "That could be a sign of where this is coming from." High school senior vaccination levels may jump because they are preparing to head to colleges and universities, which require tetanus shots, which means they would probably get the whole Tdap booster then, Mr Wardle said.

How it spread across 4 school districts is still being studied, Mr Wardle said, though some of the earliest cases could have been kids at the same movie, mall, vocational technology center, or some other gathering point. "We don't have any information as to what the exact cause was yet," he said. Mr Heinrich said Indiana Area has tried to piece together what put their cases in common, too. "We couldn't find a pattern whether it was a group of wrestlers, cheerleaders, or some specific building," he said.

Mr Wardle said the last outbreak like this occurred 3 years ago, during the same time of year, with a similar number of cases, and also among school kids, in Chambersburg, Franklin County.

The district has responded to each case with letters home to all of the students' families in the buildings where the students attended -- the district has had cases in 4 of its 6 buildings so far -- providing basic information about the disease and listing a contact number for the state health department.

The district also specifically reached out to the families of students who were either immuocompromised or not yet vaccinated to warn them again of the dangers of staying unvaccinated. Though state law says in cases like this the school district may exclude unvaccinated students, the district has not yet done that.

But once a student or the one faculty member was confirmed with whooping cough, they were told to stay home at least 15 days from the onset of symptoms, or for 5 days after they began taking antibiotics, which is included in the state law, too.

The district had all of the cases closer to the beginning of the year, but has one unconfirmed case still being investigated from just last week, Mr. Heinrich said. "The state told us it's not unusual to have a few cases every now and then around the state," he said. "But this many in this area is unusual."
