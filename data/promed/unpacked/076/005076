A total of 4 people died with an apparent bird flu infection in the city of Mosul, medical sources were quoted saying on [Tue 16 Jan 2018] after earlier reports this week told of the appearance of more cases at other areas of the country.

NRTTV quoted a medical source in the city saying that al-Salam Educational Hospital in eastern Mosul recorded 3 deaths with the disease, while the 4th case was recorded at al-Shifa Hospital in the western region of the city.

According to the source, medical workers raised alert in the city, especially with drugs needed to counter the disease short of demand. He warned that the situation makes more deaths possible.

Sot Aliraq said one of the deceased was an Islamic State member in custody. Last [Thu 11 Jan 2018], Iraqi agriculture minister Falah Hassan declared that a poultry farm caught the infection in Babil province, days after another infection focus in Diyala province was brought under control.

Last [Mon 15 Jan 2018], the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health confirmed the reporting about Diyala, saying that the infection killed 7250 out of 43 000 birds.

[Avian influenza A(H5N8) viruses have been rapidly spreading, most likely via wild migratory birds in Asia and Europe in recent months, and causing deaths in wild birds and outbreaks in domestic poultry. During 2014, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage were detected in wild birds and poultry in China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The virus was then detected in North America in late 2014 and was detected sporadically in Canada and the United States of America (USA) in wild birds and poultry until mid-2015. A(H5N8) viruses were also detected in Taiwan, China and in Hungary and Sweden in 2015.

Since June 2016, countries in both Europe and Asia have detected infections in wild birds and/or domestic poultry with A(H5N8) including Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, Netherlands, Poland, Russian Federation and Switzerland. Many of these recent detections were associated with mortality in wild birds. Further spread along the migratory route of wild birds is likely, and introduction into other countries could occur. There have been poultry outbreaks in northern Iraq with influenza A/H5N8 as reported on ProMED recently: Avian influenza (12): Iraq (BB) HPAI H5N8, poultry, spread 20180113.5557315.

Although the likelihood is low, human infection with the A(H5N8) viruses cannot be excluded, based on the limited information available to date. It should be noted that human infection with A(H5N6) of related clade 2.3.4.4 has already occurred (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH5N8_201611/en/). However, there are limited reports of human cases with the Influenza A/H5N8 thus far (Ref. archives below).

The report mentions 3 deaths but the clinical presentation in these cases or their epidemiological linkage to poultry deaths has not been mentioned. Whether these cases occurred in isolation or are related to increased hospitalizations and morbidity due to seasonal influenza also bears consideration. Further information on the laboratory tests carried out on these cases, contact tracing and any protective measures for personnel working on the infected poultry farms would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA]

[The following concise assessment and general overview regarding H5N8 HPAI has been recently phrased by FAO experts: "Since October 2016, H5N8 HPAI has been spreading globally, mostly along wild birds' migratory routes, affecting, at least, 90 species of wild birds and/or domestic birds in 53 countries in Asia (n=12), Europe (n=30), America (n=2) and Africa (n=9). During the end of 2017, compared with the same period of 2016, the number of infections with the virus seems to decrease, but it has spread to 3 new countries (Cyprus, Saudi Arabia and Iran). In particular, in the last 3 months (November 2017--January 2018), it has been detected in South Africa, in Europe (Italy and the Russian Federation) and, recently, in Western (Saudi Arabia and Iraq) and Southern (Iran and India) Asia. More details on the source and circulation of the virus in the last affected Asian countries are needed. Further spread of H5N8 HPAI can be expected within the affected countries and in the neighboring ones". - Mod.AS
