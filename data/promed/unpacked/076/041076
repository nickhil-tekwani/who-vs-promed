Jewish Autonomous Region deluged with encephalitis ticks
---------------------------------------------
An unheard-of number of encephalitis ticks is registered this year in the
Jewish Autonomous Region, including environs of Birabidzhan, the
capital of the autonomous region, the chief of the regional sanitary and
epidemiological service said here on Thursday.
He said that 15 out of every 100 ticks are disease carriers. These data are
corroborated by thorough investigations.
The sanitary service takes emergency measures to lessen infection risks.
Areas around summer health-building camps for children were treated with
special preparations. The service stepped up explanatory work among the
population on preventive measures.
Regional medical centres were already visited by 27 people, complaining
about tick bites. Luckily, there were no cases of contracting encephalitis
so far. As many as 25 people suffered from bites of encephalitis ticks in
the region last year [1998. Eight of the total died.
Anti-encephalitis inoculations were given to 25 000 people last winter --
nearly four times as many as last year.

[The Jewish Autonomous Region of Russia has a population of
approximately 86 000. It is 6011 km east of Moscow and 619 km
from Vladivostok on the Japan Sea. It's located north of the
Chinese border, and is 1341 kms from Seoul, South Korea.
They are most likely referring to Russian Spring-Summer
Encephalitis (RSSE), caused by a flavivirus that shares antigens
with the viruses causing louping ill of sheep [Europe, Omsk
hemorrhagic fever [Russia and Kyasanur Forest disease [India,
but not Japanese Encephalitis. The vector in the eastern part of the
former USSR is _Ixodes persulcatus_. The natural hosts are small
wild animals, predominantly rodents. The larval and nymphal ticks
feed on small rodents and then when mature feed on larger
mammals including man. RSSE is seasonal with spring and early
summer being the peak periods for human disease - MPP
