More than 1300 individuals, including children, fell ill across 16 districts of Jharkhand after taking medication given under the Mass Drugs Administration (MDA) campaign for elimination of filariasis. The health department had launched a 6-day MDA programme (from 10 to 16 Apr 2019) to vaccinate 2.36 crore [23.6 million] people in filariasis-affected districts in order to eliminate the disease from the state by 2020.

The reports that reached the state headquarters from different districts said that 1308 people fell ill after consuming the MDA campaign drugs in 4 days, of which 433 cases were reported in Gumla district alone. In West Singhbhum, 304 cases were reported, 148 in Hazaribagh, and 117 in Sahibganj.

Jharkhand nodal officer of Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, Dr. Vijay Natha Khanna, on Sunday [14 Apr 2019] said, "Reaction of drugs is natural. The drugs would react on those who have filarial parasite in their body. As the drug kills the parasite, it triggers complications like fever, vomiting and headache. So it is not a serious health problem," he said.

However, rattled by the complications to children after MDA, villagers attacked health personnel involved in the MDA campaign in different parts of the state. On Saturday [13 Apr 2019], irate villagers of Panchgarh village under Borio block of Sahibganj district attacked female health staff members [GS] and [RD] after the condition of a 5-year-old boy [SK] deteriorated.

However, the district malaria officer (Sahibganj) Dr. Vijay Hansda and official Satibabu rescued the health staff from the angry villagers and admitted the boy at Sadar Hospital on Saturday night [13 Apr 2019]. After the incident, 2800 health personnel of Sahibganj, involved in campaign, are now fearful about administering drugs to children.

"We have already constituted rapid response teams (RRTs) in all the 9 blocks of the district. Whenever a complaint comes from any corner of district, an RRT reaches there and takes the affected person to the hospital," said Dr. Hansda.

A supervisor of the campaign, engaged in Gumla district, said that sahiyas (assistants) and sevikas (helpers) were having a tough time at Aanganwadi Kendras, trying to convince people to take the filariasis vaccine.

[It is well known that drugs can trigger an allergic reaction when the microfilariae in the skin die after treatment. This is most common with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and less common with ivermectin. No information on the drugs used is provided here. - Mod.EP
