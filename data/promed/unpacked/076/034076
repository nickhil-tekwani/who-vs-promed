India (Punjab): Outbreak of Jaundice spreads in Khanna
------------------------------------------------------
A outbreak of jaundice has affected some areas of Uttam Nagar, with
about 65 cases of jaundice being detected today by a team of Health
Department officials. 40 percent of the patients reside in Streets
Number 2 and 3 of Uttam Nagar. The residents here say that some of
these patients had been suffering from jaundice for 4-6 weeks, and
were taking treatment from quacks, self-styled sadhus [holy men],
tantriks [also holy people, specifically those who practice the Vedic
tradition of Tantrism] or by tying a taveez ('sacred' thread) on
their arm.
The Health Team visited the area following a complaint made by the
area municipal councillor, Jitender Pathak. The residents had met
Pathak a couple of days ago and told him about the increasing number
of cases of jaundice in the area. Following Pathak's complaint, a
team of health officials led by Dr Ravi Dutt conducted a door-to-door
survey. Residents say that about 90 people are suffering from
jaundice in the area.
Talking to Newsline, one patient said that she had been suffering
from pilia (jaundice) for the last 6 weeks. "I do not want any
medical treatment. I believe in the taveez which has been given to me
by a sadhu who lives in our area," she said. "Many people in our area
have the taveez from him and they will get cured too." Another
patient said that he had been suffering from jaundice for 2 weeks now
and getting medical treatment for it. A 23-year-old who also lives in
Uttam Nagar said that he had been suffering from jaundice for about
10 days.
Uttam Nagar residents have complained to the area councillor about
the quality of water supplied by the Municipal Council. Pathak urged
the health authorities to check the quality of water.
When contacted, Senior Medical Officer Dr Purshottam Das Singla
confirmed that 65 cases of jaundice had been detected in the area.
"Only one more mohalla [ward] adjacent to Uttam Nagar is left to be
surveyed. Chlorine tablets have been distributed among the residents,
and we are educating them about ways to prevent jaundice too."
Dr Singla added that a report has been sent to the District Health
Officer about the outbreak. "All these patients had been taking
treatment from private doctors. People must take proper medical care
for jaundice, a water-borne viral disease. People must ensure that
they take clean drinking water." The Executive Officer of the
Municipal Council (MC) Nazar Singh told Newsline that water samples
from the area were taken 2 days ago and have been tested. "The
samples have been found to be satisfactory," he claimed.
Nazar Singh added that a team of the MC Engineering Department was
been sent to the area to check if there is any leakage in the pipes.
"We also checked today if sewer water had got mixed with drinking
water at some point, but such was not the case." The executive
officer said that chlorine tablets will be distributed in the area
soon.
Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Jaspal Mittal said a meeting of
municipal and health officials will be held soon to identify the
reason for the outbreak.

[The etiology of this disease cannot be deduced from the description
of the outbreak. Either or both of the enteric viruses, hepatitis A
virus and hepatitis E virus, may be implicated -- particularly if a
contaminated water supply proves to be the source of the outbreak.
Both viruses are responsible for an acute self-limited infection
characterized as acute hepatic inflammation, although hepatitis E
virus infection is the more serious, because women in late stages of
pregnancy are more at risk of complications. Hepatitis A virus
infection can be contained by vaccination.
Although the water supply did not appear to be contaminated at the
time of testing, an isolated fault could have occurred 4-6 weeks ago,
and the supply may now be pathogen-free. (The description of 40
percent of cases coming from 2 streets is reminiscent of the Broad
Street pump in John Snow's cholera investigation.)
The geographic location of the outbreak has been deduced as follows:
Ludhiana is in Punjab, north of Delhi, and there is a Khanna in
Ludhiana. As Uttam Nagar is the name of a neighborhood in New Delhi,
it may be that Uttam Nagar is also a neighborhood in Khanna,
Ludhiana, Punjab. - Mods.CP/MPP]
