[1] Egypt - 14th fatality

A [15-year old] girl has died of bird flu, apparently contracting the
disease merely by buying a chicken at a market, a World Health
Organization (WHO) spokesman said on Wed 11 Apr 2007. This death
brings to 14 the number of Egyptians to have succumbed to the H5N1
virus since it first appeared in Egypt last year [2006].
Most of the fatalities have been women or girls whose families were
raising poultry in the backyards, and having daily contact with
chicken or turkeys. But this victim's family did not, said WHO
spokesman Ibrahim el-Kardani. She is believed to have contracted the
virus 3 weeks ago when she bought a chicken at a market in Shoubra,
Cairo, while shopping for her Christian family's preparations for the
Easter holidays, said el-Kardani. "She thought she wasn't exposed to
chicken," el-Kardani said.
Egypt is one of the countries most affected by bird flu outside Asia,
where the outbreak began. The country lies on a main route for
migratory birds, which are believed to have brought the disease from Asia.

[Dr. Dudley has commented that: "I think that all but one of the
confirmed H5N1 fatalities in Egypt to date have been female. This is
a most interesting sex-bias statistic that to my knowledge is without
parallel in any other country affected by widespread outbreaks in
humans." - Mod.CP]

[2] Egypt - 14th fatality; treatment failure

A 15-year-old Egyptian girl has died in hospital of the H5N1 bird flu
virus, bringing the number of deaths from the disease in Egypt to 14,
a Health Ministry official said on Wed 11 Apr 2007. [The patient],
who was admitted to hospital in Cairo on Thursday [5 Apr 2007], died
of respiratory failure on Tuesday evening [10 Apr] despite treatment
with the antiviral Tamiflu and being placed on a respirator, a
Ministry statement said. Amr Kandeel, Director of Communicable
Diseases at the Ministry of Health, said the treatment failed because
the girl did not enter hospital until a week to 10 days after the
symptoms started.
As in several other fatal cases in Egypt, the patient and her
relatives denied she had had any recent contact with domestic
poultry, Kandeel added. Out of a total of 34 humans who have caught
bird flu in Egypt, 14 have died and 19 have recovered.
A 2-year-old girl from central Egypt is under treatment and Kandeel
said she was in a good condition. The Health Ministry statement said
[no one in] [the patient's] family was found to have bird flu.
The disease hit Egypt in February 2006 and did extensive damage to
the poultry industry and the economy as a whole. But the government
still finds it hard to enforce restrictions on the movement and sale
of live poultry.

Cambodia: avian influenza situation
------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 10 Apr 2007, the Ministry of Health in Cambodia has
confirmed the country's 7th case of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. It is the 1st case to be confirmed in humans
in Cambodia in 2007.
The 13-year-old girl, from Ponhea Kreak district in Kampong Cham
province, developed symptoms on 2 Apr 2007 and was hospitalized the
following day. She died on 5 Apr 2007. Samples taken from the girl
have tested positive for H5N1 at the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh.
Initial investigations into the source of the girl's infection
indicate the presence of sick and dead poultry in the village in
recent weeks and that she had consumed a sick chicken prior to onset
of symptoms. A team from the Ministry of Health, WHO, and the Pasteur
Institute are following up with close contacts of the girl and are
conducting awareness raising activities in the area.
Of the 7 cases confirmed to date in Cambodia, all have been fatal.
