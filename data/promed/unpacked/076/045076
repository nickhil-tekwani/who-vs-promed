Cattle virus threatens bull runs
---------------------------------
The Pamplona bull run and hundreds of smaller Spanish festivals are
threatened this year by a rare cattle disease, bluetongue virus, which has
led to government restrictions on the movement of livestock in Andalucia,
Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha.
Bullfight organisers have asked the government to exempt bull running because
of the bull's special status in Spanish culture. But the agriculture
ministry insisted yesterday that the restrictions would remain in place as
long as necessary. They would be reassessed at the end of [March 2005].
Its spokeswoman said: "It's still early to talk about what might happen in
July. We have to hope the situation improves, and it is already changing a
lot. But our 1st priority is the health of livestock."
Breeders have been warning of a potential problem since the controls were
introduced in November [2004]. Julio Fernandez, a bull breeders' association
vet, asked the government last week to help organisers find a way round the
problem. He said: "Bullfighting has particularly strong roots in this
country -- it is 2nd only to football [soccer] in popularity -- so it merits
special consideration. All we are asking for from the government is a bit of
common sense. It should be possible for bull runs to take place while also
making sure that the problem doesn't spread."
Tens of thousands of people travel to the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in
the 2nd week of July each year. For a week the town is overrun by a non-stop
street party and the air filled with music, fireworks and cheap wine sprayed
from leather bottles. Every morning at 8 am the 6 bulls that will fight that
afternoon run half a mile through the narrow, twisting streets to the
bullring. Some festival-goers run alongside them while others watch from
behind stout wooden barriers. Every year there are injuries, and often
deaths, as the bulls, weighing up to half a ton, crash into spectators and
trample or gore the runners.
Bluetongue virus is spread by mosquitoes [sic; see comment] and can affect
both sheep and cattle. [Generally, Bluetongue in cattle -- contrary to sheep -
- is clinically inapparent, though viremia can reach high levels. Cattle play
a major role in the epidemiology of the disease: the vector arthropods become
infected mainly by feeding on viremic bovines. - Mod.AS] The current outbreak
arrived in Spain from Morocco.
Although Pamplona is hundreds of miles from the restriction areas, all the
bulls booked to fight at this year's festival are affected by the
restrictions.
Manuel Cases, vice-president of the Association for the Defence of Animal
Rights, which holds a protest human run at Pamplona, welcomed the prospect of
a cancellation.

[According to the last weekly report (26 Feb 2005) of EU's Animal Disease
Notification System (ADNS), no outbreaks of Bluetongue have been reported
from Spain since 3 Jan 2005. The animal (large and small ruminants) movement
restrictions implemented by the Spanish authorities might be in line with the
prescribed OIE Code and the EU requirements, but their actual impact is
debatable. The virus is spread mainly by windborne movements of the vectors,
namely midges of the genus _Culicoides_ (not by mosquitoes, as erroneously
indicated in the press item). _Culicoides_ are not active during the cool
winter months. Movements of (even viremic) animals into a "non-receptive"
environment (where the vector is absent or seasonally inactive) do not
represent a significant hazard.
Spain suffered a serious outbreak of another animal disease caused by another
member of the orbivirus genus, namely African Horse Sickness, which is also
transmitted by _Culicoides_, in 1990. The bitter memories of that experience
might play some (subconscious?) role in the severity of the currently adopted
measures. - Mod.AS]
