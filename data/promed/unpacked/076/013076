The H5N1 avian influenza virus in humans has evolved into 2 separate
strains, a development that will complicate the search for a vaccine and
the prevention of a pandemic, U.S. researchers reported on Mon [20 Mar 2006].
The genetic diversification of the pool of H5N1 avian influenza viruses
with the potential to cause a human influenza pandemic heightens the need
for careful surveillance, researchers said at the International Conference
on Emerging Infectious Diseases in Atlanta.
"Back in 2003 we only had one genetically distinct population of H5N1 with
the potential to cause a human pandemic. Now we have 2," said Rebecca
Garten of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who
helped conduct the study. One of the 2 strains, or clades, made people sick
in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand in 2003 and 2004 and the 2nd, a cousin of
the 1st, caused the disease in people in Indonesia in 2005.
2 clades may share the same ancestor but are genetically distinct -- as are
different clades, or strains, of the AIDS virus, the team from the CDC
found. "This does complicate vaccine development. But we are moving very
swiftly to develop vaccines against this new group of viruses," said Dr.
Nancy Cox, chief of the CDC's influenza branch.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has spread across Europe, Africa and parts of
Asia and killed nearly 100 people worldwide and infected about 180 since it
reemerged in 2003. Although it is difficult to catch bird flu, people can
become infected if they come into close contact with infected birds.
Scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that could pass easily
between humans, triggering a pandemic in which millions could die.
All influenza viruses mutate easily, and H5N1 appears to be no exception.
But Cox said the evolution of a 2nd clade does not move the virus closer to
human-to-human transmission. "Like the group one or clade one viruses, the
group 2 or clade 2 viruses are not easily transmitted from person to
person," she said. "It really doesn't take us closer to a pandemic. It
simply makes preparing for the pandemic a bit more difficult."
The U.S. Health and Human Services Department has already recognized the 2
strains and approved the development of a 2nd H5N1 vaccine based on the 2nd
clade. Several companies are working on H5N1 vaccines experimentally,
although current formulations are not expected to protect very well, if at
all, against any pandemic strain. A vaccine against a pandemic flu strain
would have to be formulated using the actual virus passing from person to
person.
Researchers said while vaccines were needed against different strains of
the virus, a vaccination against one clade could provide partial protection
against another. "We would expect the priming (of a patient) with a clade
one (vaccine) could potentially reduce the severity of disease," Cox said.
For their study, Garten and colleagues analyzed more than 300 H5N1 virus
samples taken from both infected birds and people from 2003 through the
summer of 2005. Garten said the bird flu strains being detected in Europe
were generally clade 2 strains.

[The term "clade" is derived from the style of presentation of phylogenetic
data, which are most conveniently presented in the form of trees consisting
of 2 elements; nodes and branches. A branch is a line which connects 2
nodes. Nodes can be external (the tips of the branches) or internal
(representing the common ancestor of 2 nodes) A cladogram shows only the
branching order of nodes, and the lengths of the branches contain no
information. All of the descendents of a common ancestor represented by a
common node belong to the same clade. A clade is a monphyletic group.
A phylogram, on the other hand, displays both branching order and distance
information, where distance provides an indication of the number of amino
acid changes (or nucleotide substitutions) from the ancestral node (i.e.
giving an indication of the extent of relative evolution from a common
node). - Mod.CP]
