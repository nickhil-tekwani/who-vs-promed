A new case of resistance to DMI (demethylation inhibitor; Group 3) fungicides has been found in Western Australian barley for the net form of net blotch. The new fungal strain from samples collected near Esperance has a higher level of DMI resistance than previous strains detected in WA between 2013 and 2016.

The new strain may not be limited to the Esperance area and additional samples from elsewhere in WA are being tested. Australian agricultural production is becoming increasingly dependent on DMI fungicides. The emergence of the new strain highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring of fungal populations in grain crops. Growers are advised to implement integrated disease management to improve net blotch control, as overuse of fungicides is known to increase the risk of new resistant fungal populations to appear.

[Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to yield losses of up to 20 per cent. There are 2 types of the fungus, the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_ and the spot type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between seasons on barley residues, volunteer barley plants, some grasses and seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed and use of resistant cultivars. Highly aggressive new strains of the net form are emerging worldwide.

As stated above, integrated disease management including varying crop cultivars in time and space, as well as rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides, is vital to extend the useful life of any of the compounds.

In Australia, net blotch is considered an emerging threat to southern barley producing areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20100323.0921).
