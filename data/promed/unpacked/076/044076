According to the Arizona Department of Health Services, 6414 cases of Valley fever were reported in the state as of 27 Aug 2019. In 2018, the number of cases reported through August 2018 was 5260. The total for the year, according to AZDHS [Arizona Department of Health Services], was 7478.

"This year [2019] we have higher numbers of cases reported already to the Department of Health, almost maybe a 30 percent increase," said Dr. Fariba Donovan, an assistant professor in the University of Arizona's College of Medicine. From her office at the UA Valley Fever Center for Excellence, Dr. Donovan explained there are several things that could play a role in the increase of reported cases: "People who work in the very large construction areas or maybe the dry season, lesser amount of rain," said Dr. Donovan. "Digging the ground to plant the beautiful plants here sometimes puts you at risk."

About 60 percent of people may never show symptoms or know they have it, said Dr. Donovan. According to the AZDHS, the 40 percent of people who are infected will develop symptoms such as: Cough; Fever; Exhaustion; Rash; Chest pain; Night sweats; Joint pain; Muscle aches; Headaches; Weight loss; and Lack of appetite. Some symptoms can last for weeks or even months. Most people with symptoms will get better without treatment. However, some people may develop severe forms of the disease.

Less than a year ago, the University of Arizona and Banner Health teamed up to create a new set of guidelines to help doctors look for symptoms of valley fever. The VFCE [Valley Fever Center for Excellence]'s plan includes one-on-one training for doctors at all Banner Health clinics across Arizona to get rid of a possible delay in diagnosis. Dr. Donovan said that program could also play a role in the increase of reported cases.

[Coccidioidomycosis is due to _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches (5 to 20 cm) of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. Coccidioidomycosis occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada, Utah, and Washington State), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. If inhaled, the airborne spores can produce infection in humans, as well as other animals.

Reasons for increased cases of coccidioidomycosis can in part be attributed to increased reporting practices, climatic change (drought and increasing temperatures in the southwestern United States) (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), dust storms, soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and immigration to endemic areas of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
