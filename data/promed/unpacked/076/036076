Some suspected cases of bluetongue have been detected in Ogliastra [Sardinia], and the nightmare of bluetongue [BT] that affects sheep and brings farms to their knees is back. The cattle that presented signs of the disease [see comment] are housed in 2 farms in Bari Sardo and 2 others in Villagrande Strisaili.

Examinations are under way in the laboratories of the [Sardinian] Zooprophylactic Institute, but the results will then have to be confirmed by the national reference center for bluetongue in Teramo. They will be the ones to determine the serotype, thus formalizing the return of the disease in the Ogliastra area.

"We are waiting for the outcome and if it should be positive we will move as indicatied by the ATS [Agenzia di Tutela della Salute; health protection agency] to isolate the outbreaks and prevent the disease from spreading", explains the mayor of Bari Sardo Ivan Mameli.

Similar precautions in Villagrande: "On the basis of the results that will come to us from ATS, we will implement all the necessary health measures", confirms the mayor Alessio Seoni; "for the moment it is only a question of suspicions".

[It will be interesting to note if the cows found BTV-positive on the 4 farms presented clinical signs or were tested within the official serological surveillance scheme. BT infection of cattle is usually subclinical, except for infection with BTV-8. Certain species of the _Culicoides_ vectors (midges) have a higher preference for cattle than for sheep. Therefore, testing cattle may be expected to allow early detection of the (seasonal, regional) virus appearance. Sheep are clinically more susceptible than cattle.

The indigenous Sarda dairy sheep breed is known to be extremely susceptible to the BT virus. Sheep breeding is a main source of income in Sardinia. Information about the serotyping results of the suspected cattle will allow timely vaccination of the susceptible sheep population with the relevant vaccine strains, in case not yet vaccinated. Vaccination is the only practical way to diminish losses. Some previous BT epizootics in Sardinia were devastating.
