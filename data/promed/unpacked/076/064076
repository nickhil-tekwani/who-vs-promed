[On 10 Apr 2019, South Africa also reported an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in North West Province in the Zeerust area, just outside of the ASF controlled area of South Africa. See ProMED-mail posting 20190411.6414634.

According to the media statement from South Africa 's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Animal Production and Health, published on 11 Apr 2019: "The virus is endemic in wildlife in the ASF controlled area and specific measures for keeping pigs in this area are described in the Animal Diseases Act, 1984 (Act No. 35 of 1984), which also includes restrictions on the movement of pigs and pig products from this area. The farm has been placed under quarantine by the North West Provincial Veterinary Services, who are also doing follow-up investigations and applying disease control measures for this outbreak" (source: https://www.daff.gov.za/docs/media/African%20Swine%20Fever%20in%20North%20West.pdf).
