"Out of 1796 persons infected by the epidemic stomach disorders in Upper
Nile State,
141 persons have died," minister of state for health Thomas Abwal said in a
press statement.
Abwal and his senior aides said they were not yet able to diagnose the
disease whose main symptom is diarrhoea.
The area of Malakal in Upper Nile was declared closed Sunday because of the
malaise.
River steamer traffic in and out of the area was suspended.
On Wednesday, however, health officials said travel to the area has been
eased because the situation was now under control.
"People are now being allowed to travel in and out of the area as the
situation has been put under control," the director of preventive medicine,
Dr. Abdulkarim el Faki,
said.
He said 26 medical workers will be flown into the area and WHO has provided
necessary
drugs and solutions to contain the problem.
