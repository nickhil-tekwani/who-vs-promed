Doctors at the Charite hospital in Berlin say it is "highly plausible" Pyotr Verzilov of the Russian protest band Pussy Riot was poisoned last week [11 Sep 2018], although it is unclear with what or by whom. Verzilov is currently being treated in Berlin.

"We have no indication -- and this is important -- that this was an infection or metabolic disease," the hospital's CEO, Dr. Karl Max Einhaeupl, told reporters at a news conference in Berlin. But "we cannot say anything about the question of how this toxin got into the body. It's not for us to answer this question." He added although recreational drugs could cause such poisoning, it is rare for drugs to be used that way.

The Russian government did not immediately comment on the German doctors' findings. As National Public Radio (NPR) has previously reported, Verzilov's family and friends suspected he was poisoned after he fell ill in Moscow last week [11 Sep 2018].

Dr. Kai-Uwe Eckardt, who heads the Charite intensive care unit, said the substance that poisoned the activist -- which could have come from pharmaceuticals or plants -- attacked his nervous system, causing an anticholinergic syndrome. The doctor said symptoms include widely dilated pupils, high blood pressure and dry mucous membranes. (Verzilov's girlfriend, Veronika Nikulshina, also told the Russian news portal Meduza that Verzilov was having trouble speaking and walking.)

[Anticholinergic syndrome results from competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at central and peripheral muscarinic receptors. Central inhibition leads to an agitated (hyperactive) delirium -- typically including confusion, restlessness and picking at imaginary objects -- which characterizes this toxidrome https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Anticholinergic_Syndrome/.

Common anticholinergic agents should be more accurately referred to as antimuscarinics, as these agents do not generally block nicotinic receptors. They are typically responsible for 15% to 20% of acute poisoning admissions, up to 40% of poisoning admissions to intensive care units, and 16% of poison centre calls. "Anticholinergic" agents are diverse and can be considered broadly as being within 3 categories.

Mechanisms are listed on the left, followed by examples of each mechanism:
Predominant muscarinic antagonist -- atropine, scopolamine, hyoscine, benztropine and many plants
Muscarinic antagonist with other mixed effects -- antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics
Decrease of acetylcholine release -- carbamazepine, opiates, cannabinoids, ethanol, clonidine
Decrease of acetylcholine synthesis -- thiamine deficiency

Additionally, many illicit drugs produce the same symptoms described in the article: widely dilated pupils, high blood pressure and dry mucous membranes. Examples include marijuana, hashish, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline and psilocybin, phencyclidine (PCP), methylated amphetamines ("designer drugs"), inhaled dry-cleaning fluids, some cannabis products and other chemicals https://www.csam-asam.org/sites/default/files/pdf/misc/Howtospot.pdf.

Datura sp., a plant sometimes called moon trumpet, is known to produce these clinical signs. The clinical signs are often remembered as red as a beet (skin flushing, temperature), mad as a hatter (delusions) and blind as a bat (dilated pupils). An extensive list of plants causing those or similar clinical signs can be found at http://www.stclaircounty.org/offices/msue/horticulture/pubs/Poisonous%20Plants.pdf.

Thus, there are plenty of suspects potentially causing the symptoms indicated in the article. It is hoped there will be more information forthcoming. - Mod.TG
