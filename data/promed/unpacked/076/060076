Domestic elk continue to be slaughtered in Saskatchewan as federal
officials continue the attempted cleanup of chronic wasting disease
(CWD). Animals from 5 more herds will be killed after veterinarians
from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) discovered some
herd members were infected. That raises the number of infected herds
from 24 to 29.
More than 4600 game farm elk have been killed since March 2000.
Most of those animals have not been infected with the disease. The
only way to test for CWD is to kill an animal and analyze its brain. The
whole-herd killoffs are an attempt to stamp out the disease. The recent
batch of infected herds were discovered as CFIA vets traced animals
having left infected herds for other herds.
"Some are traceouts of traceouts of traceouts," said CFIA official Brian
Peart. CWD was brought into Canada in a shipment of South Dakota
elk that went to a Lloydminster area farm. The disease has been present
in that herd since 1990, but was only discovered last year. Animals
from that herd were sold to other herds, taking the disease with them.
Then animals from those herds were sold to other herds, further
spreading it. However, Peart said all infected animals discovered so far
have been connected to the Lloydminster farm. There are no
independent cases.
CWD is endemic in a small area of Colorado and Wyoming. It is part
of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) family of
diseases, which includes scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. Scientists are not sure how it spreads.
There is no evidence it is a threat to human health.
No cases of CWD have been discovered in Manitoba and Alberta. The
only cases found in Canada have been on Saskatchewan farms, at the
Toronto zoo in mule deer imported from Colorado, and 2 cases of
infected mule deer in the wild in western Saskatchewan.
