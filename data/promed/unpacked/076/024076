Pig illness in the south, agriculture ministry demands strengthened quarantine
-----------------------------------------------
In response to the recent occurrence of pig illness in the south, the
General Office of the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice yesterday [31
Aug 2006] requiring legally-compliant control and prevention against
transmission or expansion of the disease; requiring increased quarantine
dynamics at sites of production and slaughter; and resolutely implementing
the "four impermissibles, one disposal" for all diseased pigs: no butchery,
no eating, no sale, no transport, and safe onsite disposal.
Since June 2006, a pig disease characterized by rising body temperature,
redness of the skin, and rapid breathing has occurred in portions of Anhui,
Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces. The
Agriculture Ministry's notice requires conscientious implementation of all
control measures: emphasize improvement of disease control and hoghouse
hygiene among small and mid-size breeders (households) and breeding
districts; establish sound disease control systems; strengthen disease
surveillance and epidemiological investigations; promptly find and report
disease; promptly eliminate hidden risks for disease; be strict with
disease handling work; actively undertake appropriate treatment of diseased
pigs; carry out cremation, burial and other safe disposal of dead pigs;
appropriately select vaccines to conduct immunization work; promptly
control and stamp out disease; strengthen supervision over animal hygiene
production, sale and distribution; prohibit pigs that have not passed
quarantine from entering distribution or slaughter; strike hard against
illegal trafficking of diseased pigs and byproducts.

Personnel in the industry believe rising pig prices are closely related to
the recent appearance of an unidentified, high-mortality disease in the
Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian regions.
News obtained from the Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian regions shows that this
outbreak has caused large-scale pig herd deaths in parts of the region. In
the area of Nanchang in Jiangxi alone, nearly one million pigs may have
died [according to] incomplete statistics. With large-scale deaths of pigs
in each area, the existing pig shortage has expanded, causing pig prices to
rise substantially.

The sender/translator, Dan Silver, has kindly notified us that additional
similar references have been published recently in China, most of them in
economic articles and government announcements about general preventive
measures employed in a few locales in Hunan.
Any available information, including mortality rates, detailed clinical
signs and pathological changes, and -- it is to be hoped -- excluding
zoonotic diseases, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
