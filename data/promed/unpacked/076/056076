As of 14 Sep 2015, 11 equine cases of West Nile virus (WNV) have been diagnosed in 9 Colorado counties. The WNV positive horses are from Alamosa, Boulder, Broomfield, Conejos, Fremont, Jefferson, Larimer, Park, and Weld counties.

The incidence of WNV disease varies from year to year and depends on a number of factors, including the amount of mosquitoes. The West Nile virus can be carried by infected birds and then spread locally by mosquitoes that bite those birds. The mosquitoes can then pass the virus to humans and animals. Horses are a "dead-end host" meaning they pose no threat to public health but they can be severely affected by physical signs.

Important information for horse owners:
- mitigate the mosquito populations and possible mosquito breeding areas on your property;
- take precautions to develop methods to repel mosquitos from biting your horse;
- contact a veterinarian if horses exhibit clinical signs consistent with WNV so that a proper diagnosis can be obtained -- clinical signs include head tilt, muscle tremors, lack of coordination, weakness of the limbs, or partial paralysis;
- be aware that clinical signs of WNV are consistent with other important neurological diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpes virus so work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing;
- consult a veterinarian on appropriate prevention strategies;
- vaccinate your horses for WNV as it is a very effective prevention tool;
- protect yourself by using appropriate WNV preventive activities suggested by public health experts (see web sites below);

[West Nile virus (WNV), like eastern equine encephalitis, is preventable by a vaccine, as mentioned in the article. The 2 are usually in combination, so it takes a single injection to prevent these diseases. Admittedly, injection needs to be given an initial time and again about 21-30 days later. Then it should be given annually or every 6 months depending upon your location or the recommendation of your veterinarian.

WNV is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 percent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental US, most of Canada, and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans, and a number of other mammals. WNV is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is approximately 33 percent. Data have supported that 40 percent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus, vaccination for WNV is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.
