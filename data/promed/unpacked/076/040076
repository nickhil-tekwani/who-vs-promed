The General Directorate for Health (GDH) reported on [Thu 1 Oct 2015] that the number of cases of foodborne botulism in Portugal has increased to 4 confirmed patients and "2 probable cases under investigation," awaiting test results. The GDH also refers, in a clarification published on its website, that there is no record of deaths related to foodborne botulism.

According to GDH, of the 4 confirmed cases, one is a citizen resident in Switzerland, "that consumed suspect foods in Portugal." The "2 probable cases" await results of ongoing analysis by the National Health Institute's (NHI) Dr Ricardo Jorge.

"There is no public health reason to limit consumption of sausages and smoked meat, since the poisoning problem was only identified in a particular brand, cited above," the GDH. In a combined communication with the GDH, the General Directorate of Food and Animals, the Food Safety and Economic Authority and the NHI, revealed that "the origin of these cases of disease is associated only with consumption of smoked meat products (sausages) marketed under the trademark Transmontana." For this reason, it was determined that the "immediate withdrawal of Transmontana meat and cheese products from stores, distribution channels, and marketing" should occur.

Foodborne botulism is a serious acute disease and has been a reportable disease in Portugal since 1999, where fewer than 100 cases were registered in 2013.

[Although the neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases, a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness.

Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores especially in young infants as well as related to unsterile needle use in illicit drug users.

Botulism (http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/id/botulism/Botulism.pdf), or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus", the Latin word for sausage. - Mod.LL
