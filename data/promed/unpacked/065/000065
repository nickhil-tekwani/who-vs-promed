[Cyprus was the 1st country suffering clinical bluetongue disease in sheep outside the African continent. Since 1924, several severe epizootics have been registered. The severity of the disease reflects the susceptibility of the Chios sheep, Cyprus' dominant breed, to the bluetongue virus. This also led to the early recognition of the disease in Cyprus, though the BT virus circulates elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. On top of mortality in unvaccinated sheep, BT is known to cause debilitating effect followed by a long convalescence period and may cause reduced milk production in dairy sheep of susceptible breeds. - Mods.AS/CRD
