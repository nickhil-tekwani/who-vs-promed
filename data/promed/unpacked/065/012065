CFIA/Health Hazard Alert: Certain Raw Oysters and
Mussels Sold in British Columbia May Contain Paralytic Shellfish Toxin
Audio clips available at
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/relations/indexaude.shtml>

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is
warning the public not to serve or consume the
raw oysters and mussels described below because
these products may contain paralytic shellfish
toxins that can cause illness if consumed.

The following oysters and mussels, harvested from
Subarea 15-4, are affected by this alert:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Producer Product Size Lot code Harvest Date
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Albion Fisheries Ltd. Oyster N/Shell 5 dozen Albion Lot # OCT03/10
# 1906 Royal Miyagi XS 173668 & 173716
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Albion Fisheries Ltd Oyster N/Shell 5 dozen Albion Lot # OCT03/10
# 1906 Little Wing 173667
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aquatec Seafoods Ltd. Mussels Various Landfile # OCT04/10
235011
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taylor Shellfish Canada ULC Gallow Mussles Various Landfile # OCT03/10
DBA Fanny Bay Oysters 2405189
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These products were distributed to various retail
and institutional clients in British Columbia.
Also, these products may have been sold in
smaller quantities at some retail seafood
counters. Consumers who are unsure whether they
have the affected products are advised to check
with their retailer or supplier.

There have been no reported cases of Paralytic
Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) associated with the consumption of these products.

Paralytic shellfish toxins are a group of natural
toxins that sometimes accumulate in bivalve
shellfish that include oysters, clams, scallops,
mussels and cockles. Non-bivalve shellfish, such
as whelks, can also accumulate PSP toxins. These
toxins can cause PSP if consumed. Symptoms of PSP
include tingling and numbness of the lips,
tongue, hands and feet, and difficulty
swallowing. In severe situations, this can
proceed to difficulty walking, muscle paralysis,
respiratory paralysis and death in as quickly as 12 hours.

The shellfish processors are voluntarily
recalling the affected products from the
marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

["Red tide is caused by several toxic algae.
Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as
paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

PSP is a significant problem in several
geographic areas, especially in both the east and
the west coasts of the US. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus
_Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for
persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish; but they also move
through the food chain, affecting zooplankton,
fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve
large-cell accumulations that discolor the water
and may instead be invisible below the water
surface. Low-density populations can cause severe
problems due to the high potency of the toxins
produced._Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in
relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult
to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are
stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal
blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called
_Karenia brevis_, which in high concentrations
can make the water look red. The organism
releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory
system of fish and other marine life.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an
outbreak have kept people from beaches while
leaving others with irritated eyes and throats.
Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to
it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats,
and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for
personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide
poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Previously the organism causing red tide was
known as _Gymnodinium breve_, but it has been
reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates.
Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
_Karenia_ was chosen in honor of Dr Karen
Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from
the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, FL."
