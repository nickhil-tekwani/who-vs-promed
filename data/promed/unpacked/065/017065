I had previously undertaken an examination of literature on the likelihood
of transmission of smallpox in the exhumation of human remains, and
found many helpful articles, which I've cited and summarized below.
There are several other articles available that describe attempts to isolate
the variola virus in exhumed remains -- particularly in Egyptian mummies
-- but those articles are probably less relevant to Mr Vardas' request.
Wolff and Croon's work was already cited by the moderator, and
showed that scabs stored in envelopes -- at temperatures from 15C to
30C and relative humidities from 35% to 98% -- remained viable for at
least 13 years. The study was terminated at 13 years as Wolff and
Croon ran out of scabs; however, the number of viable viruses per scab
decreased significantly over time.
MacCallum and McDonald's work examined variola virus in scabs and in
raw cotton; they determined that scabs survived for a maximum of three
to four months. These researchers concluded that "the virus can
survive for many years, ten or more, at from 4C to 5C in enclosed tubes or
bottles, with little decrease in titre," but that the virus "in tropical
climates
-- i.e., at temperatures from 30C to 40C -- is unlikely to survive for as
long as six months." These results corroborated those of Downie and
Dumbell.
Fornaciari and Marchetti, using electron microscopy, were able to
identify intact variola virus from a sixteenth century Italian mummy. Both
their articles stated that attempts would be undertaken to cultivate the
virus from the remains, but I was unable to locate subsequent
references to determine if such efforts had been successful.
Kennedy discussed his work in exhuming remains in a Honolulu
cemetery; among those buried were victims of an 1853 epidemic of
smallpox. After a review of the literature, Kennedy concludes that "care
should be taken in the unlikely event that disturbances occur to
individuals with sealed coffins, and interred in very cool and dry regions.
Even then, however, the victim must exhibit scabs, and there would
have to be direct contact."
In discussing similar work, Zuckerman concluded that "it would be
prudent to immunise anthropologists engaged in this type of research
since inadvertent reintroduction of smallpox would be devastating."
