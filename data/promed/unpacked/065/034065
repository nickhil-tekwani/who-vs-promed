Around 250 cattle have been slaughtered so far this year [2019] due to tuberculosis [TB]. Director of animal health and production Avinesh Dayal has confirmed that the majority of the infected animals were from farms in the Central Division.

Dayal says that in the past, the ministry concentrated mostly on dairy farms, but this year [2019] is a bit different. "Basically, we are going Fiji-wide now, and we are testing both the large and small farms. This is just to see the spread and extend of the disease, and, basically, we can tell you the numbers on the ground." Dayal says eradicating TB will be a long process, and he's hoping farmers will support the ministry initiatives put in place.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease caused when bacteria attack the respiratory system. There are 3 types of TB: human, avian, and bovine. Human TB is rarely transmitted to non-humans; avian TB is typically restricted to birds (pigs and occasionally other animals have been found to be susceptible); and bovine TB -- or cattle TB -- is the most infectious, capable of infecting most mammals. Bovine TB is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_), which is part of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex.

Bovine TB is spread primarily through the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and uninfected animals. This transmission usually happens when animals are in close contact with each other. Thus, animal density plays a major factor in the transmission of _M. bovis_. Bacteria released into the air through coughing and sneezing can spread the disease to uninfected animals. Research suggests that bovine TB can also be contracted from ingesting contaminated feed. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is primarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of survival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging from 54-75 F [12-23 C]. In a number of studies under laboratory conditions, _M. bovis_ has been isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at 75 F [24 C] and 14 weeks from various feeds kept at 32 F [0 C]. Under field conditions, however, it is difficult to isolate _M. bovis_ from pastures grazed by animals known to be infected with bovine TB.

Bovine TB is a chronic disease, and it can take years to develop. _M. bovis _grows very slowly and only replicates every 12-20 hours. The lymph nodes in the animal's head usually show infection 1st, and as the disease progresses, lesions will begin to develop on the surface of the lungs and chest cavity; https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79136_79608_85016-99064--,00.html.

It is this extremely slow growing aspect of the organism which makes detection much more difficult. Fiji is wise to incorporate all of Fiji in the testing program. Sometimes it takes several tests, occurring over months, to weed out those infected but not testing positive. It is a slow growing organism.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

Signs
-----
Q. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately, and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

Q. How does TB get into cattle herds?
A: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 commonest methods of introduction are
- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or
- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.

The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.
