Around 20 countries where monkeypox is not endemic have reported outbreaks of the viral disease, with more than 100 confirmed or suspected infections mostly in Europe.

The outbreaks are raising alarm because monkeypox, which spreads through close contact and was first found in monkeys, mostly occurs in west and central Africa, and only very occasionally spreads elsewhere.

Below is a list of countries that have so far reported suspected or confirmed cases, in alphabetical order [all in 2022]:

Asia Pacific
- Australia on 20 May reported its 1st case in a traveller who recently returned from Britain. Another suspected case was also identified.

Europe
- Austria confirmed its 1st case on 22 May.
- Belgium detected 2 cases on 20 May.
- Czech Republic detected its 1st case on 24 May.
- Denmark confirmed a 2nd case on 24 May, a day after the 1st.
- Finland discovered a "highly likely" 1st case, Helsinki hospital district said on 25 May.
- France's number of confirmed cases rose to 5 on 25 May.
- Germany has confirmed 3 cases, with the 1st registered on 20 May.
- Italy has confirmed 9 cases by 26 May. It detected its 1st case on 19 May.
- The Netherlands reported its 1st case on 20 May. It has since confirmed "several" more patients, without stating the exact number.
- Portugal reported 9 new confirmed cases on 26 May, bringing the total to 58.
- Slovenia confirmed its 1st case on 24 May.
- Spain confirmed 25 new cases on 26 May, bringing the total to 84.
- Sweden confirmed its 1st case on19 May.
- Switzerland reported its 1st confirmed case on 21 May.
- The United Kingdom detected 14 new cases in England on 24 May, taking the total of identified cases to 70 [78 as of 25 May; see below].

Middle East
- Israel confirmed its 1st case on May 21.
- The United Arab Emirates detected its 1st case on 24 May, state news agency WAM reported. [The infection in this case was acquired in West Africa, not Europe]

Americas
- Argentina reported its 1st suspected case on 23 May. No cases are yet confirmed in South America.
- Canada has confirmed 15 infections in the Quebec province as of 24 May. The province's health department said more cases from other parts of the country were expected.

England records 7 more cases of monkeypox bringing the UK total to 78
- The UK has logged 7 more monkeypox infections, all of which are in England, health chiefs said today [25 May 2022].
- The additional cases bring the UK total to 78 since the 1st in the current outbreak was publicised on 7 May [2022].
- It comes as experts warned scrapping smallpox vaccine scheme has left Britons vulnerable to monkeypox.
- Britons were routinely offered the smallpox jab until the 1970s, shortly after which the virus was eradicated.
- Waning immunity from family of viruses may explain why monkeypox outbreaks becoming more common.
- Although not made for monkeypox, Imvanex jab is up to 85% effective because the 2 viruses are so similar.

Another 7 monkeypox cases were logged in the UK today [25 May 2022] as the tropical virus usually only spotted in Africa continues to sweep the world. The new infections, all detected in England, bring Britain's total to 78 since the 1st case in the ongoing outbreak was publicised on 7 May [2022]. Scotland has so far logged one monkeypox case, while no infections have been reported in Wales or Northern Ireland.

Officials stated a 'notable proportion' have occurred among gay and bisexual men but have not provided an exact breakdown. No gender or age details have been shared, either.

UKHSA's chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins said new monkeypox cases were being spotted 'promptly' due to 'extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks'.

[Please note that the press releases mentioned below, are available at the individual links in the original report at the source URL above.]

In Germany, the 1st cases of monkeypox were identified in May 2022 (as of [24 May 2022]: 5 cases, see e.g., press release from the Ministry for Social Affairs, Health and Integration in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg dated [23 May 2022]; press release from the Senate Department for Health in Berlin dated [21 May 2022]; press release from the Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care of [20 May 2022]), according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).

These cases are related to other monkeypox cases reported in May 2022 in various countries outside of Africa.

What is special about these cases is that those affected had not traveled to African countries where the virus is endemic (West and Central Africa), as previous cases had in the past, and that many transmissions apparently took place in the context of sexual activities (currently especially in men who have had sexual contact with other men).

As far as is known, most of those affected do not become seriously ill. Further cases are also to be expected in Germany.

According to current knowledge, close contact is required for transmission of the pathogen, so it can currently be assumed that the outbreak can be contained, etc.) or lesions can be included in the extended differential diagnostic considerations.

According to current knowledge, the RKI assesses the risk to the health of the general population in Germany as low. The RKI continues to monitor the situation very closely and adapts its assessment to the current state of knowledge.

https://www.ge.ch/document/variole-du-singe-premier-cas-detecte-dans-canton-geneve


Today [24 May 2022], a 1st case of monkeypox has been confirmed in the canton of Geneva. This is the 2nd confirmed case in Switzerland, the 1st case having been confirmed on 21 May 2022 in the canton of Bern.

In accordance with the recommendations of the FOPH [Federal Office of Public Health], the person concerned is in good general condition, not currently requiring hospitalization but in isolation, until the complete resolution of the disease. Preliminary evidence indicates that she was infected during a trip abroad. An epidemiological investigation is underway to warn people who could be exposed.

There are 2 new suspected cases of monkeypox and one probable case of the virus reported in Toronto on Wednesday [25 May 2022], bringing the total number of cases being investigated in the city to 4.

Toronto Public Health said all 3 of the newly reported cases are men -- 2 in their 30s and one in their 20s -- and they are "doing well."

One of the 3 men had traveled to Montreal and was a contact of the 1st suspected case Toronto Public Health said it was investigating in the city over the weekend [21-22 May 2022].

That 1st case involved a man in his 40s who had contact with someone who had recently travelled to Montreal. The agency said Wednesday [25 May 2022] that the 1st case was now considered a probable case.

In general, monkeypox does not spread easily between people and is transmitted through prolonged close contact, including direct contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, or sores.

Monkeypox is typically milder than smallpox and can cause fever, headache, muscle aches, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes, and lesions all over the body.

Health officials have said the risk [to the public] posed by monkeypox is low.

[6] Vaccination efficacy

Global monkeypox outbreak was 'waiting to happen': Waning immunity from smallpox vaccination drives discontinued in the 1970s means only over-50s now have any protection against virus, scientists say.

- Britons were routinely offered the smallpox jab until the 1970s, shortly after which the virus was eradicated.
- Waning immunity from family of viruses may explain why monkeypox outbreaks becoming more common.
- Although not made for monkeypox, Imvanex jab is up to 85% effective because the 2 viruses are so similar.
- Dr Romulus Breban, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said the surge was 'waiting to happen'.
- Professor Neil Mabbott, from the University of Edinburgh, said the under-50s are more susceptible.

Britons were routinely offered smallpox jabs until the 1970s, when the scheme was deemed no longer necessary because the virus had been beaten into submission [eradication]. Similar programmes were wound down across the world at the same time. Scientists say the waning immunity from the mammoth inoculation campaigns may help explain why monkeypox outbreaks are becoming more common across the world.

Although not purposefully made for monkeypox, the Imvanex jab -- made by Danish firm Bavarian Nordic -- is up to 85 per cent effective because the 2 viruses are so similar. Antivirals and therapies for smallpox also work for monkeypox.

Dr Romulus Breban, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said the current global outbreak was 'waiting to happen' because of the world's 'almost zero' immunity level. [Current cases] sparked alarm because infections usually only occur in west and central Africa.

Professor Neil Mabbott, an immunopathologist from the University of Edinburgh, told MailOnline over-50s are the only group protected against monkeypox. 'Although the level of immunity will wane in time, smallpox vaccination provides long-lasting protection,' he said. 'Some estimates suggest this may last for decades.'
