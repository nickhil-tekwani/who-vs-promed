A mosquito-borne virus is present in the Kimberley this season, says
the health department. Mosquito expert Mike Lindsay warned newcomers
to take precautions against Kunjin virus, which has symptoms similar
to Ross River virus.

Mosquito-borne disease risk in the north of WA
----------------------------
The Department of Health today [8 Apr 2010] urged people living and
holidaying in the north of Western Australia to take extra care
against mosquito bites, following detection of the mosquito-borne
Kunjin virus for the 1st time this wet season. The Environmental
Health Hazards Managing Scientist, Dr Michael Lindsay, said that the
Department's surveillance program (undertaken by The University of
Western Australia) had detected activity of Kunjin virus in the
Kimberley. "Infection with Kunjin virus can cause symptoms that are
similar to Ross River virus disease, such as swollen and aching
joints, fever and rash. However, in rare case, it can cause more
severe symptoms, including headache, neck stiffness, fever, delirium
and coma. In young children, fever might be the only early sign, so
parents should see their doctor if concerned, and particularly if
their child experiences drowsiness, floppiness, irritability, poor
feeding, or general distress."

People most likely to be affected by Kunjin virus are newcomers to
affected regions, such as babies, young children, tourists or new
employees, but anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical
advice quickly.

"Despite below average rainfall and relatively low numbers of
mosquitoes in most areas of the Kimberley for this time of year, the
surveillance results show that mosquitoes are still carrying
mosquito-borne diseases, so it is important that people living or
travelling in the north take particular care to avoid mosquito bites
for the next few weeks," Dr Lindsay said.

"Transmission of other mosquito-borne viruses is also continuing in
the north, with 13 cases of Ross River virus disease and Barmah
Forest virus disease reported from the Kimberley in the past 3
months," he said. "There are no specific cures or vaccines for
Kunjin, Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River or Barmah Forest
viruses, so it is very important that people take care to prevent
being bitten by mosquitoes." This warning is particularly important
for people living, visiting or camping near swamp and river systems
during the evening and night through the Kimberley, Pilbara and
Gascoyne regions. However, the viruses may be active elsewhere in the
north of the state, especially where mosquitoes are abundant.

Dr Lindsay said controlling mosquitoes in most rural regions of WA
was generally not possible because of the large size and
inaccessibility of natural mosquito breeding habitats. "It is also
important that communities prevent mosquitoes breeding in man-made
sites around the home or workplace because these types of mosquitoes
can also be disease carriers," he said. People do not need to alter
their plans to visit the northern half of WA, but it is important to
avoid mosquito bites by taking a few simple steps, such as:
- avoiding outdoor exposure from dusk and at night
- wearing protective (long, loose-fitting) clothing when outdoors
- using a personal repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or
picaridin. The most effective and long-lasting formulations are
lotions or gels. Most natural or organic repellents are not as
effective as DEET or picaridin.
- ensuring insect screens are installed and completely
mosquito-proof: use mosquito nets and mosquito-proof tents.
- ensuring infants and children are adequately protected against
mosquito bites, preferably with suitable clothing, bed nets or other
forms of insect screening.
