- Last week, multi-country outbreak responses were conducted, in Malawi and neighbouring countries, in response to the recently-detected WPV1 in the country.
- The activity aimed to reach more than 9.2 million children across Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique over the next week. It was the 1st of a series of multi-country, emergency outbreak response activities to be held in the subregion.
- Initial monitoring in the country indicates upwards of 94% of the target population was successfully reached during the campaign.
- GPEI partners were supporting local health authorities in their efforts, in particular also through local Rotarians across the country.
- UNICEF supported authorities in communications and social mobilization activities, including through organization of media tours, community engagement meetings, public service announcements and other activities.
- Commenting about these outbreak response activities, WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said: "In support of Malawi and its neighbours, we are acting fast to halt this outbreak and extinguish the threat through effective vaccinations. The African region has already defeated wild poliovirus due to a monumental effort by countries. We have the know-how and are tirelessly working to ensure that every child lives and thrives in a continent free of polio."
- In response to confirmation of the WPV1 outbreak in the country, the Government of Malawi declared the outbreak a national public health emergency and activated the emergency operations centre to coordinate outbreak response. Global and regional support from the GPEI Rapid Response Team are in-country to support planning, implementing and monitoring of response.
- The response plan includes at least 4 large-scale outbreak response campaigns with bivalent OPV.
- In terms of next steps: the country aims to conduct a complete analysis of this campaign, and begin planning for the next multi-country activity, including by implementing any corrective measures as necessary/lessons learned from the 1st round.

- Last week, Mozambique participated in the 1st of a series of multi-country outbreak response campaigns, in response to detection of WPV1 in neighbouring Malawi.
- The country aimed to reach 4.3 million children. The campaign was officially launched by the Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Dr Armindo Tiago, urging to "quickly vaccinate all children under 5 years of age, as polio is a serious public health concern and can be easily transmitted among unvaccinated children."
- A national emergency operations centre had been established to coordinate the outbreak response activities. Coordination across all levels of operations focused on planning, monitoring, health worker training, vaccine supply, and extensive communications and social mobilization to [ensure] high levels of community engagement.

Niger
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 17 cases reported in 2021.

Nigeria
- 3 cases of cVDPV2 were reported, 2 in Bauchi and 1 in Gombe, bringing the number of 2022 cases to 8. The number of 2021 cases remains 415.
- 2 positive environmental samples were reported in Sokoto.
- The 38th Meeting of the Expert Review Committee (ERC) on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization convened in Abuja on 14-15 Mar 2022. The group reviewed the latest poliovirus epidemiology in the country and put forward key recommendations.
- The group highlighted the need to urgently address the resurgence of cVDPV2 in the country since March 2021, noting that outbreak response is taking place under challenging circumstances of increasing insecurity in some areas, COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreak response efforts.
- The ERC underscored the need for increased quality outbreak response through advocacy at all levels of government, particularly at State and Local Government Area (LGA) levels, in fully implemented planned, large-scale campaigns (nOPV2 and also phased fIPV campaigns).
- The group also noted the need to minimize the risk of WPV1 re-introduction, particularly given detection of this strain this year [2022] in Malawi.

Senegal
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 17 cases reported in 2021.

Sierra Leone
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 5 cases reported in 2021.

Somalia
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There is 1 case reported in 2022 and 1 case in 2021.
- Last week, a high-level summit of stakeholders was held to take urgent action to end ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak and protect country from WPV re-infection.
- The Federal Government of Somalia and members of the GPEI recommitted to the effort at this high-level delegate meeting convened by HE Fawziya Abikar Nur, Federal Minister of Health and Human Services.
- The meeting affirmed their commitment to the Somalia Polio Eradication Action Plan, which focuses efforts and resources towards boosting population immunity, making concerted efforts to reach high-risk populations -- including inaccessible and nomadic communities and internally displaced persons -- to strengthen their immunity, enhancing the search for poliovirus circulation, and strengthening coordination among all stakeholders. Some of the strategies that will be deployed include intensifying efforts to offer 5 opportunities for vaccination against polio in 2022, providing routine childhood immunization in high-risk locations, where children have missed out on vaccinations, and strengthening community engagement.
- "In the midst of the ongoing drought, and while recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our stakeholders must not forget how important it is to contain the ongoing poliovirus outbreak so that it does not spread any further and does not affect any more children's lives," said HE Fawziya Abikar Nur. "On this occasion, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all our partners, and donors, for the immense efforts they have put into shielding millions of Somali children from polio over the years."
- Efforts are continuing to strengthen both immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity in the country. This week, for example, a technical assessment and support mission in Somaliland took place to strengthen both surveillance for AFP and measles.

South Sudan
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 9 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2021.

Tajikistan
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 32 cases reported in 2021.

Uganda
- No cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported this week. There are 2 positive samples linked to the N'Djamena outbreak in Chad reported in 2021.

Ukraine
- No case of cVDPV2 was reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2021.
- The GPEI is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country's health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care.
- A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio. While the cold winter climate of Ukraine is not conducive to polio transmission, undetected residual transmission cannot be ruled out, particularly as the surveillance system has been disrupted.
- The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.
- Immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from large-scale population movements.
- The GPEI is strengthening synergies with broader immunization needs for displaced persons, including polio vaccines in the package of health interventions and using polio surveillance to help detect other vaccine-preventable diseases.
- The GPEI is assessing the availability of IPV and measles vaccines in key areas; assessing cold chain capacity and potential impact on it due to electricity cuts; providing communication support for demand generation for immunization; and supporting proactive AFP and environmental surveillance in all IDP sites.
- In border areas, operational support is provided to set up mobile vaccination teams and ensuring safe and efficient transport and temporary storage of vaccines.
- In neighbouring countries (Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary), support is focusing on strengthening surveillance (AFP and environmental); registration of children; procurement of vaccines; increased communication to generate vaccine demand; and strengthening immunization in camps and refugee settlements.

Yemen
- 16 cases of cVDPV2 were reported, 1 each in Aden, Aldhale and Dhamar; 2 each in Alhudaidah and Aljawf; and 3 each in Amran, Marib and Saadah, bringing the number of 2021 cVDPV2 cases to 32 while number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3.
- Efforts are continuing to strengthen surveillance, particularly in high-risk areas, but security and logistical challenges continue to slow the movement of samples to laboratories outside of the country.

Officially reported WPV1 and cVDPV cases as of 29 Mar 2022

[2] Comment on cVDPV3 and OPV3
Date: Thu 31 Mar 2022
From: Prof. T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]


Regarding: PRO/EDR> Poliomyelitis update (14): Israel, RFI 20220331.8702310
MOH daily update [29 Mar 2022]:

Jerusalem and its environs:
6 "fully confirmed diseased cases"
1 "highly suspected diseased case"
All 7 are in unvaccinated patients.
There is also one "partially vaccinated" new case "under investigation."

My comments:
On 24 Oct 2019, WHO had announced the Certification of the Global Eradication of Poliovirus type 3 (https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated). The last case of polio due to wild poliovirus type 3 was in Nigeria, in 2012. Now 10 years later an outbreak of polio due to type 3 virus derived from oral polio vaccine is being reported in and around Jerusalem, Israel.

It is widely known since 1964, that among the 3 vaccine virus types, the most common cause of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) is type 3. The benefit-risk ratio of OPV type 3 became negative in 2012. Three years of absence is the norm to declare eradication; hence, from January 2016 the continued use of vaccine type 3 became ethically wrong. For some strange reason, VAPP is not counted, by defining it non-polio acute flaccid paralysis. The Jerusalem outbreak is a stark reminder that public health interventions must strictly follow biomedical ethics. The use of vaccine virus type 3 is to be stopped forthwith, globally. Once the source is clipped, the outbreak can be controlled with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). It is remarkable that all children with confirmed polio were unvaccinated.
