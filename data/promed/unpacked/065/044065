Outbreak of measles in Reims, January-March 2008 -- preliminary report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Outbreak description
--------------------
Between the end of January 2008 and 12 Mar 2008,
16 cases of measles were reported to the local
health authority in Reims in eastern France. The
outbreak has to date affected 9 adults and 7
children, aged from 7 months to 28 years. Among
these cases, 13 were biologically confirmed
(presence of measles RNA and/or measles-specific
IgM antibodies in sera and/or oral fluids).

The index case was a 20-year-old female, whose
rash onset was on 21 Jan 2008. She developed
pneumonia 8 days after the rash onset and was
hospitalised at the university hospital. The
source of infection remains unknown (she is
unemployed and did not report any travel outside
her hometown, contact with a measles case or
having any visitors from abroad in the 7 to 18 days before the rash onset).

The 1st generation of cases included her 2 sons
(aged 7 months and 17 months) and 2 young adults
in her family (21 years and 19 years old). All
these secondary cases except one adult were
hospitalised between 2 and 6 Feb 2008. None of
the 5 cases [had been] vaccinated against measles.

The 2nd generation of cases infected by
hospitalised members of this family cluster
included 3 persons: a 25-year-old unvaccinated
nurse who worked in the ward to which one of the
secondary cases was admitted; a 22-year-old
unvaccinated medical student who took care of the
2 hospitalised children (precautions around the 2
boys, although not fully adapted, had been taken
and had been respected); and a 4-year-old girl
who was admitted to the hospital emergency room
while the 2 children were patients in a nearby
ward. This child stayed in the paediatric surgery
department for 3 weeks and developed a rash on 21
Feb 2008. As the diagnosis was made only on the
day she was released, 8 days after the rash
onset, no special precautions had been taken
around her during her stay. She had received a
single dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
(MMR) in 2006. None of these 3 cases developed any complications.

The 3rd generation of cases was related to the
child hospitalised in the paediatric surgery
department. A non-immune 24-year-old nursing
student, who had worked in the unit until 29 Feb
2008, developed the rash on 3 Mar 2008. Two
children hospitalised in the same department (7
years old and 11 months old) developed the rash
on 5 and 7 Mar 20008 respectively, after hospital
discharge. Both of them had received one dose of MMR.

Among these 11 related cases, 9 were
laboratory-confirmed. To date, the identical
genotype D4 sequences were obtained by the
National Reference Centre for the index patient and 4 other cases.

Another biologically confirmed case was reported
in a 27-year-old senior medical student (rash
onset on 5 Feb 2008) without any known link with
previous cases. Four other cases not related to
the cluster were notified in this period: a
27-year-old man (rash onset on 4 Feb 2008,
genotype D5) who, during the incubation period,
did not report any travel outside Reims nor had
any known contact with visitors from abroad; and
a 7-year-old child (rash on 2 Mar 2008). These 2
cases were biologically confirmed and no
epidemiological link could be identified. Two
other cases were considered as suspect: a
one-year-old boy, who had received an MMR dose 5
days before rash onset on 4 Feb 2008, and his
mother, who was retrospectively diagnosed with measles (rash on 26 Jan 2008).

Control measures
----------------
Around each case reported to the health
authority, contact people were identified and
their immunisation statuses were updated. A
post-exposure immunisation was recommended to
unvaccinated people if the contact had occurred
during the previous 72 hours, and the possibility
of an immunoglobulin injection was discussed if
at high risk for severe measles.

Staff members of the hospital units to which
measles cases had been admitted were advised to
undergo a serological examination if their
immunisation status was unknown and to update it
if necessary. Patients, possibly infected by the
2 staff members who had worked while contagious,
were informed and invited to contact their GP to
ascertain their vaccination status and to
complete it if necessary. Primary care
paediatricians and GPs working in the Marne
district, where Reims is located, were alerted
and requested to report all suspected cases of
measles and to test for specific IgM.

Discussion
----------
This is the 1st important cluster of measles with
3 generations following the index case reported
in France since the launch of the national plan
for the elimination of measles and congenital
rubella [1] and measles mandatory notification in July 2005 [2].

In France, the 1st dose of MMR is recommended at
12 months old and the 2nd dose between 13 and 24
months. A catch-up strategy includes a 2 MMR dose
regimen for children born in 1992 or later and a
one MMR dose regimen recommended for children and
adults born between 1980 and 1991 if not
previously vaccinated. Unvaccinated health
workers born before 1980 and without a previous
history of measles should receive one dose of MMR
if non-immune (absence of specific IgG),
especially if working in units hosting patients
with a high risk of contracting severe measles.
In the Marne district, MMR vaccination coverage
is estimated at 92 percent at 24 months old
(preliminary data of the Ministry of Health).
Measles coverage in health staff is, to date, unknown.

In this outbreak, both D4 and D5 genotypes have
so far been identified. In recent years, D4
viruses have been implicated in several major
outbreaks in Europe (in Romania, the United
Kingdom, Spain and Germany). D5 virus circulation
in Europe is rare and is often associated with imported cases [3].

This outbreak underlines the need to achieve
higher vaccine coverage among children, teenagers
and young adults. Although nosocomial
transmission of measles is well documented [4,5],
more awareness among health professionals of
measles diagnosis, appropriate infection control
practices to prevent transmission in hospital
settings and specific vaccination recommendations
for health professionals is needed.

[This report documents another instance of the
transmission of measles virus to unvaccinated or
partially vaccinated individuals in a health care
setting. It is significant in that a single
immunization was not sufficient to protect
children exposed to infection in the community or
in hospital. This outbreak reveals also that
despite a 92 percent level of vaccine coverage, 2
distinct genotypes of measles virus are
circulating in the Marne region of France, one of
which is rare outside of southeast Asia. The
report reinforces the necessity for health care
staff to be fully vaccinated for their own
protection and to reduce transmission in hospitals and clinics.
