Egypt: avian influenza cases
----------------------------
The Ministry of health and population, Fri 23 Jan 2015, is following the case of a 60-year-old woman from Western Province [Al Gharbiyah governorate] of Kafr El-Zayat, who is under treatment in a hospital of Tanta. In addition, a 5-year-old child from Asyut province [Assiut governorate] has died from H5N1.

The Ministry said that the total number of cases of bird flu during 2015 to date is 25 (8 cases recovering, 9 cases under treatment, and 8 deaths).

[Notes from Michael Coston's blog [edited]: This current streak of H5N1 cases in Egypt is unusual not only for the high number of cases reported (54 identified since mid-November 2014), but also for the number of pediatric deaths (4) reported since early December 2014.

Unlike the pattern in Asia -- where children are often the most severely affected -- Egypt has enjoyed a much lower mortality rate among children with H5N1, with many youngsters presenting with only mild symptoms. While the reasons aren't well understood, the clade of H5N1 circulating in Egypt (2.2.1) is different from the clades circulating in Indonesia (2.1.3.2) or Cambodia and Vietnam (1.1.2) -- which might account for these epidemiological differences -- as could societal factors, such as seeking medical treatment much earlier in Egypt.
