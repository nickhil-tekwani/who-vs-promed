Hundreds of Chinese students sickened by food poisoning at army base
--------------------
Food poisoning among students participating in a training program at a
Chinese military facility sent 222 people to the hospital, China's Xinhua
News Agency reported.
No deaths were reported in the incident in Tianjin, a port city east of of
the capital Beijing, and most patients were discharged Thu, 11 Sep 2003,
after a night in the hospital, the report said.
The outbreak was blamed on spoiled chicken and sausage served the day
before to students from 4 polytechnic schools who were on a 10-day training
program at the facility, Xinhua said. It didn't give any details of the
training. Doctors said most of the students had vomiting, diarrhea, and
fever, the report said.
Similar large-scale food poisoning cases are reported regularly in China,
usually blamed on lax hygiene or the mistaken use of industrial chemicals
in food preparation.
