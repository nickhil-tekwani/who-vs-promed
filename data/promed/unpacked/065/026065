The report of a another human rabies death in rural China is quite tragic, as is every case of this preventable disease. However, there are multiple points that were missed in the report as to several basic facts.

Rabies is not just "a 3rd world" problem. This zoonosis perpetuates itself on all inhabited continents with few exceptions. Clearly, human rabies prophylaxis is affordable, particularly through the use of dose saving multi-site intra-dermal vaccination by modern human tissue culture biologics.

Mass dog vaccination, not culling, is the safe, humane, and cost-effective method for the elimination of canine rabies on a global level. In addition, although bites are the most common means of infection, mucosal contamination is also a method for viral transmission. Oral lesions are not needed. Lyssaviruses can utilize receptors in the oral-pharygneal cavity (not the lower GI, given the harsh acidic environment present in the stomach of carnivores). Such pathobiological elements are the basis for the oral vaccination of free-ranging carnivores, which has led to the prevention and control of wildlife, particularly in Western Europe and North America. Moreover, proper public education of children, improved social media outlets for health communications, renewed advocacy, and local community engagement are necessary, particularly given the recognition of World Rabies Day later this month, on Sat 28 Sep 2013.

[ProMED-mail thank Charles Ruprecht for these comments on the cases of a Chinese father who contracted rabies by attempting to interrupt transmission of the virus by sucking fluid from the child's lesion. In particular, this moderator thanks Charles Rupprecht for the information that oral lesions are not a requirement for transmission of lyssaviruses, which are able to attach to receptors in the oral-pharygneal cavity (but not the lower GI, given the harsh acidic environment present in the stomach of carnivores).

ProMED-mail welcomes this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that World Rabies Day occurs on Sat 28 Sep 2013. - Mod.CP
