Flu pandemic remains moderate, easing in areas: WHO
---------------------------------------------------
The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus outbreak remains moderate and its
effects are probably closer to those of 1957 and 1968 than the far more
deadly 1918 version, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday [17
Jan 2010]. Margaret Chan, WHO director-general, also said the H1N1 pandemic
appeared to be easing in the northern hemisphere but could still cause
infections until winter ends in April. It was too soon to say what would
happen once the southern hemisphere enters winter and the virus becomes
more infectious.

"An event similar to the 1918 pandemic was feared when what happened was
probably closer to the 1957 or 1968 pandemics," Chan said in a speech
opening a week-long meeting of the WHO's executive board. The 1918
pandemic, known as the Spanish flu, swept around the world at the end of
World War One, killing some 40-50 million people.

Governments have taken appropriate steps this time to protect their
populations and will ultimately earn "the highest marks," said Chan, a
former health director of Hong Kong. "Though the burden on emergency rooms
and intensive care units has been heavy, nearly all health systems have
coped well." Populations should continue to be vaccinated, she added,
reiterating that the vaccine was safe and effective. In public health
crises, it was better to "err on the side of caution," Chan said. "I
believe we would all rather see a moderate pandemic with ample supplies of
vaccine than a severe pandemic with inadequate vaccine."

Nearly 14 000 official deaths have been reported by more than 200 countries
since the virus emerged in North America last April [2009], but it will
take at least 1-2 years after the pandemic ends to establish the true toll,
she said. WHO experts say the actual death rate could be much higher than
the number of laboratory-confirmed cases so far. Data on H1N1 outbreaks in
Africa were scarce, she warned. "We are concerned that some countries in
the western part of the continent remain susceptible to intense waves of
transmission," Chan said.

[More precise details of the current global situation can be obtained by
accessing the WHO weekly updates. The most recent update (No. 83) dated 15
Jan 2010 at <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_01_15/en/index.html> stated that:

"Worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities
have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009,
including at least 13 554 deaths. The most intense areas of pandemic
influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of North Africa, South
Asia, and east and south eastern Europe.

"In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic
influenza virus remains active throughout the region, particularly in
Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. In West Asia, limit data suggest that pandemic
virus continues to circulate widely with a number of countries likely
having already experienced a peak in activity prior to December [2009].
Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be the predominant circulating
influenza virus in the northern African and western Asian regions with only
sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.

"In South Asia, the northern and western parts of the subcontinent
continued to experience active influenza transmission. In Nepal, increasing
ARI [acute respiratory infection] activity and geographically regional to
widespread influenza activity was reported during December and January. In
India, overall activity may have peaked during mid to late December [2009],
however transmission has been regionally variable with a recently
increasing trend in the western states, active but decreasing transmission
in the northern states, and overall low activity in the eastern and
southern states. In Sri Lanka, geographically widespread transmission with
increasing trend of respiratory diseases was reported throughout December,
however activity may have recently plateaued.

"In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically
widespread throughout the continent, however, overall activity continued to
decline substantially since November [2009]. A moderate intensity of
respiratory diseases activity was reported in Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, and
Switzerland, however, rates of ILI/ARI [influenza-like illness/acute
respiratory infection] have been decreasing or have plateaued in all. At
least 4 countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory specimens
reported greater than 25 per cent specimens were positive for influenza
(Romania, Georgia, Germany, and France). The overall rate of specimens
testing positive for influenza fell to 22 per cent in Europe after reaching
a peak of 45 per cent during early November 2009. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus
continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European
region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.

"In East Asia, influenza activity remains widespread but continues to
decline overall. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but has
declined since peaking at the end of November 2009. Although influenza
transmission remains active and regionally variable in China, overall
activity has declined substantially since peaking during mid November 2009
in northern and southern China. In the Hong Kong SAR (China), influenza
activity remained stably elevated but substantially lower than a large peak
of activity during late September and early October 2009. In Mongolia,
rates of ILI have been elevated above seasonal baseline since late October
2009 but declined substantially since a peak of activity was observed
during November 2009. In DPR [North] Korea, geographically regional
influenza activity with increasing respiratory diseases trend was reported
during early January 2010. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant
circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to
circulate in very small numbers in northern China.

"In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones,
overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In
North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late
October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. Small areas
of increased influenza activity may be occurring in central and northern
Mexico.

"In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of
pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained
community transmission. This suggests that the level of population immunity
in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter
season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring
during the summer when the virus is less transmissible."
