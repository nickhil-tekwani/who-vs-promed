More than 1100 people have contracted salmonellosis from chickens and ducks so far in 2017, with health officials pointing to an increase in backyard coops as the cause. At least one of the cases has resulted in death, with nearly 250 others requiring hospital care.

"For one salmonella case we know of in an outbreak, there are up to 30 others that we don't know about," CDC veterinarian Megin Nichols said. Nichols also said that many people raising chickens don't understand the potential danger, and treat the birds like pets allowing close contact and access to the family home. But poultry can carry salmonella bacteria in their intestines that can be shed in their feces, which could attach to feathers and dust and brush off on shoes or clothing.

While salmonellosis can be prevented with thorough hand washing and discarding shoes used in chicken coops outside, some have taken to snuggling or kissing the birds. Nichols said they view the uptick in cases as a preventable health problem, and that the best way to protect against infection is to assume all birds carry the bacterium.

Salmonellosis is more widely-known as a food-borne illness, with more than one million cases and 300 deaths due to contaminated food recorded each year. There are no firm figures on how many households in the USA have backyard chickens, but a Department of Agriculture report in 2013 found a growing number of residents in Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City expressed interest in getting them. Coops are now seen in even the smallest yards and densest urban neighborhoods.

"I think it's really important to know where your food comes from, but I do think they need to be educated on how to do it safely," Dr. Stacene Maroushek, a pediatric infectious disease physician in Minneapolis, told the Associated Press. "There are things growing up as a farm kid you know instinctively, but city people don't know."

"It gets into their blood and it can get into organs," Maroushek said. "It can be much more significant in people with underlying health problems."

Multistate Outbreaks of Human Salmonella Infections Linked to Live Poultry in Backyard Flocks, 2017 (Final Update)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outbreak Summary - 1120 cases - 48 states - 249 hospitalizations - one death

The year 2017 is seeing the largest number of illnesses linked to contact with backyard poultry ever recorded by CDC. Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with salmonellosis. Live poultry such as chickens and ducks can be carrying _Salmonella_ bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness. As raising backyard flocks becomes more popular, more people are having contact with chickens and ducks - and may not know about the risk of salmonellosis.

These outbreaks are a reminder to follow steps to keep your family healthy while enjoying your backyard flock.
- Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where the birds live and roam.
- Adults should supervise hand washing for children.
- Do not let live poultry inside the house.
- Do not let children younger than 5 years handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry without adult supervision.

In 2017, CDC and multiple states investigated 10 separate multistate outbreaks of salmonellosis in people who had contact with live poultry in backyard flocks. The outbreak strains of Salmonella infected a reported 1120 people in 48 states and the District of Columbia

Total 1120

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 4 Jan 2017 to 22 Sep 2017. Up to 249 ill people were hospitalized. One death was reported from North Carolina.

Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings linked the 10 outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, from multiple hatcheries.

In interviews, 542 (70 percent) of 774 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started.

The outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_ bacteria with several DNA fingerprints : _S._ Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,[5],12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Mbandaka, _S._ Muenchen, and _S._ Typhimurium.

[Having a flock of backyard fowl can serve a number of purposes including home raised meat, fresh eggs and companionship, but care must be taken to avoid the zoonosis salmonellosis. The larger number of cases in 2017 may be related to an increasing number of households with backyard flocks but it is unclear if the denominator is known. - Mod.LL
