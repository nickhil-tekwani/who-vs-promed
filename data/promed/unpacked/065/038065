More than 4000 goats in eastern Jiangsu province died days after
receiving goat-pox vaccines, local authorities said [Wed 15 Jun
2011].

The goats in Rudong county developed symptoms of tearing and fading
appetite 2 or 3 days after the vaccination and suffered diarrhea the
following week, the county government said in a statement.

None of the common medications proved effective in this case, it
said.

Wang Qingyi, director of the veterinary station in Rudong, said
factors ranging from the vaccines' quality, weather changes, feeding
management, to a new pathogen could be behind the deaths.

The Jiangsu provincial agricultural bureau has dispatched a group of
experts to look into the cause of the deaths.

The provincial finance bureau purchased 60 000 vials of goat pox
vaccine in 2 groups from the Lanzhou pharmaceutical factory of China
Animal Husbandry Industry Co in 2011, of which 25 000 pieces have been
used.

Goat pox is a highly infectious disease characterized by fever,
lacrimation, salivation, nasal discharge, and eruptions of nodules in
the skin and can have a high fatality rate.

[The control upon the manufacture of animal vaccines in China, their
testing requirements, and their licensing and certification
procedures, as well as the control upon their application, has been
subject to discussions and concern for years. One of the early
examples was the Taiwan 1997 outbreak of FMD, suspected to be
connected with an attenuated live vaccine virus used in China. Later
published examples included avian influenza and rabies vaccines.

Internationally recognised requirements concerning the manufacture
and testing (safety, efficacy, stability) of sheep and goat pox
vaccines, as adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in
May 2010, are included in chapter 2.7.14 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual
and available at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf.

Results on the Chinese investigation concerning the current goat-pox
event, and updated information on the vaccine control and licensing
currently required in China, will be appreciated.- Mod.AS]
