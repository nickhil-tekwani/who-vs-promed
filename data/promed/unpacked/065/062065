---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(It is true that avian influenza activity has been demonstrated in
parts of Saudi Arabia. However, the Reuters newswire posted on Mon 26
Nov 2007, unaccompanied by the well-valued ProMED moderators'
comments, is more sensational than it is objective or constructive.
In the absence of a moderator's comment to clarify this
sensationalism and the unwarranted anxieties it may generate, I put
forward a few words.

Firstly, the outbreak foci are far away from Makkah. Riyadh is about
800 km (497 mi) from Makkah. And the pilgrims will have no access to
such places during their stay. This geographical disconnection,
enhanced by the desert ecology, forms a natural barrier that limits
further spread of the disease; however, it is ominously missing in
the newswire. Added to this, the authorities have put in place strict
measures to prevent transportation of poultry and potentially
affected birds outside the affected areas. Access to Makkah is
presently heavily restricted.

Secondly, the newswire gives an impression, a wrong one too, that the
pilgrims would be engaged in activities that expose them to
potentially infected birds while in Makkah. This is far from being
the case. To imply this, as the newswire subtly does, demonstrates
ignorance of the Hajj activities and cannot be described as
responsible journalism.

Thirdly, portions of countries like France, UK, and the Netherlands
have had avian influenza outbreaks without threatening activities in
other nearby unaffected areas. Presently, the risk of avian influenza
in intending pilgrims, due to the outbreak in the far away Central
region or the pilgrimage rites, as might be misconstrued from the
newswire is extremely low. ProMED, in order to protect its
established quality, should enhance screening of such newswires that
have the potential to generate unfounded hysteria. As a long time
subscriber to ProMED-mail, I want to believe this is possible.

[Dr Fagbo's observations, based upon his valued expertise and his
close acquaintance with the local Saudi situation, are much
appreciated. It may be concluded that the health hazard to pilgrims,
in relation to HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1, is
minimal if at all. Even if the disease appears in the vicinity of
Makkah or sea and airports, only those in close contact with infected
avians will be exposed to risk. Such contacts may occur in wet
markets.

There is, however, another zoonotic disease, which deserves attention
in the context of the Hajj, namely Rift Valley fever. RVF is
currently rife in Sudan; it has been spreading earlier this year
(2007) in other African territories close to the Arab peninsular. It
will help to obtain information on the steps undertaken by the Saudi
authorities to prevent its introduction, in particular by transported
ruminants for slaughter. - Mod.AS]
