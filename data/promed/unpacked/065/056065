The number of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections in Florida increased by 2 as state health officials report new cases of the bacterial disease in Pasco County and a fatal case in Brevard County, according to updated data published Friday, 31 Oct 2014.

The Brevard case brings the state death tally due to _V. vulnificus_ to 6, while the total number of cases reported in 2014 to date rises to 28.

Vibriosis ("vibrio") is a rare but potentially dangerous infection associated with swimming in natural waters, particularly warm bodies of salt or brackish water, or from eating contaminated seafood (usually raw or undercooked oysters).

Among healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Most _V. vulnificus_ infections are acute and have no long-term consequences. In immunocompromised persons, particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can invade the bloodstream from either a wound or from the GI tract, causing a severe and life-threatening illness called primary septicemia, characterized by fever, chills, septic shock and death. Blistering skin lesions accompany the disease in about 70 percent of the cases. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time.

These individuals are 80-200 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ primary septicemia than are healthy people. For this particular risk group, the infection carries one of the highest mortality rates of all bacterial infections.

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (as stated in the posting) that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ now includes more northern geographical areas, related to the effects of global warming. - Mod.LL
