Region since 1998.
Venezuela has been the country reporting an increase of the number of cases
(6), with the recent outbreak in the district of Guaranito, state of
Portuguesa.
Review of the data from Colombia has generated 6 additional cases to be
included in this update, despite the fact that they are not of recent
appearance.
The countries continue to intensify surveillance and promote vaccination of
all residents in the affected areas.
