Ukraine: Water-borne Hepatitis A Outbreak in Luhansk Region
-----------------------------------------------------------
KIEV: In the last 24 hours, 36 residents of Sukhodolsk, in Luhansk
Region,including 14 children, were admitted to a hospital in Krasnodon with
symptoms of hepatitis A infection. The press service of Ukraine's
Emergencies Ministry has reported that as of this morning [24 Jun 2003] 285
people are in hospital, including 61 children. The diagnosis of hepatitis A
has been confirmed in 192 cases (40 involving children). Doctors say those
infected are currently in satisfactory condition.
In order to localize and eliminate the disease, specialists from the
Emergencies Ministry, Health Ministry and Luhansk Regional administration
are taking measures to prevent an epidemic. The city of Gorvodokanal is
replacing its metal water pipes with plastic ones, cleaning its sewage
manifolds and pumping water from the basements of houses. The city's
residents are being provided with drinking water brought in by truck.
As reported earlier, the cause of the Hepatitis A outbreak was drinking
water infected as a result of the simultaneous breach of water supplies and
of the sewage system after a rise in ground water, followed by irregular
water service and ultimately pollution from the sewage water.

[Water-borne outbreaks of hepatitis A infection are now rare except where
there has been a breakdown in water supply and sewage disposal systems. In
these situations control of infection is best achieved by engineering
solutions. Hepatitis A is transmitted by the faecal-oral route. Person to
person spread is the usual route of transmission except where contaminated
food or drink may be involved. The incubation period is about 15-40 days
and the disease is generally mild. Asymptomatic disease is common in
children and severity tends to increase with age. Occasional cases of
fulminant hepatitis may occur but there is no chronic carrier state and
little likelihood of chronic liver damage. An effective
formaldehyde-inactivated human diploid cell vaccine is now widely available
and advisable for travellers to regions where infection may be expected. -
