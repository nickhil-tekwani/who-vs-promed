The official responsible for the La Paz Municipal Zoonoses Center
(CEMZOO), Hector Mencias, said that the country is facing a rabies
epidemic with an increase in cases in 3 departments [state of province
equivalent] and the death of 4 people due to the infection. "We are in
a national epidemic situation and the rabies cases are increasing,
unfortunately, in the large cities of the country -- Cochabamba, Santa
Cruz, and Sucre," Mencias stated. As of epidemiological week 28 (up to
17 Jul) 2011, canine rabies cases increased 115 per cent nationally,
according to the director of the National Zoonoses Program, Gary
Barrios. In 2010, during this same period, 51 cases were recognized.
As a result of rabies transmitted to humans by dog bite, in this
period [in 2011], 4 children died, 3 in Sucre and one in Cochabamba.
In 2010, just one death was registered -- an adult in Oruro.

According to the records of the National Zoonoses Program, the
Cochabamba department has 40 canine rabies cases, Santa Cruz 38, Sucre
21, La Paz 4, Beni 4, Potosi 2, and Tarija one. In Oruro and Pando
there has been no rabies incidence.

The responsible officials in the organizations we consulted agreed
that the increase in rabies is mainly due to the large number of
[unowned, stray] dogs in the streets and the sale of puppies less than
6 months of age, in which the disease is not noticed. "We have a weak
spot with the dogs that come from Cochabamba. If we bring a dog from
there today, it will get [clinical] rabies in September or October.
The rabies incubation period [in them] is 2 months," explained the La
Paz CEMZOO head. According to Mencias, to avoid the increase in rabies
cases, it is very important for owners to vaccinate their pets
annually against this disease.

[The occurrence of rabies in Bolivia is more wide spread that
indicated in the previous report of 17 Jul 2011 (see ProMED-mail
archive no 20110717.2164). The 11 Apr 2011 report (ProMED-mail archive
no 20110411.1150) reported just one human case. Now there are 4,
apparently all of canine origin.
