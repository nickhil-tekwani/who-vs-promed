The potentially deadly porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDv] has been found on a 3rd farm in south eastern Manitoba. Manitoba Pork Council's general manager Andrew Dickson confirmed on Monday [6 Jun 2016] that the virus had been found on Saturday in a sow-weanling barn in the same general area as the 2 earlier cases, which were detected last Thursday [2 Jun 2016] and on 26 May 2016.

While sows and older feeder hogs can often recover from PED, that's not the case with young piglets, which almost always die. Dickson said it's not known whether there is any connection between this farm and the other 2 farms. But it is worrisome that the virus was found in a barn where there are young piglets.

Dickson said the latest barn where the virus was found has since been locked down, and the owner and the province are devising a plan for how to clean up the barn. He said a number of piglets in the barn are showing signs of the virus, but he couldn't say how many. "Hopefully, there is some interconnection (between the 3 farms) that we don't quite understand right now and that there will be no more (cases)," he said. "But we don't know. There are a lot of barns in this area."

The 2 earlier cases were the 1st detected in Manitoba in more than 16 months. There had been 5 others prior to that, between early 2014 and early 2015, and an undisclosed number of young pigs were lost. But since then, no further signs of the virus have been found on those particular farms.

[Since its appearance in the United States in April 2013, PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in this country. Infections with these novel SECD viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases.

Manitoba has had a long break without any cases of this virus, so clearly an investigation will begin on what is common to these 3 cases that could link them and help determine whether a new outbreak is to be avoided.

This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long lasting effect on the price of pork. We hope this is rapidly contained.
