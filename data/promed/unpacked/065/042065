This weekly report provides an overview of West Nile virus (WNV) epidemiology in the EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries during the WNV transmission season (expected to be June-November). Following a One Health approach, WNV infections in humans and outbreaks in equids and birds are included in the report. Visit the dedicated web pages for more information on WNV infections and ECDC's seasonal WNV surveillance.

Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
Since last week's update, and as of 20 Jul 2022, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries reported 17 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection and 4 deaths related to WNV infections. Cases were reported by Italy (14) and Greece (3). Deaths were reported by Italy (4). EU-neighbouring countries reported one human case of WNV infection in Serbia (1). There were no deaths related to WNV infection.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season and as of 20 Jul 2022, EU/EEA countries have reported 19 human cases of WNV infection in Italy (15) and Greece (4), and 4 deaths in Italy (4). EU-neighbouring countries have reported 2 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia (2) and no deaths.

During the current transmission season, within the reporting countries, human cases of WNV infection were reported from 13 different NUTS [Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics] 3 or GAUL [Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)] 1 regions.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, no outbreaks among equids and six outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries.

Outbreaks among birds have been reported by Italy (5) and Germany (1).

Sources
--------
Data on human cases are collected via The European Surveillance System (TESSy) managed by ECDC. Only locally acquired cases with known place of infection are included in this report. The following EU-neighbouring countries report human cases of WNV infection to ECDC: Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey.

Animal data (i.e. outbreaks among equids and birds) are collected through the Animal Disease Information System (ADIS) of the European Commission. Reporting of WNV in equids and birds is mandatory at the EU/EEA level.

The distribution of human infections covers EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries, whereas outbreaks among equids and birds covers only EU/EEA countries.

* This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

In Italy, from the beginning of June until 19 Jul 2022, 15 cases of West Nile infection were confirmed: 4 deaths, including 2 in Veneto (another 2 under investigation), 1 in Piedmont, and 1 in Emilia-Romagna. Furthermore, 3 cases are still being investigated in Veneto. This was reported by the new weekly bulletin of West Nile surveillance, published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, which specifies that "at the moment the number of cases is slightly higher, but in any case comparable to those recorded in other non-epidemic years, and far from the values of 2018."

Of the 15 confirmed cases, 9 were the neuro-invasive form (including 3 in Veneto and 2 in Piedmont), 5 cases were identified in blood donors (2 in Lombardy, 3 in Veneto), and 1 symptomatic case (Veneto). Another 2 cases reported today, 21 Jul 2022, in Paduan are cases of encephalitis: a woman, born in 1956, admitted to Neurology at the hospital of Piove di Sacco and a 49-year-old man, also admitted to Neurology in Schiavonia, both residents in the province of Padua Sud. In addition, 2 positive cases are not hospitalized (they are well).

The West Nile fever starts to be of concern. The deaths in Veneto due have risen to 4 even if the last 2 await official confirmation: 2 in the province of Padua, 2 more in Treviso. And the cases of contagion are spreading. So much so, that the Ulss 2 Marca [local public health centre] has already sent a letter to all the mayors of the Treviso municipalities asking for strengthening of prevention measures, also informing citizens of suspected cases in their territories. The situation is delicate, also because the proliferation of mosquitoes on these hot days makes everything more difficult. Starting with the monitoring of possible outbreaks.

The deceased
------------
Yesterday [20 Jul 2022], at the hospital in Schiavonia (Padua), a 77-year-old from Legnaro died. Already suffering from other pathologies, he had been hospitalized at Madre Teresa di Calcutta hospital since last Friday [15 Jul 2022] after showing the typical symptoms of encephalitis: high fever, headache, tremors, numbness, and loss of vision. The elderly man was immediately taken care of by doctors but the treatments were not sufficient to make him overcome the severe inflammation of the brain caused by the virus.

On 16 Jul 2022, however, the Treviso Public Health and Hygiene Service (Sisp) received the report concerning the death of an 87-year-old resident of Salgareda, also with previous pathologies and symptoms of West Nile encephalitis. The day before there were 3 cases registered in Veneto, with the 1st two deaths.

An 83-year-old from Piove di Sacco who had arrived at the emergency room of the Saccisica hospital 3 days earlier died. Immediately hospitalized, he was sent to the geriatrics ward where blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken for the diagnostic tests that were positive for West Nile virus.

A few hours later the Sisp of Treviso received notification of another death caused by probable Nile fever arbovirosis of a 73-year-old from Ponzano Veneto who died "following a neuroinvasive disease", according to Ulss 2. Confirmation tests were sent to Padua.

Also on 15 Jul 2022, another suspected case was reported concerning a 72-year-old resident of Cessalto, also suffering from other concomitant pathologies. The man survived and has already been discharged from the Ca 'Foncello hospital and is in good health.

The alarm
---------
If at the moment there are no other infections in Treviso, a 62-year-old intubated in Piove di Sacco, a 73-year-old from Teolo assisted in the ward in Schiavonia, and a 72-year-old from Anguillara have been hospitalized in Padua since Monday [18 JUL 2022] in the intensive neurosurgical care of via Giustiniani. In addition to these, there are 2 other suspected patients, still under investigation: one from Ulss 6 and the other from the hospital.

The disease also manifests itself in the animal world. There are 2 cases of West Nile among the equines of the Bassa: one horse is recovering while the other has an important neurological involvement. "If we consider the incubation times, which can reach up to 20 days, and the fact that less than 1% of infected people manifest encephalitis -- says Luca Sbrogiò, director of the Prevention Department of Ulss 6 Euganea -- it makes us understand that we are only in front of the tip of the iceberg."

And the Ulss 2 Marca has written to the mayors: "in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks, all citizens are advised not to abandon objects and containers of any kind where rainwater can collect and to empty them daily any commonly used container with the presence of water. Furthermore, condominium and building owners must treat the drains and manholes in gardens, courtyards, and outdoor areas of the buildings in a preventive and periodic form, with a suitable larvicide product in tablet form (the use of adulticides is excluded). The treatments will be recorded in a special register to be shown at the request of the persons in charge of supervising compliance with the provisions."

["West Nile virus (WNV) infection is a mosquito-borne zoonosis that is endemo-epidemic in Europe. The disease affects countries in southern, eastern, and western Europe [1-3]. The virus is transmitted among birds via the bite of infected mosquitoes and incidentally, humans and other mammals may become infected. About 80% of WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic. West Nile fever (WNF) is the most common clinical presentation. The elderly and immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of developing West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). No specific prophylaxis or treatment exist against the disease in humans."
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/facts)

"West Nile Virus (WNV) has recently emerged as a major public health concern in Europe, its recent expansion also coincided with some remarkable socio-economic and environmental changes, including an economic crisis and some of the warmest temperatures" in the region.

"Since 2010, WNV has been reported in 14 EU countries including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain; and has also been reported in 5 neighboring EU candidate countries including Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey, and Kosovo. In 2010, major outbreaks hit Greece, Hungary, Romania, and Turkey. Since then, outbreaks have occurred annually in multiple regions, including more northerly regions that had not previously reported cases, like Germany and the Czech Republic. This culminated in another major outbreak in 2018, that affected more regions than had been recorded in previous years."
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408625/)

"West Nile virus infection can be confirmed by virus genome detection or virus isolation. Viral genome is typically detectable in plasma from 2-18 days post-infection and up to 5 days post-onset of symptoms, although prolonged viremia (up to 35 days after symptom onset) has been reported. There is evidence that whole blood is the best sample type, with 86.8% sensitivity, while sensitivity is lower in urine, plasma, serum, and CSF. Requirements for sensitivity of assays used to depend on the setting, e.g. SoHO [substance of human origin] screening of population samples versus identification of clinical cases."

Regular monitoring of WNV activity with the integration of surveillance at the human-animal interface is essential for preparedness and response activities in future surges. - Mod.UBA
