[1] UK: (England) sheep, 1st cases
Date: 23 Jan 2012
From: Trevor Drew <Trevor.Drew@ahvla.gsi.gov.uk>

Following the emergence of Schmallenberg virus in some countries in continental Europe, enhanced surveillance has been in place in the UK, since the autumn of 2011. A number of samples have been submitted to AHVLA for testing for Schmallenberg virus as part of this surveillance

We have identified the Schmallenberg virus in some of these samples, submitted recently. These samples were from lambs born with deformities similar to case descriptions from cases in continental Europe. The location of the positive cases are the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and East Sussex, in the south-east corner of the country and this is consistent with airborne transmission via insects blown across the
English Channel, from countries we now know to have been infected last autumn. No cases in bovines have been detected.

Further details on can be found on our website at www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla

We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of scientists in affected countries in Europe and, particularly, the Fredreich Loeffler Institute in providing information on primer sequences and probe used for their diagnostic PCR and for making further sequence information available. Using this data, our own sequence analysis of the S gene and L gene of the virus detected in GB cases conclusively demonstrates it to be the
same virus.

We will continue to collaborate with FLI and other laboratories in Europe to ensure a rapid and coordinated approach to understanding the disease and its impact, the causative virus, risk pathways and methods of diagnosis and control.

Schmallenberg virus: update
---------------------------
On 23 Jan 2012 AHVLA [Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency] reported the presence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) on 4 sheep farms in Norfolk, Suffolk, and East Sussex. Last week [week of 16 Jan 2012] we obtained samples from animals with clinical signs consistent with SBV infection via our Regional Laboratory network. The samples were analysed at the Virology Laboratory, AHVLA Weybridge based on information provided by the Netherlands and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute [FLI, Riems, Germany].

Specific RT-PCR products were detected by 2 independent means from 2 different genes of SBV. Along with the sequence information we have obtained, all combined with the clinical picture seen, we consider this now provides a sufficient level of laboratory confirmation to conclude that SBV has been detected in GB sheep.

Schmallenberg virus detected in eastern England
----------------------------------------------
The Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been confirmed in the UK for the 1st time.

The new livestock disease, which affects cattle, sheep, and goats, has been formally identified on 4 sheep farms in Norfolk, Suffolk, and East Sussex.

Defra vets believe the virus was carried over to eastern England via midges from northern Europe, where it was 1st identified last August [2011].

AHVLA obtained samples from animals with clinical signs consistent with SBV infection last week, as part of its enhanced surveillance for the new disease. They were analysed at its Weybridge Virology Laboratory based on information provided by the Netherlands and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute.

An AHVLA spokesman said: "We have identified the SBV in some of these samples and as we continue surveillance we may find further cases.

"These samples came from the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and East Sussex. These counties are in the area that we had identified as potentially being at risk from infected midges blown across the Channel from the affected areas and we suspect that this is the most likely cause of transmission."

It is understood that the 4 cases in eastern England have been detected on farms that have started lambing. Reports from the Netherlands show that lambs infected with the virus in utero are often born with congenital malformations.

The disease first appeared in cattle in the Netherlands and Germany in August 2011. Clinical signs included fever, reduced milk yield, inappetence, loss of body condition and, principally in Dutch herds, diarrhoea, according to AHVLA. Herds experienced outbreaks of disease lasting 2-3 weeks, with individual affected animals recovering over several days.

Tests carried out on cases in Germany and the Netherlands identified a novel virus that has been named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). It appears to belong to a group of viruses that are spread by insect vectors, principally midges and mosquitoes, although the precise vector that may be responsible for transmission of SBV has not been identified yet.

More recently, from November [2011], the virus has been associated with reports of miscarriages and stillbirths associated with congenital abnormalities affecting mainly sheep but also cattle and goats, in northern Europe.

Risk assessments carried out by public health authorities in the Netherlands and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have concluded that the risk to human health from SBV is 'likely to be very low'. However, at this early stage of knowledge about the new disease, there are still considered to 'some uncertainties' and a risk to human has not been entirely discarded.

AHVLA is advising farmers and veterinary surgeons to take 'sensible hygiene precautions when working with livestock'.

The disease is not notifiable, which means farmers are not legally compelled to report it. Nonetheless, animal keepers are requested to be vigilant and inform their veterinary surgeons of any such cases. Stillbirths, malformations, or nervous disease in newborn animals or foetuses born to imported animals should be sent for screening to the AHVLA.

Farmers are also advised to contact their local AHVLA Regional Laboratory or the SAC Disease Surveillance Centre if they require further guidance or information.

[4] Russia: temporary import restrictions
Date: Wed 18 Jan 2012

Phytosanitary Surveillance) News [edited]

Mortality in cattle and small ruminants was reported on a number of Dutch, German, and Belgium farms, as the World Organization for Animal Health officially reports. Symptoms of the disease included fever, diarrhea, and drop in milk yields. Potential agent of the disease (Schmallenberg virus) [SBV] was recovered in the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) (the National Research Centre for Animal Health in Germany). The virus was determined to have an ability to cause congenital defects in calves and lambs including neck dislocation, hydrocephaly, deformities of joints, premature birth, and abortions.

Therefore, Deputy Head of the Rosselkhoznadzor and Chief Veterinary Officer, Nicolai Vlasov, applied to Director General of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers of the European Commission, Paola Testori Coggi, for information on characteristics of the agent, its stability, routes of spread, routes of transmission among animals, ways of prevention, diagnosis, existing diagnostic
kits, and on measures taken by the Official Veterinary Services of the EU-countries to prevent spread of the disease during export of cattle and small ruminants, meat products, offal, semen, and embryos to the 3rd countries, including Russia and other CU-countries.

On 17 Jan 2012 the Rosselkhoznadzor imposed temporary restrictions on import of live small ruminants, meat, offal, semen, and embryos of small ruminants from Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium to Russia, until the current situation is cleared up.

[The UK has become Europe's 4th country infected by the Orthobunyavirus "Schmallenberg virus" (SBV), a teratogenic, most likely vector-borne virus initially identified by FLI scientists in December 2011. So far, SBV has been identified in congenitally malformed offspring of domestic ruminants in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The spread of this virus resembles, geographically and seasons-wise, the one manifested by the culicoid-borne orbivirus BTV-8 in the late summer of 2006. Eventually, BTV-8 spread in a southward direction within western Europe.

It will interesting to note if (and, in case affirmative, when) disease symptoms, similar to the ones seen in Germany and the Netherlands in August-October 2011, have also been observed in Eastern England. The UK's sheep population is rather dense, and if the introduction of SBV coincided with the 1st semester of pregnancy in ewes, losses might be severe.

The Dutch figures, as updated at noon 23 Jan 2012, are:
Total number of tested holdings - 207 (all species; out of 283 holdings from which samples have been derived; 76 still investigated).
cattle: tested 91, positive 2* (2.2 percent)
sheep: tested 107, positive 72 (67.3 percent)
goats: tested 9, positive 2 (22.2 percent).
*These are the 1st SBV positive bovines in the Netherlands. One of them is from the province of Drenthe, the other one from Flevoland. See table at http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201855 and a map at http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201854 (sheep/goat foci -- red, cattle -- blue).

The countryside German press provides data on a large number of sheep holdings in which SBV positive congenitally affected lambs have been identified; a country-wide summarised information is anticipated.

To follow this unfolding event, thus far recorded in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK (England), it would be helpful if a regional map, indicating all identified SBV holdings, becomes available. Such a map was developed and kept updated by the EU animal-health authorities during the BTV-8 epizootic, which started in the summer of 2006 and continued during the consecutive years. - Mod.AS
