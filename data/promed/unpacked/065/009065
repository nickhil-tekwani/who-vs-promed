99 students from a kindergarten in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong remain hospitalized with suspected foodborne illness, local authorities said Mon 23 Sep 2019.

The municipal health bureau in the city of Dongguan said that 103 people, including the 99 children, are still being treated following a "possible foodborne disease outbreak." An earlier statement from the city's market supervision bureau said that 242 children and 12 adults from Montai International Kindergarten in Fenggang Town had visited hospitals in Dongguan and Shenzhen since the school reported the cases to the local disease control and prevention center on Saturday [21 Sep 2019].

One mother told domestic media outlet Litchi News that several concerned parents had shared their children's symptoms -- including diarrhea, stomachache, and fever -- in a WeChat group Saturday [21 Sep 2019] morning before notifying the school. She added that the doctors who examined her child said the symptoms were likely from food poisoning or sepsis, a toxic state resulting from bacterial infection.

In its statement, the health bureau said the outbreak could be salmonella -- a common bacterium that infects humans through contaminated water or food -- and that relevant authorities are investigating any suspicious food items served in the school cafeteria. Authorities also ordered the school to suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday [23-24 Sep 2019] to disinfect the premises.

When Sixth Tone called Montai International Kindergarten, a woman who answered the phone said she was not familiar with the case but added that faculty members were out paying hospital visits. A staff member at the municipal health bureau's publicity office said no further updates to the investigation were available.

According to a weekly lunch schedule published by the kindergarten on its WeChat account, the school offered 2 meals, along with fruits and snacks, every day last week. On Friday [20 Sep 2019], the students were served milk and sandwiches after lunch.
