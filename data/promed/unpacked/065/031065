Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: An epidemiological investigation is being conducted in the outbreak area and around the outbreak. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Since this is the 1st time that small hive beetle infestation (_Aethina tumida_) is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a zone.

Measures applied: Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Screening, No vaccination, No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Zoning

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (national laboratory) / Bees / entomological investigations / 4 Dec 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and scavenger of honey bee colonies. Adult and larvae small hive beetles feed on honey bee brood, honey and pollen, thus causing brood death, fermentation of honey and comb destruction. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honey bees to abscond.

The extent of beetle-associated damage likely depends on climate conditions, among other factors. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity than in areas with lower temperatures and humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honey bee colonies of all strengths and sizes.

An infestation by the small hive beetle can be recognised either indirectly via colony-wide damage associated with the beetle or directly via eggs, larvae and adults. An early diagnosis can be made after opening the colony and finding adult beetles under the colony lid, on the bottom board, or hiding in the combs (especially peripheral combs). No serological tests are applicable and no vaccines are available.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.2.5 Small hive beetle infestation (_Aethina tumida_), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf.

OIE's internationally agreed-upon requirements pertaining to infestation with _Aethina tumida _ (small hive beetle) are spelled out in chapter 9.4 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.9.4.htm.

The following information was obtained from the University of Florida, Institute of food and Agriculture Sciences -- Entomology and Nematology Department's Fact Sheet on small hive beetle: _Aethina tumida_ (http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/small_hive_beetle.htm):

"_Aethina tumida_ Murray is native to sub-Saharan Africa where it is an occasional pest in colonies of African subspecies of the western honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae, _Apis mellifera_ Linnaeus). However, the beetle has been found outside of its native range where it can cause considerable damage to colonies of European subspecies of honey bees.

"Small hive beetles were confirmed in the southeastern United States in 1998 in a commercial apiary in Florida, but previously unidentified specimens indicate its presence in the US since at least 1996. The small hive beetle initially appeared in port cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, as well as parts of Florida, and since has spread to much of the US.

"Small hive beetles were found in the port cities of Sydney and Brisbane, Australia, in the early 2000s and have spread within Australia since that time. The small hive beetle also was found in Portugal, but it was eradicated quickly after its detection."

Photos of small hive beetles, _Aethina tumida_, and a map showing the distribution of disease as of 2010 can also be seen at http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/small_hive_beetle.htm.

According to the information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist), since the disease was added to the OIE's list of notifiable diseases (2006), only 6 of 178 OIE member countries have provided some information related to small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries).

Of these 6 countries, the disease was reported as "infection present (with no clinical disease)" in Malaysia and as "demonstrated clinical disease" in Australia, Canada, Cuba, Mexico and the United States (Note: to view the information on small hive beetle infestation, scroll to the name of the disease).
