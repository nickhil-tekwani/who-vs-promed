[An undated July 2014 report from Igaripe Institute (http://en.igarape.org.br/break-your-bones-mortality-and-morbidity-associated-with-haitis-chikungunya-epidemic/) on a study in Haiti conducted 19-30 May 2014 indicated that the virus had infected 9.2 per cent of 13 760 individuals in the study, affecting 14.3 per cent of households (n=402). Statistically significant risk factors associated with the virus include having a household member with chikungunya, living in a displaced persons camp, a past diagnosis of dengue fever in the household, and rice farming.

A 22 Jul 2014 edition of France Guyane (http://www.franceguyane.fr/actualite/education-sante-environnement/le-chikungunya-quartier-par-quartier-205078.php in French) reports that French Guiana has more than 1000 cases, and a map shows cases in various quarters of Cayenne city.

[A single locally acquired case does not necessarily indicate that there will be ongoing transmission, but it does indicate that local transmission occurred, and might occur again. The 24 Jul 2014 report from Telemetro (http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/registran-casos-sospechosos-chikungunya_3_718758142.html, in Spanish) reiterated that there are 12 imported cases and one locally acquired, and that there were an additional 5 suspected cases being tested. However, the 23 Jul 2014 edition of El Caribe (http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2014/07/23/alerta-panama-por-virus-chikungunya, in Spanish) stated that of these 13 cases, 10 were imported and 3 were locally acquired.

[3] Neonatal effects

Neurocognitive Outcome of Children Exposed to Perinatal Mother-to-Child Chikungunya Virus Infection: The CHIMERE Cohort Study on Reunion Island.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Little is known about the neurocognitive outcome in children exposed to perinatal mother-to-child Chikungunya virus (p-CHIKV) infection.

Results
The mean DQ score was 86.3 (95 per cent CI: 81.0-91.5) in infected children compared to 100.2 (95 per cent CI: 98.0-102.5) in uninfected peers (P less than 0.001). 51 per cent (n = 17) of infected children had a GND compared to 15 per cent (n = 21) of uninfected children (P less than 0.001). Specific neurocognitive delays in p-CHIKV-infected children were as follows: coordination and language (57 per cent), sociability (36 per cent), movement/posture (27 per cent). After adjustment for maternal social situation, small for gestational age, and head circumference, p-CHIKV infection was found associated with GND (incidence rate ratio: 2.79, 95 per cent CI: 1.45-5.34). Further adjustments on gestational age or breastfeeding did not change the independent effect of CHIKV infection on neurocognitive outcome. The mean DQ of p-CHIKV-infected children was lower in severe encephalopathic children than in non-severe children (77.6 versus 91.2, P less than 0.001). Of the 12 cases of CHIKV neonatal encephalopathy, 5 developed a microcephaly (head circumference less than -2 standard deviations) and 4 matched the definition of cerebral palsy. MRI scans showed severe restrictions of white matter areas, predominant in the frontal lobes in these children.

Conclusions
The neurocognitive outcome of children exposed to perinatal mother-to-child CHIKV infection is poor. Severe CHIKV neonatal encephalopathy is associated with an even poorer outcome.
