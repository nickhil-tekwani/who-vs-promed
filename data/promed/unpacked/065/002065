POTATO VIRUSES - SAUDI ARABIA
==============================
Date: March 1997
From: EPPO Reporting Service (ha@eppo.fr)
In Saudi Arabia, potato is a relatively new crop but is
constantly increasing. The commercial production was 20 tons in
1976 and reached 60,000 tons in 1990. Potatoes are grown in both
spring and autumn. Seed potatoes for the spring crops are
imported mainly from the Netherlands but also from France,
Northern Ireland and USA. The autumn crop is planted with seed
potatoes produced locally from the previous crop. From 1989 to
1991, a survey on virus diseases was conducted in two of the six
major potato-growing areas, Tabuk and Hail, which are situated in
the north of the country. The following viruses were found in
the two areas:
- alfalfa mosaic alfamovirus,
- cucumber mosaic cucumovirus,
- tobacco mosaic tobamovirus,
- potato leaf roll luteovirus,
- tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (potential EPPO A2 quarantine
pest),
- tobacco ringspot nepovirus and
- potato viruses A, M, S, X and Y.
Potato yellow dwarf nucleorhabdovirus (EPPO Al quarantine pest)
was found in Hail but not in Tabuk. The EPPO Secretariat will
check with the authors this rather surprising record (the virus
has been reported from North America only, where it has not been
seen on potatoes since many years).
