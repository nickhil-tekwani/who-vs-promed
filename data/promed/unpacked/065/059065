Taiwan has raised a travel advisory for China's Zhejiang Province by one level after an H7N9 avian flu case was reported there 2 Oct 2015, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Wed [7 Oct 2015].

The patient, a 62-year-old woman, had been exposed to birds 2 weeks before developing symptoms and is currently under intensive care, the CDC said, citing Chinese health officials.

Issuing a level-2 alert for Zhejiang, the CDC said travelers to the province should take careful precautions.

They should avoid contact with live or dead birds, pay attention to personal hygiene and seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms such as a fever or a cough, the CDC said.

Other cities and provinces in China are still on the level-1 watch.

The agency uses a 3-tier warning system, with level 3 being the most severe, meaning that people are advised against traveling to the destination.

[This appears to be the 1st reported H7N9 case of the Fall in 2015. Sharon Sanders, Editor of FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/index.php) has posted in Avian Flu Diary (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/10/media-shengzhou-reports-1st-h7n9-case.html), a number of media reports of heightened respiratory virus activity in Zhejiang province. While there is no evidence that any of them have anything to do with H7N9, heavy flu activity may increase the chances that mild H7N9 cases go undetected.

Human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013. Most of these infections are believed to result from exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments, as H7N9 viruses have also been found in poultry in China. While some mild illnesses in human H7N9 cases have been seen, most patients have had severe respiratory illness, with about 1/3 resulting in death. No evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of H7N9 has been found, though some evidence points to limited person-to-person spread in rare circumstances. The 1st case outside of China was in Malaysia and was reported on 12 Feb 2014. The case was detected in a traveler from an H7N9-affected area of China. The new H7N9 virus has not been detected in people or birds in the United States. ... -- more

Influenza tends to be most prevalent during the winter months. The Chinese New Year begins at the end of January with increased slaughter of poultry for feasts. In January 2014 there was a spike in reports of illness with 96 confirmed reports of disease and 19 deaths. An H7N9 case list maintained by FluTrackers puts the global total for the disease at 681 cases.
