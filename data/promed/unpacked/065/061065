The Public Health Agency is investigating the source of an outbreak of _Legionella_ pneumonia [Legionnaires' disease] in Blanes (Selva, Catalonia), which as of Monday [10 Sep 2012] had affected 8 people, of whom 3 were hospitalized.

As reported by the Ministry of Health, the outbreak was detected over the course of last week [3-9 Sep 2012], and tests are still being carried out to determine its origin, which could be found in the cooling towers near a Blanes campground where the 1st reported cases were staying.

Of the 8 infected people, 3 remain admitted to health centers -- one in the intensive care unit of the Doctor Josep Trueta Hospital and the other 2 in the Blanes and Granollers hospitals.

The affected people are 3 Dutch tourists aged 59, 67, and 58; a 62-year-old Latvian woman; 3 men from the province of Barcelona, aged 48, 81, and 82; and a 54-year-old resident of Blanes.

The 1st 3 cases detected were the Dutch tourists who were on holiday at a campsite in Blanes. As a result, health technicians initially suspected the camping facilities and applied the appropriate preventive treatments in the bathroom modules and a pool.

A few days later, however, 3 other people who were staying in homes in the municipality were also affected, forcing the authorities to expand the search for the origin of the infection to other areas of Blanes.

On Friday [7 Sep 2012], technicians took samples from the cooling towers of 2 municipal companies close to the campsite, but conclusive test results are not available yet.

The Ministry of Health, who thanked the support of the City of Blanes in the implementation of outbreak control measures, noted that _Legionella_ is not spread by human contact and that it is completely safe for people to drink from the public water supply.

Dr Steve Berger has noted that rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain (http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It is not known whether this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase in acquisition of this infection.

A diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. According to the U.S. CDC, about 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of Legionnaires' disease in other travelers associated with the same source may not be appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. Cases of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease need to be reported to the appropriate authorities to be able to detect these outbreaks.

Blanes is a town with a population of 40 010 (in 2010) northeast of Barcelona in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain on the Costa Brava, which stretches from Blanes all the way to the French border. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanes). The Costa Brava is a holiday destination with large numbers of hotels and apartments in seaside resorts such as Blanes, mainly for package holiday tourists from Northern Europe and especially the United Kingdom and France (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Brava). For a map of the Costa Brava, see http://www.wordtravels.com/assets/map//Spain/Costa_Brava_map.jpg.
