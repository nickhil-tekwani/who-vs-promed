For about 2 weeks, cases of anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_) were reported in various localities, including "Corail" of the 8th communal section of Petit-Goave. According to a preliminary assessment drawn up by the peasants: 6 oxen died from this disease, and 9 people are currently infected. Worse, the meat of infected animals has been sold in the market, a situation that constitutes a major risk for consumer health.

Urgent action must be taken by the communal agriculture office and the UCS-Goavienne to curb and eradicate the disease.

[This is a problem of many years for Haiti, where anthrax is enzootic but only sporadically reported. It is also seen in goats there, which are a staple of family nutrition in the Caribbean. - Mod.MHJ
