With reference to the previous posting [see reference below], I would like
to add to comments made by the moderator.
We confirmed the presence of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) on the island of
Mauritius in October 2000 by electron microscopy of lesion material. They
have been vaccinating cattle on the island but have recently been
considering the effect of discontinuing this.

[Thanks to Dr Gerdes for her complementary information.
According to Mauritius' reports to the OIE, the outbreak in 2000 was due to
importation of cattle from a country on the African continent. 178 clinical
cases were recorded, of which 2 animals died. The outbreak was eradicated
by application of slaughter policy followed by general vaccination. No
cases have been reported during 2001-2003. - Mod.AS]
