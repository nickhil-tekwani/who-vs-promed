Arkansas health officials warn the latest hepatitis A outbreak is just beginning and could get much worse. So far, the virus has spread to 2 Arkansas counties in region 8: Clay and Lawrence. Dr Dirk Haselow, the state's epidemiologist, told Little Rock TV station KATV, that the Arkansas Department of Health expects more confirmed cases in the coming weeks.

The outbreak began at the Taco Bell in Corning, 200 N Missouri Ave, when an employee tested positive for the virus. Another case was also reported in Corning at the Flash Market/Subway, 105 N Missouri Ave. The latest case was reported last week [week of 23 Apr 2018] at the Doublebee's gas station, 1003 Hwy 63 in Walnut Ridge, when an employee tested positive. "It comes down to hand hygiene," Haselow said. "If you wash your hands really well before you touch food and after you use the restroom, you can protect others from getting it."

In 2017, according to the CDC, Arkansas reported just 2 cases of hepatitis A. That number has already risen to 13 this year [2018].

However, the CDC says other states have seen even greater increases. As of [21 Apr 2018], the number of hepatitis A cases nationwide has nearly doubled the total cases reported in 2017. The cumulative total so far is 1122 compared to last year's 604 cases. This year Indiana reports 89 hep A infections compared to just 6 in 2017. Utah saw its infections jump from 4 to 88. Missouri's number of cases rose from one reported in 2017 to 86 this year. Kentucky has seen one of the greatest increases, according to the CDC, jumping from 2 cases in 2017 to a whopping 344 cases this year.

Kentuckiana's [Kentucky-Indiana] hepatitis A outbreak grows worse by the week. As of [Mon 30 Apr 2018], 294 cases have been confirmed in Louisville, and more than a dozen have been confirmed in neighboring southern Indiana communities like Clark and Floyd counties.

"The majority of the people are from a high risk group," University of Louisville Associate Professor of infectious disease Ruth Carrico said. "People who are homeless, housing insecure, people who use or inject drugs, men who have sex with men, or people who congregate with those populations."

Doctors diagnosed an employee at the Bearno's Pizza off Westport Road in Louisville with hepatitis A on Thu 26 Apr 2018. The restaurant immediately shut its doors for a bleach cleaning before reopening with health department approval. "I think it's very unfortunate what happened," Bearno's Inc President George Timmering said. "Their past 3 health department scores have been 99, 100, 99, so they run a good operation. But I think this shows with this outbreak you got to get everybody covered."

Bearno's is paying for hepatitis A vaccinations for 500 workers across all 14 of its location and offering to cover any out of pocket cost for the shot to any customer who ate at the Wesport Road location between [8 and 22 Apr 2018]. "It's just the right thing to do," Timmering said. "Let's get every restaurant in the city to require every employee to get it."

Food safety remains a top concern as tourist flood the area this week for the Kentucky Derby [Sat 5 May 2018]. It's Louisville's signature event of the year. The city's health department is taking part in a vaccination blitz, scheduling shots for more than 1700 restaurant workers over the next few days.

"They directly touch something that goes directly in our mouths, and that's how we acquire hep A," Carrico said. "I have to put the poop germ in my mouth."

Employees at 11 restaurants or grocery stores in the area have fallen ill with hepatitis A:
Applebee's at 4717 Dixie Highway
Kroger store at 4915 Dixie Highway
Kroger at 520 North 35th Street
Sarino restaurant at 1030 Goss Avenue
Bob Evans on State Street in New Albany
Denny's restaurant located at 4030 Dutchman's Lane
White Castle located at 3701 Seventh Street Road, near Berry Boulevard
Bearno's Pizza located at 9222 Westport Road
Taco Bell, located at 900 Lafollette Center, in Floyds Knobs, Indiana
TOMO Restaurant located at 4317 Charlestown Road in New Albany
Arby's located at 225 South Indiana Avenue in Sellersburg

In November [2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health declared a statewide hepatitis A outbreak. One death has been attributed to the disease. More than 16 000 people have been vaccinated in Louisville. The Louisville Health Department has reduced the price of hepatitis A shots from USD 65 to USD 25 in an effort to encourage food service workers to get vaccinated.
