A fox found near McMillan Road and Cordova Road in Orangeburg County has tested positive for rabies, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

The fox, according to DHEC, exposed one person and a dog following an attack. The fox was submitted for testing on 4 May 2020 and was confirmed to have rabies one day later.

Anyone who believes they may have been exposed to rabies should wash any body part having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with soap and water. You are also urged to seek medical attention.

If you, your family members, or pets have come into contact with this fox or any other animal which may have been exposed to rabies, please call DHEC's Orangeburg Environmental Affairs Office at 803-533-5490. You may also call DHEC after hours at 1-888-847-0902.

A man bitten by a fox in Brier Creek is receiving post-exposure treatment for rabies, according to Raleigh police.

The family of [RC] confirmed he was bitten by a fox Saturday [9 May 2020] while walking 2 dogs on Emerald Creek Drive.

On Sunday [10 May 2020], a fox encountered a resident and 2 dogs in a fenced yard on Broadfield Court but ran off before an animal control officer arrived, police say.

The animal control officer located a fox later in the day acting abnormally on Helmond Way. Once captured, the fox was tested for rabies and results were positive.

Raleigh police believe this fox was the same one involved in the previous incidents.

The wild fox that attacked a 78-year-old man while he walked his dogs in Raleigh has tested positive for rabies. The attack happened Saturday [9 May 2020] on Emerald Creek Drive in Brier Creek.

Victim [RC] said he was minding his business Saturday when a wild fox went past his dogs, Bugatti and Prancer, and bit him on the leg. "I've read about people getting attacked by bears and things like that. And here I was getting attacked by this small fox," [RC] told ABC11 on Sunday [10 May 2020]. "The fox had sharp teeth."

Animal Control officers found the fox Sunday on Helmond Way. Tests later confirm the fox was rabid. [Unless there was something distinguishing about the fox, they have no confirmed way of making sure this fox is the same fox having bitten the individual. What they have is a fox, testing positive for rabies, and the authorities cannot afford to take a chance with a man's life, so consequently he has started post-exposure rabies treatment - Mod.TG]

[RC] has started post-exposure rabies treatments. "Let me tell you, the 1st rabies shot they give you, they go in and give it to you right down in the bites. And it is ouchy," he said. [RC] is now taking antibiotics and will endure more shots this week.

A stray cat has tested positive for rabies in Hampton, officials say. The stray cat bit at least one person before it was captured by the Hampton Department of Health and sent to a lab for rabies testing. It was a domestic short hair dilute calico located on Glascow Way in the Scotland Square area, according to a news release.

Rabies is a deadly virus affecting humans and pets. It is transmitted through bites, saliva and brain tissue. Pet owners should vaccinate their animals against rabies and avoid contact with wild animals.

Anyone who is bitten or scratched by a wild or stray animal should call their health department immediately.

[This posting is a little different in the sense we have 3 posts involving a fox. Although 2 of these stories are related to the same incident, I thought it interesting one of them involves the aspect of how the victim of the bite felt receiving post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against the rabies virus. However, whatever discomfort from the PEP occurs, it is better than the death from the rabies virus.

It is also sad the communities are not advertising, promoting, and encouraging people to be sure their animals are current on the rabies vaccine and asking the veterinarians to host rabies clinic drives to help get more animals vaccinated. The communities should at least be encouraging all animal owners to visit a veterinary office for a rabies prevention vaccine for their pet(s).

If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the bite/scratch with copious amounts of soap and water. Seek medical attention.

From the CDC: Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient-assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html). - Mod.TG
