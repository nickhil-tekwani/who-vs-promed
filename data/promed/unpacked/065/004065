Information received on [and dated] 8 Feb 2016 from Dr Mikheil Sokhadze, Chief Veterinary Officer Deputy Head, National Food Agency, Ministry of Agriculture, Tbilisi, Georgia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 12 Jan 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 4 Feb 2016
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Peste des petits ruminants virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory advanced
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Tbilisi, Varketili, Varketili Farming, Tbilisi
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Jan 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 2190 / 350 / 170 / 80 / 0

Affected population: Farmer noticed disease clinical signs (lesions in mouth, tongue, gingiva and nozzles) on 12 Jan 2016. Disease occurred in lambs 1-2 months of age. Samples were collected and submitted to the Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture. Samples were confirmed positive for bluetongue virus (BTV) by RT-PCR. Samples were sent to the Pirbright Institute Reference Laboratory for confirmation; samples were negative for BTV, but by further analysis, the Laboratory confirmed Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRv). On 4 Feb 2015, sequence results were obtained; all nucleic acid sequences belonged to Lineage IV when compared with the PPRv reference strains.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep / 15.98 / 7.76 / 48.57 / 11.42
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: According to the OIE/FAO global strategy on control of peste des petits ruminants and advice of experts, mass vaccination is required; procurement of 1 000 000 vaccine doses is about to be conducted.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Pirbright Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / sheep / real-time PCR / 4 Feb 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This described 1st PPR outbreak in Georgia was initially diagnosed as bluetongue (see 20160126.3966527). In view of the revised diagnosis, becoming PPR, the bluetongue event has now been removed from OIE's WAHID records.

The origin of the PPR virus introduced into Georgia is not provided ("unknown or inconclusive"). Georgia's immediate neighbor on the south, Turkey, is known to be heavily infected and is a plausible source of the infection, though introduction by animals transported from other infected countries has not been excluded. PPR virus lineage IV is present notably in South Asia and the Middle East, Turkey included. The same lineage IV is also present in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and is widespread in Egypt. Morocco started implementing a mass vaccination campaign in 2008, and this continued in 2010-2011. The results demonstrated that PPR can be controlled through mass vaccination campaigns.

It will be interesting to obtain additional information on the observed outbreak, in particular whether the disease remained limited to 1-2 month old lambs or affected adult animals as well, as would have been expected in a fully susceptible population. Are there no additional foci in Georgia?

The FAO and OIE have declared PPR a priority disease; plans to eradicate it from the globe by 2030, following the footsteps of rinderpest eradication, mainly by mass vaccinations, have been drawn. In a document issued commonly by both agencies in March 2015, "Global strategy for the control and eradication of PPR," Georgia was addressed as one of the Caucasus countries (together with Azerbaijan and Armenia) which belong to the "Central Asia" region (the other countries are Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan).

Referring to Central Asia, the document states:
"Few countries (in the region) are or have been infected, but the exact situation of some countries is not well known. Vaccination has been used in several countries. Vaccine is produced in countries associated with this region, such as Iran and Pakistan. PPR control and eradication programmes are being developed, but there is a need to better harmonise and coordinate all these efforts." See http://www.oie.int/eng/PPR2015/doc/PPR-Global-Strategy-avecAnnexes_2015-03-28.pdf.

It will be interesting to obtain results of PPR surveillance in Georgia's immediate neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan. The latter stated, in the most recent available annual OIE report (2014), that PPR was absent in 2014, while its last year of occurrence was "unknown." Armenia stated in its 2014 annual report that PPR was a disease which had never occurred. Both countries share borders with Turkey. - Mod.AS
