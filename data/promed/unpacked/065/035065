Chinese woman dies from suspected SARS on Moscow-bound train
------------------------------------------------------------
A Chinese woman has died from what may be Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) while traveling on a train from the Far East Russian
city of Blagoveshchensk to Moscow, a medical source said on Wednesday
[15 Mar 2009].

The train was stopped in the central Russian city of Kirov and around
60 train passengers were sent to a local hospital. 6 of them are
reported as running fevers, the source said, although Kirov Region
officials have said that none of them were suffering from SARS. The
carriage in which the woman was travelling was disconnected from the
rest of the train. The train then continued on its way to Moscow.
Russia's [public health] watchdog spokesman was unable to confirm
that the woman had died from SARS. "Doctors are currently
establishing a preliminary diagnosis," he said.

Kirov Region administration officials said that the final results of
the analysis would be ready in 24 hours' time.

Chinese woman dies on a train traveling across Russia
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A body of a dead Chinese woman has been taken off a Moscow-bound
train travelling from Russia's Far East. The woman has allegedly died
of pneumonia. 51 passengers, who were also from China, plus 2 train
attendants traveling aboard the same carriage were taken to hospital
in Kirovsky region in Volga district and the carriage has been
disinfected. Russia's Health Ministry reported the passengers were in
no danger but were kept under observation.

The train was traveling to the Russian capital from the city of
Blagoveshensk and got stuck for several hours in Kirovsky region [a]
thousand kilometers east of Moscow.

"Isolation is necessary because we still don't know the cause of the
girl's death. It could have been a heart attack, or other disease,"
stated the press office of the Kirovsky region's government.

"We've taken all measures to prevent the spread of infection and
taken samples from all people who have been hospitalized. We'll know
preliminary test results tomorrow. In several weeks, doctors will be
able to draw final conclusions," added the officials.

The Chinese embassy hasn't allowed an autopsy of the body to be
carried out but doctors say a medical examination showed the woman
allegedly had fluid on her lungs. It is also known, that 2 hours
before her death, the woman asked the train attendant for medical
help as she wasn't feeling good. The situation is being closely
monitored by medical professionals, says Russia's Chief Medical
officer of Health Gennady Onischenko: "The situation is under total
control. There are no complications that people of the Russian
Federation should worry about," said Onischenko.

[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory
illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). SARS was 1st reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the
next few months, the illness spread to more than 2 dozen countries in
North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global
outbreak of 2003 was contained. The disease has not recurred
subsequently except in some cases presumed related to laboratory
exposure. It is unlikely that the death of the passenger on board the
train en route from the Russian Far East to Moscow will be attributed
to SARS virus infection. The only reason to consider the diagnosis of
SARS in this case appears to be the patient's origin from China and
the possibility that pneumonia contributed to the fatal outcome.
There is no indication of spread of the illness to other passengers
or attendants on the train (during the course of a journey probably
extending over several days). Any additional information as to the
etiology or other details would be appreciated.

SARS begins with a high fever. Other symptoms may include headache,
an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also
have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20
percent of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients
may develop a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia. The virus
that causes SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by
respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected
person coughs or sneezes. The virus also can spread when a person
touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and
then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is
possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the
air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known.
