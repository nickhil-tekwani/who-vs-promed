New information out of South Africa shows that 1053 people have been confirmed with listeria infections in the past 18 months. One in 5 has died in what the World Health Organization has determined to be the largest listeriosis outbreak in recorded history.

Infants in their 1st month of life have been harder hit than any other age group in the outbreak. Of the infants who are 28 days or younger, for whom complete information is available, 91 have died. Overall, at least 212 people have died in the outbreak. Officials do not yet have final reports on all of the sick people, so there could easily be additional deaths confirmed.

Public health investigators traced the outbreak to Tiger Brand's ready-to-eat polony, which is similar to baloney and hot dogs, that was produced at Enterprise Foods' Polokwane production facility.

During the peak period of the outbreak, from late October 2017 through March this year [2018], health officials often confirmed more than 30 new cases per week. In some weeks, more than 40 new people were found to have infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_.

Prior to 2017, health officials recorded less than 2 cases per week, for an average of 60 to 80 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases per year in the country.

The South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) began investigating the situation in July 2017 when increases in laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis were reported. On 5 Dec 2017, Minister of Health Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi declared the outbreak.

A recall of Tiger Brand's polony was initiated on 4 Mar 2018. By mid-April 2018, the number of new cases per week had dropped to 5 or less.

Highlights of the most recent report from South African public health officials include:

- 1053 cases confirmed from 1 Jan 2017, through 20 Jun 2018;
- Neonates younger than 28 days are the most affected age group;
- People aged 15 to 49 years old are the 2nd most affected age group; and
- Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province at 58 percent of all cases, followed by Western Cape with 13 percent, and KwaZulu-Natal with 8 percent.

[Cases continue to be reported for a total now of 1053 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, 20 more cases than last reported by ProMED-mail in May 2018, with a case fatality rate of 20 percent. The source, "polony" contaminated with the outbreak strain of _Listeria moncytogenes_, was recalled in early March 2018. With an incubation period of up to 70 days, at this point, new cases of listeriosis are likely to be due to delays in reporting, or perhaps failure to discard listeria-contaminated polony despite the recall. - Mod.ML
