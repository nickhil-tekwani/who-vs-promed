Nakuru County health executive Dr Gichuki Kariuki has urged Solai residents to visit health facilities in the area for malaria checkup. Addressing the media following reports that 3 people had succumbed to malaria, Dr Gichuki said regular checkup is the only solution. He termed the deaths unfortunate, adding that had the patients visited health facilities on noting the 1st symptoms, they could have been saved. "We urge residents of Solai and Nakuru as a whole to ensure they go for checkups in our health facilities whenever they spot symptoms" he said.

He acknowledged that the health docket in Nakuru is facing challenges when it comes to malaria, as the national government has not been providing mosquito nets since malaria prevalence is low. According Dr Gichuki, a sensitization campaign on malaria has commenced in Solai to educate residents on the symptoms of the disease. "The other challenge we have is that since our prevalence is low the national government does not distribute mosquito nets in Nakuru. But so far, we have put in place measures," he said.

Earlier this week[week of 28 Oct 2019], panic gripped residents of Arus village in Solai, following the death of 3 people in a week due to malaria.

The symptoms of malaria include; diarrhea, high fever, chills, headaches, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and profuse sweating. According to the World Health Organization, the early symptoms; fever, headache, and chills may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria.

[Nakuru country is located approximately 1850 m (about 6070 ft) above sea level and is considered a low risk area (see figure 2 in The epidemiology and control profile of malaria in Kenya at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/de6c/664f1723fcf3ed31400b2cb06710a889bedd.pdf. Ministry of Health, Nairobi, 2016) [Solai is 1952 m (6404 ft) above sea level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solai), even higher than the altitude of Nakuru County. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]. It is unusual to have an outbreak at this altitude but a warmer climate moving the altitude limit of malaria transmission upwards is a possible explanation. - Mod.EP
