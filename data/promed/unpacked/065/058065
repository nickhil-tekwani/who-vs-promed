More cattle die of anthrax in Saskatchewan
------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed 2 more fatal
cases of anthrax in cattle in 2 different communities in
Saskatchewan. The most recent case was confirmed Monday [11 Aug 2008]
in the Rural Municipality of Big River, about 130 km [80 miles]
northwest of Prince Albert. The CFIA also confirmed a case on
Saturday [9 Aug 2008] in the RM of Harris, about 80 km [50 miles]
southwest of Saskatoon. Just one animal was involved in each case.

The 2 most recent cases bring the total number of anthrax deaths this
spring and summer to 24, including 16 cattle and 8 bison, over a
total of 5 farms, all in different areas of Saskatchewan. The CFIA
reiterated in its report that findings of anthrax in Western Canada
are common and the spores which cause the disease are known to exist
in soils across the Prairies.

Vaccination prevents anthrax in most animals, the CFIA said,
recommending that ranchers consult with veterinarians about making
vaccinations part of regular herd-health maintenance.

All suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax must be reported to the
CFIA, which recommends that, as a precaution, producers should
immediately notify their veterinarians of any sudden deaths in their
herds. When anthrax is confirmed, the CFIA quarantines affected
premises during decontamination and disposal. Producers of livestock
affected by anthrax may get compensation of between CAD 100 [USD
94] and CAD 500 [USD 469] per animal, depending on species,
once CFIA confirms disease control actions are complete.

Human cases of anthrax poisoning are only rarely associated with
outbreaks in animals, but producers still should not handle or move
an animal's carcass if anthrax is suspected, the CFIA cautioned.

In 2007, anthrax was reported on 23 farms in Manitoba, 6 in
Saskatchewan and 4 in Alberta.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[Anthrax depends for its continued existance not on the large
epidemics, splendid though they may be, but on the silent pitter
patter of sporadic outbreaks in the background. These do 2 things:
they keep the ground recontaminated as other sites fade and die, and
they occur both in dry summers and wet, ready to trigger another
epidemic. In 2006 the epidemic was restarted time and again, here and
there, by sporadic outbreaks, and thanks to the fly-full summer the
disease spread from RM to RM. With the ongoing contamination in the
province we can expect to see sporadic outbreaks for a few years as
ranchers ignore the advice to get their stock vaccinated each spring.
Fortunately in dry summers these usually involve individual cows on
scattered farms. Because they are few, they are frequently ignored --
fortunately not in these 2 outbreaks -- and the ground contamination is
maintained by fresh extravasated blood from the carcasses. This would
be prevented by consistent vaccination.

The Darwinian function of anthrax epidemics is to flood the
countryside with the epidemic strain, even though when properly
controlled most carcasses are now properly disposed of. This by its
density nudges out the varied prior strains -- the probability of
their being picked up by grazing livestock is much dimished by the
higher frequency of the epidemic strain. So where epidemics occur
every 10 years or so, thanks to climatic patterns of rainfall, the
number of enzootic strains gets limited to the strains taking part in
recent epidemics and maybe just one or 2 other sporadics. For example
in the Kruger National Park [South Africa] there are just 2 enzootic
strains and a pair of sporadics. The strains across the Canadian
Prairies and the Dakotas are similarly limited. - Mod.MHJ]
