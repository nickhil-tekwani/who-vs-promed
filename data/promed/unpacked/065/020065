Laboratory-acquired brucellosis - Indiana and Minnesota, 2006
-----------------------------------------------
In November 2006, 2 cases of brucellosis in microbiologists at 2
clinical laboratories were reported to state health departments in
Indiana and Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)
contacted CDC regarding this suspected multistate cluster of
laboratory-acquired brucellosis. MDH and the Indiana State Department
of Health (ISDH) asked CDC to conduct further testing on _Brucella_
isolates suspected of causing the infections and to provide
recommendations for appropriate response by the laboratories. This
report summarizes the investigation conducted jointly by MDH, ISDH,
and CDC, provides guidance on safe laboratory handling of _Brucella
spp._, and makes recommendations for responding to _Brucella_
laboratory exposures. The results of that investigation determined
that 146 workers at the 2 laboratories had been exposed to and that,
although 2 _Brucella_ isolates had been handled by both laboratories,
infections in the 2 microbiologists were caused by 2 unrelated
isolates. Because _Brucella spp._ pose a risk for aerosol-transmitted
infection, CDC recommended risk assessment for all Brucella-exposed
laboratory workers, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for those at high
risk, surveillance for symptoms of disease, and serologic follow-up
with workers. The events in Indiana and Minnesota emphasize the
importance of adhering to recommended biosafety practices, timely
sharing of information regarding laboratory exposures, and rapid
implementation of response protocols.

Case Reports
-------------
Indiana: On 28 Sep 2006, a microbiologist aged 47 years
(microbiologist A) who worked at a clinical laboratory had onset of
high fever, sweating, malaise, anorexia, headache, and hip pain.
Initially, her symptoms were not severe; she did not seek medical
treatment until 3 weeks later, after her symptoms had progressively
worsened. The microbiologist was hospitalized on 22 Oct 2006 and
recovered fully with treatment. On 26 Oct 2006, an unidentified blood
culture isolate from microbiologist A (isolate A) was submitted for
identification to a Minnesota clinical laboratory and determined to
be _Brucella spp._; both MDH and IDSH were notified of the finding.
Epidemiologic investigation later revealed that, on 17 Jul 2006,
microbiologist A had subcultured on an open laboratory bench an
unidentified isolate (isolate C) from a referring laboratory. Isolate
C subsequently was forwarded for identification to the same Minnesota
clinical laboratory and identified as _Brucella spp_.

Minnesota: On 25 Oct 2006, a microbiologist aged 61 years
(microbiologist B), who worked at the same Minnesota clinical
laboratory that received microbiologist A's isolate, had onset of
low-grade fever, fatigue, and night sweats. She was hospitalized and
recovered with treatment. On 9 Nov 2006, the Minnesota laboratory
identified a blood culture isolate from microbiologist B (isolate B)
as _Brucella spp._ and notified MDH. The subsequent investigation
determined that microbiologist B had not handled isolate A from
microbiologist A. However, previously she had handled on an open
bench 2 unidentified isolates subsequently identified as _Brucella
spp_. Her 1st exposure had occurred on 21 Jul 2006 while she was
handling isolate C, which had been forwarded from the Indiana
clinical laboratory. The 2nd exposure had occurred on 8 Aug 2006
during testing of an isolate from a Texas referring clinical
laboratory (isolate D).

Investigation and Response
--------------------------
The investigation revealed that all potentially implicated specimens
or isolates had been manipulated on an open bench, the routine
practice for handling unidentified isolates in these laboratories. No
spills or aerosol-generating procedures had occurred. Neither
laboratory had formal protocols for 1) notification and follow-up of
staff members who worked with isolates identified as _Brucella spp._
or 2) notification of laboratories that forwarded isolates later
identified as _Brucella spp_.

Brucella-exposed workers (any person present in the microbiology
laboratory from the time the culture was first manipulated until all
culture isolates were destroyed or removed from the laboratory) from
each laboratory were identified, and their exposures were classified
as either high risk or low risk.

A high-risk exposure was defined as 1) having direct personal
exposure (e.g., sniffing bacteriologic cultures; direct skin contact;
pipetting by mouth; inoculation; or spraying into the eyes, nose, or
mouth), 2) performing work on an open bench (i.e., outside of
biosafety level 3 containment equipment) with an open culture plate
containing a _Brucella_ isolate or being in close proximity to such
work (e.g., across an open bench top or within 5 feet), or 3)
presence in the laboratory during any procedure conducted on a
_Brucella_ isolate that might result in generation of aerosolized
organisms and inhalational exposure (e.g., vortexing or catalase
testing). A low-risk exposure was defined as being present in the
laboratory during an exposure but not meeting the definition for a
high-risk exposure.

In Indiana, 105 staff members were exposed; 15 of those exposures
were classified as high risk, including the exposure of
microbiologist A. In Minnesota, 41 staff members were exposed; 13 of
those exposures were classified as high risk, including the exposure
of microbiologist B. All staff members classified with high-risk
exposure, other than the 2 microbiologists who received antimicrobial
therapy, were advised to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

To determine the source of the _Brucella_ infections, CDC compared
blood culture isolates from the microbiologists with the isolates
they handled, using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeats
analysis at 21 genomic regions. All isolates were identified as
_Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. Matching of 16 genomic amplicons
suggested that isolate C was the source of infection for
microbiologist A, the Indiana microbiologist. Matching of 17 genomic
amplicons suggested that isolate D was the source of infection for
microbiologist B, the Minnesota microbiologist.

Serial serum samples from the 105 exposed Indiana laboratory staff
members, excluding microbiologist A, were tested at CDC for
anti-_Brucella_ antibodies, using the Brucella microagglutination
test (BMAT); the Minnesota laboratory conducted voluntary serial BMAT
testing for 11 exposed laboratory staff members. No additional
infections were detected in either group.

Editorial Note
--------------
Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection usually caused by
_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, or less commonly by
_B. canis_. Humans usually are infected by occupational exposure to
infected animals, consumption of unpasteurized dairy products from
infected animals, or inhalation of infectious aerosols. The average
incubation period for brucellosis is 2-10 weeks but ranges from a few
days to 6 months. Symptoms include intermittent fever, chills,
malaise, sweating, joint and lower back pain, headache, anorexia, and
fatigue (1). Untreated brucellosis can last from several weeks to
several years. Chronic untreated brucellosis can lead to abscesses in
the liver, spleen, heart valves, brain, or bone; osteoarticular
complications; and, in rare cases, death. A definitive diagnosis
requires that bacteria be cultured from clinical specimens. A
presumptive diagnosis requires demonstrating high or rising titers of
specific antibodies in the serum (1).

Since 1986, fewer than 150 cases of brucellosis have been reported
annually in the USA (2; CDC, unpublished data, 2007). However,
brucellosis is among the most commonly reported laboratory-acquired
bacterial infections (3). In a review of laboratory-associated
infections during 1979-1999, _Brucella spp._ accounted for
approximately 8 percent of all laboratory infections, 16 percent of
bacterial infections, and 4 percent of deaths (4). Infections have
occurred from sniffing culture plates, spilling blood-culture
bottles, mucocutaneous exposure to sprays of organism-containing
suspensions, aerosol generation from ruptured centrifuge tubes, or
routine laboratory work with _Brucella_ cultures outside of
biological safety cabinets (5-9).

Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) practices, containment equipment, and
facilities are recommended for all manipulations of _Brucella_
cultures (Box 1, for boxes, see original URL. - Mod.LL) (10). Because
unidentified isolates are commonly manipulated on an open bench,
inadvertent exposure can occur when _Brucella_ unexpectedly grows in
a culture. A formal notification and response protocol must be used
after identification of _Brucella spp_. Timely identification,
notification, and appropriate follow-up of potentially exposed
workers, in combination with worker training to maximize awareness
and observance of appropriate safety practices, can prevent
unnecessary illness and hospitalization from brucellosis. Exposures
can be minimized by clinicians and forwarding laboratories clearly
identifying specimens they suspect to be _Brucella_.

Once _Brucella_ has been identified (or is highly suspected),
clinical laboratories should notify the state health department and
send the isolate to the state public health laboratory or nearest
Laboratory Reference Network laboratory for confirmation and species
identification. When _Brucella_ is confirmed, the state public health
laboratory should notify all other laboratories that handled the
specimen, and exposure to workers should be assessed at the
submitting laboratory and other laboratories involved.

Classification of exposures as high risk or low risk by practitioners
of occupational health, infection control, or public health
determines PEP recommendations. PEP is recommended for persons with
high-risk exposure (Box 2, for boxes, see original URL, but primarily
doxcycline and rifampin for 3 weeks. - Mod.LL). Serologic follow-up
for exposed persons using quantitative assays (e.g., BMAT) should be
performed at the time of exposure and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 24 after
exposure. Active, regular (e.g., weekly) surveillance for symptoms
consistent with brucellosis should be conducted for all exposed
laboratory workers for 6 months after exposure. PEP and monitoring
differ for persons exposed to _B. abortus_ RB51, an attenuated
veterinary vaccine strain that is less commonly associated with human
illness, is rifampin resistant in vitro, and does not elicit a
measurable serologic response using available tests. Laboratory
workers who might have been exposed to _Brucella_ and who have
unexplained febrile illness consistent with brucellosis should be
referred to health-care providers for evaluation. Evaluation should
include blood culture and anti-_Brucella_ antibody serologic testing,
and treatment for brucellosis should be initiated when compatible
illness is confirmed.

_Brucella spp._ are dangerous infectious bacteria listed among CDC's
category B bioterrorism agents. CDC and the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) regulate the transfer, possession, or use
of such agents in the USA. New isolations, laboratory exposures, and
other incidents associated with the intentional or unintentional
release of _B. abortus_ (excluding RB51), _B. melitensis_, or _B.
suis_ must be reported as soon as possible to either CDC or APHIS.
Persons seeking assistance in identifying _Brucella spp._ or
serologic monitoring of exposed persons should contact their state
health departments or the CDC Bacterial Zoonoses Branch at telephone,
404-639-1711.
