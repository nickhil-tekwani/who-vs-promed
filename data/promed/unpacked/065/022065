The dengue situation in the Tuaran district is under control due to
the proactive actions taken by the Health Department here, said Local
Government and Housing Minister Datuk Hajiji Mohd Noor. He said the
situation would be continuously monitored so that appropriate
measures would be taken immediately to contain the spread of the disease.
Last month [Apr 2007], dengue claimed the life of a woman in her 60s
in the district.The Health Department had also recorded 6 other
dengue cases in the district so far this year [2007]. Hajiji said 15
villages in the district have been identified as breeding grounds for
the _Aedes_ mosquito that causes [transmits dengue virus. - Mod.TY]
dengue and urged the villagers to clean up their areas or destroy
mosquito-breeding grounds.
The villages are Trayong, Bakut, Selaud, Labuaya, Giling Laut,
Rambai, Bawang, Bontoi, Tamparuli town, Kalipasuan, Soromboton,
Guakon, Malinsou, Roun and Taman Nabalu. Hajiji also said the Health
Department had carried out fogging in the high-risk areas.

Thai health ministry is on full alert to prevent the spread of dengue
fever after the disease claimed 4 lives so far this year, and the
number of dengue fever patients nationwide has risen to 6000, the
Thai News Agency reported Thursday [3 May 2007]. The focus of the
outbreak is in Trat province, 400 km southeast of Bangkok on the
Cambodian border, and in the southernmost provinces along the Malaysian border.
Earlier than usual rains has meant that dengue is a greater concern
this year than before, Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla
said. The insurgency in the far South means that anti-mosquito
measures are more difficult to apply. More breeding grounds
for dengue-carrying mosquitoes emerge during the rainy season, he
explained, especially in the 3 southernmost provinces where heavier
rainfall contributes to a higher population of mosquitoes than in the
country's other regions. Mongkol said that the outbreak could become
a severe problem in the border provinces as health officials can't
implement pro-active strategies to fight the disease due to the
ongoing violence.
The number of dengue fever patients is normally higher from May to
August due to the rainy season. So far there have been 6070 dengue
fever patients in the first four months of this year [2007]. The
nationwide ratio amounted to nearly 10 patients per 100 000 persons
in the population, he said. However, almost 1000 new dengue fever
cases have been reported in the past two weeks [23 Apr - 4 May 2007].
The highest concentration of dengue fever patients was reported in
Trat province with the ratio of 46:100 000, followed by the southern
provinces of Pattani at 42: 100 000 and Yala at 33: 100 000
respectively. The public health minister said he ordered health
officials to work with local authorities to prevent the further
spread on any outbreak.

The dengue epidemic has killed 54 people in the Philippines so far
this year [2007] and is threatening several neighborhoods of Metro
Manila as well as some provinces, said the Philippine Department of
Health (DOH) Thursday [03 May 2007].
The DOH's latest Dengue Surveillance Report said the barangays
(neighborhoods) with cluster of dengue cases, where more than one
case of dengue in one family have been reported, are located in
Malabon, Navotas and Quezon City of Metro Manila and Bangui in Ilocos
Norte, northern Philippines, and Cabantian and Sasa in Davao City in the south.
The DOH also said from January to 21 Apr [2007], a total of 4858
dengue cases were admitted in different sentinel hospitals
nationwide. There were 54 reported deaths. This year's figure is 14.7
percent lower compared to the same period last year of 5696 cases
with 78 deaths, said DOH.
The DOH's dengue prevention and control measures include searching
and destroying all possible breeding of the mosquito vector,
self-protection measures like the use of mosquito repellent and other
protective gear, seeking early consultation and management of cases
and saying no to indiscriminate fogging, which can only be done if
there is an outbreak of dengue.
While dengue is considered an all year-round disease, the number of
cases increases mainly during rainy days when there are more breeding
places of the mosquito.

[The following note was received from Dr. Guillaumot in response to
the Fiji post in the 01 May 2007 Dengue/DHF update, archive no.
20070501.1409. - Mod.TY]
Dear Sir.
I would like to add a couple of comments about the dengue fever
problem in Fiji.
First this country has to face a particular problem regarding this
disease, since the 3 principal vectors are present : _Aedes aegypti_
itself, but also _Ae. albopictus_ (introduced at the end of the
1980s), and _Ae. polynesiensis_. This makes it much more difficult
to prevent the disease since the 2 latter species (although
considered less efficient vectors) breed not only in artificial
containers, but also in the wild in natural water collections
including land crab burrows for Ae. polynesiensis. Fiji also has 2
local vectors: _Ae. pseudoscutellaris_, and _Ae. rotumae_.
On another hand, I would like to support Dr Kiedrzinski's statement
about the usefulness of bed nets (insecticide impregnated ones if
possible) even when the mosquito vectors are diurnal biters. At least
3 categories of people spend time in bed during daytime and should be
protected by this means: i) Infants and young children, particularly
because many parents are reluctant to use insect repellents in this
case for fear of side-effects. ii) All people who take a midday nap
(as said in the comment), and many Pacific Islanders do so because
they generally begin their activities very early in the morning. iii)
And more important even, the sick people, either because they already
suffer from another disease and should be protected from the
devastating effects of dengue, or because they are infected by dengue
viruses and it is essential to prevent mosquitoes from biting them in
order to break the transmission cycle.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Guillaumot for his interesting and helpful
comments. Fiji does indeed face a serious challenge in accomplishing
dengue vector control, given the variety of various virus vectors
that are present there. His comments about the utility of bed nets
are well taken.

The WHO (World Health Organization) describes dengue fever as a
severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children, and
adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical features of dengue fever
vary according to the age of the patient. Infants and young children
may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash (although some
infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome, with
sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe
headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 deg C (104-105.8 deg F),
possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In
moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever
subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops,
followed by signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly
go into a critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or
quickly recover following appropriate volume replacement therapy.
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful
clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently
saves the lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive
supportive therapy, mortality may be reduced to less than one
percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid volume is the central
feature of DHF case management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact
sheet on dengue at:
