Information received on 15 Jun 2010 from Dr Toshiro Kawashima, CVO, Animal
Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

This report covers 10 new outbreaks of FMDV serotype O in the Miyazaki
prefecture. Their respective details, including start dates, species, and
number, in each of them, of susceptible animals, clinical cases and culled
animals, are to be found in the above URL.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 4601 / 10 / 0 / 4601 / 0
Cattle / 2597 / 18 / 0 / 2597 / 0

Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s):
Administrative division / Species / Total Vaccinated / Details
MIYAZAKI / Cattle / 45 944 / Oil-adjuvant killed vaccine against type O.
MIYAZAKI / Swine / 79 603 / Oil-adjuvant killed vaccine against type O.

The following epidemiological comments were included:
"Four outbreaks occurred outside (but nearby) a movement control area
around Kawaminami-cho in Miyazaki prefecture. All the cases showed typical
clinical signs and were confirmed by PCR.

"A movement restriction within 10 km around the outbreak in Saito city
(start date 21 May 2010) was lifted on 13 Jun 2010 because there has been
no outbreak in the area since 23 May 2010."

Two months into the outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] among
livestock here, local farmers are still reeling from the negative impact of
the widespread disease scare.

After an infected cow was 1st discovered in central Miyazaki Prefecture on
20 Apr 2010, the disease went on to spread to the prefectural city of
Miyakonojo, which lies in one of the nation's largest livestock areas on
the border with Kagoshima Prefecture, on 9 Jun 2010.

Scared of where the disease will hit next, farm producers are in the depths
of despair and fatigue, struggling with an invisible enemy.

"We're sorry, but we'd like you to interview us here," said Kazuaki Hazama,
chairman of Hazama Farm Co. in Miyakonojo, offering a chair to this
reporter in front of the entrance to the farm compound. Only employees of
the farm and sterile trucks are allowed entry into the farm, whose approach
is covered with lime hydrate for disinfection.

Hazama, 66, operates 31 farms mainly in Miyakonojo, owning some 90 000 head
of cattle and pigs. He is a self-made man, starting out as a farmer with
only 2 pigs 41 years ago and eventually leading the nation's shipments of
the trademark "Kinako Buta" brand pigs, which are fed on fodder mixed with
soybean flour (kinako). "I've met obstacles many times before, but the
terror of the latest FMD scare is like nothing else," said Hazama. "It's
like we've gone into a war."

In Miyakonojo, the 1st suspected cases were detected on 9 Jun 2010 in
cattle kept at a farm. The farm lies just across a river from 2 of the
farms owned by Hazama, where some 5500 "Kinako Buta" pigs are raised.

In a desperate bid to ward off airborne viruses, Hazama immediately
gathered his employees and ordered them to cover the barns with curtains.
By 10 Jun 2010, a total of 28 farms affiliated with Hazama Farm, including
the 2 farms on the river, fell within livestock movement and transport
restriction areas.

"Our monthly sales for June 2010 will be only about 5 percent of the usual
600 million yen [USD 6.5 million]," lamented Hazama.

A total of 1776 livestock farms in the city lie within the restriction
areas, with lime powder scattered around at their home entrances. Farmers
are scared of a possible reincarnation of the disaster in central Miyazaki
Prefecture, which was hit hardest by the disease.

In the town of Kawaminami in central Miyazaki, which lies about 60 km north
east of Miyakonojo, fields and shopping streets are still empty despite the
farming season. Noboru Kawakami, 57, a dairy farmer in the town, pointed to
a mound in a corner of his yard. Underneath the mound covered with lime
powder are 16 buried milk cows that were slaughtered following the outbreak
of the disease. He recalled the heavy rainy day when he had to put the cows
down. A short while after administering tranquilizer, he heard the cows
fall with a thud. They were then given a lethal injection and were lifted
with heavy machinery to be buried. Along with his 53 year old wife, his
morning routine used to involve cleaning up the barns, feeding cattle and
milking. "I still wake up at 5 am, but I've got nothing to do," he said.

Miyazaki and Hokkaido prefectures suffered FMD a decade ago. This year
[2010], South Korea and China also saw a spate of outbreaks of the disease.
Says Kawakami: "Have farmers, the administration and local residents taken
proper countermeasures (since the outbreak 10 years ago)? If we don't learn
from the latest lessons, the sacrifices that have been made will be wasted."

[It appears that the number of new outbreaks per day has gone down from 10
to 6 and, in tandem with the accomplished vaccination around the foci,
decreased to 2-3 per day. Further decrease is expected now when
post-vaccination immunity is established. - Mod.AS]
