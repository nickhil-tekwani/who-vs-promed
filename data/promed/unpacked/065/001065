[Since 13 May 2005, 9 outbreaks of FMD serotype Asia 1 have been officially
notified to the OIE by the Chinese authorities. They are located in 7
provinces, spread over distances of about 4000 km, from the far eastern
parts of China (Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei and Beijing) to the centre
(Gansu), midwest (Qinghai) and the far north west (Xinjiang autonomous
region), as follows:
No / report date / infected species / location (province)
1. 13 May 2005 / bov / Jiangsu province (east)
2. 13 May 2005 / bov / Shandong province (east)
3. 26 May 2005 / bov / Xinjiang (autonomous region, north-west)
4. 26 May 2005 / bov / Hebei province (east)

the north and north western borders (Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation,
and Mongolia). Readers are referred to FAO's evaluation of the current
