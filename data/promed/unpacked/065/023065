Blight outbreaks from dumps are on the rise
-------------------------------------------
More blight may be originating from outgrade piles as a result of
growers losing focus on control, according to Potato Council. "During
the 2003 season, blight scouts reported that over 18 percent of
outbreaks originated from outgrade piles. This led to a campaign to
target this major source of infection," notes Potato Council blight
specialist Gary Collins.

"The result was to reduce the level dramatically, with only 1.6
percent of outbreaks in 2007 attributed to outgrade piles. During
2008 the level rose to 5.8 percent, showing that everyone needs to be
vigilant when it comes to controlling any growth from this potential
blight source."

The rise in potatoes grown in allotments poses another risk for
growers. Mr Collins comments: "The credit crunch has increased the
trend in producing home-grown potatoes, grown in gardens and
allotments. This may result in increased levels of blight from areas
that are seldom treated."

There is still little evidence to suggest that recombination is
taking place in British crops, which would result in the formation of
oospores, but it is important to look out for the common signs, which
will indicate that blight possibly originated from this soil-borne
source.

"An early indication of infection from oospores will be many small
lesions affecting lower leaves that are touching, or close to, the
soil surface. Airborne blight typically affects the upper leaves
first. Infection will look particularly aggressive and needs urgent
treatment," warns Mr Collins. "Although the viability of oospores
over time in different British soils is not known, growers should
remain alert."

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop losses in
potato and tomato. The pathogen is spread by plant material
(including seed tubers), wind, and water. Volunteer potato plants,
which are often found on sites were crop residue is being dumped, may
serve as pathogen reservoirs and source of crop infection. PLB
disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed
tubers and crops. These treatments may be insufficient in home grown
potato crops.

Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present,
reproduction occurs sexually via oospores as well as asexually. A1 is
present worldwide, and a dramatic increase in the frequency of A2 in
western Europe is causing changes in the UK population of fungal
strains. Recombinants of A1 and A2 strains would emerge from the soil
affecting lower leaves first, in contrast to windborne spores, which
land on upper plant parts.

The item above describes several important sources of PLB inoculum,
which need to be addressed in disease management programmes. For more
information on PLB see links and previous ProMED-mail posts below.
