BOVINE MALIGNANT CATARRHAL FEVER: RFI

CONFIRMATION OF BMC VIRUS MULTIPLICATION ON TISSUE CULTURE
I am aware that this mailing list is not for the search of information as an
alternative to a literature search but information on the specific aspect
that we are interested in seemed to have dried up in the early 1980's.
As part of an ongoing project into the epidemiology of BMC the isolation of
the virus from wildebeest calves is attempted at present. Because some
unexpected results in respect of antibody response and PCR positive cattle
that do not develop symptoms have
been found, it is deemed necessary to isolate the virus from the specific
area and compare it with isolates from elsewhere.
To confirm the presence of virus in the tissue cultures (TC) PCR procedures
will be done but at a facility some 600km away. This means that material
will be sent by overnight express delivery.
Articles by Castro A E et al in the American Journal of Veterinary Research,
dated January 1982 and March 1984, refers to FA procedures to confirm the
presence of virus in the TC cells. At the time the authors used a FA
conjugate produced at the Plum Island Disease Center, Greenport, NY. No
literature of a more recent nature referring to the procedure or source of
FA conjugate could be found.
Since the Allerton Provincial Laboratory, where the virus isolation will be
attempted, has not got a PCR facility some other means of confirming the
presence of the virus in TC will be of value.
Is FA conjugate still used? If so is there a source for such a conjugate?
Are other relatively quick procedures available?
Any assistance will be appreciated.

For those whose knowledge of BMC (Bovine malignant catarrh) is rusty, James
kindly provided this additional information. MHJ]
Sorry. In this part of the world one gets used to terms etc that are
considered everyday for south (sub-Saharan) Africa.
Bovine Malinant Catarrhal fever (BMC)
Also refered to as Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), mainly in the nothern
hemisphere. Strictly speaking they are different.
Now you probably know what I refer to. A good and recent overview will be
found in:
Infectious diseases of livestock. Coetzer JAW, Thomson GR and
Tustin RC. Oxford University Press, 1994. (page 946)

MCF is a viral disease of cattle and deer with a worldwide distribution. It
is sheep associated and has been recognised first in the late 1800. In South
Africa we only see the disease very occasionally.
BMC is a wildebeest (primarily blue wildebeest) associated caused by a
herpes virus that is isolated with difficulty. In eastern Africa the disease
is of particular importance where in some areas and some years it is
estimated that the disease causes up to 20% mortality in cattle. The disease
is invariably fatal but morbidity is usually low.
Antigens can be detected by PCR and can be differentiated by this method.
