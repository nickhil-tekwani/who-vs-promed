Anthrax in animals has long been endemic in southern Kyrgyzstan, but
since 2006, an increasing number of human cases have been registered.
41 cases of anthrax in humans were registered in Kyrgyzstan in 2005;
15 in 2006; and 23 in 2007, according to Jalalidin Gaibulin, head of
the National Centre for Quarantine and Especially Dangerous
Infections (NCQEDI). As of 14 Aug 2008, the number of confirmed human
cases since May 2008 was 27, Gaibulin told IRIN in the capital,
Bishkek [As of 2 Aug 2008, there were 21 cases; see 20080807.2426. -
Mod.MHJ]. All patients had received treatment.

"If strict measures are not taken, there is a danger of mass
disease," said a senior official at the Agency for the Protection of
the Environment and Forestry, Kubanychbek Noruzbaev.

Prime Minister Igor Chudinov has ordered the establishment of a
special commission to design a programme to combat the spread of the
disease.

Anthrax spores are to be found in the soil in many areas, and these
spores are frequently ingested by animals, which then catch the
disease and can pass on the infection to humans. Factors identified
by specialists as promoting the spread of the disease include: late
or non-vaccination of cattle in the poorest regions; poor hygiene
standards and lack of veterinary supervision at local markets;
inadequate veterinary services; insufficient data on animals and
anthrax hotspots; and the failure of animal owners to register
newly-purchased cattle.

Nurlan Duisheev, deputy director-general of the Department of
Veterinary Medicine, said that "535 [historic] sites have been
documented, covered with concrete and fenced off," but that track had
been lost of many hotspots since World War II.

Duisheev said his department could not vaccinate all animals and
pointed out that currently the number of animals in Kyrgyzstan was
twice the number registered by the National Statistical Committee.
"We allocate vaccines according to National Statistical Committee
data and cannot give out additional drugs." He also said his
department faced a serious shortage of veterinarians: He only had 30
percent of the necessary 4000 veterinarians. Lack of funds was to
blame for his department's inability to fight the outbreak
successfully, he said. "We were able to buy only 2 000 650 doses of
anthrax vaccine [for animals] with the money allocated in the budget.
That is only 30 percent of the required amount. We requested 126
million soms [about USD 3.7 million] for the department's work, but
so far we have received less than half of the requested amount,"
Duisheev said.

Experts from the International Epizootic Bureau who conducted an
evaluation of the Kyrgyz veterinary service gave it a low score: 1-2
points out of a possible 5. Duisheev interpreted this as meaning
veterinary services in Kyrgyzstan were at a very low level.

"To implement all planned tasks [for 2008-2012] we need USD 42
million. During talks with representatives of the EU, the
International Epizootic Bureau, the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank, and a number of European states and members of international
community, verbal agreement to provide funds was given," said
Duisheev.

"We are very scared about anthrax among cattle and people. One person
has died," said Syrgak Kurmanbaev, 50, a resident of Nooken village,
Jalalabad Province. "There have been outbreaks of anthrax over several
years. We keep cattle, and we buy drugs and treat animals if there is
any sign of an infection. We try not to buy meat at the market," he
said.

[In 2007, they had, according to OIE, 1 168 026 cattle and vaccinated
1 028 500; sheep & goats: 4 251 813 (2 408 000 vaccinated); equids
around 360 000 (202 400); and vaccinated 17 000 of 74 918 pigs. With
the higher cost of gasoline/petrol, even with Russian subsidies, that
will eat into the ability of vaccinating teams to get out and do
their job. If they can persuade their Uzbek neighbours to mount an
effective vaccination programme, it would be logical to hit the
southwest in the oblasts adjoining Uzbekistan, where the disease is
common and the border porous. Similarly in the northern oblasts
adjoining Kazakhstan, it would be wise to move when the Kazakhs have
effective control programmes in their southern neighbouring oblasts.
The countries have to move together for any cost-effective livestock
control programme. It is not a simple problem. - Mod.MHJ
