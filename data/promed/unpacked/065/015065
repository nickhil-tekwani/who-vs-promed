Detection of macrolide resistant _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ in England, September 2014 to September 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Brown R, Macfarlane-Smith L, Phillips S, Chalker V.]

_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection can cause pneumonia, particularly in children. Global increase in macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ is of concern due to limited therapeutic options. We describe the detection of macrolide resistance-conferring mutations in 9.3 percent of 43 clinical specimens where _M. pneumoniae_ was detected in England and Wales from September 2014-September 2015. This study aims to impact by highlighting the presence of macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ positive patients, promoting increased clinical vigilance.

Background
----------
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ can be isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection, including pneumonia, and has also been associated with prolonged persistent cough and exacerbation of asthma [4]. _M. pneumoniae_ infections may manifest infrequently as extra-pulmonary sequelae after the onset of or even in the absence of respiratory illness [5]; including encephalitis [6], dermatological manifestations such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome [7], and haemolytic anaemia [8]. Asymptomatic carriage of _M. pneumoniae_ has been documented in nasopharyngeal swabs at low levels in England, e.g. at 0.25 percent based on PCR in a 2001 carriage study [9], however, a study from the Netherlands reported a much higher carriage rate (21.2 percent) [10]. In England and Wales, _M. pneumoniae_ infection can be found in all age groups, with a higher prevalence in children of school age [9]. In England and Wales, seasonal peaks of infection are detected from December to February each year with epidemics at approximately 4-yearly intervals, lasting 12 to 15 months [9]. A large increase in reported _M. pneumoniae_ cases was documented in several European countries, including England and Wales, in 2011 [11].

Discussion
----------
In the past 15 years, a significant increase in macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ has been reported globally, of increasing concern and importance to the international community [12]. In Asia, resistance rates of over 90 percent have been reported [13], particularly in China, whereas in Europe and North America resistance rates of up to 25 percent have been documented [14,15]. Macrolide-resistant strains of _M. pneumoniae_ have not been documented to show cross-resistance to other classes of antibiotics, i.e., tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones [16].

Prior to 2014, in the United Kingdom, 7 cases of macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ infections were reported between 2008 and 2011, 1 case in England and Wales and 6 cases in Scotland [1,2]. This is the 2nd report of macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ strains detected in England and Wales, with 1 case previously documented for a single patient specimen from 2008 [1]. Macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ has been reported in Scotland at 19 percent (6/32) [2], considerably higher than the 9.3 percent documented here. This may reflect low sample numbers or sampling differences and it is important to note that the specimens examined for macrolide resistance in Scotland were from patients in whom macrolide resistance was considered most likely based on their clinical presentation or history, being one of the following: repeated specimen positive, remaining symptomatic following antibiotic treatment, admitted to critical care or having an underlying condition.

In this study a high number of samples were from a single city in England and a local epidemic cannot be excluded. There is no requirement for referral of _M. pneumoniae_-positive specimens to the reference laboratory in England and Wales. Systematic testing and referral of positive specimens does not occur. Therefore regional comparison was not possible. Nonetheless, the focus of this article was to highlight macrolide resistance rather than a specific regional cluster analysis.

Macrolides are currently recommended as the 1st-line treatment for _M. pneumoniae_ infection in the UK [17]. The 2011 British Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community acquired pneumonia in children and adults suggest empirical macrolide treatment at any age if there is no response to 1st-line beta-lactam antibiotics or in the case of very severe disease [17,18]. Tetracyclines (minocycline and doxycycline) and fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) can be used to treat _M. pneumoniae_ infections as an alternative to macrolides when clinically relevant [19], however, their use in children is limited due to effects on bone toxicity and cartilage development, respectively [20,21].

We did not isolate _M. pneumoniae_ by culture from those specimens wherein _M. pneumoniae_ was detected by PCR and therefore we were not able to confirm phenotypic macrolide resistance. However, point mutations within the 23SrRNA gene in clinical specimens and isolates, including the A2058G mutation, have previously been shown to confer resistance [16]. Acquisition of resistance has been documented in patients receiving macrolides and resistance may develop as a consequence of antibiotic selective pressure [22]. This is supported by the highest macrolide resistance rates being reported in countries with extensive macrolide use [15]. Increased vigilance pertaining to macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ in the UK is recommended.

[The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail post Mycoplasma pneumoniae - China: (HK) schoolchildren 20141213.3031474:

_Mycoplasma_ are bacteria that lack a cell wall and are bounded only by the cytoplasmic membrane. _Mycoplasma_, too small (about 0.1 micron in diameter) to be detected by conventional microscopy, can be detected by DNA probe, enzyme immunoassay, real-time PCR assay (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=19403761&dopt=Abstract), and growth in vitro. However, isolation of these organisms in vitro can be difficult and may require up to 6 weeks. In vitro media must supply long-chain fatty acids and cholesterol that are required for cytoplasmic membrane synthesis. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including _M. pneumoniae_.

_M. pneumoniae_ commonly cause a mild acute upper respiratory infection with fever, nonproductive cough, pharyngitis, malaise, muscle pains, earache, and headache in children and young adults (http://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/atypical/mycoplasma/index.html). Radiologically confirmed pneumonia develops in 5-10 percent of cases. _M. pneumoniae_ accounts for 15-20 percent of community-acquired lower respiratory infection in adults that require hospitalization and probably an even greater proportion of those that do not require hospitalization. Approximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic. Extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias), neurologic (e.g., encephalitis), hematologic (hemolysis), and dermatologic findings (erythema multiforme) may occur rarely. Cold agglutinins may be present in the acute serum of 30-60 percent of patients.

Transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ infections probably occurs through close contact with contaminated respiratory droplets. Infections with _M. pneumoniae_ occur sporadically throughout the year, and outbreaks are most common during the late summer and early fall, typically in 4-7-year cycles (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00022322.htm). Spread of infection is common in households, schools, college dormitories and military bases where people are living together in close proximity. The prolonged incubation period for this pathogen of 2-4 weeks may contribute to protracted duration of outbreaks. Because _M. pneumoniae_ infection most commonly causes upper respiratory illness (only an estimated 3-10 percent of persons with infection experience pneumonia), infected persons often go about their normal activities and infect others.

Macrolides, tetracyclines (doxycycline), fluoroquinolones have been the antimicrobials of choice for _M. pneumoniae_ infections. However, macrolide resistance has been reported and appears be increasing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2223908/ and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/6/10-1558_article.htm). A real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect in clinical specimens the mutations that confer macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565909/). - Mod.ML
