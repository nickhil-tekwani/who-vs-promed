A 22-month-old toddler is in a stable condition in hospital with the 1st confirmed case of tetanus in a South Australian child in 17 years.

The state's chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips has urged parents to get their children fully vaccinated against tetanus and other diseases.

"Sadly, we have been notified of the 1st tetanus case in South Australia since 2013 and the 1st case in a child since 2000," he said. Professor Phillips confirmed the child was a boy but would not give any further details about the case.

SA Health said the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccination is given to children at 6 weeks, 4 months and 6 months, with booster doses at 18 months, 4 years, and in year 8.

"Childhood vaccinations are particularly vital as children are more susceptible to illness and early immunization can prevent deaths in childhood as well as disease and disability later in life," Professor Phillips said. "Some people have concerns about vaccination, but they should be reassured that the risk from getting a disease far outweighs the risk from immunizing against it."

Tetanus is caused by bacteria whose spores are found in soil, and human and animal feces entering the body through cuts and open wounds. Symptoms include painful muscle spasms, initially of the muscles of the neck and jaw and later in torso muscles.

[This ProMED report, the 2nd from Australia in a month, underscores the need for appropriate follow up immunization for another vaccine preventable disease, tetanus. ProMED-mail has been active in reporting similar issues related to pertussis and measles in the developed world as well as the increase in poliomyelitis in parts of the developing world, all primarily related to under vaccination.

It is not specifically stated that the toddler was unvaccinated but it is likely that this is the case. The case underscores the need for primary vaccination against this disease and many others. In addition, routine boosters for tetanus during office visits or hospitalizations for any reason must be utilized to prevent these cases, and trauma-related opportunities for tetanus protection should not be missed. - Mod.LL
