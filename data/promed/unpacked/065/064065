With the arrival of the monsoon, typhoid cases have spiked in Telangana, and health officials are blaming the beloved street food 'pani puri' for the rise in the number of reported cases. During May 2022, 2700 cases were typhoid cases reported in Telangana and this number stood at 2752 cases during June 2022. Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, has referred to typhoid as "pani puri disease". The government is advising people to avoid street food, especially pani puri, during monsoon. Dr Rao also said that vendors should ensure hygiene and use only safe drinking water.

Contaminated water, food, and mosquitoes are the main causes of seasonal monsoon-related diseases such as malaria, acute diarrheal diseases (ADDs), and viral fevers reported in the past few weeks. Telangana has registered more than 6000 cases of diarrheal disease and is also seeing an upward trend in dengue cases.

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by the _Salmonella_ Typhi bacterium, from defiled food or water. At an early stage, typhoid symptoms include prolonged high fever, severe pain in the stomach, headache, diarrhea or constipation, and reduced appetite.
If not treated immediately, the symptoms can worsen and lead to fatigue, pale skin, vomiting blood, and even internal bleeding.

It's been only a few weeks of monsoon in India, and there has been a spike in a plethora of waterborne and foodborne infections such as typhoid and jaundice. The contaminated food or water contains disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens. Apart from these, the risk of mosquitoborne diseases such as dengue and malaria also increases during this time. Here are some important steps to prevent yourself from these diseases.

["Panipuri (also called phuchka, Gupshup, golgappa, or pani ka potash) is a type of snack that originates from India and is one of the most common street foods there. It generally consists of a round hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion, or chickpeas." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panipuri).

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is often reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity between the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial-resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). Vaccines are available for prevention. - Mod.LL
