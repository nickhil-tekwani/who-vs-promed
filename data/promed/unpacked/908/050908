A Willow Creek girl becomes one of the few who've ever lived through
the deadly virus. It started with a stomachache. An 8-year-old who
lives in Willow Creek with her grandparents, 3 siblings, and a cousin,
had been complaining about tummy troubles, so her grandfather took her
to the local clinic. Assuming she had the flu, her doctor advised the
usual treatment -- rest, fluids -- and sent her home.

Soon, new symptoms began to appear. Around 3 in the morning on Sat 30
Apr 2011, the 8-year-old woke her grandparents complaining that her
neck and back were hurting. "I thought she might have just slept on it
wrong, so I told her to go back and lay down," her grandmother, told
the Journal by phone Tuesday [24 May 2011]. Come daylight, however,
the girl wasn't any better, so her grandpa drove her over the hill to
Mad River Hospital.

Doctors performed tests but, given her stomachache and muscle
soreness, they, too, assumed the girl had the flu. Once again her
grandfather brought her home. "At lunch time, I was fixing all the
kids lunch, and she said she felt like she was going to get sick to
her stomach," he recalled. "She got up from the table and her legs
just collapsed on her. She looked at me surprised. She just wasn't
functioning right." The family helped the girl onto the couch, and
over the next few hours they kept offering her water. But every time
the girl took a sip she would vomit it back up. By 8 p.m. she couldn't
talk and was barely moving. Around 10 p.m. her grandfather tried to
prop the girl upright on the couch, but she immediately slumped over,
"like she was paralyzed." That's when he knew something was seriously
wrong. "I said, 'This is no damn flu.'" Indeed it wasn't. The
following morning, the girl was flown 200 miles [322 km] south to the
UC [University of California] Davis Medical Center where, almost a
week later, doctors determined that she had contracted rabies.

Human rabies cases have become exceedingly rare in the United States,
thanks in large part to vaccinations of domestic animals. The most
recent human case in California was 9 years ago, according to the
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The girl's case is the
1st from Humboldt County.

The viral disease affects the central nervous system and is typically
transmitted to humans from the bite of a rabid animal (bats and skunks
are most common, though any mammal can contract the disease). After
infection, symptoms can appear in as little as 9 days, or they can
take a year or more to show up. At first these symptoms are typical of
many illnesses -- fever, headache, general malaise -- but as the
disease progresses it starts to cause neurological problems. These
vary dramatically from case to case, but they can include insomnia,
anxiety, confusion, fear of water, partial paralysis, difficulty
swallowing, hallucinations, and more. Once these symptoms appear,
death from respiratory failure is usually imminent.

"Up until a few years ago we would have said quite definitively that
rabies is 100 percent fatal," said Dr Curtis Fritz, a public health
veterinarian with the CDPH. The 1st human ever to survive rabies
without a vaccination was a Wisconsin teenager. This 15-year-old made
worldwide headlines in 2004 after doctors saved her life by medically
inducing a coma to protect the brain while her body fought off the
virus. This method, which came to be called the Milwaukee protocol, is
exactly what doctors at UC Davis used to save Humboldt 8-year-old.

[This report fills in some details missing from the preceding report
of this case in ProMED-mail (archive no 20110524.1576). It does not
reveal, however, the source of the child's infection or the lapse of
time between exposure and development of symptoms of rabies virus
infection. The present condition of the patient is not revealed.

The Milwaukee protocol is an experimental course of treatment of an
acute infection of rabies in a human being. The treatment involves
putting the patient into a chemically induced coma and administering
antiviral drugs. It was developed and named by Rodney Willoughby Jr
following the successful treatment of a Wisconsin teenager bitten by a
bat. The Wisconsin teenager became the 1st of only 5 patients now
known to have survived symptomatic rabies without receiving rabies
vaccine.

There were 2 survivors out of 25 patients treated under the original
Milwaukee protocol. A further 10 patients have been treated under a
modified protocol and there have been another 2 survivors. Further
details of the protocol used to treat the Humboldt County patient and
the present condition of the patient are awaited. - Mod.CP]
