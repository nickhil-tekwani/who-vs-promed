Over 250 individuals in Villareal town in Samar [Eastern Visayas region] are believed to have been afflicted with chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease with symptoms similar to those of dengue fever.

The Department of Health (DoH) in Eastern Visayas has deployed Regional Prevention and Control Program (RPCP) teams to investigate the spread of the disease in Villareal as well as in Catarman, Northern Samar, and San Juan, Southern Leyte, where cases were also reported early this week.

Roderick Boyd S. Cerro, DoH-8 regional sentinel nurse, said 235 people in Barangay Banquil and 28 in Guintarcan Island in Samar showed symptoms of the disease.

"The disease was reported by the municipal health office in November [2012]. They raised an alarm over the quick spread of the disease in December last year [2012] and early this month [January 2013]," he said.

He said 12 of the 28 cases reported in Guintarcan Island were confirmed to be chikungunya [virus infections] based on laboratory results from the Regional Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

Chikungunya, a dengue-like disease, has also been reported in Northern Mindanao, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, National Capital Region, Calabarzon, Bicol, Western Visayas, Davao and Caraga.

Mr. Cerro said chikungunya causes fever and a skin rash similar to dengue and mostly affects adults. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), chikungunya is a viral disease spread by mosquitoes that causes fever and severe joint pain. Its symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rashes.

Signs and symptoms include an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by joint pain. Illness usually occurs 4-8 days after a mosquito bite and can range from 2-12 days.

"There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Although it is not as deadly as dengue, patients are advised to seek immediate medical help," Mr. Cerro said.

[This outbreak appears to have been going on for over 2 months. There were sporadic outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections last year (2012) in various parts of the Philippines. Chikungunya virus is doubtless endemic in the Philippines, having caused sporadic outbreaks in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985 to 1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120929.1315954), mainly in the center and south areas of the country. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
