The Narok district livestock officer, Dr David Wekesa, announced an
outbreak of the deadly contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) disease in
the area. He said the outbreak was as a result of cattle grazing and trade
across the Tanzania-Kenya border.
Wekesa named Maji Moto, Olkinyei and the Masai Mara ranches as the prime
areas having been hit by the disease. He said his officers were working
round the clock to prevent the disease from spreading further.
Wekesa was speaking in Mara division during a farmers demonstration day
organized by group ranches. He appealed to livestock farmers to co-operate
with his officers and minimize the movement of stock to Tanzania.
Wekasa said vaccination of animals against the disease was being done free
of charge. He announced his department had lifted a quarantine it imposed
following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the area.
The chairmen of the group ranches, Mr Joseph ole Pariken and John Sayaton,
said the community had lost large herds of cattle to the disease and
thanked the Government for the prompt action taken to arrest the situation.
Meanwhile, livestock farmers in Narok have asked the Government to speed up
the re-opening of the Kenya Meat Commission. The farmers lamented they
greatly suffered at the hands of middlemen since the factory was closed
more than 12 years ago.
The farmers accused the government of not being serious about the
re-opening of the factory despite several statements that it would do so.

[Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia is a highly contagious pneumonia caused
by _Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides_ small colony type.
Susceptible cattle become infected by inhaling droplets disseminated by
coughing of affected cattle. In acute cases signs include fever up to 107
degrees F (41.5 C), anorexia, and painful, difficult breathing. Respiration
is rapid, and shallow. If the animal is forced to move quickly the
breathing becomes more distress and a soft moist cough may result. The
disease progresses rapidly, animals lose condition, and breathing becomes
very labored with a grunt at expiration. The animals becomes recumbent and
dies after 1 to 3 weeks. Chronically affected animals usually exhibit signs
of varying intensity for 3 to 4 weeks after which the lesions gradually
resolve and the cattle appear to recover.
Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, the complement fixation test and
necropsy lesions. Confirmation is by histopathology, detection of organisms
in pleural fluid using dark field microscopy, isolation of the organism
form lung or pleural fluid or demonstration of specific antigens in lung
tissue by immunodiffusion or immunofluorescence and hyperimmune
antigalactan serum.
In countries where cattle movement can readily be restricted, the disease
can be eradicated by quarantine, blood testing, and immunization with an
attenuated vaccine. Where cattle cannot be confined, the spread of
infection can be limited by vaccination.
Treatment is recommended only in endemic areas because the organisms may
not be eliminated, and carriers may develop. - Mod. TG]
