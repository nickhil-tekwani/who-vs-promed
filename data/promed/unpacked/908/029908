9 more kindergartens in Sarawak have been ordered to close temporarily as a
preventive measure to avert the spread of hand, foot and mouth (HFM)
disease in the state. Deputy chief minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan said
Thursday that this brought to 10 the number of kindergartens that had been
ordered closed, including one that was closed last week.
"As of now, there are a total of 6 kindergartens in Kuching and 4 in
Bintulu that have been asked to close," he told reporters after launching
the RM10 million [USD 2.7 million] Sarawak Information Systems Sdn Bhd
(Sains) Data Centre here.
Dr Chan said that yesterday, a 1 year old baby from Mukah was confirmed
dead with symptoms related to the deadly enterovirus 71 (EV71), one of the
virus strains related to the HFM that killed 29 children under 5 years old
in Sarawak in 1997.
Without revealing the gender of the baby, he said the Sarawak Health
Department was doing laboratory tests to confirm the exact cause of death,
whether it was due to EV71 or other HFM virus strains. Dr Chan said 4
deaths had been recorded since January 2006, including the latest case in
Mukah yesterday, with one death confirmed to be due to EV71 while the other
2 were confirmed to be due to HFM-related disease but without the presence
of EV71. He said all the HFM cases in Sarawak were in the town areas. He
assured the public that the Sarawak Health Department had the capability to
handle HFM disease based on the 1997 experience.

[HFM disease is a common childhood illness. In 1997, a severe outbreak of
HFM took place in the same state in Malaysia (Sarawak; see also:
19970615.1256). Among other enteroviruses, EV 71 and coxsackievirus A16 are
the 2 major pathogens. HFM is usually spread by person-to-person contact.
In the current situation, any kindergarten affected by the disease should
be closed for thorough decontamination. - Mod.RY]
