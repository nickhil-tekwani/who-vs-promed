Anthrax outbreak affects hippos in the Kruger National Park
-----------------------------------------------------------
The South African National Parks (SANParks) said in a statement today [5 Nov 2012] that the anthrax outbreak that started in late August [2012] in the north of the Kruger National Park (KNP) has claimed the lives of 30 hippopotami in the Letaba and Olifants Rivers in the past 2 weeks. Post mortem results from some of the carcases, suggest they were infected by the bacteria.

Reynold Thakhuli, spokesman for SANParks said a total of 30 hippo carcases have been found up to now and Park Rangers are closely monitoring the situation. "Members of the public are urged to report any sightings to the nearest camp and not to touch the carcases. The State Veterinarians are busy examining 6 carcases that were found over the weekend [3-4 Nov 2012] and will issue the results as soon as they're available."

According to Thakhuli anthrax outbreaks are a natural occurrence in the northern Kruger National Park and occur more or less every 10 years, apparently related to the end of dry cycles. It usually occurs during the dry months of the year. Since 1960, 8 major anthrax outbreaks have occurred in the KNP (1960, 1970, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2010 and 2012).

It is also closely linked to population density -- when certain species like kudu and hippo reach high densities then anthrax spreads more rapidly. The disease is also the only disease in KNP that needs to kill its host in order to propagate itself. In all the outbreaks before the disease naturally dissipates when the rains start and when animal densities decrease, so it can be considered a "natural regulator" of animal densities. The current outbreak has seen relatively low numbers of cases in relation to population sizes of species affected.

During the previous outbreak of 2010 in the Nxanatseni region it is estimated that approximately 2000 animals died.

"The Kruger National Park rangers are currently monitoring the situation on a daily basis to determine if they are more carcases in the rivers," concludes Thakhuli.

[Our thanks to Michael for forwarding this report and the following news report:
http://www.examiner.com/article/thirty-hippos-die-anthrax-outbreak-at-kruger-national-park

It is now November and these deaths were first noted in August. Hopefully the KNP people have an official confirmation, or not, by now. We look forward to hearing from them. Earlier outbreaks this year (2012) were reported in Roan antelopes (ProMED-mail post 20120829.1271244) and buffaloes (ProMED-mail posting 20120906.1283767).

Anthrax is seen sporadically most years in the KNP, usually affecting kudu and such, but traditionally with severe outbreaks every 10 years or so. For anyone interested there are 2 useful papers on the subject:
