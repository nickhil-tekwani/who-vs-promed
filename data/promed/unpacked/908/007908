OIE rarely has any anthrax data from Uzbekistan; at best the Uzbeks will admit it is there, but nothing more. The control is minimal, which is why it regularly overflows into bordering SE Kyrgyzstan in the Fergana Valley. As this outbreak involved humans in a popular tourist area of the republic, it made the press in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. - Mod.MHJ
