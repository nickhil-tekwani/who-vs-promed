Various brands of pie and tart shells are being recalled due to the presence of _E. coli_. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says the shells are produced by Edmonton-based Harlan Bakeries and were sold across Canada. The Deep Dish Pie Shells, Sweetened Tart Shells and Tart Shells are sold under the Great Value, Apple Valley, Western Family and No Name brands.

The CFIA says the best-before dates on the affected shells range from 24 November 2017 to 21 December 2017. The federal agency says there have been no confirmed illnesses associated with these products.

Food contaminated with _E. coli_ O121 may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, mild to severe abdominal cramps and watery to bloody diarrhea.

[To this point, the Public Health Agency of Canada has confirmed 27 cases of _E. coli_ O121 infections across 5 Canadian provinces since November 2016 that have been linked to flour produced by Ardent Mills Canada. A 28th victim was a visitor to the country. A total of 7 of the outbreak victims were hospitalized, but are recovering. No deaths have been reported in relation to the outbreak.

_E. coli_ O121 is a Shiga toxin-producing strain of _E. coli_. In recent years, according to the CDC, it has been responsible for outbreaks associated with flour, frozen foods and raw clover sprouts.

Provinces reporting illnesses and the number of cases in each are:
British Columbia, 12;
Saskatchewan 4;
Alberta 5;
Ontario 1; and
Newfoundland and Labrador. - Mod.LL
