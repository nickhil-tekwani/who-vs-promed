West Nile virus in birds in Cuba in 2004
---------------------------------------------
Researchers from the Smithsonian Institution reportedly confirmed West Nile
virus in 3 birds ("2 red-legged thrushes and a little blue heron") in Cuba
during field work conducted in 2004.
The Smithsonian Press Release in an edited form is reproduced below.

Scientists track West Nile on its southward spread
---------------------------------------------
Ecologist Peter Marra of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center
(SERC) found West Nile virus antibodies in resident birds species collected
in Cuba and Puerto Rico during field work conducted in 2004.
In Puerto Rico, Marra's team found 2 resident birds, a bananaquit and a
green heron, with antibodies to the virus, and in Cuba, 2 red-legged
thrushes and a little blue heron tested positive for antibodies.
"It's the 1st year we've looked in Cuba," Marra said, "but it's only 90
miles from Miami, Florida, where birds have tested positive for at least 2
years." The researchers expected to find signs of the virus in Cuba, but
the recent test results provide the 1st confirmed evidence that the virus
is there.
"One of the most perplexing issues in the West Nile virus story thus far
has been its behavior in tropical regions," said Marra, "We just aren't
seeing the same sort of bird, horse or human impacts as we did in temperate
areas. This is a huge relief, since wildlife and people have already been
seriously impacted from the effects of habitat destruction. Understanding
why West Nile's lethal effects appear to be reduced in the tropics is
something we're preparing to study."
