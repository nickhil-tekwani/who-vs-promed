The number of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases reported in
China this year [2008] jumped to 16 778 as of Wednesday [7 May 2008],
resulting in 28 deaths, according to a Xinhua tally of local official
figures. The figure stood at 15 799 on Monday [5 May 2008], Xinhua found.

The rising number was not a sign of a deteriorating situation but
mainly due to a recent order by the Ministry of Health that made HFMD
a class C epidemic, the incidence of which must be reported.

The northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reported 131 sporadic
infections, according to Wang Wenrui, an official with the region's
disease control and prevention center. The local government has
ordered the shut down of all kindergartens and the implementation of
morning inspections at primary schools in the worst-hit Dengkou
County until the epidemic eases.

Tianjin reported 134 HFMD cases, including 113 children below 5 years
old. A local health official said the disease occurs annually in the
city, usually increasing starting in April and peaking in the summer.

The northwestern Qinghai Province also reported 9 HFMD infections,
which were not triggered by EV71 on the basis of medical tests. The 9
children were receiving treatment in a hospital in the provincial
capital Xining.

In the worst-hit province of Anhui in east China, the total number of
infections has risen to 6545. Currently, 104 patients remain in
critical condition, and 3166 have been released from hospital.

So far, EV71 [human enterovirus 71] is blamed for most of the 28
deaths in the outbreak of the disease. Of all the victims, 22 were in
Anhui and 3 in Guangdong, with the rest in Zhejiang, Guangxi, and
Hunan. The epidemic has spread to nearly 20 provinces across the
country. Experts and officials kept asking the public not to panic
and to help children adopt preventive sanitary measures.

Some 79 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have been
detected so far in Macao, 4 of which were confirmed as enterovirus 71
(EV71) infections, local health authorities announced Wednesday [7 May 2008].

The most severe outbreak of the disease occurred at a local creche,
with 14 pupils diagnosed with HFMD, and the fecal samples from 4 of
these young patients tested positive for the highly contagious EV71,
according to a press statement released by the Disease Preventive and
Control Center of Macao's Health Bureau (SSM).

HFMD is caused by more than one type of virus, and most of the cases
involve young children, according to information posted on the
website of China's Health Ministry.

EV71 is one of the most common viruses that can cause HFMD, which
usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in
the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. If the disease develops,
it can lead to death [but only rarely].

To date, none of the young patients from the creche are in critical
condition, and none need to be admitted to hospital, the SSM said in
the statement, adding that most of them have recovered. The SSM 1st
confirmed the occurrence of HFMD at the creche last Friday.

HFMD has led to 28 deaths in China as of Wednesday morning [7 May
2008], according to Xinhua's tally based on confirmed death reports
from provincial-level health bureaus. The outbreak of HFMD has led to
fatalities, mostly in the eastern province of Anhui, where 22
children died after having been infected with EV71. Three deaths were
in the southern province of Guangdong and one in east China's
Zhejiang Province.

Enterovirus in China -- update -- 7 May 2008
---------------
As of 5 May [2008], 4496 cases, including 22 deaths, of hand, foot
and mouth disease (HFMD) due to enterovirus 71 (EV71) have been
reported among infants and young children in Fuyang City, Anhui
Province, China. There are currently 1391 cases receiving medical
care in hospital, with no additional deaths for 5 consecutive days.

HFMD became a notifiable disease in China on 2 May [2008]. Because of
this change in reporting policy and the increased awareness of the
general public about the disease, it is expected there will be an
increase in the number of reported cases in the next weeks and months
from Anhui province and the rest of China.

The Government of China has assured WHO of its strong technical and
political commitment to control the disease in Anhui and other
provinces. In addition to enhanced surveillance, as there is no
specific treatment for enterovirus infections and a vaccine is not
currently available, a nation-wide health campaign is ongoing,
stressing the need for personal hygiene, especially hand washing.
Additional resources have also been provided to paediatric health
care providers by the Ministry of Health.

HFMD is a common and usually mild childhood disease. EV71 is a
frequent cause of HFMD epidemics associated with neurological disease
in a small proportion of cases. There have been a number of outbreaks
of EV71 HFMD in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Outbreaks have
been reported in Malaysia (1997), Taiwan , China (1998), Australia
(1999) and Singapore (2000) among other areas in the region.

WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade
restrictions relating to China while reinforcing the need for
prevention through enhanced personal hygiene.

[The increased number of reported cases is not a sign of a
deteriorating situation, but is mainly due to a recent order by the
Ministry of Health that made HFMD a class C epidemic, the incidence
of which must be reported. Twenty provinces are now experiencing
outbreaks of HFMD, and the death toll has risen to 28. The new
fatalities are spread through several provinces, while the death toll
in Anhui, the worst hit province, remains at 22.
