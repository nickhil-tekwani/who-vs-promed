West Nile Virus Death in Israel
--------------------------------
JERUSALEM: An 84-year-old man died this week of complications [following
infection with West Nile virus, the virus affecting the New York City area
at the present time. Despite [alarmist newspaper headlines and long
reports on the radio, [medical experts stated that West Nile virus is
common in this region, and most Israelis have developed immunity.
Severe infections of West Nile virus can result in encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the brain's
lining and the spinal cord. While downplaying the severity in Israel,
officials are taking steps to stop the spread. The Health Ministry said it
is working with local authorities to increase spraying against mosquitoes,
which carry the disease to humans after biting infected birds.
Agriculture Ministry workers destroyed a flock of 3 000 infected geese at a
farm in the center of the country on Monday [28 Aug 2000, said the
director of the ministry's veterinary services, Dr. Oded Nir. He said
farm-grown flocks are immunized, but it is much more difficult to deal with
free birds. Israel is on a main bird migration route.
Professor Eitan Rubinstein, director of the infectious disease department
at Sheba Hospital outside Tel Aviv, where the man died, said West Nile
disease usually causes mild flu-like symptoms and clears up by itself in a
few days, leaving lifelong immunity. The Health Ministry said 2 residents
of Tel Aviv were diagnosed with serious complications from the virus last
year. Rubinstein said that "more than one died, for certain." Older
immigrants to Israel are more vulnerable. The elderly and infirm are at
risk of developing complications, like encephalitis and meningitis, said
Dr. Alex Levental, director of public health services at the Health Ministry.

information on the nature of the vaccine would be welcomed. -Mod.CP

A Comment from Dr Eleanor Kellon
------------------------------------
The statement by Prof Rubenstein with regard to "lifelong immunity"
[stimulated me to undertake a literature search for references on duration
of immunity/lifelong immunity, but with no success. Does anyone have
information on this?
In the course of that search 2 [unrelated articles were uncovered which
may be of interest. One describes persistent infection in monkeys, which
could have implications in regard to testing of clinical cases that do not
appear during mosquito active months. [Study on West Nile virus persistence
in monkeys. Pogodina VV, Frolova MP, Malenko GV, Fokina GI, Koreshkova GV,
Kiseleva LL, Bochkova NG, Ralph NM. Arch Virol 1983;75(1-2):71-86.
The other describes infection via the oral route in mice, yet another
potential route for birds of prey (such as the early hawk case this
year)and scavengers [Odelola HA, Oduye OO. West Nile virus infection of
adult mice by oral route. Arch Virol 1977;54(3):251-3.

[Dr Kellin highlights an interesting gap in knowledge with regard to
immunological responses to West Nile virus infection in humans and animals.
