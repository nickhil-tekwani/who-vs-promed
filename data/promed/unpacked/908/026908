[In 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 detected in Dalmatian pelicans has been reported by Russia, Bulgaria and Romania. Reports of these detections can be seen in the interactive disease outbreak map at http://tinyurl.com/n83lwf8 (click on in the region of interest and zoom in).

There is a high probability that the current subtype is similar to that reported in Astrakhan Oblast by Russia on 27 Apr 2015, which was identified as H5N1 (ProMED-mail post 20150429.3330986). This outbreak, reported by Russia on 27 Apr 2015, was located in the southern border of the Astrakhan Oblast, which is bordered by the Caspian Sea, by Kazakhstan to the east, by the Volgograd Oblast to the north, and the Republic of Kalmykia to the west. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan_Oblast

The Akzhayik Nature Reserve is located in the delta of the Ural River on the coast of the Caspian Sea and covers a huge area of 111 500 hectares (11 948 000 acres). It has hundreds of shallow lakes surrounded by high reeds, reed mace [bulrushes or cattails] and shrubs. Its territory is in the path of the East-Siberian-African flyway of migrating birds every spring and autumn. The nature reserve contains nesting grounds for river and diving ducks, gray geese and swans. Rare and endangered species of birds breed in safety in coastal and water ecosystems there, including pink and curly pelicans, yellow and small egrets, spoonbills, glossy ibis and sultans. Thousands of flamingos and pelicans rest there during their migration seasons. http://www.astanatimes.com/2012/12/akzhayik-reserve-will-join-unesco-biosphere-list/

In March 2006, Kazakhstan reported an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in wild swans in the region of Mangyshlak. The summary report and map of this previous outbreak is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=4603. - Mod.CRD
