According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, 1 human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by the state of Texas. The person was infected with an influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus.

This H3N2v virus was detected through the Department of Defense Global, Laboratory-based Influenza Surveillance Program. The patient became ill with respiratory symptoms in February 2017, was not hospitalized, and has fully recovered from the illness. Swine contact at an agricultural event was reported in the week preceding the illness onset. This is the 1st H3N2v virus infection detected in the United States in 2017.

Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are usually mild and similar to those of seasonal flu viruses, but as with seasonal flu, complications can lead to hospitalization and death. Symptoms include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, as well as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some populations are at higher risk of developing complications if they get influenza, including children younger than 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions.

The incubation period (the time it takes from exposure to illness) for this influenza is typically similar to seasonal influenza at about 2 days, but may be up to 10 days. Currently, there is no vaccine for H3N2v and the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against H3N2v. Antiviral drugs are effective in treating H3N2v virus infections. Early treatment works best and may be especially important for people with a high risk condition.

2016-2017 Influenza Season Week 17 [ending 29 Apr 2017]
-------------------------------------------------------
One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by the state of Texas. The person was infected with an influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus. The patient became ill with respiratory symptoms in February 2017, was not hospitalized, and has fully recovered from their illness. Swine contact at an agricultural event was reported in the week preceding illness onset. This is the 1st H3N2v virus infection detected in the United States in 2017.

Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from humans. Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.

[Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called "variant" viruses when they are found in people. Influenza A H3N2 variant viruses (also known as "H3N2v" viruses) with the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were 1st detected in people in July 2011. The viruses were 1st identified in U.S. pigs in 2010. During 2011, 12 human infections with H3N2v were detected.

During 2012, there were multiple outbreaks of H3N2v resulting in 309 reported cases. Sporadic infections with H3N2v have continued to be detected since that time. Infections with H3N2v have mostly been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has been detected in the past as well but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified at this time. It's possible that sporadic infections and even localized outbreaks among people with this virus will continue to occur. As per the data available from CDC webpage; https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-case-count.htm, this is the first H3N2v case reported from Texas. - Mod.UBA
