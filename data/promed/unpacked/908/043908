Virginia: Two Cases of La Crosse Encephalitis Contracted in West Virginia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two children in Virginia have been diagnosed with La Crosse encephalitis, a
mosquito-borne disease similar to West Nile virus infection [but caused by
an unrelated virus]. One case involves a child under 15 from Augusta
County, the other a child from Tazewell County. State health officials
declined to release any other details.
Unlike West Nile virus-associated disease, which is more common in older
people, La Crosse encephalitis cases are seen predominantly in children
under 16 years of age. The diseases share similar symptoms: headaches,
fever, neck stiffness and confusion. But West Nile virus infection, in the
elderly, spreads to the nervous system and [circulatory system], making it
potentially fatal. Adults and children may not have any symptoms.
Roy Campbell of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
stated that La Crosse encephalitis symptoms often are misdiagnosed or
under-diagnosed. Generally, the disease is mild. However, long-term effects
could include learning disabilities, seizures and permanent brain damage.
Compared to West Nile virus infection, the fatality rate is far less. Fewer
than 1 percent of those infected by La Crosse virus die. In contrast, to
date this year, 2267 people nationwide have been diagnosed with West Nile
virus infection; 44 have died. In Virginia this year, four people have been
diagnosed and none have died.
Doug Larsen, health director for Central Shenandoah Health District, said
the victim from the Churchville area of Tazewell County contracted the
disease while in West Virginia. Since 1974, when the disease first [came
under surveillance], only about 3000 cases, or 79 a year, have been
reported nationwide. West Virginia has felt the brunt of it with about 435
cases. 16 cases have been documented in Virginia in that period. "We were
relieved to know he contracted the disease from where La Crosse
encephalitis is known to be," Larsen said. "We don't feel there's any risk
in this area."
First identified in 1963 in La Crosse (Wisconsin) scientists say the
disease is usually transmitted by infected mosquitos and small animals,
such as squirrels and chipmunks in oak forest areas. "Anything that comes
into West Nile testing will be tested for La Crosse encephalitis," said
Suzanne Jenkins, epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health.
Neither of the diseases are expected to subside until the weather changes.

[The viruses responsible for La Crosse encephalitis and West Nile fever are
not related. La Crosse virus is classified in the genus _Bunyavirus_ of the
family _Bunyaviridae_, whereas West Nile virus is a member of the
genus_Flavivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_. The former viruses have
tripartite negative sense RNA genomes, whereas the latter have positive
sense non-segmented RNA genomes. As a consequence the bunyaviruses have the
potential to interchange genome segments during replication thereby
increasing their potential for rapid variation. Biologically, these viruses
are transmitted by different vectors and have different intermediate hosts.
