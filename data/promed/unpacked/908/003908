At an annual Preventive Medicine Conference in Atlanta last Saturday, which
was sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr.
Gregory Gray, a medical epidemiologist for the US Department of Defense,
said that tracking disease in military personnel can predict epidemics in
the US population at large. New strains of HIV imported into the US have
been traced to military personnel. A particularly deadly strain of
influenza that caused millions of deaths around the world in 1918 was
spread to the US population by troops returning from World War I.
The Defense Department, the CDC, and the World Health Organization are
working to improve surveillance of emerging infections at military bases
around the world. Adenovirus (a respiratory virus), _Mycoplasma_ pneumonia
(a contagious disease of children and young adults), influenza, and
drug-resistant _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus_ (common disease-causing
bacteria) are especially important to watch, said Gray. The effectiveness
of vaccines and prophylactic (disease-preventing) antibiotics are also
under study.
Despite preventive efforts, epidemics still plague the military.
Respiratory illness is the number one threat, the investigators noted. In
1996, 77% of the freshman class at the US Merchant Marine Academy was
diagnosed with acute _Mycoplasma_ pneumonia. Four years ago, the USS
Arkansas sailed into San Diego harbor with the commanding officer and most
of the crew incapacitated by influenza. Ninety-nine percent of the crew had
received the flu vaccine, but they encountered a new strain in the South
Pacific -- and they brought it back to the US.
"Military populations, by their nature, aggregate people from around the
country," Gray said. "There's tremendous opportunity for pathogens to be
mixed in this setting, with close contact and person-to-person
transmission." Surveillance should be used to guide preventive action, he
commented. In the 1970s, adenovirus was found to cause about 10% of all
trainees to be hospitalized, so a vaccine was developed. It was used for
many years, until the manufacturer recently decided to stop producing it.
"We've lost a vaccine which was very effective, and we're now having a
number of epidemics," Gray warned. "Surveillance systems at crowded recruit
training sites told us what happened as a result.... Adenovirus causes
severe infections, high fevers, and incapacitates trainees. We're now
moving to find a new manufacturer for an adenovirus vaccine, but it will be
4 or 5 years before we have one."

[The disease surveillance of military -- and prison -- populations in many
countries is not integrated into the public health surveillance system, yet
soldiers going on leave, and prison guards & visitors, move back & forth
into the general population carrying their viruses & bacteria, such as HIV
and TB. We wonder what the story is behind the ending of adenovirus vaccine
production in the USA - Mod.JW]
