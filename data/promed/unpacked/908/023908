[1] Kampala: fatal case

An Ebola patient has died at a hospital in Uganda's capital, the health ministry has confirmed. He was the 19th victim in the current outbreak of the deadly virus but the 1st to die in Kampala.

There have been 54 confirmed cases in Uganda but no others have been recorded in the city.

A total of 20 people have recovered including 5 medics from the 1st hospital where a case was treated. They were discharged on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022].

The person who died in Kampala was already known to the authorities as having potentially come into contact with the virus. He was from outside the city but Health Minister Dr Jane Ruth Aceng said the man ran away from his village, disguised his identity, and visited a traditional healer in a different region. He died at Kiruddu National Referral Hospital last Friday [7 Oct 2022], but the death has only just been confirmed.

Dr Aceng said that the teams which treated him were alert to the dangers and had protected themselves because the patient arrived at the hospital when he was seriously ill.

Forty-two people who he may have come into contact with have been identified and are being followed up.

Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.

Dr Aceng added that there are currently no other confirmed Ebola cases in Kampala, although the city and surrounding districts are considered high risk.

The outbreak began in September [2022] in Mubende district, 80 km (50 mi) west of the capital.

A 24-year-old-man was the 1st known Ebola death and 6 members of his family also died.

Among the victims are also 4 health workers, including a doctor from Tanzania.

Medics had previously expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They had also called for Mubende to be put under quarantine.

However, President Yoweri Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.

No effective Ebola vaccine is available yet, because the Sudan strain circulating in central Uganda is different from the Zaire strain that has afflicted West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo and which can be immunised against.

Experts say it is unrealistic to think Ebola will ever be eradicated, but with swift action and effective contact tracing, it is now easier to prevent a crisis.

[This individual died in Kampala, but may have been infected in Mubende district, 80 km (50 mi) west of the capital. Additional cases may still appear in individuals who had contact with the index case since it was 3 weeks before the 1st case was detected on 20 Sep 2022. In this case, the individual "ran away from his village, disguised his identity, and visited a traditional healer in a different region." That is a problem since he came into contact with others outside the epicenter of the outbreak; whether he infected anyone in Kampala will become clear over time. Contact tracing has identified 42 individuals to date. His fear leading to his escape to a traditional healer is an unfortunate event; it is so important to have the trust and cooperation of the villagers, a lesson from previous outbreaks.

"At least 74 cases [note 54 confirmed cases cited above] and 39 deaths [19 confirmed] have been reported so far, although Ugandan officials have not been providing regular updates in recent days. President Yoweri Museveni is scheduled to address the nation on Ebola at 8 pm on [Wed 12 Oct 2022]."

The Uganda Ministry of Health reported today [10 Oct 2022] an additional 4 confirmed Sudan virus disease (SVD) cases and 7 new fatalities, bringing the total cases and deaths from the outbreak declared on 20 Sep 2022 to 48 and 17, respectively. [This case count is 54 confirmed cases and 19 deaths as of 11 Oct 2022, although it is difficult to find official numbers. - Mod.LK]. This is a case-fatality rate of 35% among confirmed cases.

The virus has been reported in 5 of 146 districts in the country -- Mubende, Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Kagadi, and Bunyangabu. All of these districts are more than 100 km [62 mi] from the capital city of Kampala, Dr Diana Atwine, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry said last week. The rest of the country is free from Ebola [but see item above reporting a case in Kampala] and there are no travel restrictions, she continued.

Both US and UK officials issued travel restrictions on passengers from Uganda.

This is the 5th outbreak of Ebola caused by the Sudan virus in Uganda since 2000.
