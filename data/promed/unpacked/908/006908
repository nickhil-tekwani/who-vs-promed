A young girl is thought to have been poisoned by arsenic after playing with a putty toy that was removed from online retailer Amazon last month [January 2018].

Victim NK was found to have 10 times the safe level of the deadly poison in her urine after playing with Magnetic Putty, according to her mother FK.

FK claimed the toy was bought as a Christmas present for her 2 daughters before she was warned by her sister over its possible toxic contents. She and her partner MK then took their daughter to the doctors after NK complained of stomach pains.

Doctor's results concluded that NK had 10 times the safe amount of arsenic in her urine.

FK has since spoken out on social media to warn other parents of the toy.

Despite being removed from the market stalls earlier this month [February 2018], the product is still available to buy in the UK.

She wrote: "We have received shock news this afternoon with the results of my daughter NK's tests and there is a toxicology team in Edinburgh who is now dealing with it. There was 10 times the normal level of arsenic found in her urine. They had to take vials of blood and it is getting sent to an arsenic specialist in Glasgow. They are all in shock. NK has thankfully not shown many symptoms of damage and pray this test will be lower as she hasn't been in contact with it since January [2018]."

Northamptonshire Trading Standards barred the product from sale last month [January 2018] after discovering it on a market stall, however it is still available to buy in the UK from some online retailers. The magnetic putty was removed from Amazon in January [2018], following Northamptonshire Trading Standards Service banning the sale from a market stall. Amazon removed it from its website over fears it contained 7 times the safe level of arsenic and the magnet was 29 times stronger than the permitted force. At the time, the online retailer said: "Customer safety is our priority". Amazon declined to comment on this case.

NK's dad MK 40, wrote of his daughter's condition on Facebook: "We don't want to cause a panic, only make people aware of the potentially dangerous product."

Symptoms of arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, while long term exposure can cause heart disease and cancer. Most exposure comes from drinking contaminated water.

The family is now seeking legal advice. FK added: "You'd think buying a Christmas present from a well-known seller would be safe. [We're] just worried if a child ingested it, how much damage this would cause. We are all in disbelief."

[This seems a bit unusual. I doubt this magnet is off-gassing arsenic, so I doubt it was inhaled arsenic. While this magnet is a putty, not a hard metal magnet, one has to wonder whether this person swallowed a part of this or repeatedly licked it or held it in the mouth. I would also wonder how much arsenic and what form of arsenic (organic or inorganic) is in this putty and why it is in this product.

This report does not tell us if there was any skin irritation or reddening of the skin where there was contact with the magnet and, therefore, any arsenic from the magnet.

So how did the arsenic get into the child, or is there another source in the household? It makes me wonder if the water has been tested and also makes me wonder if the urine test should be repeated. Also I wonder if the rest of the household should also have their urine tested.

According to the Agency for toxic substances and disease registry:
- Breathing high levels of inorganic arsenic can give you a sore throat or irritated lungs.
- Ingesting very high levels of arsenic can result in death. Exposure to lower levels can cause nausea and vomiting, decreased production of red and white blood cells, abnormal heart rhythm, damage to blood vessels, and a sensation of "pins and needles" in hands and feet.
- Ingesting or breathing low levels of inorganic arsenic for a long time can cause a darkening of the skin and the appearance of small "corns" or "warts" on the palms, soles, and torso.
- Skin contact with inorganic arsenic may cause redness and swelling.
- Almost nothing is known regarding health effects of organic arsenic compounds in humans. Studies in animals show that some simple organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic forms. Ingestion of methyl and dimethyl compounds can cause diarrhea and damage to the kidneys.

Dimercaprol may be used for treatment if physicians deem it necessary. But without finding the source for certain, any treatment may not be effective as reexposure might occur. - Mod.TG]
