Sarcocystosis in Malaysia: preventive advice
--------------------------------------------
GeoSentinel [1] has reported a cluster of sarcocystosis among
travelers returning from Malaysia. These travelers reported visiting
Tioman Island on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia before their
illnesses occurred.

What is sarcocystosis?
Sarcocystosis is a disease caused by a parasite called sarcocystis.

Sarcocystosis occurs in tropical or subtropical countries, mainly
countries in South East Asia. This disease usually affects animals but
also can also cause disease in humans. Two forms of the disease can
occur, one which causes diarrhea, and the other which causes muscle
pain, fevers, and other symptoms. Most people infected with
sarcocystis do not have symptoms.

The travelers described in this notice returned from Malaysia with
prominent muscle pain, a symptom consistent with sarcocystosis. Other
reported symptoms included mild diarrhea and fever. Most people have
been ill for 2-4 weeks. Muscle sarcocystosis is spread through the
ingestion of food, water, or soil contaminated with infected animal
feces. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for sarcocystosis;
most infected people get better on their own.

How can travelers protect themselves?
While traveling, you should follow food and water precautions and
practise good hygiene.

Drink and use safe water
Use bottled water with unbroken seals or water that has been boiled or
filtered to make it safe. Water purification tablets and chlorine
products may not kill sarcocystis.

Bring your water to a complete boil for 1 minute OR filter water with
an absolute 1 micron filter to make it safe.

Use safe water to brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, and make
ice.

Clean food preparation areas and kitchenware with soap and safe water
and let dry completely before reuse.

Store water in a clean, covered container.

Do not use piped water sources.

Do not drink beverages sold in cups or bags or use ice if you are not
sure the ice was made with safe water.

Do not swim in fresh water.

Eat safe food
Cook all meat to 160 degrees Fahrenheit or 71 degrees Celsius
(especially pork and beef).

Eat all food hot.

Keep all food covered.

Do not eat raw foods, except for fruits and vegetables you can wash
and peel yourself.

Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and safe water. If you do not have soap, use
an alcohol-based (60 per cent) hand cleaner.

Wash your hands before you eat or prepare food, before feeding your
children, after using the toilet, after cleaning your child's bottom,
and after taking care of someone ill with diarrhea.

Use toilets
Use toilets or other sanitation systems, like chemical toilets, to
dispose of feces.

Clean toilets and surfaces contaminated with feces using a solution of
1 part household bleach to 9 parts water.

Do not defecate in any body of water.

Practice household hygiene
Clean up the areas you eat in and wash in.

Wash yourself, your children, diapers, and clothes at least 30 meters
away from drinking water sources.

Information for health care providers
Muscle sarcocystosis can be suspected in people with signs and
symptoms of myositis, with or without fever. Ill patients may have an
elevated eosinophil count and may have an elevated creatinine kinase
with no other explanation for these findings. A muscle biopsy can be
done using a conventional histologic staining and will show
eosinophilic myositis but may or may not demonstrate classic
sarcocysts. Molecular testing is not widely available.

[1] GeoSentinel is a global sentinel surveillance system consisting of
more than 50 participating travel and tropical medicine clinics
located in 25 countries on 6 continents. Surveillance data are
collected on patients seen at these clinics during or after
international travel. GeoSentinel is managed through a cooperative
agreement between the International Society for Travel Medicine and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[A description of the life cycle of sarcocystis can be found here:
http://dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/Sarcocystosis.htm.

Systemic infection occurs when sporulated oocysts of sarcocystis are
ingested and release sporocysts which enter the body through the
intestinal wall. They then divide (asexual division) and are
distributed throughout the body where they end up in muscles where
they continue to divide for several months and develop cysts, which
contain many bradyzoites.

Intestinal infection occurs when sarcocystis infected meat is eaten
and the cysts release bradyzoites, which invade the intestinal cells
and develop into a male and female stage. Sexual reproduction takes
place in the infected intestinal cells and oocysts containing
sporocysts are excreted in the feces and may contaminate the
environment.

human infections. Clin Microbiol Rev 2004;17:894â€“902.
