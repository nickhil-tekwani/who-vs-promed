First Molecular Identification of _Dirofilaria repens_ in a Dog Blood Sample from Guanajuato, Mexico.

Abstract
--------
_Dirofilaria repens_ is the causative zoonotic agent of subcutaneous dirofilariosis. Although the American continent is considered currently free of _D. repens_ infections, in the past few years there have been some reports suggesting the presence of this agent in the Americas. In Guanajuato, Mexico, there is a report of the presence of _D. repens_. To determine whether this parasite is really present in Guanajuato, a total of 177 EDTA blood samples from dogs were tested using the modified Knott's technique. Using this technique, we found 15 positive samples, which were then analyzed using the PCR technique, with a panfilarial set of primers and a specific primer pair for _D. repens_. In one sample, the expected band was present and the corresponding amplicon, sequenced, displayed a 100 percent identity to _D. repens_, confirming the presence of this exotic and zoonotic filarial species in the municipality of Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico.

Discussion
----------
After the 1st report of the presence of _D. repens_ in Guanajuato, in which the origin and number of microfilaraemic samples were unknown, the present result confirms the presence of _D. repens_ in a dog blood sample from the municipality of Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico.

Notwithstanding based on only a positive dog and, that is more, lacking beneficial and necessary morphological data on the microfilariae that were found, this finding is significant. Indeed, in the Americas the most important _Dirofilaria_ species reported to date are _D. immitis_, _D. tenuis_, and _D. ursi_, all etiological agents of zoonotic diseases. Although the American continent is currently recognized as a _D. repens_-free zone, and to our knowledge, no clinical cases attributed to _D. repens_ have been reported to date in Mexico, there have been some reports that suggest its presence in other American countries, such as the report of _D. repens_-like microfilariae, confirmed by PCR but with a sequence match of only 95 percent in a community in Chile. In addition, there is a report of a human clinical case near that area, where an unidentified filarial worm was extracted from a nodule in the arm of a girl.

A possible explanation of the presence of exotic filaria (in Chile as in Mexico) is that traveling with pets is increasingly common, not only in local areas but also across countries, thus increasing the risk of healthy dogs becoming infected and the spread of pet-borne diseases such as dirofilariosis in countries where vector mosquitoes are present.

To raise the epidemiological significance of _D. repens_ in Mexico, we suggest considering _D. repens_ when making microscopic blood analysis, to identify morphological features of the microfilariae at a low cost. Moreover, veterinary practitioners should also consider this species in the differential diagnosis of canine and feline cardiopulmonary and skin diseases, to avoid its spread throughout the Americas, not only in animals but also in the human population.

Conclusions
-----------
This study confirms, by means of molecular methods, the presence of _D. repens_, never reported in Mexico thus far, and draws general attention to public health risks.

[There are a number of useful references in this paper and members are recommended to check the actual paper for them. If this _Dirofilaria_ is in Mexico I think we can assume that it may be in the Southwest USA and in Central America, and should be kept in mind when suitable clinical cases of subcutaneous dirofilariasis in dogs, cats, or humans are presented. For those looking for a suitable class field-exercise for graduate students, such a serosurvey would get them fresh air, experience interacting with the dog owners, and laboratory work, and maybe even an emerging disease publication.
