Highlights

- In week 01, the number of new confirmed cases has increased from 16 cases in week 52, 2019 to 18. These were reported from 5 states (Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi and Abia) (Table 3).

- The number of deaths has decreased. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) for 2020 is (11.1%) which is lower than the CFR for the same period during 2019 (28%) (Figure 5).

- In total for 2020, 5 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 11 Local Government Areas.

- The predominant age-group affected is 11-40 years (Range: over 11 to 60 years, Median Age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1 (Figure 3).

- The number of suspected cases has increased and is higher than the numbers reported in 2019.

- There was no Health Care Worker infection identified in week 01.

[The 18 new confirmed and 98 suspected cases in week 01 of 2020 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing and perhaps accelerating. Nigeria is now entering the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 7 (at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.

There is no specific mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
