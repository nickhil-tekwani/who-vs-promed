The Scientific Steering Committee of the European Commission is now calling
for increased heat treatment conditions in processing raw materials to
reduce BSE infectivity. Previously the conditions of 133 C, 3 bar pressure
and 20 minutes were considered adequate to reduce infectivity. The new
conditions are 140 C, 3.6 bar pressure for 30 minutes.
