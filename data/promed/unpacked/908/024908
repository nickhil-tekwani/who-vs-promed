Tomato prices shoot up due to crop disease
------------------------------------------
Farmers at the Nicosia market complained about the disease that has
decimated the 2010 crop and pushed prices up. "80 per cent of all the
tomatoes have been destroyed and there's nothing we can do about it," said
a farmer from Pharmakas. In 2009, there were around 2000 crates of tomatoes
daily, but this year [2010], farmers were having to make do with only
200-300 crates.

The disease, which has been around for about a month, farmers said,
involves bacteria which attack the seed of the tomatoes. Farmers can do
nothing but uproot the whole plant as it spreads at an exponential rate and
can destroy other crops. According to a farmer, the disease spread to
Cyprus from Africa. Imported goods that came from countries in Africa
brought the disease with them and insects then carried it to Cypriot
tomatoes, he said. Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture were
unavailable for comment.

[A number of bacterial pathogens are known to affect tomato, including
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (bacterial canker),
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (bacterial leaf blight or leaf spot), several
_Pseudomonas_ species, (bacterial speck, wilt, leaf spot and pith
necrosis), and _Erwinia_ species (stem and fruit rots).

Most of these bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including
non-specific insect activity), splashing rain, and infected plant and other
materials (including seed). Since most of them are also present in Africa,
the information provided above does not give any clues as to which one of
the bacterial diseases is causing the problems in Cyprus. In the absence of
a conclusive diagnosis, disease management may include phytosanitary
measures to ensure clean planting material (seed and explants), crop
rotation and preventative bactericidal sprays.
