The state Veterinary Department began vaccinating cows and buffaloes
yesterday as part of its ongoing operation against the hemorrhagic
septicemia outbreak. Department deputy director Dr K. Palanisamy said a
total of 3700 cows and 500 buffaloes had already been vaccinated in Pasir
Puteh district.
He said the department's 15 operation teams would take about 2 to 3 weeks
to complete the task in Kota Baru. He added the village heads in the
district had been notified to spread the word to cattle breeders.
Dr Palanisamy said he had increased the number of operation teams as a
result of the good response from farmers and breeders who wanted their
cattle to be vaccinated.
"The disease has been confined to Pasir Puteh district but we are taking
precautionary measures," he said.
As of Sunday, the total number of cattle which had died from hemorrhagic
septicemia in Pasir Puteh was 31, he said.
Hemorrhagic septicemia is an endemic disease which can spread to other
cattle through grass, water and other feed, and through the body fluids of
sick cattle.
The disease is caused by the "stress" cattle suffer due to a change in the
weather, such as prolonged drought or wet season.
