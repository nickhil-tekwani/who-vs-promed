Increasing case numbers of adenovirus conjunctivitis in Germany, 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
In 2010 (as of 13 Oct 2010), the number of adenovirus conjunctivitis cases
reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany has
increased by more than 250 per cent compared with the same period in the
previous 2 years. An investigation was initiated to identify spatial or
temporal clusters, possible sources of infection and potential connections
to cases abroad. The analysis did not show a disproportionately affected
sex or age group, but many infections were preceded by exposure to
ophthalmological facilities, communal facilities, or public places.

Background
----------
Several reports have recently been posted in ProMED-mail
(<promed@promedmail.org> of viral conjunctivitis in various parts of the
world [1-7]. Since the beginning of 2010, there has been a rise in the
number of notified cases of adenovirus conjunctivitis in several German
Laender. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin initiated an
investigation of all notified cases in the country in order to identify
spatial or temporal clusters of cases, any potential connection to cases
abroad and possible sources of infection, so that appropriate public health
measures could be recommended.

Adenoviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA-viruses, which are
resistant to various treatments (such as extremes of pH) and are,
therefore, difficult to inactivate. They can be transmitted via
contaminated hands or objects, often in health care settings. Depending on
the serotype, clinical manifestations are related to different organ
systems, such as the eye and the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract,
resulting in diverse clinical pictures. The most frequently detected human
adenoviruses (HAdV) found in conjunctivitis are of serotypes 8, 19, and 37 [8].

Adenovirus conjunctivitis is characterised by sudden onset of symptoms and
can be diagnosed clinically by keratitis with coin-shaped infiltrations in
the cornea. It is usually self-limiting. The incubation period generally
lasts from 5 to 12 days, and the person remains infective for up to 3
weeks. Diagnosis can be laboratory confirmed by direct detection of the
pathogen (by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoassays or cell
culture). As only the symptoms can be treated, good hygiene and
disinfection management are, therefore, important for prevention and
control of the disease [9,10].

Case notification
-----------------
In Germany, notification to local health authorities is mandatory for
laboratories that detect adenoviruses from conjunctival swabs (direct
detection of antigen or DNA) [11]. Case data, including data on
epidemiological links, are then reported to RKI according to the national
case definition. The German notification system has been described
previously [12].

Notified cases in 2010 (up to 13 Oct 2010) in Germany were analysed and
compared with the 2 previous years regarding temporal and spatial
distribution. Clusters were defined as epidemiologically linked cases with
a minimum of 2 persons, whereas sporadic cases had no documented link to
other cases.

We asked all cases notified from weeks 34 to 40 (that is, over the previous
6 weeks) from 6 Laender whether they would be prepared to be interviewed,
using an exploratory questionnaire, in order to generate a hypothesis of
common infection modes or sources. Selecting weeks 34 to 40 allowed us to
obtain a sufficiently large sample size and given the cases were recent,
recall bias was minimised.

Analysis of notified cases
--------------------------
As of 13 Oct 2010, 370 people with adenovirus conjunctivitis with onset of
symptoms from 1 Jan 2010 were notified to local health authorities and
reported to the RKI. The date of symptom onset was recorded for 303, while
in a further 67 cases it was assumed to be in 2010 due to the time of
notification. During the same time period in 2008 and 2009, 141 and 134
cases respectively were notified (the total number of notified cases was
180 in 2008 and 169 in 2009). In those years, the infections were
distributed widely, affecting urban and rural districts, with the highest
number of cases occurring in August.

In 2010, the median and mean age of cases was 39 years (range: 0-90 years).
A total of 186 (50 per cent) were men (in 2008: 47 per cent; in 2009: 51
per cent). Cases were notified in all Laender, from laboratories to local
health authorities in 121 rural and urban districts (30 per cent of all
districts). Cases were mainly clustered in northern Germany (whereas in
2009, they were more evenly distributed). The highest incidence was found
in Mecklenburg-West-Pomerania (in the north east of the country), with 5
cases per 100 000 population. The highest number of cases was reported in
week 13 (the week before Easter). The appearance of cases in the same
region within a 4-week period suggests a common source of infection or
related cause.

Cluster cases
-------------
In 2010, 120 (32 per cent) of the 370 cases were linked to 22 clusters (in
2008, there were 46 cases (33 per cent) in 10 clusters; in 2009, there were
25 cases (15 per cent) in 9 clusters). The 2010 clusters were located
across 16 rural and urban districts in 8 Laender. The proportion of cases
linked to clusters decreased around week 19 (Figure 2). The median age of
cases in clusters was 32 years (mean: 33 years, range: 0-90).

Sporadic cases
--------------
There were 250 (67.6 per cent) sporadic cases, of whom 133 were men. The
median age was 43 years (mean: 42 years, range: 0-89). About 40 per cent of
all sporadic cases appeared in locations close to clustered cases, which
points to a possible connection. However, some sporadic cases were
geographically isolated, in regions far from the clusters.

Most clusters were notified as being associated with ophthalmological
facilities or hospitals. Some were related to outbreaks in child day-care
centres or kindergartens, which lowered the median age of cases in clusters
significantly (t-test p=0.004) in comparison with sporadic cases.

Analysis of interviewed cases
-----------------------------
Detailed investigation of 27 cases who were interviewed revealed that the
median duration of illness was 18 days (range: 4-84 days); 13 judged the
severity of the disease as high or very high [these data are tabulated in
the original text].

A majority (n=16) of the 27 interviewed cases wore either glasses or
contact lenses. Among the interviewees, 21 were not aware of any contact
with other affected persons. In the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms,
excursions to public places were reported in 13 cases, while 12 stayed in
or visited a medical facility (such as an ophthalmologist or eye clinics),
where mostly eye drops were administered. A total of 11 cases had used
communal facilities associated with sport or leisure activities (e.g. in a
swimming pool, at the seaside or communal showers).

Discussion
----------
Compared with the previous 2 years, an increase of notified adenovirus
conjunctivitis cases of more than 250 per cent was seen in 2010. Given the
delay in reporting, it is likely that case numbers will continue to rise
[14]. As notification is confined to laboratory-confirmed cases -- thus
excluding cases that are only clinically diagnosed -- it can be assumed
that not all cases of adenovirus conjunctivitis are captured, and a bias
towards severe cases is possible. Although it was not feasible to interview
all notified cases, the interviewed cases represented a similar sample in
terms of regional, sex and age distribution.

Our findings -- showing that the majority of cases who were interviewed
were exposed through use of community facilities, excursions to public
places within Germany or ophthalmological treatment -- are in line with
other published investigations [15,16]. No direct connection with recently
described outbreaks of conjunctivitis in various countries [1-7] could be
established due to the few records of German cases with known relevant
travel history abroad.

In conclusion, the analysis did not show a disproportionally affected sex
or age group, except for outbreaks in child day-care centres and
kindergartens [17]. The cause of the increase of notified cases in the
country is still unclear, although the majority of infections in clusters
was nosocomial. Information about the recent epidemiological developments
regarding adenovirus conjunctivitis was shared with German
ophthalmologists, with a request to submit conjunctival samples from
patients with acute conjunctivitis to the national reference laboratory for
serotyping. Improved hygiene measures are recommended, especially in
ophthalmological centres [8,9]. It would be interesting to know if the
increase seen in Germany in the number and severity of cases of adenovirus
conjunctivitis is also seen in other European countries.

[The cause of the increase of notified cases of adenoviral conjunctivitis
in Germany is unclear, although the majority of infections in clusters were
nosocomial. It will be interesting to establish if the increase seen in
Germany in the number and severity of cases of adenovirus conjunctivitis
will be observed also in other European countries. It would be interesting
to know the serotype (8, 19 and 37) of the infecting viruses. Previous
reports of conjunctivitis in ProMED-mail have originated from arid or
coastal regions, and infection has been attributed to enteroviral infection
(but not verified) due to greater risk of abrasion and poor hygiene.

As pointed out by the authors, only the symptoms of conjunctivitis can be
treated, and, therefore, good hygiene and disinfection procedures are
essential for prevention and control of the disease. The authors recommend
improved hygiene measures, particularly in ophthalmological centres.
