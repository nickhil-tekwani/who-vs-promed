Peru: Children at Greatest Risk in Outbreak of Vampire Bat-transmitted Rabies
-------------------------------------------------
Peru will receive 22 000 doses of rabies vaccine from Ecuador and Argentina
in order to [limit] a rabies outbreak due to vampire bites that has already
killed 12 children, stated the Peruvian Ministry of Health on Fri 14 Jan
2005. The announcement was made by the Head of Environmental Health, Jorge
Albinagorta, who said that, in addition to these donations, Peru will
receive from UNICEF USD 8000 for purchasing sanitation materials. The
outbreak is located in Condorcanqui, a remote Amazon province near Ecuador,
which was declared a health emergency in December 2004. The money donated
by UNICEF will allow the purchase of 100 nylon nets for capturing bats, 40
pairs of leather gloves for chasing bats, 10 sleeping bags, and 20
waterproof ponchos.
Vaccination will include the entire population of 16 native communities in
the area, regardless of age, since all of them are at risk, according to
the Peruvian authorities. It is estimated that the number of people living
in the Amazonian region involved is 13 300. So far, those most affected are
children under 15 years of age. As well as carrying out vaccination, the
health authorities will trap bats in order to spray them with poison, so
that disease transmission will be controlled. According to the Ministry of
Health, when "socializing", the bats lick themselves [and ingest the
poison, which will lead to hemorrhage and ultimately death].
Some of the difficulties the health authorities face are cultural: native
people think that rabies is a product of sorcery of some kind between rival
tribes. Such beliefs lead some villagers to reject vaccination and perform
certain rites in order to be cured or to protect themselves from the
disease. Vampire bats bite villagers while they sleep. Symptoms such as
fever, delirium, muscle pain and spasm, seizures and finally death may
ensue, according to health authorities.

[In several South American countries, vampire bat rabies is a problem for
both livestock and the human population. There are 3 species of vampire
bats, the most important disease-transmitter being _Desmodus rotundus_.
Protection of livestock has depended on the use of bovine vaccines and/or
use of anticoagulants, such as diphenadione or warfarin, which can be
administered to bovines as slow-release boluses, or mixed with grease and
applied to the skin. Vampire bats suffer fatal hemorrhages in their wing
capillaries as a result of ingesting bovine blood containing anticoagulant,
or during grooming to remove adherent grease. Humans can be protected by
vaccination with standard human rabies vaccine, or less effectively by
protective netting at night. The vulnerability of children in the current
outbreak may be a consequence of greater depth of sleep and reduced
awareness of attack by vampire bats. However, other interpretations are
possible and comment will be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
