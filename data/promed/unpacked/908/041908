Apple witches' broom [apple proliferation] disease more common than supposed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2013, the apple witches' broom disease, which is new to Finland, was found particularly in Aland. The disease was investigated on 43 sites in all. The disease was identified on all 13 sites in Aland included in the survey, as well as on Finnish mainland in 2 apple orchards and one producer of apple tree saplings.

"The witches' broom disease reduces the apple crop and impairs the fruit quality and flavour. It had not occurred to experts previously to connect the broom-like shoot growth to the witches' broom disease of apples, so it may have been present in Finland for years. The disease spreads with infected apple tree saplings and locally through the jumping plant louse," says Sirkka Malkki from Evira.

[Apple proliferation (AP) disease (also called apple witches' broom) is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma mali (apple proliferation phytoplasma, type member of 16SrX taxonomic group). The pathogen is present throughout much of Europe where it is considered one of the most serious diseases of the crop, and has also recently been reported for the 1st time from North America (Canada, ProMED-mail post 20130415.1646164). It affects almost all apple cultivars resulting in losses of yield and fruit quality. Symptoms may include shoot proliferations and distortions (witches' broom); leaf rosettes and/or reduced leaf size with enlarged stipules (small leaf-like appendages at the base of leaf stalks); phyllody (green proliferations) of flowers; up to 50 percent reduction of fruit size and loss of flavour; matted root systems leading to stunting and loss of tree vigour. Symptoms may be unevenly distributed over the tree or even completely disappear, leaving symptomless trees as pathogen reservoirs.

AP is transmitted by grafting and can be spread with budwood (both scion and rootstock) and tissue cultures. The psyllid (plant louse) _Cacopsylla melanoneura_ has been implicated as a vector, and overwintered adults may play a role in AP spread in orchards. Disease management may include phytosanitation, vector control, removal of pathogen reservoirs and use of certified clean propagation material. AP has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) and is also considered a quarantine disease in the Americas.

Other members of the apple proliferation group include the pear decline (_Ca._ P. pyri) and European stone fruit yellows (_Ca._ P. prunorum) pathogens.
