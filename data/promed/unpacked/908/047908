Ref: Lindsey NP, Lehman JA, Staples JE, Fischer M: West Nile Virus and other arboviral diseases -- United States, 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease in the United States. However, several other arboviruses also cause sporadic cases and seasonal outbreaks of neuroinvasive disease (that is, meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis). This report summarizes surveillance data reported to CDC in 2013 for WNV and other nationally notifiable arboviruses, excluding dengue. 47 states and the District of Columbia reported 2469 cases of WNV disease. Of these, 1267 (51 per cent) were classified as WNV neuroinvasive disease, for a national incidence of 0.40 per 100 000 population.

A total of 2469 WNV disease cases, including 1267 (51 per cent) neuroinvasive cases, were reported from 725 counties in 47 states and the District of Columbia (Table 1 -- available at the source URL above). WNV disease cases peaked in early September 2013; 90 per cent of cases had illness onset during July-September 2013. The median age of patients was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 41-67 years); 1425 (58 per cent) were male. Overall, 1494 (61 per cent ) patients were hospitalized, and 119 (5 per cent) died. The median age of patients who died was 78 years (IQR = 67-83 years).

Of the 1267 WNV neuroinvasive disease patients, 669 (53 per cent) had encephalitis, 486 (38 per cent) had meningitis, and 112 (9 per cent) had acute flaccid paralysis. Among the 112 patients with acute flaccid paralysis, 85 (76 per cent) also had encephalitis or meningitis. The national incidence of neuroinvasive WNV disease was 0.40 per 100 000 population (Table 2 -- available at the source URL above). States with the highest incidence rates included North Dakota (8.9 per 100 000), South Dakota (6.8), Nebraska (2.9), and Wyoming (2.8) (Figure -- available at the source URL above). 6 states reported approximately half (51 per cent) of the WNV neuroinvasive disease cases: California (237 cases), Texas (113), Colorado (90), Illinois (86), North Dakota (64), and Oklahoma (60). Neuroinvasive WNV disease incidence increased with age, with the highest incidence among persons aged 70 years and older. Among patients with neuroinvasive disease, 111 (9 per cent) died.

Discussion
----------
Reported numbers of arboviral disease cases vary from year to year. Weather (for example, temperature and precipitation), zoonotic host and vector abundance, and human behavior (such as repellent use, outdoor activities, and use of air conditioning or screens in the home) are all factors that can influence when and where outbreaks occur. This complex ecology makes it difficult to predict how many cases of disease might occur in the future and where they will occur. Increased numbers of reported cases and the identification of cases in new locations might reflect actual changes in incidence and epidemiology or increased disease awareness.

The incidence of WNV neuroinvasive disease declined substantially in 2013 (incidence of 0.40 per 100 000 population) compared with 2012 (0.92 per 100 000 population), when a large multistate outbreak occurred, with incidence nearing the levels observed in 2002 and 2003. However, the incidence in 2013 was similar to that during 2004-2007 (median = 0.43; range = 0.39-0.50) and was higher than that during 2008-2011 (median = 0.18; range: 0.13-0.23) (3-5). WNV activity remained focalized in 2013, with more than half of the neuroinvasive disease cases being reported from just 6 states.

[WNV is an example of a virus moving into a vacant niche where competent vector mosquitoes and susceptible hosts already existed. Certainly, before WNV introduction in 1999, no one would have predicted that it would cross the Atlantic Ocean and appear in New York. Once arrived, there were no barriers to prevent its spread to the lower 48 states and into southern Canada, northern Mexico, and beyond. WNV has become endemic in this large geographic area and will continue to pose a threat to the health of humans, equine animals, and some wild vertebrates, especially birds. This situation raises the question -- which viruses will arrive next? And are we prepared to deal with them?
