[1] Denmark, eradication, mink-farming banned

Denmark on Monday [21 Dec 2020] banned mink farming until the start of 2022 after it emerged that a strain of the coronavirus can be passed between the animals and humans.

Officials have concerns that the mutated variant could threaten the effectiveness of future vaccines.

The draft bill passed by 55 votes to 43 in parliament with the main opposition parties -- the central-right Liberals and the populist Danish People's Party -- voting against the bill.

"Danish mink farmers have sacrificed their life's work for the common good. We own them a big thank you," Rasmus Prehn, the country's agriculture minister, wrote on Twitter.

More than 15 million mink have been culled in Denmark, devastating its fur industry.

Farmers are expected to receive a state bailout, although many say they are unlikely to return to their jobs when the temporary ban expires.

The Nordic country is the world's biggest producer of mink fur and its main export markets are China and Hong Kong.

Authorities later admitted that the order to cull healthy mink herds had lacked a legal basis. Monday's [21 Dec 2020] vote now provides one retroactively.

The move hurled the government into a political storm, as plummeting public trust coincided with resignation calls and a vote of no confidence by opposition parties.

[2] COVID-19 in animals, Russia, USA, vaccines

Fortunately, very effective human vaccines have arrived. But are vaccines for pets and other animals necessary? How will they be developed? And how quickly could they become available?

It's still not clear how many dogs and cats have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, although the rates may be similar to those of people. Yet pet symptoms seem to be mild, if they appear at all.

In addition: "Cats and dogs don't play an important role in the maintenance or transmission of the disease to humans," says William Karesh, executive vice president for health and policy at EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that tracks emerging diseases in animals. As a result, he says: "There's no need for a vaccine from a public health standpoint."

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which grants commercial licenses for pet vaccines, is not currently approving any for COVID-19. The "data do not indicate that such a vaccine would have value," according to the agency. "Companies are still free to do research and development on these vaccines," USDA spokesperson Joelle Hayden tells Science, "but without a license, they can't sell or distribute them."

Jonathan Epstein, vice president for science and outreach at EcoHealth, has one concern at the top of his list: great apes. Human respiratory viruses have in the past been fatal in chimpanzees and gorillas, he notes, and researchers worry the new coronavirus could decimate endangered primate species in Africa and Asia.

Karesh is also concerned about endangered animals such as black-footed ferrets, which are likely at high risk for COVID-19, given the susceptibility of lab ferrets to the disease. He's also worried about great apes at zoos and sanctuaries, places where tigers and other animals have become infected.

Epstein is concerned about mink, too. Given the outbreaks on mink farms, he says, "There's the potential for the virus to mutate and not only jump to people, but to wildlife as well."

With both mink and apes, however, Epstein argues the best approach would be to change how we interact with them. Mink are kept in high densities, he says, which likely fosters the transmission of the virus. "Should we continue to farm them this way?" And he says that, regardless of whether people themselves are vaccinated against COVID-19, they should always take extra precautions around animals that could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. "Anyone who's going to come into contact with gorillas should wear a mask."

COVID-19 animal vaccines should be relatively easy to make at this point. Indeed, we may already have some. This week, Russia announced it was close to completing clinical trials on a COVID-19 vaccine for mink and domestic animals such as cats. The details of the vaccine were not made public, but the government center developing the vaccine said doses could be widely available in a few months [see comment].

A U.S. veterinary pharmaceutical company, Zoetis, is also working on a vaccine for mink and pets. Like human vaccine maker Novavax's approach, Zoetis's strategy delivers a shot of a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recent data presented by the company show cats and dogs mounted a strong immune response to the viral molecule, or antigen, although it's not yet clear whether it was enough to protect them against infection.

John Hardham, who runs the emerging infectious disease program at Zoetis, says his company is in talks with USDA to license its mink vaccine and that it could rapidly adapt the candidate for dogs and cats. He says Zoetis has also had conversations with zoo vets, who have expressed interest in the vaccine.

Meanwhile, vaccines for some other animals may effectively be here. The human COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved or clinically tested required safety and efficacy tests with hamsters, mice, or monkeys, meaning we may already know how to protect those creatures.

Karesh says translating the vaccines across species should be relatively straightforward. "Different species have different immune responses, so you may need to double or triple the antigen level in, say, dogs versus cats," he says. "But the fundamentals of the vaccine approach wouldn't change."

[Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia's veterinary watchdog, announced on 17 Aug 2020 it was "developing a new Covid-19 vaccine to protect mink in its vast fur farms, as well as domestic cats." The vaccine was "being worked on and expected to be tested in autumn [2020]."

It was also made known that Russia had around 100 fur farms specialising in mink for the large fur industry (see https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8635009/Russia-says-developing-Covid-19-vaccine-mink-CATS-boasting-human-treatment.html).

The head of Rosselkhoznadzor, Sergey Dankvert, also said that people will want a vaccine for their cats if they become infected. "The vaccine is needed primarily for mink," he said. "They quickly transmit the virus to each other."

On 14 Dec 2020, Rosselkhoznadzor said they were "close to completing clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine for domestic animals and mink and expect to begin the regulatory approval process in February [2021]." More specifically, the agency stated that the Federal Centre for Animal Health began developing the vaccine in spring [2020] after the authorities established the virus could be passed from humans on to some domestic animals, and that the vaccine "is aimed at rabbits, mink, cats, and some other animals. Clinical trials will end in January [2021], and the approval process is likely to begin at the end of February 2021 (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-russia-animal-vaccine-idUSKBN28O1HU). It was further said that the Russian mink population has, so far, not been affected and that Russia would vaccinate its minks once the process was finished.

According to another source, the news of the Russian mink vaccine "will likely be celebrated in the fur industry, which has been shaken by outbreaks of Covid-19 that have seen 2 leading producers of mink -- the Netherlands and Denmark -- taken out of action, possibly permanently. Further European culls could push even more production to China, which is already a major producer (https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2020/12/14/russia-is-developing-a-covid-19-vaccine-for-pets-and-mink/?sh=7d53f2763de8).

It is unclear how Chinese mink herds have been affected by the pandemic. The global fur trade, worth more than USD 22 billion a year, is reeling from Denmark's decision to kill millions of farmed mink. Worries of a sudden shortage of mink pelts, of which Denmark was the top exporter, have lifted prices by as much as 30% in Asia, the International Fur Federation (IFF) says."

As millions of mink are culled in Europe amid fears they could spread the novel coronavirus, struggling Chinese suppliers are defying calls for their business to be banned and taking advantage of a surge in global prices for the prized fur.

Chinese mink farmers, rattled by a ban on wildlife trade early in the pandemic, are now resuming breeding of the slinky mammals, while traders have boosted prices by as much as 1/3rd as supplies tighten.

Authorities in Denmark, the world's biggest mink exporter, began slaughtering an estimated 15-17 million animals in early November 2020 after some tested positive for a mutated form of the coronavirus, raising concerns that vaccine-resistant strains could recirculate in humans.

Before the culls, China was the 2nd largest producer of mink fur behind Denmark.

Beijing has shown a zero-tolerance approach to new infection risks, tracking imported frozen meat and seafood and locking down communities whenever new transmissions occur. But it has taken little action against its mink farms, which researchers say number around 8000 and hold about 5 million animals.

In the village of Shangcun, around 180 km (110 miles) south of Beijing, fur traders said their business was safe and would thrive as producers sought replacement pelts for coats costing USD 10 000 or more each.

"I don't worry about getting the virus from mink fur because I'm sure the Chinese government will do all the necessary checks," said Wang Zhanhui, a shop owner, running his hand over a strip of glossy black fur.

Animal welfare groups around the world have urged a ban on fur farming, saying the COVID-19 pandemic proves that intensive captive breeding is not only cruel but also hazardous to human health.

"When it comes to public health risks, these farms and markets are much like the live animal market in Wuhan where the novel coronavirus is widely believed to have originated," said Jason Baker, Senior Vice President at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

"Filthy fur farms are packed with sick, stressed, and injured animals and are breeding grounds for disease."

Studies also suggest mink are particularly prone to coronavirus infection and could transmit the virus back into humans.

"If the objective is to reduce transmission, then yes, having these mink farms is a big risk because it makes it much more difficult to manage the epidemic and creates such big reservoirs of susceptible hosts," said Francois Balloux, a geneticist with University College London and co-author of a recent paper on COVID-19 transmission in minks.

But while authorities have stepped up checks and offered free coronavirus tests at some bigger breeding facilities, Beijing is seen unlikely to crack down on an industry that earns an estimated USD 50 billion per year in China alone.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to requests for comment.

Chinese mink suppliers and traders who had been struggling in recent years due to declining overseas demand are already benefiting from rising prices.

"It felt great," said Wang He, a Shangcun trader and breeder, whose earnings increased 30-50% when the price of mink fur jumped after Denmark ordered the cull.

Chinese demand has remained strong, with rising wealth and little in the way of animal rights activism.

But the coronavirus outbreak triggered a blanket ban on all wildlife trading in China, forcing some smaller breeders out of business and causing "panic," according to an industry association.

In April [2020], the government said mink, arctic fox, and racoon would be classified as "special livestock" rather than wildlife, and would, therefore, be exempt from the ban.

There are now signs the market is responding to the culls in Denmark, which was responsible for about 40% of worldwide output.

Many Chinese farmers were considering abandoning the business altogether, said Zhao Yangang, another mink trader.

"They were preparing to stop rearing, but now that the markets have started to move like this, they've started breeding again," he said.

China is well-aware of the health risks of intensive mink farming, known to be a source of infectious diseases like rabies and distemper. Most larger breeding facilities are subject to rigorous vaccination and hygiene regimes.

Wang, the fur trader and breeder, said that after the Danish cull was announced, China began administering free COVID-19 tests for captive minks. "They came to my farm in Dalian and tested minks from 5 spots in the farm," he said.

But a wider crackdown is not expected, as fur farming has been a relatively cheap way for local governments to alleviate poverty in rural communities and rustbelt regions such as Hebei, where it provides earning opportunities for laid-off industrial workers.

Still, experts say the health risks posed by minks cannot be separated from the conditions in which animals are kept.

"Minks are susceptible, but we should not forget the conditions they are housed in," said Balloux. "There are very large populations in cages, living on top of one another, and the numbers are insane."

[According to OIE's recently updated "Guidance to report cases of animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 to the OIE," SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease, which means, as defined by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, "a new occurrence in an animal of a disease, infection or infestation, causing a significant impact on animal or public health resulting from:
1. a change of a known pathogenic agent or its spread to a new geographic area or species; or
2. a previously unrecognised pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time."

Mink-farming member countries are thus obliged to notify the OIE of the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in animals as set out in article 1.1.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code:
1. Immediate notification through WAHIS or by fax or email;
2. Periodic reports subsequent to the notification;
3. A final report once the disease was eradicated or become stable.

As per Article 1.1.6 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, mink farming countries which have not recorded/reported outbreaks, are "encouraged" to report any other relevant information, such as experimental studies or prevalence surveys, to OIE's Information and Analysis Department (at <information.dept@oie.int>) in a summary report. "In the context of early warning, Members should send these reports in a timely manner with the purpose of collecting and sharing this information at international level; unless the country specifies otherwise, these reports will be published in the OIE website." The detailed guidelines are available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/A_Reporting_SARS-CoV-2_to_the_OIE.pdf.

So far, 10 countries that have identified COVID-19 infections in minks have submitted reports to the OIE (https://tinyurl.com/y6wqgqwe). Several leading mink-farming countries, including Russia and China, which are known to have carried out experimental studies in minks and surveillance on farms, have not submitted any mink-related report (under articles 1.1.4 OR 1.1.6).

It may be assumed that, similar to Russia, other countries have considered vaccination of their farmed-mink populations. Most likely, China is one of them; information/references will be welcomed.

Vaccination of minks is expected to protect animals and humans combined. Closely following vaccinated minks, particularly in experimental settings, may facilitate an additional tool in the arsenal of methods destined to provide early identification of mutants potentially challenging commercial human vaccines. - Mod.AS
