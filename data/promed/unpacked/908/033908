Advice on Q fever, 9 Mar 2010, Doc 168/210 RC/TO/evtb
-----------------------------------------------------
An additional expert consultation has been carried out on 5 Mar 2010.
During this consultation both the CVI (Central Veterinary Institute)
and the GD (Gezondheidsdienst voor Dieren/Animal Health Service) have
presented the currently available data from international scientific
literature and the effects of vaccination in small ruminants, as
recorded up till now. Also, the 1st results have been presented of
the research into the temperature course of [collected] manure.

From the scientific literature we know that during abortion of an
infected small ruminant billions of bacteria are shed in the
environment; during normal partus of an infected small ruminant the
shedding is considerably less, in the range of millions of bacteria.
From the limited data of the field study done by GD and CVI and from
the literature study done by the CVI the preliminary conclusion is
that vaccination reduces the chance of an abortion considerably, and
will probably prevent it almost all together. At the same time there
are indications that a considerable reduction in shedding of _C.
burnetii_ is achieved by fully and timely vaccination of the animals.
The vaccine used in the Netherlands is not (yet) registered in the
EU, but has meanwhile temporary admittance in France.

I would like to stress again that much is still unclear as to how the
gradation in quantitative shedding of _C. burnetii_ bacteria by farms
with small ruminants is related to the gradation of the number of
human cases. The experts expect that vaccination (as a means to
reduce the shedding of _C. burnetii_) will significantly reduce the
risk of airborne spread of the bacteria from positive farms, thus
decreasing the risk for human cases. It is, however, difficult to
tell if and how many people will get sick in 2010 and later due to
the presence of viable bacteria in the environment, shed during
previous years.

Your questions (letter of 3 Mar 2010) have been discussed with the
experts, and here are the responses:

1. How effective is the vaccine in preventing infection of animals?

There are indications that the vaccine reduces the infection rate by
_C. burnetii_ in the majority of the vaccinated animals. An exact
estimation of the efficacy is not possible yet.

2. How effective is the vaccine in preventing abortions in animals?

The experts believe that there are sufficient indications that the
vaccine will prevent abortions considerably, or almost entirely, in
timely and fully vaccinated small ruminants.

3. How effective is the vaccine in preventing the shedding of _C.
burnetii_ during abortion/partus?

There is some possibility that, despite timely and full vaccination,
abortions may yet occur in small ruminants as a result of other
causes. There are sufficient indications that in such situations a
considerable reduction in the shedding of _C. burnetii_ is seen,
compared to its shedding by aborting, Q-fever infected, unvaccinated
animals. An exact estimate of the reduction is at this moment not yet
available.

4. Will substantial risks for public health remain after vaccination?
If affirmative, which will they be?

As already indicated in the introduction, vaccination will reduce the
shedding of _C.burnetii_ and subsequently reduce also the risk of
airborne bacteria spread from positive farms. It is also expected
that as outcome of the said reduction, risk of human cases related to
this shedding will decrease.

The experts have established that the presence of infectious Q-fever
bacteria in the environment has increased due to their large-scale
spread from positive farms during the recent years. The effect of
this upon the human epidemic in 2010 and years to follow is
unpredictable. Thus, the experts cannot eliminate the possibility
that in 2010 and coming years new human cases will occur as a result
of the already contaminated environment, as well as of other
(smaller) sources and via other (as yet unknown) transmission routes.
At the same time, direct contact of humans with infected animals on
the farms will remain a potential source of infection for employees
and visitors. Employees could be at extra risk of infection if they
work in the contaminated environment without proper protection.

The experts therefore agree that substantial risks for public health
could be maintained after vaccination. Their exact estimation is not
yet possible.

5. What would be the weight of the above risks for a possible
phasing-out of the measures contained in the 'Continuation Strategy
for Q-fever control'? Could you indicate this for each measure?

In the measures overview you attached, the measures have been
classified into 3 groups. I will use the same classification for my
replies.

Not all experts [in the team] have the knowledge to be able to
address the detailed, elaborate veterinary measures as described by
you. Therefore, the assessment of these measures has been formulated
primarily by the veterinary experts.

I. Source control and preventing the expansion of the [infection] source:

-For the measures that you mention in group I, the advice is to
maintain the fortnightly bulk milk testing of dairy goat and sheep
farms with more than 50 animals, until 1 Jun 2010. After 1 Jun 2010,
the testing could return to the original bimonthly frequency,
providing that the animals have been fully vaccinated before that
date.

-All experts advise you to grant the 'negative' [non-infected] status
only one year has elapsed with negative periodic milk test results.
This, since at least one lambing season [without positive result] is
required to justify this status, in view of the known increase [in
C._burnetii_] shedding during the lambing season and its known
gradual decrease in the months afterwards.

-Both the prescribed obligatory notification of Q fever suspicion,
and the compulsory vaccination, must be maintained.

-According to the veterinary experts, the breeding ban should be
maintained, until 1 Jun 2010, only for the female non-pregnant
animals that were now spared on the farms [where culling has been
applied].

-The ban upon introduction of animals from other farms can be lifted
as from 1 Jun 2010, provided they have been fully and timely
vaccinated and derived from negative farms.

-Vaccinating animals is supposed to reduce the shedding of _C.
burnetii_ from positive farms. This, provided no changes have taken
place regarding the management and size of the farms in question.

-In view of the many uncertainties, the experts advise to maintain,
for the time being, the bans upon the expansion of farms and upon
added buildings; this ban to be anew reconsidered over one year.

-As to additional measures on the premises declared infected, the
culling of pregnant animals can be nullified provided the intended
vaccination strategy has been implemented before 1 Jun 2010.

-We regard the culling steps as a one-time emergency measure applied
for the lambing season of 2009 - 2010.

-The he-goats and rams are no source for human cases related to
airborne spread, and therefore are not regarded a considerable public
health risk. The experts believe therefore that it can be left to the
farming sector to decide about the conditions under which these
animals can be involved in the breeding process.

-The animal transport ban and the rodents and birds control measures
must remain in force.

-The measures for other goat and sheep farms, among which farms with
a public function [e.g., children's petting farms, educational
institutions, nursing homes] must remain in force. The only measure
which may be lifted is the breeding ban, after 1 Jun 2010 and
provided the animals are vaccinated. Obviously, the 1 Jun 2010
[vaccination deadline] does not apply to recently born offspring.

II. Transmission from animal to human:

The experts see no reason to revise the present general
guidelines/information to the public.

From preliminary results of research into the manure issue, and based
upon studies in dairy [farms], there are indications that three
quarters of the covered manure heaps contain no infectious _C.
burnetii_ within a month [since collection]. Remarkably, the outer
layer probably contains no live _C.burnetii_ within several days, due
to the high composting temperatures in the outer layer of the manure
heap. In waiting for the final test results, the veterinary experts
advise to maintain the currently prevailing manure measures and the
hygiene directives for dairy goat and sheep farms. They also advise
to maintain the measures required from farms declared infected,
similarly to all other measures, described in your review, in
relation to other goat and sheep farms.

III. In the human sector, to limit the effects of infection:

The measures for the human sector remain unchanged, with areas where
no positive bulk milk tests have been detected deserving special
attention.

Employers are obliged to comply to the health and safety legislation
to prevent the risk of employees' exposure as well as possible
deleterious effect upon their health. It is important that permanent
employees and temporary workers are informed in advance about the
possibly contaminated environment in which they will be working and
will know how to work safely and soundly.

Formulating national Q-fever guidelines by health and safety experts
for secure working in a contaminated environment is essential.

6. Can the dot and/or the 5-km zone be removed from the VWA Q fever
map for farms where the contamination status has been lifted? [For
the map, updated 23 Mar 2010, currently including all 78 "dots and
stains" which stand for farms declared infected since the beginning
of the surveillance, click on "Kaart overzicht besmettingen Q-koorts"
in the VWA web-site, available at
<http://www.vwa.nl/portal/page?_pageid=119,2025799&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_document_id=932575&p_node_id=2198882&p_mode=BROWSE>.
-Mod.AS]

On the so-called 'stains map' there are dots to indicate the
contaminated farms; around these dots there are 5-km zones ["stains"]
within which there is a higher risk of human cases and in which
inhabitants are informed about the possible effects of a Q-fever
contaminated farm in their region. The experts believe that the
public health risk around such a farm has not disappeared when such a
farm has been declared Q-fever free (repeated negative bulk milk
tests, or culled and disinfected). The farm can however be removed
from the list and the dot from the geographical map; however, for the
time being the 5-km zones ["stains"] shall be maintained on the map
after lifting the contamination status. [The reason for maintaining
the 5-km areas on the map] is the need for incidental employees,
temporary workers and other services providers in and around farms
which had undergone a recent Q-fever history, to be informed in
advance about this and be able to work safely and soundly, even!
if the farm has become free in the meantime.

Depending on the further course of the human epidemic and on better
knowledge of transmission, we hope to provide further advice on this
issue at a later stage.

Finally I would like to emphasise that in order to phase out the
measures, as clarified above, it will be essential to carry out the
vaccination campaign for all groups of relevant animals, timely
(namely before pregnancy) and fully (namely 2 primary vaccinations,
or a revaccination after a primary series), before 1 Jun 2010. New
data from research or from epidemiology could require reconsideration
of the phasing-out of the measures. Involved parties will closely
follow the course of the epidemic in humans and in animals and the
obtained results of research activities.

Depending on new findings, I intend to reconvene with the experts at
the end of May [2010], at the latest.

[The above advisory document includes interim follow-up and
conclusions of the (unique) prevention and control policy undertaken
in the Netherlands in relation to this (unique) Q-fever epidemic. The
major veterinary effort included, inter alia, fortnightly milk bulk
testing of about 400 dairy farms of goats and sheep since
November-December 2009, throughout the country and the culling,
against compensation, of more than 45 000 pregnant animals (mainly
goats) in 77 farms found positive (the culling of about 1500 goats on
the 78th farm, in Wanroij, provincie Noord-Brabant, found positive on
23 Mar 2010, is currently underway). Such policy is unprecedented and
its close, ongoing assessment, is of utmost value internationally.

The option of vaccinating selected groups such as farms labor,
veterinarians, etc., has not been included in this discussion.

The advisory team, chaired by Prof Coutinho, included 13
participants, among them 6 of the animal health sector.

The above advisory document was put to discussion by the 2
ministries, followed by a letter from the 2 Ministers to the Chair of
the House, with their detailed updated common policy. This document,
in Dutch, is available at
