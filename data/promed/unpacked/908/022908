HEAVY METAL POLLUTION - SPAIN (ANDALUSIA): REQUEST FOR INFO
***********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Gerry M. Dorrestein <G.M.Dorrestein@pobox.ruu.nl>

In the South-west of Spain in Andalusia, a National Park (Donana) is faced
with disaster after the dikes of a large sedimentation pond broke and
emptied into a river. This water came from a pyrite-mine and is heavily
polluted with heavy metals and ferrosulphite (FeS2).
There is a high fish and bird mortality, affecting many species of
waterfowl and coast birds, which breed in this area. This area will be used
this fall by millions of migrating and wintering birds.
I am looking for information (personal experience, literature) concerning:
1. future effect on birds and breading after eating the polluted fish in
this area.
2. what is the effect (in the future) of sulphur-acid on the feathers.
3. how long is the sediment going to be a threat when the river empties
into the sea. How much will stay on the riverbanks and -bottom.
Anyone who has information personal or literature about this kind of
disaster please respond. (e-mail G.M.Dorrestein@POBox.RUU.NL or fax 0031 30
253 3131)

[Ecologically, agriculturally, socially, and economically this disaster is
extremely complex and will take years to play out. As ProMED-mail is
primarily concerned with emerging infectious diseases, we ask that
respondents communicate DIRECTLY with Gerry Dorrestein. It is uncertain
whether replies sent to ProMED will be passed on to him. Gerry has been
asked to assemble the information and share it with us at a future date. -
