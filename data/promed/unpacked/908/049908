[A very long overdue re-entry of polio updates for which once again I sincerely apologize. Our coverage of polio during the COVID-19 has been sub-optimal, to say the least, and 100% my fault (albeit aided by the COVID-19 pandemic).

Looking at today's [Thu 10 Dec 2020] update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), this year [2020] has been a very bad year for the global effort. The initial months of the pandemic were accompanied by reduced to paralyzed vaccination programme activities, and the wild poliovirus (WPV) and the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (primarily cVDPV2) "exploded."

The WPV1 case count is higher than it was on this approximate date in 2019; the cVDPV case count is twice that for all of 2019 and is over 3 times what it was on this approximate date in 2019.

Sobering is the observation that 25 countries have reported outbreaks associated with cVDPVs -- 23 with cVDPV2 and 2 with cVDPV1 -- and 19 African countries have had cVDPV2 outbreaks during 2020. That means 19 of 45 (42.2%) countries in Africa that report to WHO have experienced outbreaks of cVDPV2-associated paralytic disease during 2020.

Reporting of cases for 2020 will continue through January and possibly February 2021.

[2] Novel OPV2 (nOPV2)
[A] WHO EUL
Date: Fri 13 Nov 2020
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/13-11-2020-first-ever-vaccine-listed-under-who-emergency-use


WHO today [13 Nov 2020] listed the nOPV2 vaccine (Bio Farma, Indonesia) for emergency use to address the rising cases of a vaccine-derived polio strain in a number of African and East Mediterranean countries. Countries in WHO's Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions are also affected by these outbreaks. The emergency use listing, or EUL, is the 1st of its kind for a vaccine and paves the way for potential listing of COVID-19 vaccines.

The world has made incredible progress toward polio eradication, reducing polio cases by 99.9% in the last 30 years. But the last steps to ending this disease are proving the most difficult, particularly with continuing outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio viruses (cVDPVs). cVDPVs are rare and occur if the weakened strain of the poliovirus contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) circulates among under-immunized populations for a long time. If not enough children are immunized against polio, the weakened virus can pass between individuals and, over time, genetically revert to a form that can cause paralysis. Type 2 cVDPVs are currently the most prevalent form of the vaccine-derived virus.

The EUL procedure assesses the suitability of yet-to-be-licensed health products during public health emergencies, such as polio and COVID. The objective is to make these medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics available faster to address the emergency. The assessment essentially weighs the threat posed by the emergency against the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product based on a robust body of evidence.

The procedure was introduced during the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, when multiple Ebola diagnostics received emergency-use listing; since then, numerous COVID-19 diagnostics have also been listed. The nOPV2 is the 1st such listing for a vaccine.

The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, and manufacturing quality. These data are reviewed by independent experts who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and the plans for further studies.

Experts from individual national authorities are invited to participate in the EUL review and are engaged to help facilitate the necessary country-level decision process for authorization of use. Once a vaccine has been listed for WHO emergency use, WHO engages its regional regulatory networks and partners to sensitize national health authorities on the vaccine and its anticipated benefits based on data from clinical studies to date.

In addition to deciding whether to use the vaccine, each country needs to complete a readiness process for the implementation of the vaccine under the EUL. The company producing the vaccine also commits to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. WHO prequalification will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine continues to meet the necessary standards of quality, safety, and efficacy for broader availability (i.e., through procurement by UN agencies and others).

[B] Background studies
Date: May 2020
Source GPEI
http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Clinical-development-summary-nOPV2-20200521.pdf


Background
To better address the evolving risk of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2), GPEI partners are working to deploy an additional innovative tool: novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). The vaccine is a modified version of the existing type 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2), and clinical trials have shown it provides comparable protection against poliovirus while being more genetically stable and less likely to revert into a form that can cause paralysis in low-immunity settings. The vaccine's increased genetic stability means there is a reduced risk of seeding new cVDPV2 outbreaks compared to mOPV2and reduced risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP).

Human clinical trials for 2 nOPV2 vaccine candidates began in 2017. In late 2019, after a careful review of available clinical data and manufacturing considerations, candidate 1 was prioritized for assessment under the WHO emergency use listing (EUL) procedure, a mechanism that enables early, targeted use of unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics, and in-vitro diagnostic products during a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A summary of key clinical data findings for nOPV2 candidate 1 can be found below, for both high-dose and low-dose potencies.

Clinical studies
Clinical studies have been conducted in Belgium and Panama in both adults and children. Prior to the global withdrawal of Sabin OPV2 from routine use in 2016, mOPV2 clinical trials were carried out in both of these countries to provide data for comparison. The 1st in-human nOPV2 study was conducted in Belgium in adults under physical and biological containment, with findings published in The Lancet [1]. Further studies in Belgium, again in adults, and Panama, in 18-22-week-old infants and children aged 1-5 years, were completed. Preliminary results from the nOPV2 Panama study are available.

Summary of clinical data
Safety:
Data from the clinical studies show nOPV2to be well tolerated in adults, young children, and infants, with no indication of any increase in general safety risk compared to mOPV2. There have been no serious adverse events identified that are considered to be related to vaccination with nOPV2.

Immunogenicity
The most important immunogenicity evaluation was the seroprotection rate and seroconversion rate, 28 days following a single dose, in 18-22-week-old infants.
- Non-inferiority (in comparison to mOPV2) for seroprotection was established for both low-dose and high-dose potencies of nOPV2.
- There was no significant difference in seroconversion rates between nOPV2 and mOPV2.
- Following a 2nd vaccine dose, both seroprotection and seroconversion rates were uniformly high for both groups.

Viral excretion
- An exclusively IPV-vaccinated (no history of OPV vaccination) cohort of adults who received a 2nd dose of nOPV2 provided an opportunity for indirect assessment of intestinal immunogenicity to type 2 poliovirus, induced by a dose of nOPV2.There was a substantial decrease in proportion of subjects shedding the vaccine virus following 2nd dose compared to shedding positivity following the 1st dose. This is comparable to prior experience with Sabin OPVs and is encouraging.

In infants, the rate of nOPV2 shedding was comparable to mOPV2 at the peak of shedding (1st 2 weeks). However, the proportion of infants that shed nOPV2 was significantly lower than mOPV2 historic controls by week 4, indicating a likely shorter duration of shedding.

Genetic stability
Using the standard method to evaluate the neurovirulence of polioviruses (i.e., to measure paralysis rates in transgenic mice after intraspinal administration of the virus), the vaccine viruses isolated from the stool of participants after vaccination with mOPV2 or nOPV2 could be compared. In participants who receive mOPV2, the shed vaccine virus causes high paralysis rates in the mouse model after approximately 7 days. In contrast, nOPV2 shows low to no paralysis associated across the studies, regardless of the age of study participants (adults and children).

Conclusions
Overall, the pre-clinical and clinical data continue to be supportive of further clinical development, initial EUL submission, and at-risk stockpile production of nOPV2.The candidate demonstrated non-inferior immunogenicity to the historical mOPV2 control groups in the pivotal evaluation among infants. Assessment of viral excretion indicates that nOPV2 is unlikely to be shed in a greater rate or quantity as compared to mOPV2, and the cessation of intestinal mucosal viral replication and shedding may actually be earlier following vaccination in infants. While there is no direct way to quantitatively extrapolate to reduced risk of paralysis in humans, the available data support significantly improved genetic and phenotypic stability of shed nOPV2 compared to shed mOPV2.

[Fingers crossed that the nOPV2 will not lead to a delayed development of cVDPV2-associated disease. The studies are promising, but long-term data on circulation of the nOPV2 following vaccination have not been done as yet. OPV was in use globally starting in the early 1960s, with the retrospective 1st recognition of possible vaccine-associated outbreaks in Egypt in the period 1988-1993, but confirmed outbreaks elsewhere (Hispaniola! Philippines, Madagascar) identified in 2000-2001. Possible circulation of a VDPV was retrospectively identified in Belarus in 1965-1966 (Kew OM, Wright PF, Agol VI, Delpeyroux F, Shimizu H, Nathanson N, Pallansch MA. Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses: current state of knowledge. Bull World Health Organ. 2004 Jan; 82(1): 16-23. Epub 26 Feb 2004). Hence, the problem of cVDPVs wasn't confirmed for over 20 years of use. The explosion of cVDPV2 in Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions of WHO has occurred during the past few years, with hundreds of cases occurring annually.
