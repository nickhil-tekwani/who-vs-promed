Cases of encephalitis possibly due to West Nile virus or other
similar virus have been detected by the competent authorities in
Central Macedonia, according to the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. They are taking preventive measures. Under KEELPNO [the
Hellenic Centre for Diseases Control], 2 cases have been confirmed
and 9 others are possible. The final documentation of the diagnosis
is pending.

The virus is transmitted only through the bite of infected mosquitoes
and not from human to human. Many patients also mentioned by the
KEELPNO have mild symptoms such as fever and muscle aches. Some
patients do not exhibit any symptoms. A minimum figure of less than 1
percent in the mostly elderly and most vulnerable group have
complications in the central nervous system, such as meningitis or
encephalitis, but in most cases have a good course [of infection].

The Ministry of Health, in addition to measures for early detection
and reporting of incidents, [have] in addition coordination with
authorities. In addition, citizens [should] be using insect
repellents and clothing that cover the widest possible area of the
body (e.g., sleeves).

Epidemics of West Nile virus have occurred since 1996 in EU (European
Union) countries and in the USA. This is the 1st outbreak in Greece.
Outbreaks are associated with warming and population growth of mosquitoes.

[West Nile virus (WNV) transmission has been occurring within the
past 4 months in the Mediterranean Basin -- west of Greece in Italy
and southeast of Greece in Israel. So it is not surprising that
transmission has been found in Greece as well. It would be of
interest to know if equine clinical cases of WNV infection have been
occurring in Greece as well. It would be of interest to know how
climate warming has contributed to population growth of vector
mosquitoes (presumably _Culex_ species) and perhaps to changes in the
distribution of avian hosts of WNV.

Central Macedonia is one of the 13 peripheries of Greece, being the
central part of Greek Macedonia. It is divided into the prefectures
of Chalcidice, Imathia, Kilkis, Pella, Pieria, Serres, and
Thessaloniki. A map showing the location of Greek Central Macedonia
