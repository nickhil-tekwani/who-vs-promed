Background
----------
On [20 Apr 2018], 7 people were admitted to Ngenge HCIII [Health Center III], after skinning, carrying, and eating a dead cow at Kaplopwotwo village, Kween district. They all presented with blisters, oedema, and red to brown, raised spots that are typical of an anthrax infection. Additionally, 4 cows were reported to have died within the same kraal [an enclosure for cattle or sheep] in Kaplopwotwo village. Locals reportedly skinned and ate the meat from the 4 cows. Ministry of Health set out to confirm the existence of the outbreak, determine the scope and magnitude of the outbreak, identify possible exposures, and recommend evidence-based control measures.

Methods
-------
- A suspected cutaneous anthrax case was defined as onset of skin lesions (such as papule, vesicle, or eschar) in a person residing in Kaplopwotwo village, Kween district, with illness onset from [6 Apr 2018] onwards.
- A suspected gastrointestinal anthrax case as onset of abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting in a person residing in Kaplopwotwo village, Kween district with illness onset from [6 Apr 2018] onwards.
- A suspected inhalation anthrax case as onset of difficulty in breathing and any of the following: cough and blood in sputum in a person residing in Kaplopwotwo village, Kween District with illness onset from [6 Apr 2018] onwards.
- A suspected meningeal anthrax case as onset of headache, photophobia, and any of the following: neck pains/neck stiffness, convulsions, altered mental state, and coma in a person residing in Kaplopwotwo village, Kween District with illness onset from [6 Apr 2018] onwards; and
- A confirmed anthrax case as a suspected case with PCR-positivity for _Bacillus anthracis_ from a clinical sample, that is, swab from skin lesions/vesicles and blood.

We reviewed Ngenge HCIII medical records and actively searched for cases in the affected village in households exposed to the implicated cow on 11 Apr 2018 to update the line list. We conducted in-depth interviews with sub-county animal husbandry assistant, chairman LC [Local Council] I of Kaplopwotwo village, and district health officer. We also conducted environmental assessments, and trace back investigations.

Results
-------
On [11 Apr 2018], a cow suddenly died at [the residence of one of the village members]. A total of 15 village members participated in slaughtering, skinning, cutting, carrying meat, and cleaning waste of the dead cow on the same day. According to the village LC 1 [police constable], almost the entire village (more of a small cluster) ate the dead cow's meat. A big portion of it was also sold to a bar owner in Kamuga, a nearby village in Binyinyi sub-county. As of today [30 Apr 2018], we have line listed 26 cases with signs and symptoms suggestive of either cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, and meningeal, or a combination of 2 or 3 forms of anthrax infection. Of the 26 suspected cases, 6 had only cutaneous (CTN) symptoms, 1 had only inhalation (INH) symptoms, 4 had only gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms, 2 had both cutaneous and inhalation symptoms, 1 had both cutaneous and meningeal (MNG) symptoms, 7 had both cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms, 2 had both inhalation and gastrointestinal symptoms, 2 had GIT+CTN+ING, and 1 had GIT+CTN+MNG. All the 26 cases got symptoms after participating in skinning, dissecting, carrying, and eating meat from the dead cow. Only 5 of the 26 cases sought care from Ngenge HCIII. The rest didn't because they think they will regarded as Marburg cases, and therefore die at the health facility. The epidemic curve is typical of a point source outbreak with cases stating to appear on [13 Apr 2018]. In total, 10 cows have died in the same village and neighboring village within the same time period. Only 4 of the 10 have been buried.

Conclusions
-----------
This is possibly a point source outbreak with a mixture of cutaneous, gastrointestinal, inhalation, and meningeal anthrax forms associated with skinning, carrying, and eating a dead cow. We recommended vaccination of all healthy animals, treatment of the sick animals, replenishment of anthrax antibiotics at Ngenge HCIII, safe burial of carcass, community mobilization and sensitization, and availing of personal protective gears to people burying the carcasses.

[Our thanks to Dr Riolexus Ario for this detailed and very interesting report. Meningeal anthrax is not unusual. It is just frequently missed in the diagnostic workup. It is interesting that they had an inhalation case as these are usually associated with occupational exposure in wool mills. But I don't doubt it. Infectious material can be inhaled into the bronchi. As 21 of 26 did not seek medical care, I fear that many of them may have died by now, even if they were given oral antibiotics at their local pharmacy. Once symptoms have started it is vitally important to drain off any bloody fluids from the site in order to remove as much of the toxins as possible. This must be aggressively done as antibiotics just kill the organisms. They don't neutralise the toxins.
