A rabies outbreak was detected in recent days in Guarayos province, Santa Cruz department [state equivalent], where up to now 33 animals lost their lives, Radio "Santa Cruz" of the Erbol network reported.

The Santa Cruz Cattlemen's Federation [Fegasacruz] reported to the Ministry of Health that they are mobilized and are proceeding with respective vaccination of animals in ranches of the area.

The director general of Fegasacruz, Hector Sandoval, requested that ranchers decapitate their animals [and send in the head for rabies diagnosis?] if they encounter bovine rabies and incinerate the meat because it is not suitable for human consumption. He cautioned that some bad ranchers are selling this contaminated meat to consumers, knowing that this is a clear attempt against public health [regulations].

"Animals with this disease must be killed, burned, incinerated, salted in place, and [people should] avoid handling them because an infection may be caused through feed given by hand to other animals," he stated.

He asked the public to report [to the authorities] if they find that some people are selling tainted meat to the consumer.

[It is not clear if this is a continuation of the earlier rabies outbreak in Santa Cruz with a fatal equine case that was reported on 5 Feb 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120207.1035741). The origin of these bovine rabies cases is not stated but is likely virus transmission from being fed upon by infected vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) in this tropical area. An aggressive vaccination campaign of bovine animals in the area is prudent. It would be wise to vaccinate equine animals as well, because vampire bats may feed on them, too.

Although the risk of acquiring rabies virus infection through the consumption of meat from infected animals is very low, it is never prudent to consume tissues from any animals that are ill or dead.
