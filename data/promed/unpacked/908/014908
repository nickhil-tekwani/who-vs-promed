Between 13 and 19 Nov 2020, EU Member States reported one new human case of WNV [West Nile virus] infection. The case was reported by the Netherlands from the region of Arnhem/Nijmegen. This region reported a locally acquired human case of WNV infection for the 1st time through TESSy. One death was reported by Greece. No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU-neighbouring countries.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season, and as of 19 Nov 2020, EU Member States have reported 316 human cases of WNV infection, including 37 deaths, through TESSy: Greece (143, including 23 deaths), Spain (77, including 7 deaths), Italy (66, including 5 deaths), Germany (13), Romania (6, including 1 death), the Netherlands (7), Hungary (3) and Bulgaria (1, including 1 death). The province of Pazardzhik in Bulgaria, the province of Badajoz in Spain, the regions of Utrecht and Arnhem/Nijmegen in the Netherlands and 5 regions in Germany (Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Saalekreis, Halle (Saale) and Meissen) reported locally acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time. All other cases reported through TESSy were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

EU-neighbouring countries reported 17 human cases of WNV infection; all were reported by Israel.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 182 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (138), Germany (20), Italy (14), France (5), Portugal (2), Austria (2) and Hungary (1) through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS). Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 2 outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS, both by Bulgaria.

[3] Review of WNV in Europe
Date: Thu 19 Nov 2020
Source: Eurosurveillance [edited]

The 2020 arthropod vector season in Europe is approaching its end. Data from indicator-based surveillance on vector-borne diseases in 2020 will be reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only in 2021, but we are already able to draw a preliminary picture from data obtained via event-based surveillance and weekly reporting of West Nile virus (WNV) infections.

In 2020, WNV caused remarkable outbreaks in certain areas in Europe, such as Spain and the Netherlands. However, the largest outbreak of human WNV infections in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries was recorded in 2018, when 11 countries reported 1548 locally acquired mosquito-borne infections [1; see source URL for complete references]. The number of WNV infections in 2018 exceeded the cumulative number of all reported infections between 2010 and 2017, and the highest number of newly affected areas (n = 45) was reported [2]. Even though in 2019 the number of reported locally acquired human WNV infections dropped by 73% compared with 2018, the total numbers were still the second highest ever recorded. Most countries reported numbers of infections similar to before 2018, while Greece continued to report a high number of infections [1].

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season on 1 Jun, and as of 12 Nov, EU/EEA countries have reported 315 human cases of WNV infection with known place of infection through the European Surveillance System (TESSy): Greece (n = 143), Spain (n = 77), Italy (n  =  66), Germany (n = 13), Romania (n = 6), the Netherlands (n = 6), Hungary (n = 3) and Bulgaria (n =  1) [3] (Figure [at source URL]). It is noteworthy that some countries reporting very low numbers of infections in 2020, ranging from none to 6, had previously detected higher numbers of human WNV infections (e.g., Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Romania). Additionally, in other endemic countries reporting a large number of cases (i.e., Greece and Italy), the proportion of the more severe manifestation of the infection, West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND), was higher than the average of the previous 5 years.

Within the last decade, the geographical spread of a genetic WNV lineage 2 strain has been observed in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean region [4]. In Germany, this EU-dominant strain was first detected in 2018 in resident birds and horses. The first 5 locally acquired vector-borne human cases were reported in 2019 in the country. In the current issue of Eurosurveillance, Pietsch et al. report an outbreak of 9 locally acquired cases of West Nile fever (WNF) and WNND in Leipzig, Germany, in August and September 2020 [5]. The authors hypothesise endemic seasonal circulation of WNV lineage 2 in the city of Leipzig in 2020 and also in the coming years; therefore, they suggest population's and healthcare workers' WNV awareness should be further increased as well as the surveillance in animals.

WNV lineage 2 was also reported in bird and mosquito samples in the Netherlands, for the 1st time, at the end of August 2020 [6]. Hereafter, the 1st locally acquired human WNV infections were diagnosed, in the region of Utrecht, in September and October [3,7].

Since 2017, WNV lineage 2 has been spreading further west in the Mediterranean region, via the south of France, reaching Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where it only caused sporadic cases in birds [8]. However, an unprecedented outbreak of WNV infections occurred in the southern Spanish provinces of Seville, Cadiz and Badajoz, between July and September 2020, comprising 77 infections diagnosed in humans and 137 documented outbreaks among equids [3]. A lineage 1 WNV strain was detected in both humans and animals; hence, this outbreak has no epidemiological link to other concurrent WNV outbreaks in Europe [8]. Of note, Spain did not report locally acquired WNV infections in humans from 2017 to 2019.

Albeit numbers of human WNV infections in 2020 were lower than in previous years, the geographic expansion of WNV has continued in Europe. The environmental and ecological drivers of WNV are complex and not known in detail, yet. Nevertheless, ambient temperature is known as one important determinant through its effect on mosquito reproduction rates and the extrinsic virus period in mosquitoes. According to the monthly climate bulletins of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, positive surface air anomalies were recorded in the southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula from July to August, as well as in northwest Europe from August to October [2020]. The temporospatial overlap with the WNV outbreaks might be a mere coincidence, but in the long term, the environmental conditions tend to become more favourable for WNV establishment and seasonal circulation in many European regions. The European spread of another flavivirus, closely related to WNV, the Usutu virus (USUV), may be regarded as an example. The 1st cases of USUV-associated wild bird mortality events were described in Italy in 1996 and in Austria in 2001. Within 2 decades, USUV has spread all over Europe, except for the Baltic countries and Scandinavia, and in 2020, USUV emerged in the United Kingdom. Although the ecology and epizootiology of USUV and WNV differ in several points (e.g., higher genetic diversity of USUV in Europe indicates various, recent introductions from Africa), the 2 viruses share mosquito vectors and avian hosts; therefore, the environmental and ecological conditions suitable for USUV may indicate the same for WNV (e.g., vector competences).

Most of the diagnosed human WNV infections in 2020 were reported from areas with virus activities already recorded in the previous years. This, together with genetic data, indicates overwintering and local circulation of the virus. Therefore, once established, the likelihood of maintenance and the risk of re-emergence of WNV infections in the affected European areas are high. The geographical spread after recent WNV lineage 2 introduction may be limited, e.g., as it was seen in the eastern federal states of Germany, since 2018, but a massive geographical spread has been observed 4 to 5 years after its 1st emergence in Europe.

The annual fluctuations in WNV activity can be influenced by several factors. In the current issue of Eurosurveillance, Lourenco et al. have analysed West Nile virus epidemiology in Israel. WNV infections caused by diverse strains have been diagnosed in the country in the past decade. In 2020, Israel reported 17 human cases as of 12 Nov. Authors adapted a suitability index to WNV and found that it confirmed the geotemporal estimation of transmission potential of WNV in the country. Several further studies have been and are investigating the ecological and environmental drivers of WNV. Factors associated to national health systems, such as diagnostic awareness and vigilance, diagnostic capabilities and capacities, surveillance and reporting accuracies could also contribute to the annual variations of diagnosed and reported cases in a country. In 2020, the extraordinary and unprecedented burden on national health diagnostic systems caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic might have had an influence on WNV surveillance in some countries.

The maintenance of national preparedness for seasonal WNV outbreaks in the forthcoming years is particularly important in countries where -- even if sporadic -- cases have been reported previously, as well as in countries where the ecological conditions are suitable for WNV emergence and establishment. The risk and public health impact of human WNV infections in the different European countries clearly and significantly varies. In certain countries, surveillance of human WNV infections might be challenging or of low priority. The natural cycle of WNV involves avian hosts and mosquito vectors, while -- besides humans -- equids are also frequent, incidental hosts of the virus. Therefore, integrated animal-human WNV surveillance with systematic response and control measures, e.g., for blood donation safety, vector control, awareness and information campaigns, might allow a more efficient utilisation of national resources and capacities. Animal WNV infections should be diagnosed timely, and EU/EEA countries are encouraged to report infections via the Animal Disease Notification System of the European Commission. These data are visualised together with the TESSy data on human cases in ECDC's weekly updated maps on WNV infections in Europe. The joint animal-human surveillance data can provide more accurate information on WNV activity within the transmission season than solely data from human infections. Joint efforts on WNV surveillance and control could be one of the good examples for a One Health approach towards zoonotic diseases.

[4] Spain (Valencia): Outbreak in horses
Date: Sat 21 Nov 2020 09:08 CET

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has confirmed that there has been an outbreak of [West Nile virus] in horses in the province of Castellon. Mosquitoes carrying the [West Nile virus] were first detected by the National Animal Surveillance Program back in July [2020] in Andalusia, and a total of 139 outbreaks have been confirmed across Spain since then.

The Ministry reported on Friday [20 Nov 2020] that 2 more outbreaks have been reported, in the provinces of Castellon and Lleida.

The West Nile virus is a disease that is transmitted through the common mosquito. It is usually found in birds from the African continent, on which the insect feeds, infecting itself and later introducing it to humans, horses or other mammals with its bite.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne human and animal pathogen with nearly worldwide distribution. In Europe, the virus is endemic with seasonal regional outbreaks that have increased in frequency over the last 10 years or so.

Europe is likely to experience even larger-scale outbreaks in the coming years. Increased surveillance efforts should be implemented with a focus on early-warning detection methods, and large-scale host and vector surveys should continue to fill gaps in knowledge. - Mod.UBA
