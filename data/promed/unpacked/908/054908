Abstract.

Background
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in young children (less than 5 years old) and older adults (greater than or equal to 65 years old), leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend the implementation of a dedicated surveillance in countries.

Aim
We tested the capacity of the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospital network to contribute to RSV surveillance in Belgium.

Methods
During the 2018/19 influenza season, we started the SARI surveillance for influenza in Belgium in week 40, earlier than in the past, to follow RSV activity, which usually precedes influenza virus circulation. While the WHO SARI case definition for influenza normally used by the SARI hospital network was employed, flexibility over the fever criterion was allowed, so patients without fever but meeting the other case definition criteria could be included in the surveillance.

Results
Between weeks 40 2018 and 2 2019, we received 508 samples from SARI patients. We found an overall RSV detection rate of 62.4% (317/508), with rates varying depending on the age group: 77.6% in  children aged  less than 5  years (253/326) and 34.4% in adults aged greater than or equal to 65 years (44/128). Over 90% of the RSV-positive samples [that were] also positive for another tested respiratory virus (80/85) were from children aged less than 5 years. Differences were also noted between age groups for symptoms, comorbidities, and complications.

Conclusion
With only marginal modifications in the case definition and the period of surveillance, the Belgian SARI network would be able to substantially contribute to RSV surveillance and burden evaluation in children and older adults, the 2 groups of particular interest for WHO.

[Because influenza and the number of positive RSV cases tend to peak December through February, it is helpful for the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospital network (Belgium) to be able to conduct surveillance for both viruses at the same time. Both these viruses lead to an increase in hospitalizations due to dehydration, high fever, and other complications and need to be identified and distinguished. This year [2020] has an added complication, COVID-19. Hospitals are already overburdened with patients infected with this 3rd respiratory disease, raising concern a notch.

Even though RSV most commonly infects young children, older adults do become infected. According to WebMD, approximately 177 000 older adults are hospitalized for RSV each year in the United States, and 14 000 of them die (https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid19-rsv#1). Risk is increased in older adults for flu and COVID-19. Children generally do not suffer severe disease following infection with SARS-CoV-2, but some do become ill. So while there is some age stratification for these diseases, it is not rigid.

This will be the 1st time the 3 viruses have been co-circulating at their peak seasons. The SARI hospital network may want to refine the new case definition to also capture COVID-19 cases. - Mod.LK
