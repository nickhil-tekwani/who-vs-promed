The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has temporarily banned the import of Danish
beef and related products, apparently over the discovery of a case of "mad
cow" disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) in Denmark.
Newspapers quoted a statement issued by the food inspection committee, as
saying the ban aimed to "protect the health and welfare of consumers." The
statement did not give a reason for the ban, but Denmark said in February
2000 that a milk cow had been affected with BSE, a fatal brain-wasting
disorder.
Several other countries including the UAE's Gulf Arab neighbor Saudi Arabia
have already banned beef imports from Denmark.
