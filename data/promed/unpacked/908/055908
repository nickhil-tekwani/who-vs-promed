[Suspected - Mod.LL] pneumonic plague has, since 16 Aug 2006, claimed 29
lives and infected another 500 people in the Pawa and Wemba areas of Isiro
District in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the WHO.
Dr. Florent Ekwanzala, an epidemiologist with the WHO, said on Mon 2 Oct
2006 that a WHO-backed health team comprising a supervisor, laboratory
nurse and members of an international NGO had collected samples that were
sent to the National Institute of Bio-Medical Research in Kinshasa to
confirm the diagnosis.
The WHO team has been informing the local population on how to avoid the
disease by taking precautions against flea bites, avoiding the handling of
carcasses in plague-endemic areas and contact with infective tissues, or
being exposed to patients with pneumonic plague.
"The samples are expected to be compared with those of other lung diseases,
as it could also turn out to be leptospirosis," Ekwanzala said.
Ekwanzala said the same area recently experienced a similar epidemic on a
smaller scale, which could have spread from the neighboring region. A few
cases were recorded in the Reti, Ringa and Zobia zones of the Bas-Uele
District.
There were 19 deaths and 100 suspected cases in June 2006 in the
neighboring district of Ituri, which, according to the WHO, is the most
active breeding ground for human plague in the world, with an average of
1000 cases per year.
Plague is endemic in many countries in Africa, in the former Soviet Union,
the Americas and Asia. In 2003, 9 countries reported 2118 cases and 182
deaths, almost all in Africa.

[The relatively low mortality rate reported in the posting suggests
alternative diagnoses; at least not all the cases are the pneumonic form.
ProMED would like more information about these clusters of possible
pneumonic plague.
