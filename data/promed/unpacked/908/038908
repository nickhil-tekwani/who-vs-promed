[Turkey's province Bitlis is in Eastern Turkey, separated from the (further east) Iranian border by the province Van, which has similarly been infected. For some reason, Bitlis was not included in Turkey's previous notification to the OIE though earlier reported as infected to the EU authorities (posting 20151107.3772559). The province Amasya, reportedly infected about a month after the start of the event in Van, is in central-north Turkey, adjacent to the Black Sea, northeast of Ankara; Amasya is a city on the road of the Europe and Iran International Way. OIE's interactive summarising map, showing the 3 outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=19092.

The distance between Bitlis and Amasya is about 600 km (as the crow flies); such a distant spread may be indicative of a wider circulation than reported of the exotic FMDV serotype A strain, against which the local livestock population is not protected.

Turkey's livestock population (OIE 2014 data) is the following: cattle 14 122 847, buffaloes 121 826, goats 10 347 159, sheep 31 115 190,
swine 1235. (For comparison, UK's data: cattle 9 777 633, buffaloes 3680, goats 98 884, sheep 31 679 184, swine 4 618 020).

The report says that the virus strain involved is genotyped VII. In the previous report, the Turkish authorities indicated that this genotyping result was obtained from the World Reference Laboratory (WRLFMD) at Pirbright. So far, the Turkish page on the WRLFMD website does not present the genotyping report, which usually includes a list of the 10 closest reference vaccine strains. However, in case the Turkish strain is indeed close or similar to the FMDV-A strain identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2015, as indicated in an earlier Turkish report (also yet to be confirmed by WRLFMD), subscribers may refer to its genotyping results, available in the report "IAH-P-EP-MEG-FOR-005-3" at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm (go to batch number WRLFMD/2015/00025, received 15/09/2015, type A). According to the said report, the closest reference strain is more than 15 percent distant from the new Saudi field strain.

FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII belongs to pool 2 (Indian subcontinent) of FMD virus strains. Genotype VII is, according to recent information, endemic in India. In addition to India, it has been identified in Bangladesh in 2013 (ref 1, dated 2015; see table 1). The said reference does not indicate additional spread of this genotype worldwide.

According to ref. 2 (dated 2002), FMDV serotype A genotype VII contained, at the time of publication, 49 field isolates, of which the oldest one had been isolated in Assam in 1989 (IND 21/90). One strain of this genotype was, according to this source, isolated in Albania in 1996(Albania/96). This strain was 2.8-14.7 percent nucleotide divergent from the Indian isolates. Most of these isolates were from Cattle and 2 from Buffalo origin (IND39/2000 and IND 81/2000).

In their 6 Nov 2015 report to EUFMD, the Turkish authorities wrote: "Our FMD institute produced vaccine for this new strain. Within 15 days, these vaccines will be used in outbreaks and risky areas." According to the current report, 789 and 460 cattle have been vaccinated in Amasya and Bitlis, respectively. Our RFI regarding the vaccine strain used and the testing of the vaccine, included in the previous posting, is pending; such information is of high value when other countries in the region are threatened by this new, and rather pathogenic (case fatality rate of 7.87 percent) virus strain.

The recent international spread of Indian FMD virus strains (serotype O in Saudia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco; serotype A in Saudia and Turkey) is cause for concern. India is the world's leading beef exporter (buffalo meat) http://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.PDF.
