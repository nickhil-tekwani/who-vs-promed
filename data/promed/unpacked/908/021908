It may be helpful to know that freezing meat at minus 15 degrees C
effectively kills the parasite [easy to do in Siberia! - Mod.JW]
This interested responder would like to point out that the method of cooking
[the infected bear meat was] "smoking." Albeit one of the finer grilling
culinations, smoking poses a public health risk because of the low
temperatures involved with the process.
