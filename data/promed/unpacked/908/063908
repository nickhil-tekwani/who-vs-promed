The John Innes Centre (JIC) is heading a major national offensive
against ramularia, a new emerging barley disease that has gripped
areas of Europe. The CORACLE project will pull together the efforts
of leading plant scientists, breeders and industry to prevent the
disease taking root in the UK, having already spread through northern
Europe, particularly in Germany and Scandinavia, where it has caused
substantial yield losses.

Ramularia leaf spot is a fungal disease of barley that has come to
prominence in the last 10 years. It is a significant problem in
Ireland and Scotland and is spreading into England, with Norfolk
seeing a major outbreak last year [2008].

Taking an integrated approach, the scientists and companies working
on CORACLE will attempt to reduce the severity of ramularia outbreaks
in the field and stop the disease spreading in contaminated barley
grain. In the longer term, the research will help plant breeders to
produce barley varieties that are more resistant to ramularia.

Project coordinator Professor James Brown of the JIC, said: "We still
don't know very much about this disease. We'll be improving our
scientific knowledge of ramularia and helping to combat it." Dr Peter
Werner, a breeder, said: "To date, only limited progress has been
made towards ramularia control. We need improved understanding of the
pathology of the disease."

[Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) of barley is caused by the fungus
_Ramularia collo-cygni_. Symptoms including small brown rectangular
lesions with yellow margins within leaf veins, premature leaf
senescence, and loss of plant vigour. RLS can cause extensive damage
to the upper leaves in spring and winter barley once crops have
finished flowering, which can cause extensive losses in yield (up to
0.6 tons per hectare) and quality. RLS is often found in association
with other leaf spots such as sun or agrochemical scorch and
nutritional stress.

The fungus can also affect some other graminaceous hosts, which may
serve as pathogen reservoirs. It can be detected on the seed and
within symptomless leaves. It is spread via infected plant material
and wind, but its epidemiology is not yet completely known.

RLS is present in central Europe, South and Central America, and New
Zealand. It poses the greatest threat to spring malting barley, and
resistant varieties are being developed. Disease management at
present includes fungicide treatments, with correct timing being
critical. The related species _Ramularia beticola_ causes leaf spot
disease on sugarbeet.
