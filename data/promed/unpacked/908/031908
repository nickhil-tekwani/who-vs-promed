Local and regional spread of chikungunya fever in the Americas
--------------------------------------------------------------

Chikungunya fever (CHIKV), a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is currently affecting several areas in the Caribbean. The vector is found in the Americas from southern Florida to Brazil, and the Caribbean is a highly connected region in terms of population movements. There is, therefore, a significant risk for the epidemic to quickly expand to a wide area in the Americas. Here, we describe the spread of CHIKV in the 1st 3 areas to report cases and between areas in the region. Local transmission of CHIKV in the Caribbean is very effective, the mean number of cases generated by a human case ranging from 2-4. There is a strong spatial signature in the regional epidemic, with the risk of transmission between areas estimated to be inversely proportional to the distance rather than driven by air transportation. So far, this simple distance-based model has successfully predicted observed patterns of spread. The spatial structure allows ranking areas according to their risk of invasion. This characterisation may help national and international agencies to optimise resource allocation for monitoring and control and encourage areas with elevated risks to act.

Cases in The Americas
Date: Thu 12 Jul 2014

Autochthonous cases rose by nearly 50 000 in the Caribbean and Latin America during the past week; total such cases now topping 350 000. Of the 355 617 locally acquired cases, Hispaniola has 245 257 cases (Dominican Republic 193 413 cases and Haiti 51 844 cases), accounting for 69 per cent of cases.

In the United States to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on 8 Jul 2014 reports of 153 cases of chikungunya in the US. However, a compilation of state reports by Health and Disease journalist Chuck Simmins shows 42 more cases than in the CDC reports

Risk for Europe

Spread of chikungunya from the Caribbean to mainland Central and South America: a greater risk of spillover in Europe

Summary
The introduction of chikungunya in the Caribbean and the Americas illustrates how quickly diseases can spread with international travel. In the coming months, chikungunya cases among travellers visiting or returning to Europe are likely to increase. European public health authorities should, therefore, not underestimate the transmission potential of CHIKV and should remain vigilant. These imported cases could trigger local outbreaks in Europe where the competent vector is established. Levels of risk and preparedness appear very heterogeneous between and within countries. We believe that ECDC can lend support to EU Member States in preparing for potential local chikungunya outbreaks by building capacity and strengthening networks in collaboration with internationals stakeholders in this global event.

France. 17 Jul 2014. During the summer of 2014, all the prerequisites for autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus are present in southern France: a competent vector, _Aedes albopictus_, and a large number of travellers returning from the French Caribbean islands where an outbreak is occurring. We describe the system implemented for the surveillance of chikungunya and dengue in mainland France. From 2 May - 4 Jul 2014, there were 126 were laboratory-confirmed imported chikungunya cases in mainland France.

There is a risk that individuals will become infected and carry the virus back to France.

Spain. 17 Jul 2014. 10 cases of chikungunya were diagnosed in Spanish travellers returning from Haiti (n=2), the Dominican Republic (n=7) or from both countries (n=1) between April and June 2014. The presence of _Aedes albopictus_ together with viraemic patients could potentially lead to autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus in southern Europe.
