[With the addition of these 6 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 3 newly reported deaths, it brings the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 to 119, including 23 deaths (reported case fatality rate 19.3%).

Noteworthy are the 3 newly reported cases from Alkhafji city, Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] region, all 3 of whom are classified as secondary cases (cases with a history of contact with previously confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, either a household contact, healthcare acquired, or general community contact). Presumably the index case in this cluster was case no. 19-1889, a 75-year-old male reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 Mar 2019, who had a history of contact with camels.
