A total of 5 people in Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu province have been diagnosed with scrub typhus, a disease that killed 2 females in Guangzhou this year [2012].

Four patients were treated at Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University. Wang Xihua, deputy director of the hospital's department of respiratory diseases, said scrub typhus is a type of acute infectious disease caused by the chigger, a tiny mite usually found in Southern China, including Guangdong and Yunnan provinces.

Doctors suggest that people protect themselves when taking part in outdoor activities by wearing long-sleeved clothing and by avoiding sitting on the ground.

[The following is extracted from moderator ML's prior comments in ProMED-mail posts on scrub typhus:

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Scrub typhus has been reported from regions that extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.

Nanjing, located in the lower Yangtze River drainage basin with an urban population of over 7 million (2011), is the capital of Jiangsu province in eastern China (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing).
