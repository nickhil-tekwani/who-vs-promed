Chilean Psa cases have doubled
------------------------------
Chile's Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) has announced 16 new positive detections of kiwifruit disease Psa in orchards in the VII (Maule) and VIII (Biobio) regions.

SAG has urged growers outside these areas to adopt preventive measures to contain the disease's spread, including strict controls on the movement of plant materials and people, disinfection of tools, and [disinfectant] footbaths for workers. SAG has pledged it will strengthen its phytosanitary measures in positive orchards and areas at risk.

[According to the Chilean Kiwifruit Committee], Maule -- where 29 of the [current total of] 30 cases are located -- accounts for 45 percent of the country's production of the fruit. "The problem is that it is in a zone where there is a lot of production, so work needs to be done on the part of the government and growers to contain it."

They said Chile still had the opportunity to control the bacteria from reaching specific areas. "Chile has some positive orchards with the disease in its 1st stage with very low intensity, but next year [2013] it will probably be more intense; from what's been seen in New Zealand and Italy it can be very aggressive in some orchards."

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected, and spread with infected fruit cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen) and resistant crop varieties, but specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Italy and Japan, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

An outbreak in Italy in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting 25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa V. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa V. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206). Details of strains present in France, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, and China are not yet available. In Chile, Psa was first reported in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110325.0940), but the strain(s) have also not yet been identified.
