Georgia: Echovirus 9 Associated with Current Viral Meningitis Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is an update on the posting on viral meningitis
in North Georgia [see: Meningitis, viral - USA (Georgia) 20030805.1923].
We first detected the outbreak here in early April 2003, although in
retrospect there had been some cases seen in late March. Echovirus 9 was
isolated from numerous patients from cerebrospinal fluid .
