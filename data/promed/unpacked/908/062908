Queensland's health system is battling to cope with an outbreak of
the highly infectious norovirus and anyone unwell or carrying the
symptoms is being urged to stay away from hospitals.
Norovirus-associated illness -- which causes vomiting, diarrhoea,
nausea, stomach cramps, a fever, and headache -- has swept through
staff and patients at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH)
in recent weeks. Gold Coast Hospital and the Cairns Base Hospital
have also reported outbreaks of norovirus.
While staff are beginning to return to work at the RBWH, the
hospital's acting clinical chief executive, Doctor Judy Graves, today
[23 Jul 2007] issued a plea to anyone unwell to postpone visits to
the hospital. "We apologise for any inconvenience but these measures
are essential to help us control this virus while providing essential
medical care to our patients," Dr Graves said. Patients with
norovirus infection at the RBWH have been isolated to protect staff,
patients, and visitors.
A Queensland health spokeswoman said the state's public hospitals
were coping with the outbreak. Staff at the Gold Coast and Cairns
hospitals who had been infected were slowly returning to work.
Norovirus victims remain infectious for at least 72 hours after the
symptoms have gone.
There is no antiviral medication or preventative vaccine for it. To
reduce the chances of infection, people are advised that before
handling or eating food they thoroughly wash their hands after using
the toilet or changing nappies.

[Noroviruses are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.
Norovirus infection presents as vomiting and diarrhea and often
occurs in large outbreaks propagated by fecal-oral transmission via
contaminated food or water or by direct person-to-person contact.
Outbreaks affecting patients in hospitals and medical staff are not
uncommon and hospital outbreaks have occurred worldwide. In the
United States, norovirus infections are estimated to cause 23 million
illnesses a year and may cause up to 50 percent of all foodborne outbreaks.
Seroprevalence studies have shown that norovirus infections are
common throughout the world, and most children will have experienced
at least one infection by the age of 5 years. Noroviruses are
genetically and antigenically variable, hence immunity is short-lived
and outbreaks of disease are recurrent. Outbreaks in closed
communities such as schools and hospitals can occur at any time of
the year, whereas in the open community they may be seasonal whenever
conditions favour transmission, such as, the "winter-vomiting
disease" in the northern hemisphere, or the frequent association of
outbreaks with cruise ships during vacation periods.
Risk of infection is present anywhere where food is prepared
unhygienically or drinking water is inadequately treated. Of
particular risk are raw shellfish, especially oysters. - Mod.CP
