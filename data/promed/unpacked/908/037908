A mild (low pathogenic) variant of avian influenza has been detected
in a bird trading business in Zuidwolde (Drenthe). The mild bird flu
was found in 83 swans destined for export.

The swans, routinely kept "in the wild," are caught before being
traded. Low pathogenic avian influenza is very common in wild birds.
It is, therefore, not surprising that the swans were found infected;
their contamination came to light because they had to undergo testing
prior to export.

According to European regulations, kept animals which are not defined
as "poultry," need not be culled.

Since the holding is in an area where poultry farms are scanty, it was
decided to keep the animals on the premises, allowing the outbreak to
"die out." The holding in Zuidwolde will remain under the supervision
of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (WVA) until the
animals stop shedding the virus. The infected animals are quarantined,
and the other susceptible animals are being checked for infection. The
measures remain in place until the infected animals excrete no virus.

Further spread of the disease must be prevented. Therefore, a
restricted zone of 1 km around the holding in Zuidwolde has been
applied. Within the area, transportation of live poultry and eggs is
banned. There are no other poultry farms in the area.
