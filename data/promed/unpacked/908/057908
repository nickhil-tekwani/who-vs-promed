One thing that hasn't been mentioned is the use of monochloramine for disinfection of NYC [New York City] water. In cities where monochloramine is used, Legionnaire's disease is rare. See attached articles [1,2]. I'm surprised that NYC is not talking about this option.

[_Legionella_ are commonly found in fresh water and occur naturally as intracellular parasites of biofilm-associated protozoa. _Legionella_ consequently grow on inner surfaces of water pipes forming a thin biofilm layer in potable water systems. _Legionella_ grow best at temperatures between 25 to 42 degrees C (77 to 107.6 degrees F) and thus colonize the warm water side of buildings' plumbing systems and cooling towers. Monochloramine has been used as an effective water disinfectant in municipal and building water systems because it does not dissipate as rapidly as chlorine at higher temperatures (http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/chloramines_index.cfm) and can penetrate biofilms in model systems to eliminate biofilm-associated _Legionella_ (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927010500044286#abstract).

Several large cities such as Denver [Colorado] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] have been using monochloramine as part of their water treatment process for decades (http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/disinfection/chloramine/pdfs/Q2.pdf). According to the EPA, more than 1 in 5 Americans uses drinking water treated with chloramines; water that contains chloramines and meets EPA regulatory standards is safe to use for drinking, cooking, bathing and other household uses (http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/disinfection/chloramine/pdfs/Q2.pdf).

The process involves adding ammonia to chlorinated water; aqueous chlorine reacts with ammonia to form inorganic chloramines. Use of monochloramine for disinfection compared with chlorine has been associated with a lower prevalence of _Legionella_ colonization in plumbing systems and decreased risk of nosocomial outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294698/). Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco are reported to use and New York City and Chicago are reported not to use monochloramine in their municipal water supply (http://dudegrows.com/watercheck/). However, monochloramine is not without problems: for example, adding monochloramine to the water supply may be linked to increased exposure to lead in drinking water under certain conditions (http://www.miexresin.com/files/pdfs/TechNote_Chloramines_V0308.pdf).

Abstracts of the 2 articles cited by Dr. Harriman, plus a 3rd article on use of monochloramine in the water supply to prevent Legionnaires' disease, are reproduced below:

Abstract
--------
Legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which live in biofilm in natural and synthetic aquatic environments. The most frequent route of infection is inhalation of contaminated aerosol, which is often produced by faucets, showers, or cooling towers. [It also occurs less often through aspiration when a person drinks contaminated water.] Although the disease can be disseminated in potable water, the effects of the disinfection methods used by municipal water treatment facilities on the occurrence of Legionnaires' disease have not been studied. This article describes an epidemiological study in which methods for disinfecting potable water supplied to 32 hospitals where outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have occurred are compared with methods for water supplied to 48 randomly selected control hospitals. Hospitals supplied with drinking water containing free chlorine were 10.2 times more likely to have reported an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease associated with potable water than hospitals that used water with monochloramine as a residual disinfectant (odds ratio - 10.2; 95 percent confidence interval - 1.4-460).

Abstract
--------
Monochloramine disinfection of municipal water supplies is associated with decreased risk for Legionnaires' disease. We conducted a 2-year, prospective, environmental study to evaluate whether converting from chlorine to monochloramine for water disinfection would decrease _Legionella_ colonization of hot water systems. Water and biofilm samples from 53 buildings were collected for _Legionella_ culture during 6 intervals. Prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing _Legionella_ colonization before and after monochloramine disinfection were adjusted for water system characteristics. _Legionella_ colonized 60 percent of the hot water systems before monochloramine versus 4 percent after conversion (PR 0.07, 95 percent confidence interval 0.03-0.16). The median number of colonized sites per building decreased with monochloramine disinfection. Increased prevalence of _Legionella_ colonization was associated with water heater temperatures less than 50 degrees C, buildings taller than 10 stories, and interruptions in water service. Increasing use of monochloramine in water supplies throughout the United States may reduce _Legionella_ transmission and incidence of Legionnaires' disease.

Abstract
--------
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a new monochloramine generation system for control of _Legionella_ in a hospital hot water distribution system.

SETTING: A 495-bed tertiary care hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The hospital has 12 floors covering approximately 78 000 m(2).

METHODS: The hospital hot water system was monitored for a total of 29 months, including a 5-month baseline sampling period prior to installation of the monochloramine system and 24 months of surveillance after system installation (postdisinfection period). Water samples were collected for microbiological analysis (_Legionella_ species, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_, _Acinetobacter_ species, nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic plate count [HPC] bacteria, and nontuberculous mycobacteria). Chemical parameters monitored during the investigation included monochloramine, chlorine (free and total), nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia, copper, silver, lead, and pH.

RESULTS: A significant reduction in _Legionella_ distal site positivity was observed between the pre- and postdisinfection periods, with positivity decreasing from an average of 53 percent (baseline) to an average of 9 percent after monochloramine application (P less than 0.5]). Although geometric mean HPC concentrations decreased by approximately 2 log colony-forming units per milliliter during monochloramine treatment, we did not observe significant changes in other microbial populations.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the 1st evaluation in the United States of a commercially available monochloramine system installed on a hospital hot water system for _Legionella_ disinfection, and it demonstrated a significant reduction in _Legionella_ colonization. Significant increases in microbial populations or other negative effects previously associated with monochloramine use in large municipal cold water systems were not observed. - Mod.ML
