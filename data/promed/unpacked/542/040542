The Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) announced today [Mon 3 Apr 2017] that since the beginning of the year, they have received 39 notifications of mumps, with most arising in West Auckland.

The age range of affected persons is 5 months to 51 years with over half occurring among students aged 10 -- 19 years.

In a letter to providers in mid-March [2017], ARPHS writes cases have been diagnosed after travel to Fiji, Tuvalu and Japan where childhood vaccinations may not have included the mumps. More recent cases have been diagnosed in a local school and a major containment strategy is underway to control the spread of mumps.

The best prevention against mumps is immunization with 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR).

Colorado this year [2017] is seeing a surge in mumps cases unlike any other in at least a decade, but a state Health Department official said it appears that the outbreak responsible for most of the cases so far is ending.

In only 3 months of 2017, Colorado has seen 60 reported cases of mumps, and more possible cases are being investigated, said Dr Lisa Miller, the state epidemiologist. That is more than 3 times the number of cases reported in the state all of last year [2016]. Every other year in the previous decade saw only single-digit case numbers.

The biggest reason for the dramatic spike this year [2017] has been an outbreak of 46 linked cases in Denver and Arapahoe County. But Miller said no new linked cases have been identified since the end of February [2017], and health officials are hopeful that vaccination clinics helped stem the outbreak.

"But we are continuing to get sporadic cases of mumps that don't turn out to be related to the outbreak," Miller said.

Those isolated cases, Miller said, are the result of a nationwide mumps boom that mirrors Colorado's own increase. This year [2017], 37 states have reported more than 1000 mumps cases, combined, and Miller said outbreaks elsewhere will likely continue to keep Colorado case numbers ticking upward.

The mumps, which causes telltale painful swelling in the glands of the cheek and jaw, is often thought of as an old-time virus. Most people born before 1957 have probably been exposed to mumps in their lifetimes. But vaccination made mumps cases much more rare.

Miller said the outbreak this year [2017] mostly occurred in unvaccinated people. Those who have been vaccinated can still catch mumps if exposed, but it is much less likely and the symptoms would be less severe.

Miller said it is possible that mumps outbreaks are cyclical and that this year's will soon be relegated to history. But she also encouraged more people to get vaccinated in order to break the cycle.

"The intervention is really very clear," she said.

Dallas County Health and Human Services report 76 mumps cases in the county, 56 of them coming from students and teachers in Cedar Hill ISD.

A letter went out to Cedar Valley College students and staff alerting them about a high school student from Cedar Hill Collegiate Academy taking classes there might have exposed others.

Dallas County reported its 1st mumps case on 19 Jan [2016]. Each week since, there have been more cases.

Audra Barrett, the VP for Instruction at Cedar Valley College said students and faculty in 4 classes may have been exposed. "They were notified by our president but they were also given this letter as well with very direct bullet points of what needs to happen and what to look out for," said Barrett.

The college isn't adding any additional cleaning beyond what's routine but the college is offering an immunization clinic on [Thu 6 Apr 2017].

"Something that is touching close to home you just want to make sure that you are well prepared," said Barrett.

Cedar Hill ISD in conjunction with DCHSS offered a booster shot or 3rd round of mumps, measles and rubella vaccine and started cleaning more.

There is no treatment for mumps, but most people recover completely in a few weeks.

The Lake County Health Department has been investigating a multi-jurisdictional outbreak of mumps. Health officials reported confirmed and probable cases at Barrington School District 220 and several other schools.

Those who contracted mumps reside in Lake, Cook, Kane and McHenry counties, 13 according to a health department news release.

On [Mon 13 Mar 2017], the Health Department held a vaccination clinic for Barrington High School staff and students who were not up to date with their measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccinations. A 2nd MMR vaccination clinic is scheduled at the high school in April [2017].

To help prevent the virus from spreading:

- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
- Dispose of used tissues in the trash can.
- If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow, not your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water.
- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters.

Officials with the Lexington-Fayette County Health Department have confirmed 2 mumps cases in Fayette County. These are the 1st mumps cases of the year [2017].

Mumps is a viral infection that causes painful swelling in the glands of the cheek and jaw. Other symptoms may include low-grade fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and headache, but about a 3rd of people who have the virus don't have symptoms. The virus is spread through direct contact with the respiratory droplets or saliva of an infected person. Serious complications from mumps are rare, but include meningitis and other problems.

Symptoms of mumps usually appear from 16 to 18 days after exposure. A person with mumps can spread the disease from 2 days before to 5 days after gland swelling begins, so people with mumps should stay at home until at least 5 days after the swelling starts.

Health officials say the best way to protect against mumps in by getting vaccinated.

A total of 2 students at University of the Pacific have confirmed cases of mumps, the 1st such cases in San Joaquin County since 2011, according to San Joaquin County Public Health Services.

Up to 7 additional suspected cases among students are being investigated, and the university is working with the health department to stop the spread of the illness.

Public health officials are recommending that even fully vaccinated students get another dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine for added protection.

"We're recommending that 3rd dose to try to stop the spread of the disease," Dr Julie Vaishampayan, assistant health officer, said in a statement. "It does help if high numbers of students take that 3rd dose."

Students who have never had the vaccine, and even those who have had only 1 dose, are even more exposed and should also be vaccinated.

The university is working with the student body to ensure access to the vaccine.

"Our priority is to ensure that the students are taken care of and that faculty, staff and the Pacific community take measures to protect themselves," said Pacific's Vice President for Student Life Patrick Day.

The 1st student with symptoms had traveled to an out-of-state conference in mid-February and developed symptoms in early March [2017]. Since late March, 2 students with close contacts to the initial student have been diagnosed with mumps, and several others have developed symptoms of inflammation of the parotid gland.

All the affected students are in the physical therapy and pharmacy programs. Students in the physician assistant program at the Sacramento campus who take some classes in pharmacy in Stockton are also being notified of possible exposure.
