[1] Netherlands: vaccine effectiveness
Date: Thu 4 Nov 2021

ref: de Gier Brechje, Andeweg Stijn, Backer Jantien A, et al. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 transmission to household contacts during dominance of delta variant (B.1.617.2), the Netherlands, August to September 2021. Euro Surveill. 2021;26(44):pii=2100977. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.44.2100977

In early August 2021, we reported vaccine effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and infections among household and other close contacts of confirmed cases in the Netherlands (1). That study was based on source and contact tracing data collected from February to May 2021, when the wildtype and alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.7) were dominating.

From [29 May to 4 Jul 2021], the delta variant (B.1.617.2) took over and became dominant, with over 85% delta variant among sequenced isolates starting from [5 Jul 2021]. Effectiveness of full vaccination of the index case against transmission to unvaccinated and fully vaccinated household contacts, respectively, was 63% (95% confidence interval (CI): 46 75) and 40% (CI: 20 54), in addition to the direct protection of vaccination of contacts against infection.

Discussion
Our results indicate that vaccination confers protection against onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated index cases, albeit somewhat less for the delta than for the alpha variant. The VET [vaccine effectiveness against transmission] to unvaccinated household contacts is higher than to vaccinated household contacts, with the latter already largely protected from infection and especially from severe disease by their own vaccine-induced immunity.

The difference in VET between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated household contacts might also be attributable to differences in age distribution and/or unmeasured confounding, for example by clinical vulnerability or risk behaviour, between the 2 populations. Possible decreasing vaccine effectiveness against infection and against onward transmission could result in increased SARS-CoV-2 circulation among populations with high vaccine coverage. As full vaccination remains highly effective in preventing severe disease, also for the delta variant, a high vaccination coverage remains the key to control the COVID-19 pandemic (12).

Russia recorded 41 335 coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the highest daily number since the onset of the pandemic, the anti-coronavirus crisis center said on Saturday [6 Nov 2021]. The total number of cases has reached 8 755 930. According to data from the crisis center, Russia's coronavirus growth rate was 0.47%. The country's new daily coronavirus cases exceed 40 000 for the 4th day in a row.

In particular, 3138 cases were reported in St Petersburg in the past day, 1621 in the Samara region, 795 in the Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod regions, and 776 in Crimea.

There are currently 975 123 active coronavirus cases in Russia. Russia's coronavirus recoveries rose by 29 201 to 7 535 172 in the past 24 hours. According to data from the crisis center, 86.06% of coronavirus patients have recovered in Russia. In particular, 3330 recoveries were confirmed in St. Petersburg in the past day, 986 in the Samara region, 701 in Crimea, 690 in the Krasnoyarsk region, and 669 in the Bashkortostan region.

Russia recorded 1188 coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, down from 1192 the day before. The total coronavirus death toll has climbed to 245 635. According to data from the crisis center, 2.81% of coronavirus patients have died in Russia. In particular, 86 coronavirus fatalities were reported in St Petersburg in the past day, 46 in the Krasnodar region and 40 in the Voronezh region. The Stavropol and Perm regions recorded 41 deaths each.

[According to the Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/), Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) = Deaths / Cases [that is: deaths + recovered cases]. Using today's worldwide data = 5 060 131 / 231 million = 2.2% (2.2% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a fatal outcome, while 97.8% recover). The report above says that 2.8% of COVID patients in Russia have died, but the data above (245 635 deaths and 7 535 172 recoveries) -- which tally with today's Worldometer data -- suggest an IFR of 3.2%, a little higher than for the world overall. But the report also states that 86.1% of patients have recovered, leaving about 11% unaccounted for. These numbers are difficult to compare though, because many cases are not confirmed and not included in the calculation. See https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid for a discussion of the different presentations of mortality rate. - Mod.LK]

[3] Covid impact on brain
Date: Fri 5 Nov 2021

How does COVID-19 change the brain?
-----------------------------------
[COVID-19] may be best known for its ability to rob people of their breath, but as the pandemic spread, patients began reporting a disconcerting array of cognitive and psychiatric issues -- memory lapses, fatigue and a mental fuzziness that became known as brain fog. There were also more acute problems, including paranoia, hallucinations, thoughts of suicide and psychosis.

This strange constellation of symptoms has led researchers to suspect that the disease is mounting a direct attack on the brain. Researchers want to figure out how -- and what the assault's long-term effects may be. Dr Maura Boldrini, a neuroscientist at Columbia University, studies the biology of suicide and the physiological markers of resilience in brain tissue. She is also a practicing psychiatrist. That combination makes her uniquely suited to investigate the underpinnings of "long COVID". She has gathered more than 40 brains from COVID-19 victims to guide her in her quest. What Boldrini and her colleagues learn could have implications far beyond COVID-19, shedding light on mental illness, the origins of dementia and the myriad ways viral infections affect the brain. To unlock the disease's secrets, they'll have to carefully take each brain apart, count its cells, track its gene expression and document its proteins."We have a lot of work to do," Boldrini says.

New York City was one of the coronavirus' early targets, and Boldrini soon noticed surprising issues among COVID-19 patients, including serious mood and psychiatric symptoms. "Very strange symptoms," she recalls -- made even stranger because they were cropping up in people with no personal or family history of such problems. Adding to the mystery was the appearance of these conditions relatively late in a patient's life rather than in adolescence and early adulthood.

"I feel like this dread that I'm feeling is something organic in my brain," one patient told her. "Psychologically, I'm not anxious about anything." "It's a very different kind of symptomatology compared to people that have normal anxiety," Boldrini says. Then there were the rarer, but more disturbing, cases of suicidal ideation.

Boldrini has not encountered a COVID-19 patient who died of suicide. But one case did hit her university close to home: Dr Lorna Breen, an emergency department physician at Columbia who worked on the front lines before becoming ill herself during the pandemic's brutal first wave. Breen was a talented and dedicated doctor who took up snowboarding and salsa dancing in her spare time. Shortly after returning to work, her mental health deteriorated and she died by suicide within weeks. "She had COVID, and I believe that it altered her brain," her sister Jennifer Feist said on NBC's "Today" last year [2020].

If so, how? Researchers have found signs that the virus can establish a foothold of sorts on the periphery of the brain, where the protective blood-brain barrier opens up to allow key molecules to slip through. One of those places is the olfactory bulb, which can be reached through the nose -- a fact that could explain why so many COVID-19 patients lose their sense of smell. Yet scientists have so far found little evidence that the virus penetrates any deeper than that. Instead, they've seen the type of damage caused by strokes, as well as the blood clots that may have precipitated them.

That's part of why Boldrini and many others suspect that inflammation -- the immune system's all-hands-on-deck response to an invader -- may play an essential role in the brain damage experienced by COVID-19 patients. Inflammation can trigger blood clots, and once a clot forms, inflammation increases around it. It's similar to what's seen in people who experience traumatic brain injury, including football players, military veterans and victims of car accidents. "People that have this kind of trauma in the brain have presented with sudden changes in behavior and personality and suicide and other brain symptoms," Boldrini says. It's eerily similar to what many COVID-19 patients face -- and she doesn't think that's a coincidence.

To gain a deeper understanding of what's happening on a cellular and molecular level, scientists need to study the brains of people who died of COVID-19. But Boldrini prefers not to work with brains collected by others -- she has to know everything about how the tissue was collected and preserved so she can understand the results of her experiments. "Depending how you freeze, store and fix the brain, you can get very different results," she says.

At Columbia, she and her colleagues examine tissue from autopsies, so they have complete control over how the precious tissue is handled. Boldrini wants to know which genes were being expressed; to track molecular markers of inflammation; to see how microglia -- the brain's immune cells -- were behaving; and to document the state of the neurons and their connections with one another.

Mapping the multifaceted effects of one disease is an ambitious endeavor, and it requires painstaking work. ...

[Young immature neurons are] sparse in many patients who had COVID-19 -- about 10 times less abundant. That's a problem because these young neurons are necessary for learning and memory, for coping with stress, and for integrating memories with emotions. Boldrini suspects these immature cells are done in by stress hormones and inflammation. "This would explain the brain fog," she says.

... Other scientists have found that COVID-19 damages the hippocampus. That could help explain why some patients have lingering issues with depression and anxiety.

If this damage is caused by inflammation, it probably wreaks havoc in several ways. Scientists suspect it disrupts the flow of serotonin, a hormone that's implicated in depression, and prompts the body to make kynurenine instead, even though it's toxic to neurons. Inflammation also triggers coagulation, creating clots that can block blood flow to cells and kill them. And it activates the microglia, which may attempt to remove more neurons than they normally would.

Boldrini's work will help scientists disentangle the factors driving that damage. ...

In a nearby room, research assistant Cheick Sissoko checks to see whether the DNA fragments obtained from the [brain] tissue are too big or too small for proper analysis. If they're the right size, Sissoko will use them to better understand the gene expression in these brain cells -- particularly in the young neurons that seem to be taking a hit in COVID-19 patients. "Ideally, we can look at every single gene expressed by a single cell," he says.

On other days, Sissoko focuses on RNA, the molecule that helps turn DNA's instructions into actual proteins. The RNA contained in brain tissue may provide clues about the alarms that were set off in the body in response to the coronavirus, and how the body reacted to a perceived threat. Sissoko uses a sophisticated new technique to sequence the RNA on a slide-by-slide basis. That allows him to see how RNA expression changes in different parts of the brain.

Ultimately, the researchers aim to combine the data on RNA, the microglia, the new and mature neurons, and the connections they make to create a portrait of a brain ravaged by COVID-19. By comparing the brains of COVID-19 patients with and without neurological symptoms, Boldrini hopes to shed light on the role of inflammation in a wide swath of neurodegenerative diseases, including depression and dementia. ...-more

[Also see https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-invades-brain-dealing-long-term-coronavirus-rcna4414. Two new studies -- from the California National Primate Research Center and the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto -- suggest that the virus directly infects neurons in the brain, potentially offering clues as to why some people suffer from a range of symptoms long after their initial Covid infection.

(The studies were) presented on Wednesday (3 Nov 2021) during a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience....

...researchers worldwide are urgently trying to learn more about the mysterious and debilitating illness that is estimated to affect at least 1/3 of the more than 46 million people who have been infected in the US, as well as millions more globally.

... research, from the California National Primate Research Center, found that rhesus monkeys infected with the virus had significant evidence of infection inside the brain's neurons just 7 days after exposure. This was particularly true for older, diabetic animals.

... Previous research on neural infection has been mixed, and not all experts agree that the findings offer definitive proof. ..."

This research presented at the meeting is preliminary and has not been peer-reviewed, thus is important to evaluate further. With 1/3 of infected individuals in the US suffering, and more worldwide, with neurologic sequelae that are highly debilitating physically and psychologically, it is a critical area of research. - Mod.LK]
