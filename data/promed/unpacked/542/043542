More than 650 cases of Oropouche fever [virus] infection were
confirmed by the Secretariat of Health of Amapa, in the municipalitiy
of Mazagao, located in the south of the state. The cases have
attracted attention not just for the high number of patients of this
disease, but also because it has been at least 5 years since there
has been an epidemic of Oropouche fever in Amanonia.

According to the Secretary of Health of Mazagao, Jose Monteiro, in
order to prevent the disease from leaving the municipality, the
prefecture has now initiated cleanup action in areas that are foci of
the vector mosquito [biting midge _Culicoides_ spp.], including
removing animals from these areas and application of [insecticide]
fumigation, which is necessary to counter the reproduction of the
mosquito. The city has nearly 14 000 inhabitants, according to the
survey done in 2007 by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics. The 1st cases of Oropouche fever occurred in the state in
March this year [2009], but have intensified in the last 3 months.

The infectious disease physician Maria Paula Mourao, who also carries
out research on the disease in the Amazonian Foundation of Tropical
Medicine, confirmed that the situation in Mazagao can be considered
an epidemic. According to her, the states of the Amazon must be
prepared to identify the occurrence of Oropouche fever. The expert
explained that the disease can only be diagnosed by laboratory tests.
Across the Amazon, only the Instituto Evandro Chagas, in Para, and
the Amazonian Foundation for Tropical Medicine in are prepared to
identify the disease. Manaus has also recorded the disease in the
last 2 years. "Often, as the disease is not serious, the municipal
health networks classify the diagnosis of Oropouche fever as just a
virus [infection]. We must prepare them to make the correct
diagnosis," she said.

Acute fever, intense headache, skin rash, joint and muscle pain are
symptoms that can appear in [the course of] a patient's disease. With
no cough or coryza, the disease is often confused with dengue and
malaria due to the similarity of symptoms. The duration of Oropouche
fever in the human body can last up to 7 days.

Oropouche fever is a tropical disease. Global warming and
deforestation can encourage the creation of environments conducive to
the midge. Epidemics were recorded in Manaus in the 1980's and in
Rondonia more than 5 years ago. The transmission is through a midge
called "maruim" [_Culicoides_ spp.]. The insect is also known as the
gunpowder midge and its larvae can live in fresh water or salt water.
The _Culicoides_ is found in wet woods and swamps. Reproduction
occurs in areas of flooding and decomposing organic matter. The name
of the insect is due to its small size and color that resembles a
grain of gunpowder.
