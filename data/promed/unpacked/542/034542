Two children have died of measles, and 30 others are in critical condition in a Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) health facility in Pibor Administrative Area, South Sudan, the medical charity has said.

In a press a statement seen by the East African on Fri 6 Nov 2020, MSF says the contagious, life-threatening disease is causing a severe crisis.

"We believe measles is now widespread and getting out of control. It is especially concerning that the Greater Pibor Administrative Area is flooded and in an emergency. We started with 4, then 6, and then 18 isolation beds," MSF's Dr Adelard Shyaka said.

The charity urged health organisations to urgently launch a vaccination campaign to curb the outbreak.

"The severity of the outbreak is being magnified by other illnesses like severe malaria, pneumonia and severe malnutrition. Two children have already died, and we are deeply concerned that without a prompt, reactive vaccination campaign, more children will continue to die," Dr Shyaka said.

MSF epidemiologist Laura Wright said measles can infect around 12-18 other people during the 8-day period in which a person with the disease is infectious.

"We can expect the infection rate of measles in Pibor today [7 Nov 2020] to be alarmingly higher than these estimates. A total of 71 per cent of patients are under one year of age. This is likely due to a disruption of routine vaccinations, resulting from the flooding that also happened this time last year [2019] and the ongoing conflict," she said.

[The situation in Pibor Administrative region is a real challenge because not only is the flooding hindering the vaccination campaign, but other diseases including severe malaria, pneumonia, and severe malnutrition, as stated above, are also problematic. Malnourishment in particular exacerbates measles infections.

"Malnourished children experience more severe measles infections at a greater frequency than well-nourished children. In Africa, the mortality rate for measles infection is 25-50% in infants and young children with edematous malnutrition. There is some evidence that the altered immune responses of malnourished people permit widespread viral infection.

The more extensive viral invasion of tissues and widespread inflammation and cell death in malnourished children infected with measles may contribute to the generation of more complexes and consequent immunosuppression, in turn resulting in secondary infections" [See: Severity of measles in malnutrition.
