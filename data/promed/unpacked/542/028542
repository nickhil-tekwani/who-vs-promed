Anthrax confirmed in SD for 1st time this year
----------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota for the 1st time this year.
The South Dakota Animal Industry Board has confirmed that one adult
cow was lost in a herd of 175 unvaccinated animals in Aurora County.

Anthrax is a very serious, quarantinable disease because it can cause
the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time.
Often, animals are found dead with no illness detected. Strict
enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses
from cattle suspected to have died from anthrax is important to
prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.
Producers should consult their veterinarians and vaccinate their
livestock, if deemed appropriate.

"It would make good sense to continue to vaccinate cattle and other
livestock in that area for the next several years," said Dr Dustin
Oedekoven, state veterinarian. Oedekoven reports that anthrax spores
survive indefinitely in contaminated soil and that much of South
Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak.

Significant climate change, such as drought, floods and winds, can
expose anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Alkaline soils, high
humidity and high temperature present conditions for anthrax spores to
vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock.

[Aurora County is a small county in SE South Dakota [see
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg] of
some 713 square miles and a declining population of 2710 people [see
Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_County,_South_Dakota].

In 2000 there were 3 bovine outbreaks involving Clark county (1) and
Day county (2); in 2001 an outbreaks involving a rodeo bison herd in
Jerauld county; in 2002 there were 7 affected herds in Butte County,
and one in 2003 in which 16 cattle died; 2004 in Tripp County; in 2005
there was a severe epidemic involving 11 counties following multiple
deaths on a rodeo bison ranch in Sully county topping out with 38
herds affected and some 330 cattle and bison; 2006 2 outbreaks; 2007 2
outbreaks; 2008 3 outbreaks; 2009 1 outbreak. In the past decade there
have been no human cases. A constant pitter-patter of cases reflecting
the extension problems of persuading the ranchers to vaccinate their
herds. - Mod.MHJ]
