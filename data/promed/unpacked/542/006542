SEA TURTLE, DIE-OFF - AUSTRALIA: RFI

I am writing to request further information regarding the sea turtle
die-offs in North America. The recent ProMED-mail article mentions a
possible infection with a parasite in the brain.
We have recently experienced an acute outbreak of _Caryospora cheloniae_
infections in green sea turtles off the east coast of Australia. This
protozoal parasite caused significant lesions in the brain of affected
turtles. Schistosome parasites are also a common finding in the brains of
turtles, but they often do not cause significant lesions. We wondered if
there was any further information available regarding the brain parasite
referred to in the ProMED-mail article.
