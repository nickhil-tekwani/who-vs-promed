Below is a copy of the June 8, 1998 press release from the California
Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). As for the ProMED-mail report of
6/15/98, the only error was the heading of NDV in cormorants and the
statement that Dr. Arnoldi reported an outbreak of NDV in cormorants. [See
correction posting above. - MHJ The VVND virus was isolated in the
California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, Fresno branch
laboratory, from a flock of 48 game chickens. The flock was depopulated on
June 8th and the infected housing was cleaned, disinfected and destroyed.
No commercial flocks have been exposed. The CDFA is continuing
surveillance, but thus far, everything has been negative for NDV.

June 8, 1998 - Press Release
Routine disease surveillance has successfully detected exotic Newcastle
disease in backyard game chickens in an urban area of Fresno, California.
On May 26, 1998, the owner of the chickens sought veterinary assistance
from a private practitioner after 10 birds on his premises began showing
signs of listlessness, upper respiratory disease, and diarrhea. The
backyard facility housed a total of 48 game chickens. Chickens from the
premises were submitted to the California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
System (CVDLS) in Fresno for a full diagnostic necropsy. California State
and Federal Animal Health Officials were immediately notified by the CVDLS
that gross pathology was suggestive of Newcastle disease.
Chickens on the affected premises were immediately placed under a hold
order, and the owner was assisted with the cleaning and disinfection of the
premises. Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease were discussed
and the owner was very cooperative. The owner had not moved birds from his
facility during the last six months.
On June 2, a virus isolated by CVDLS was submitted to National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for characterization. On June 7,
NVSL confirmed the isolate was a velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease
(VVND) virus.
All remaining chickens on the affected premises have been depopulated. A
thorough epidemiologic investigation involved door to door surveillance in
the 20 block area surrounding the affected premises. After 158 home visits,
18 sites have been identified that house approximately 75 chickens. These
premises have been placed under hold with continued surveillance and
monitoring. Even though no additional cases have been identified, attempts
are being made to purchase all birds in the immediate vicinity for
diagnostic purposes. No other premises have been found to have birds with
clinical signs.
The initial source of this disease is still under investigation. State and
Federal Animal Health Officials in the Fresno area believe that the disease
is under control and contained at this time. Importantly, affected birds
were in an urban area of Fresno and it does not appear that any commercial
poultry operations are at risk or affected. The closest commercial poultry
population is 17 miles away. The commercial poultry industry in California
has been alerted and is increasing surveillance and strengthening
biosecurity measures. Statewide surveillance has been increased with
emphasis on game chickens at live bird markets.
If you have any questions please call Dr. Kenneth L. Thomazin, Acting
Director, Animal Health and Food Safety Services or Dr. Larry J. Allen,
Acting Chief, Animal Health Branch at (916) 654-1447.
