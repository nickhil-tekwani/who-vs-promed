State officials in Hawaii consider there's little they can do to clean up a 223 000-gallon molasses spill that has killed thousands of fish, as swimmers, surfers, and snorkelers were being warned that the massive die-off could attract sharks. A cracked pipe on a loading jetty caused the spill, according to National Public Radio [NPR].

The request for federal assistance allows the [US] Coast Guard [USCG] to support the lead agency with a wide variety of resources to include specialized response personnel, boats, and equipment from the Coast Guard and other Federal Agencies.

The captain of the port requested support from the Coast Guard's National Strike Force for water sampling and monitoring and is currently coordinating with technical specialists from the Environmental Protection Agency to help assess additional response mitigation strategies.

Meanwhile, according to NPR, authorities conceded that there was little they could do to clean up the brown plume that had essentially suffocated thousands of fish in the harbor west of downtown Honolulu.

The Hawaii Department of Health remains the lead agency for the response. Other agencies involved include the Hawaii Department of Transportation Harbor Police, Hawaii Health Department Clean Water Branch, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources, Clean Islands Council, and the Hawaii Wildlife Center.

[This kind of massive spill results in quick oxygen depletion, changes in the chemical and physical constitution of the water column, and deaths of various life forms.

In 1919, 21 people were killed and 150 injured in one of the most bizarre disasters in American history, the Great Boston Molasses Flood. Fact, not legend -- see:
