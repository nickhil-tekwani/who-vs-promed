Polio in Tajikistan - Update 23 July 2010
-----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan has since [1 Jan
2010] reported 430 cases of polio following the importation of a wild
poliovirus type 1 into the country. Of those cases, 19 were fatal. A
total of 7 virologically related cases have been detected in the
Russian Federation, the only other country in the WHO European Region
to confirm cases. The poliovirus causing the outbreak originated in
northern India. This is the 1st outbreak of polio since the Region
was certified polio-free in 2002.

In response to the outbreak, 4 rounds of national immunization days
(NIDs) with oral polio vaccine have been held in Tajikistan. Coverage
was reported to be high and confirmed by independent monitors. The
most recent round was conducted on [15-19 Jun 2010] (except in
Dushanbe and 6 surrounding regions, where it started on [13 Jun
2010]). Preliminary data report nationwide coverage of 99.3 percent.
Coverage higher than 97 percent is reported from all regions and in
the groups aged 0-6 and 7-15 years.

The most recent polio case had onset on [12 Jun 2010], and the number
of new cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) -- of which polio can
be one of the causes -- being detected and reported to WHO has
dropped sharply. However, there is not sufficient virological testing
data from the recent AFP cases to revise WHO's assessment of the risk
for further international spread, which remains 'high.'

A joint national/international surveillance review is under way,
under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, to further inform the
current risk assessment and guide additional surveillance and
immunization activities. The need for additional rounds of mass oral
polio vaccine (OPV) immunization will be based on an ongoing
evaluation of epidemiological and laboratory data. International
travellers to and from polio affected areas should continue to be
adequately immunized against polio as recommended in Chapter 6 of
International Travel and Health guidance.

The European Regional Commission for the Certification of
Poliomyelitis Eradication met in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 28-29 Jun
2010. Addressing the meeting, Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional
Director for Europe, noted that the outbreak in Tajikistan threatens
both the polio-free status of the Region and the eradication of polio
globally.

The Commission recognized that the European Region has reached a
critical juncture and its polio-free status is in jeopardy. The
gravity of the situation requires that all Member States reinforce
their polio surveillance so that any spread will be detected rapidly
and effective control measures instituted at the earliest possible
moment.

Neighbouring countries are responding to the outbreak by heightening
surveillance while reviewing immunization status of children and
conducting necessary supplementary immunization activities.
Uzbekistan has held 3 national rounds of supplementary immunization
with efforts to synchronize these rounds with Tajikistan in May and
June. The 1st round of nationwide NIDs started in Turkmenistan on [12
Jul 2010], and Kyrgyzstan started its 1st round on [19 Jul 2010].

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the above WHO report, there are now 430 confirmed cases
of polio in Tajikistan -- up from 425 cases as of 20 Jul 2010 -- and
7 confirmed cases of polio in the Russian Federation. As a reminder,
in the previous ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak there had been
lay press reports mentioning the confirmation of cases of wild
poliovirus (WPV) related polio in the Russian Federation, but until
today, there was no official confirmation of these cases (see
Poliomyelitis - worldwide (15): Russia, RFI 20100723.2467). The
reports of vaccination coverages of greater than 90 percent following
the supplemental immunization days will hopefully serve to interrupt
the transmission of the WPV in Tajikistan as well as in those areas
in the Russian Federation where cases have been confirmed to date.
