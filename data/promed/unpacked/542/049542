The Special Capital District of Jakarta occupied the 1st level of
dengue fever [outbreak classification] for the length of 2007.

According to the Department of Health [2007] data entered up to 5 Dec
[2007], 134 847 cases that were reported [Nationally? In Java? - Mod.
TY], 30 469 cases were from Jakarta.

More than 30 percent of the cases of dengue fever came from Jakarta,
the Head of Health Service Special Capital District, Dr. Wibowo
Sukijat, MPH, said on Thursday (6 Dec [2007]). This number is an
increase compared to the previous year [2006] when there were 24 932
cases with 39 deaths.

This year [2007], of the 30 469 [dengue fever] sufferers who were
treated, 81 died.

There were several factors in Jakarta that account for why this area
had the highest numbers of dengue fever cases, including bad
environment, the mobility of many inhabitants, the inhabitants's
substantial population, as well as increased temperatures, so virus
[transmission] has been increasingly raging.

The [dengue virus mosquito vector] control campaign has not yet given
optimal results.

The spread of dengue fever in Jombang is increasingly worrying. As of
yesterday [8 Dec 2007], 537 [dengue fever] sufferers were given
intensive treatment in the Community Health Centre and the Hospital
in Jombang. Moreover, emergency status was given due to the increase
in dengue fever cases.

This case figure is more than twice that compared with last year
(2006), so a further increase must be guarded against, said the
Jombang head of Health Service, Dr. Andhy Bhinuko.

Moreover, the level of spread of the illness, which is caused by the
bite of [dengue virus carrying-] _Aedes aegypti_, has not stopped
throughout 2007. Usually in the period from May up to August no
[dengue] cases occur.

The increase in [dengue] cases became more apparent starting in
October [2007] when 21 sufferers were treated. In the following
month, November, the number jumped to 44 cases with the death of 2
people. The total dengue fever [2007] case load up to this December
was 537 people with 16 deaths.

The location where dengue has been spreading includes the Jombang
Subdistrict, Diwek and the Mojowarno Subdistrict. Areas at risk
include the Kudu Subdistrict, Jogoroto, Mojoagung and the Peterongan
Subdistrict.

The Health Service indicated that the Bondowoso Regency responded to
the serious dengue fever epidemic in the Dadapan Village, Kecamatan
Grujugan after dozens of villagers underwent the intensive treatment
in the Daerah Hospital.

Fumigation was carried out by the officials and the Grujugan
Community Health Centre, not only outside the area [but also in] the
residents' houses. The fumigation was done to kill _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes that spread the dengue fever illness.

In addition to fumigation, powdered abate was distributed to
residents to kill larval _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

During the Period January-November 2007, as many as 89 East
Kalimantan residents died from dengue fever. The number has increased
compared to last year [2006] which totaled 80 people from January to
December, said the Head of the East Kalimantan Health Section,
Sutarnyoto, in the office of East Kalimantan Governor, Samarinda, on
Wednesday (5 Dec [2007]). This is worrying, he stressed.

This year, 4276 people were infected by dengue fever; whereas, last
year [2006], according to Sutarnyoto, 2838 people were infected by
dengue fever.

Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever is raging in North
Sulawesi. Many patients (in general children) suffered dengue in
Manado City, Kabupaten Bolmong, Sangihe and in a part of Minahasa. At
this time more than one hospital was filled with dengue patients.

The Head Health Service North Sulawesi, Dr. Christian Ti-laar,
immediately dismissed warning related the dengue outbreak [which
appeared] together with the rainy season at this time.

Dealing with the problem of the spread of dengue fever is more than
his [agencies] responsibility, the regency/the city [must be
involved, too] because, this always has been routine every year.

Therefore he was not surprised that hospital wards were filled with
patients, said Tilaar to the reporter, on Tuesday (04 Dec [2007]).
"Of course," he continued, "the spread of dengue fever illnesses was
already anticipated a long time ago before the arrival of the rainy season."

Until now the only [dengue] prevention is by waging war on mosquitoes
that cause the spread. The method is the "3M" [that eliminates _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito breeding sites]. Abate larvacide was also given.
These measures can control mosquitoes for several weeks but must be
repeated for longer control.

Two more suspected dengue fever patients were on Monday [3 Dec
2007] admitted to Rawalpindi General Hospital (RGH), raising the
number of suspected cases to 5. Doctors said the 5 infected
people, kept in quarantine, had visited Karachi and Peshawar and were
diagnosed with high fever, vomiting and shivering which were
symptomatic of dengue fever.

They said if proper measures like fumigation and spray of
insecticides were not taken immediately, the infection could assume
[epidemic] proportions.

Dr. Fayyaz Ahmad, Assistant Medical Superintendent (Administration),
told the Daily Times that blood samples of the [dengue] suspected
patients were taken and sent to the National Institute of Health
(NIH) for dengue serology on Monday [3 Dec 2007].

He said reports of 3 patients already admitted to the hospital had
been received, one of which was positive [for dengue antibody? -
Mod.TY]. He said the patient had been put in an isolated ward. The
hospital's private ward has been declared as an isolated ward and all
the 5 patients are being treated there.

Doctors took blood samples [from one patient] and sent them to the
NIH for diagnosis of both Congo [Crimean hemorrhagic fever] and dengue fever.

[It would be important to know if some of these patients are infected
with CCHF virus, which would pose a risk to hospital personnel & which
would require isolation, and dengue viruses, which would not. ProMED
would be interested to know if any of these turn out to be CCHF
patients.

Fumigation mentioned in this report would kill adult _Aedes_ dengue
vector mosquitoes, but halting or slowing of an epidemic would be
temporary. Without elimination of larval breeding sites, a new
generation of vector mosquitoes would soon emerge and virus
transmission would resume. - Mod.TY]

The Secretary of Health for the state of Ceara (SESA) confirmed the
10th DHF death this year [2007] in the state, the latest in
Fortaleza. According to the weekly dengue bulletin published by SESA,
[dengue] deaths have been confirmed in Sobral (3 [deaths]), Juazeiro
del Norte (2), Caucaia (1), Salitre (1), Quixada (1) and Camocim (1).

Of an additional [27] suspected DHF deaths being investigated, 16 have
been registered in Fortaleza. The others occurred in Amontada (1),
Caninde (1), Caucaia (2), Itapipoca (2), Maracanau (2), Pacajus (1),
Taua (1) & Tejucuoca (1).

This year [2007] there has been notification of 631 DHF cases, of
which 284 have been [laboratory? Mod. TY] confirmed. This is the
greatest number of cases since 2003, when 291 cases were documented.
Up to the present [in 2007], 40 255 cases of classical dengue fever
have been registered in 182 of Ceara's 184 municipalities. Of these,
23 595 have been confirmed in 166 municipalities. The 1st dengue case
in Ceara occurred in 1986.

[The state of Ceara has been living with dengue for 10 years, and
unhappily the number of deaths has tended to increase. - Mod.LJS]

[It would be helpful to know if the case fatality rate has increased,
perhaps due to increased virus virulence or to problems with medical
management of DHF cases, or if there have been an increasing number
of DHF cases in the state. - Mod.TY]

Dengue [virus] transmission, which had a rapid interruption in
October [2007], returned to hit Campinas. Over 20 cases have been
confirmed in 2 dozen neighborhoods.

"The situation is really worrisome, mainly because many of these
localities [having dengue cases] are slum areas, with poor sanitary
conditions and many [mosquito] breeding sites, which facilitate an
explosion of [dengue] cases", said the municipal coordinator of
dengue control actions, Andreia Von Zuben.

According to her, the confirmed cases in November [2007] are isolated
[instances] of [dengue] transmission, but indicate theat the [vector]
mosquito is proliferating with or without dry spells or the
intensification of rains. The total numbers of dengue cases confirmed
serologically this year [2007] in Campinas is 5050. However, the
Office of Health Surveillance expects that there will be 13 000
[dengue] cases with 8000 serologically confirmed.

Andreia explained that an explosion of [dengue] cases are expected
this summer, and will [result in] implementation of "focal blockades."

The focal blockade consists of triggering all the control actions
within an area of 300 meters around the building where the confirmed
case occurred. This includes elimination of [mosquito] breeding sites
and treating [others] with biological larvicides (BTI [_Bacillus
thurengiensis_ serovar _israelensis_. - Mod.TY] in areas of water
accumulation which can not be removed. "BTI does not pose any danger
to human health in the elimination of mosquito larvae," she said.

Other blockade measures include fogging with insecticides, treatment
with larvacides at points of risk such as [vehicle] tire and scrap
metal yards; proactive new suspected case detection, and
investigation of [areas of] all cases in order to identify mosquito
breeding sites.
