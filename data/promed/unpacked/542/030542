The lockdown puppy boom has sparked fears over a disease that can be transferred from dogs to humans -- leaving owners with fevers and back pain.

The new disease, brucellosis, has seen a 1900% rise in just 3 years -- with health authorities now stepping up checks in a bid to control it.

Infection in dogs is transmitted in mating or contact with after-birth fluids.

The disease has been detected in 60 dogs in the past year [2020/21] compared to just 3 in 2017/18 -- with fears that the rise in people buying pets during lockdown will see it rise even further.

While the bacterial infection is incurable for canines with most being put to sleep, it can leave people with fevers and chills, sweats, headaches, back pains, and physical weakness.

The disease can be treated with antibiotics for humans, though in some cases it can remain for life.

Public Health England said on Friday [5 Jun] that 250 people had been tested but no one has returned a positive result.

Government officials have stepped up surveillance and have instructed all laboratories to report any positive results.

Most cases have been found in rescue dogs, most commonly those from Romania, due to commercial dog imports increasing from 19 480 to 29 348 from Romania last year [2020].

The rapid increase has led to the government needing to tighten puppy immigration from overseas.

Daniella Dos Santos, senior Vice President of the BVA [British Veterinary Association], confirmed vets were increasingly concerned about disease risk from imported dogs "without health histories".

"These so-called Trojan dogs arrive in the UK often with no health records. Some charities carry out pre-import testing, but there's no requirement to do so for diseases not commonly found in the UK," she said.

"In some cases, like canine brucellosis, there's an added risk for public health, including our veterinary teams who treat and handle these animals."

The British Veterinary Association and the Dogs' Trust have called for the government to make it compulsory that all dogs entering the country must go through pre-import screening.

MPs are to take part in a Petitions Committee animal welfare debate on Monday 7 Jun 2021], and the Government is to publish its Kept Animals Bill, cracking down on puppy smuggling and importation rules shortly.

Dr Neil Hudson, a Conservative MP who is a qualified vet, told the Telegraph: "Brucellosis is a health risk for dogs and people. We need more mandatory checks and people must take more care where they are sourcing their dogs from.

"The disease is incurable in dogs, and most have to be put down. And while humans can be treated with antibiotics, they are considered infected for life. We have to be very careful."

The Government chief vet Christine Middlemiss has warned all vets about the possible risk, advising them and staff to wear personal protective clothing when dealing with cases.

In dogs, infection is transmitted in mating or contact with after-birth fluids.

In female dogs, brucellosis can trigger an abortion, and in any future pregnancies, puppies can die shortly after birth while male dogs may also suffer from infertility.

Dr Paula Boyden, Veterinary director at the Dogs' Trust, said: "We don't want to say we should not have these dogs. But we would like compulsory pre-screening of dogs.

"We are now doing a blanket screening of all imported dogs that end up in our rescue centres. This is a zoonotic disease that can affect you and me. The risk to humans is low but is not zero."

[Canine brucellosis, the disease addressed in the report above, is caused by _Brucella canis_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). _Brucella canis_ and the disease it causes, canine brucellosis, should be clearly differentiated from other _Brucella_ species, in particular _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, which are important zoonotic pathogens, affecting and spread by farmed animals (cattle, sheep, goats, swine), which cause a serious disease, brucellosis, in humans. Occasionally, these Brucella species may be associated with disease in dogs.

_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult.

Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.

_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central, and South America and parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.

The above, and additional exhaustive information, are available in the 2018 fact sheet "Brucellosis: _Brucella canis_" at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.

The spread of _B. canis_ in the UK, attributed to the lockdown puppy boom accompanied by increased imports of puppies, reminds of information published in the journal of the Dutch Veterinary Society in January 2019, according to which several dogs originating in eastern Europe had been found there infected by _B. canis_ since 2016. "This bacterium had never before been recorded in the Netherlands." (In Dutch, at https://www.knmvd.nl/tijdschriften/jaargang-144-aflevering-1-januari-2019/). - Mod.AS
