In a statement, Oyewale Tomori said: "As the foremost independent scientific body in the country, and based on available evidence from the 22 other outbreaks of EVD [Ebola virus disease] that have occurred in the East and Central Africa in the past, the Academy wishes to state that there is absolutely no need for panic, but that the public should fully cooperate with the appointed health authorities. The EVD is a deadly disease but patients stand a good chance of survival if taken in early for supportive management. The Nigerian record of the number of patients already discharged from the Ebola Treatment Centre strongly supports this. It is important to point out that these persons were discharged after having been certified virus-free by the laboratories at LUTH [Lagos University Teaching Hospital] and Redeemers University." ...

We can confirm that a British national residing in Sierra Leone has tested positive for ebolavirus infection.

Medical experts are currently assessing the situation to ensure that appropriate care is delivered, and consular assistance is being provided. Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: "The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low. Medical experts are currently assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided. We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS [National Health Service] systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts."

Every region of Liberia has now been hit by EVD, officials said Friday [22 Aug 2014], as the World Health Organization warned the fight against the worst-ever outbreak of the killer disease would take months. After seeing people fall to the deadly virus in area after area, Liberia said 2 people had succumbed to the virus in Sinoe province, the last EVD-free bastion in a country that has seen the biggest toll with 624 deaths [as of 20 Aug 2014 -- WHO] ...

[4] Suspected cases & prevention


Canada
------
23 Aug 2014: A patient has been quarantined at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital [Montreal, Quebec] as a precaution after exhibiting some -- but not all -- of the signs of EVD. The patient recently returned from a trip to West Africa and had a fever ... [more]

Liberia
-------
22 Aug 2014: Brantly possessions to be destroyed. Before going to work in Liberia, Brantly was a resident in family medicine at JPS Hospital in Fort Worth [Texas, USA]. On Friday [22 Aug 2014], the JPS Foundation announced that it was accepting donations for the Brantly family, which needs to replace "nearly everything they owned. Brantly's wife left Liberia with their 2 children several days before he became ill. They came to Texas to attend a family member's wedding, bringing only what they needed for the trip," according to a news release. Brantly was isolated when symptoms from the ebolavirus appeared and now everything in their home [in Guinea] is considered contaminated and will be destroyed. We are hoping the community will provide the resources they need," said J.R. Labbe, vice president for communications and community affairs for JPS Health Network.

[I don't think after symptoms appeared Dr Brantly would have gone around the house touching his wife's or children's clothing and possessions. One would have thought it would be possible to gas sterilize at least clothing and small items (with ethylene oxide, NOT formaldehyde because of the residual smell). - Mod.JW]

Philippines
-----------
23 Aug 2014: Philippines pulling out UN troops in Liberia. About 115 Filipinos serving in Liberia would be repatriated "as soon as possible", due to the health risk posed by the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa, the statement added.... Defense Department spokesman Peter Paul Galvez said the Philippines would not send back its troops to the Golan Heights "unless the situation improves" ... [more]

23 Aug 2014: Administrator Hans Cacdac of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) said Filipino seafarers may soon be prohibited from leaving the ports of Nigeria due to the threat of Ebola.... Shore leave and crew change are also not allowed for seafarers in the ports of the 3 Ebola-affected countries.... Land-based Filipino workers employed in the 3 countries are required to undergo medical tests for EVD and to secure clearance prior to return to the Philippines. The POEA has also issued a memorandum circular advising recruitment agencies to prepare for the possible mandatory repatriation of OFWs [overseas Filipino workers] from EVD-affected countries in case the situation worsens ...

Potential new treatments on the horizon for EVD patients
--------------------------------------------------------
Our disease briefing provides more information on 4 early stage treatments for EVD. EVD is particularly lethal. According to the World Health Organization, outbreaks have a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. There is currently no effective treatment, and concern about a possible global outbreak continues to rise. EVD deaths in West Africa now exceed 1000 [1427 as of 20 Aug 2014 -- WHO], and healthcare practitioners in Britain are on the lookout for symptoms of the killer virus to try to stop it from taking hold in the UK....

Our Life Sciences team recently released a comprehensive disease profile on Ebola, which includes a detailed analysis of 2 new treatments in the pipeline and 2 experimental candidates approaching development ... [more]

[ProMED doesn't normally report new dug or vaccine developments until they have passed Phase III testing, but in view of the interest in this case, we are making an exception. - Mod.JW]

5 Aug 2014: FDA prohibits claims that ebolavirus diagnostic kit is safe or effective. "No advertising or promotional descriptive printed matter relating to the use of the [FDA] authorized EZ1 rRT-PCR Assay may represent or suggest that this test is safe or effective for the diagnosis of Ebola Zaire virus (detected in the West Africa outbreak in 2014)."
