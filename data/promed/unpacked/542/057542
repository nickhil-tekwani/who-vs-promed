At least 10 febrile cases have tested positive for leptospirosis during the 1st 2 weeks of September 2017. They are being treated in different hospitals located elsewhere in Kathmandu. It is well known that leptospirosis generally occurs during the rainy season, and was found to be the 4th most common disease reported among febrile patients in Kathmandu, Nepal [1].

Leptospirosis is, unfortunately, heavily underestimated/underreported and is often not considered in the differential diagnosis in Nepal. As a result, many patients may have had developed renal complications or Weil's disease, although it is yet to be known/studied in Nepal.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Nepal is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is its wettest month (https://en.climate-data.org/location/1137/).

Pictures of extensive flooding in Nepal in August 2017 can be found at http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-08-13/at-least-30-killed-in-floods-landslides.html. - Mod.ML
