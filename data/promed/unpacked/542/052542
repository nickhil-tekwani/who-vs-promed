Smallpox vaccine backed for public
----------------------------------
The United States' top public health officials said today that they favored
offering smallpox vaccine to the public, even in absence of a bioterror
attack, but only after up to 10 million health care workers are immunized,
and after a vaccine is licensed for general use, which is not likely until
2004.
It was the first time federal officials have said that the public should
have access to the vaccine, which carries significant risk of serious side
effects. But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White
House spokesman said the issue was still under review.
The health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that
could go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when
they were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers
facing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. "Right now our
thinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public
after we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care
professionals," Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were
not recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have
the option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. "No one
believes we should make it available to the general public right now," Dr
Gerberding said.
At a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of
smallpox vaccine will be provided to the military. The recommendations were
presented to President Bush by the secretary of health and human services,
Tommy G Thompson, the officials said. A spokesman for the White House today
declined to discuss the issue. "It is under review," said Scott McClellan,
the president's deputy press secretary. "There are still a number of issues
that need to be addressed before any final decision is made."
The government halted routine vaccinations in 1972 as the disease was being
eradicated from the world. But the terrorism attacks last year and the
possibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have
caused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.
Last week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared
possibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox
appears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a
case occurs. "We are still in an environment where we have no imminent
threat," Dr Gerberding said. "But there are countries with weapons of mass
destruction that probably include smallpox."
Smallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that
causes smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The
government owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none
are licensed now, all are classified as "investigational." When the vaccine
was used, "life-threatening complications" occurred at a rate of 15 per
million among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the
number included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower
among those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,
"how much lower, we don't know." The vaccine can also cause many
non-life-threatening complications such as blindness.
Between 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from
getting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by
cancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin
conditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of
complications.
The comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was
meant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The
participants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their
remarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get
vaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby
vaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency
workers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering
vaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of
encountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to
consider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated
10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an
assistant secretary of health and human services and director of the
department's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and
following licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox
vaccine, they would offer it to the public.
In interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had
evolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended
against vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox
vaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to
health care and emergency workers who were likely to be "first responders"
to a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would
be inoculated.
It fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr
Gerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make
their own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a
series of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital
executives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should
present the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health
professionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans
who want the vaccine. "Our recommendation was that a phased approach be
used, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million," Mr
Hauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in
one step.
Dr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent
threat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its
risks for the general public. But, she said: "We recognize that individual
citizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the
vaccine, they may choose to have it."
According to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney
favors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate
approach.

[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies
(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed
analysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of
introduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this
moderator made the following comments:
"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the
controversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as
general controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine
in the United States, especially in an environment and population that have
changed from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.
ProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged
to read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns
surrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine
available for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines
in terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a
real threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the
general population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of
complications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of
30 per cent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly
is more dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the
risk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from
the wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine
is real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for
treatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are
insufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of
antiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is
less than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety
issues surrounding the use of the drugs. While not a scientific conclusion,
one hopes that we will have the luxury of time for further research and
development of a newer, safer vaccine, increased production of VIG, and
further research on the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents to be used
for both complications of vaccination (vaccinial infections) and for the
actual disease."
It would be of interest to hear the opinions of members of the Advisory
Committee on Immunizations to see whether there has been sufficient new
scientific information available since the recommendations were made on 20
Jun 2002 not to embark on widespread vaccinations, but rather to limit
vaccinations to a small handful of first responders.
Reviewing the ongoing discussions leads an academically inclined individual
to conclude that the current process of development of vaccination
strategies for the use of smallpox vaccine in the USA will make an
excellent case study in the politics of health for an MPH course. - Mod.MPP]
