After a dog tested positive for plague following a probable exposure near the Divide Trail Loop at Hayden Divide Park in Teller County, Public Health is urging residents to take precautions to prevent exposure to the plague. While plague is common in the summer months, taking simple precautions can lower the risk of transmission to pets and humans.

Plague is caused by bacteria (_Yersinia pestis_) which can be spread to people and pets by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. People or pets with direct exposure to fleas or wildlife in the affected areas may be at risk. People who think they have been exposed should contact a health care provider immediately. Symptoms may include sudden fever, headache, chills, weakness, and tender, painful lymph nodes. If caught early, plague is treatable with antibiotics in both people and pets.

Plague is frequently detected in prairie dogs, squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, and other rodents. The use of veterinary-approved flea control products is strongly advised for pets.

People should take the following precautions to protect themselves, their pets, and stock animals:
- Avoid fleas. Protect humans with insect/flea repellent and animals with a veterinary-approved flea treatment.
- Do not directly handle any wildlife.
- Keep pets on a leash -- don't allow them to roam freely.
- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents and rabbits.
- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs, other rodents, or rabbits.
- Do not feed wildlife -- this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact, and increases the risk of disease transmission.
- See a physician if you become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes. Plague is a treatable illness.
- Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pet or livestock animals become ill with a high fever and/or an abscess or swollen lymph nodes. Mammals with plague can transmit the illness to humans.

Be aware of rodent and rabbit populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to El Paso County Public Health or to Teller County Public Health and Environment.

[A quick scan of ProMED archives indicates Colorado is reporting one or more cases of plague, in animals, or people, about monthly. Please be sure you are treating your pet with veterinarian-recommended products for your area.

Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, small rodents, sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel or other rodents, or other animal or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts.

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection [actually there are 3 forms -- [bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. - Mod.TG]. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives."

Dogs
----
"Dogs are inherently resistant to the plague-causing bacteria. Dogs becoming infected with plague are less likely to show signs of illness than infected cats. Signs may include fever, lethargy, inflammation of the lymph nodes below the lower jaw, a pus-like lesion along the jaw, lesions in the mouth, and cough.

"Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained with bacterial cultures. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs suggestive of plague should be placed in isolation and infection control measures implemented to protect you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected pet.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your pet."

Protecting your pets from fleas is critical for their well-being, and for yours. Fleas carry plague and potentially other diseases. But what do you use to treat your pet? There are a number of products on the market. However, some over-the-counter medications can be toxic to your pets, especially cats. A brand name does not mean safety and effectiveness. Please consult your veterinarian about safe and effective flea prevention. In some areas, fleas are resistant to some prevention products. The veterinarian is most familiar with what products are safe and effective in your area. - Mod.TG
