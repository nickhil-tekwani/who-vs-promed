More than 300 Marines at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego are being treated for possible _E. coli_ infection, MCRD officials confirm. MCRD San Diego said that as of [Tue 31 Oct 2017], 302 recruits are being treated for diarrheal illness and some Marines have been infected with the Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ bacteria. Limited cases were reported over the last 6 days with a spike in reports happening [Tue 31 Oct 2017], MCRD San Diego said. A total of 10 recruits have been admitted at off-base facilities while the rest are being treated on base.

Cases have been reported at both MCRD San Diego and the Edson Range at Camp Pendleton.

"Our immediate focus is identifying, isolating and treating recruits who present symptoms," said Brig. Gen. William Jurney, commanding general, MCRD San Diego and the Western Recruiting Region. "We are working to identify the cause of the sickness, making sure our affected recruits can return to training as soon as possible and continuing training for recruits not influenced."

The source of the outbreak is under investigation.

MCRD San Diego said it has ramped up hygiene protocol on base in light of the outbreak, including:
- Separation and treatment protocols which isolates recruits presenting symptoms and limits interaction with unaffected recruits.
- Increased hygiene requirements focusing on handwashing.
- Enhanced facilities cleaning to ensure proper sanitation and hygiene in all areas.
- Increased inspections of barracks, chow halls and common areas by Naval Medical Center San Diego's Preventative Medicine Unit.
- The dissemination of guidance on identifying possible symptoms to proactively seek treatment for potential cases.

The majority of the over 5500 recruits training at the base are not affected and are following their usual training schedule. MCRD San Diego said that families of recruits will be contacted if graduation dates are changed.

[It is unclear if all of the recruits are infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strain, one that produces Shiga toxin and can cause bloody diarrhea that can progress to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. It is interesting that the posting mentions that more than 300 recruits are being treated. Treatment for EHEC does NOT include antimicrobials as there is ample evidence to suggest that antimicrobial therapy early in EHEC infection can increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome that can cause kidney failure, anemia, central nervous system manifestations and even death.

ProMED would like more information about this emerging large outbreak which is likely food-related. - Mod.LL
