The salmonellosis outbreak possibly linked to a meat plant in County
Kildare, Ireland, has now spread to Sweden and France, bringing to 5
the number of European Union countries affected.

The latest figures for the outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona, released
last night [18 Aug 2008], show some 132 people have now been
infected. Sweden has reported its 1st 2 cases, while France has
confirmed 1 person has been infected by the relatively rare strain of
the bacterium.

The genetic fingerprint of the microbe has been linked to a
particular production line at the Dawn Farm Foods plant in Naas. Of
the 132 people, some 125 have had an isolate with the same genetic
fingerprint as samples taken from the meat plant. Final test results
are awaited on a further 7 cases.

A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said a
water specimen taken from a Scottish river contained the exact same
strain of _Salmonella_ Agona but it had subsequently been established
that the microbe had originated in a sewage outlet and was therefore
the result rather than the cause of the outbreak.

Of the 132 people who have become sick as a result of the infection,
some 76 cases have been identified in England with Scotland reporting
31 cases. 11 people in Ireland are now known to have been affected,
with 4 of these requiring hospital treatment. Finland, France and
Sweden are the other EU states where cases have been found. The
European Centre for Disease Control has reported that the Finnish
case arose after the person ate beef strips contained in a sandwich.

As a result of the outbreak, beef strips, chicken, lamb and pork
supplied to at least 8 European countries and to Kuwait have been
withdrawn by Dawn Farm Foods.
