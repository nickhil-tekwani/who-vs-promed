The Lumpy Skin Disease [LSD], a viral infection afflicting cattle and water buffaloes has spread to 14 out of the 33 districts of Gujarat and has claimed around 1000 livestock head in the state, Agriculture Minister Raghavji Patel said on Sunday [24 Jul 2022].

Quoting Patel, an official release said that the LSD, caused by a virus of the capripox genus, has spread to 4 out of 5 regions of Gujarat.

The release said that cases of the infectious disease have been reported from 880 villages and that 37 121 infected cattle and buffaloes have been given veterinary treatment.

The disease has spread to 14 districts of Kutch, Saurashtra, north Gujarat and south Gujarat regions, leaving only the central Gujarat region unaffected. The minister said that the disease had claimed 999 cattle and buffaloes as of Sunday [24 Jul 2022].

The release said the disease, which spreads through vectors like houseflies, mosquitos, ticks etc. has spread into Kutch district and all 11 districts in Saurashtra -- Jamnagar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Rajkot, Porbandar, Morbi, Surendranagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Botad. Cases of the viral disease have also come to light from Banaskantha in the north Gujarat region and Surat in south Gujarat, the release further said.

The viral infection leads to fever among cattle and buffaloes as well as other symptoms like excessive nasal and salivary secretion, firm and raised nodules on skin around the head, neck, genitals etc. The animal stops taking food and production of milk among milch animals goes down. Pregnant cows and buffaloes often suffer miscarriage and in some cases, diseased animals die as nodules burst and those parts can become infected by secondary infections.

"After the 1st case of this disease was reported, the government called a high-level meeting as advised by Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and issued instructions to take measures for controlling the disease. Thanks to that, there has been success in containing the spread of the disease," the release quoted Patel as saying.

The Minister said that 268 000 cattle head were vaccinated in affected villages to prevent the spread of the disease.

He further said that a state-level control room has been set up to monitor the situation continuously and that a toll-free helpline has been activated to guide cattle-herders and dairy farmers to tackle the disease. They can dial 1962 to seek help in treating affected cattle and guidance about the precautionary measures.

[India officially reported its 1st outbreaks of LSD in November 2019. The 1st 3 outbreaks were in Orissa, affecting cattle with an apparent morbidity rate of 7.1% and no mortality. Subsequent newspaper and anecdotal reports suggest that LSD has since swept through several northern and central Indian states, affecting hundreds of thousands of cattle. ProMED's postings have addressed, until September 2020, LSD events in the provinces of Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Maharashtra. According to the current report, Gujarat, a north-western province bordering Pakistan's province of Sindh on its west, has been added to the list.

In view of the wide distribution of the disease in Gujarat, the virus has been circulating there for a considerable time. Notably, LSD has been circulating in Sindh (Pakistan) for more than 7 months.

The uncontrolled livestock movement in India, combined with the presence of a range of competent arthropod vectors, may have contributed to a wide, yet-to-be recorded LSD circulation elsewhere in India.

High LSD vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels is required to minimise the number of outbreaks.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
