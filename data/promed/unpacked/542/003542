A 4th case of the plague has been recorded in China as the disease slowly begins to spread. The latest case of the plague has again been recorded in Inner Mongolia, where the 3 previous cases have stemmed from. The local was a rural herder in the Siziwang county, who was diagnosed and subsequently treated in hospital. He is now said to be in a stable condition, although 4 others who came into contact with him have been quarantined.

Health authorities in China confirmed it is a case of the bubonic, rather than pneumonic, plague, which was known as the Black Death in the 14 century. Bubonic plague causes swelling of the lymph nodes. However, pneumonic plague infects the lungs, making the disease airborne and much easier to transfer.

Another 3 cases of the plague have been confirmed in China in November 2019, with 2 of them being pneumonic.

Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, told Express.co.uk: "The worrying thing about the Chinese cases is that two are pneumonic plague. If you're bitten by a flea, typically you'll get bubonic plague where it is in the lymph nodes and they swell and then discharge. In pneumonic plague it goes to the lungs and then you start coughing it up. And the scary thing about pneumonic plague is that it is substantially more fatal untreated and has a much higher mortality rate. You can spread it person to person as you're coughing, the bacteria then drifts in the air and then people inhale it."

"Most cases of the plague these days are bubonic form and they don't really spread from person to person. But with the people in Beijing, they had the pneumonic form." However, Prof Hunter added there is no need to panic.

In the 14th century the Black Death spread across the Mediterranean and Europe, killing up to 60 per cent of Europe's total population. More than 100 million people may have perished -- reducing the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350-375 million.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA, the plague is treatable with antibacterials. CDC advises the earlier people seek treatment, the more likely it is they will make a full recovery. Those who come into close contact with plague victims may need preventative antibiotic therapy. In the 21st century, the plague is endemic to select regions of the planet. 3 other countries where the plague still circulates are the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, and Peru. Isolated cases often also spring up in the USA, with up to a dozen people diagnosed annually.

[The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
