Costa Rica: 9-year-old child dies from rabies
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Costa Rica reported on 17 Jul [2014] that a child had died from rabies from a squirrel bite. The child lived in the Peninsula de Osa [Puntarenas Province] in the south of the country, and died on 16 Jul [2014] in the Hospital Nacional de Ninos in San Jose after presenting with a prolonged high temperature.

Costa Rica has not registered a case of human rabies since 2001, while canine rabies was eradicated in the 1970s. Maria Esther Anchia, Costa Rica's Vice-Minister of Health, said that the child, whose identity has not been revealed, was bitten by a squirrel that frequented their house, and appears to have transmitted the infection.

Maria Ethel Trejos, Director of Epidemiologic Surveillance in the Ministry of Health, declared that the national veterinary service has initiated a massive animal vaccination programme in the southern zone of the country. In addition, the Ministry of Health and the Costa Rica Social Security Office, which administers the public health centres, started on 17 Jul [2014] to vaccinate all humans who had been in contact with this child, both family members and health sector personnel.

When one checks the rabies data reported by OIE, it jumps out that bovine rabies is a constant problem in Puntarenas Province; i.e., 2011 with 2 outbreaks involving 6 cattle; 2012, 4 outbreaks, 4 cattle; and 2013, 2 outbreaks, 3 cattle; overall, 8 outbreaks and 13 cattle deaths. Over the same 3-year period, there was 1 outbreak in Acajuela with 6 cattle affected; Guanacaste, 3 outbreaks, 7 cattle affected; and San Jose with 1 outbreak involving 2 cattle. What this says is that vampire bat rabies is an ongoing problem which unexpectedly involved a squirrel (one must wonder how the squirrel stayed still enough to be infected by a vampire bat -- sleeping?) to which the children in the house had access. - Mod.MHJ]

[Given Mod.MHJ's comment above re: the ongoing problems with vampire bat rabies in the area, combined with the rarity of identification of rabies in squirrels associated with human disease, one can't help but wonder if perhaps the child had an undetected bite from an infected vampire bat. - Mod.MPP]
