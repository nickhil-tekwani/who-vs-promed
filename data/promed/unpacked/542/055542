Banana disease hits Palmerston
------------------------------
The Northern Territory [NT] city of Palmerston is in 'banana lock-down' after the fungal disease known as banana freckle was discovered.

The NT's Chief plant health manager, Stephen West, says the entire city has been declared a quarantine area and banana plants will have to be destroyed if they're within 1 km [0.6 mi] of the infected property. "For those within 5 km [3.1 mi] of that property, they'll be within our control area. They can't plant new bananas [or] move any plant material. Some people will lose their bananas."

He says no banana plant material will be allowed in or out of Palmerston while the quarantine zone is in place.

Banana freckle was first discovered on Cavendish bananas in the Northern Territory last year [2013; ProMED-mail post 20130829.1910083], and a number of NT areas are now under quarantine. Around AUD 4.4 million [about USD 4.1 million] is being spent on trying to eradicate banana freckle.

[Banana freckle disease is caused by several fungi of the genus _Phyllosticta_. It affects leaves and fruit of _Musa_ species. Symptoms include dark spots resulting in a rough surface ("sandpaper feel" due to protruding fungal structures), leaf streaking and yellowing, as well as loss of plant vigour. Severe infections may lead to wilting and death of plants. Fruit yield and quality can be reduced significantly.

The fungi are spread on individual plants by spores moving in water on the leaf or fruit surface, or within plantings by windblown water droplets over short distances. Long distance spread occurs mostly with infected plant material. Disease management may include fungicide and cultural techniques (such as bagging of fruit bunches).

Previously, freckle disease on different banana cultivars was considered to be caused by strains of _P. maculata_ with different host specificities. However, these have recently been reclassified as different species (see link below). In Australia, freckle had previously been reported on lady finger and cooking varieties of banana, but the pathogen affecting Cavendish varieties was reported for the 1st time from the NT in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130829.1910083). This fungus, now called _P. cavendishii_, was known to occur in several countries in South East Asia, but there were only unconfirmed reports of possible pre-2013 occurrences in Australia. The type of bananas affected in Palmerston, which is near the Howard Springs area where _P. cavendishii_ was first reported, is not stated above, but it is likely that this is the fungus referred to.

Cavendish varieties (see link below) include most of the commercial eating bananas. Only a small part of the Australian banana production comes from one single NT commercial farm and so far no freckle outbreaks have been reported near that area. However, main commercial banana growing regions in Queensland are considered at risk from a possible spread of _P. cavendishii_. Furthermore, the origin of the outbreak is as yet unknown, and, therefore, there may be a threat from additional quarantine incursions from unknown sources.

Eradication programmes are being carried out in the NT (see links below), but the ongoing surveys were hampered by recent wet conditions. The outbreak above was discovered when monitoring could recommence.
