Health officials in Thailand reported a 67 percent increase in human _Streptococcus suis_ infections in 2021 compared to the year prior [2020]. Thailand's Bureau of Epidemiology reported 576 cases last year [2021], including 24 deaths. This compares to 344 cases and 11 deaths in 2020. The highest incidence of the disease is reported in the northern provinces.

_Streptococcus suis_ infection tends to occur sporadically especially in the high-risk regions due to the risky behavior of eating a local favorite food, that is, raw pork with fresh blood (Lahp-moo) and close contact with pigs with no proper personal protection.

Human _S. suis_ infection is a zoonotic infection associated with pigs. The infection can be fatal, particularly if the specific strain produces certain toxins. _S. suis_ infection can manifest itself in meningitis, hearing impairment, toxic shock, septicemia, and endocarditis.

[_Streptococcus suis_ is an alpha-hemolytic Gram-positive coccus growing in chains on blood agar. It has a worldwide distribution, and multiple serotypes based on capsular antigens. In humans, it causes a potentially fatal zoonotic infection, most commonly meningitis, but also sepsis or endocarditis; toxic shock has been reported if the pathogen produces the appropriate toxins. _S. suis_ infection can be treated with antibiotics.

_S. suis_ infection occurs mainly in pig breeders, abattoir workers, meat processing and transport workers, butchers and cooks, and those who eat raw pork products. Consumption of raw pork is a common tradition in South East Asia, where infection with _S. suis_ associated with these products has been frequently reported (see prior ProMED posts listed below). Eating cooked meat or organs from infected pigs poses no risk and person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201). The news report above says the source for infection in Thailand is eating a local favorite lahp moo, made with raw pork and fresh blood and close contact with pigs with no proper personal protection. Lahp moo (also called larb moo) is minced (commonly cooked) pork salad, with shallots, fish sauce, chili flakes, lime juice, toasted sticky rice, and fresh herbs (https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-larb-recipe/).

There is no human vaccine available for _S. suis_. Prevention of the disease in humans involves wearing gloves when handling raw pork and washing their hands and cleaning utensils, equipment, and kitchen surfaces that have been in contact with raw pork (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/3648.html). Pork should be cooked thoroughly before eating.

In clinically healthy pigs, _S. suis_ has been isolated usually from the throat, but also from the reproductive and GI tracts; virulent strains can cause serious disease, causing mainly septicemia with sudden death, meningitis, arthritis, and endocarditis, mostly in post-weaned piglets. _S. suis_ rarely causes disease in suckling and growing pigs, and rarely in adult animals. Most clinically healthy pigs are carriers of multiple serotypes of _S. suis_. During parturition, piglets become colonized with _S. suis_ from vaginal secretions or while suckling. Transmission occurs by nasal or oral secretions between pigs. No effective vaccine is available (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/streptococcal-infections-in-pigs/streptococcus-suis-infection-in-pigs?query=streptococcus%20suis#v3275263).

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_. - Mod.ML
