[Between 2006 and 2008, 298 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were reported in Nigeria: 143 outbreaks in 2006; 151 in 2007, and 4 in 2008. H5N1 was the subtype identified for all cases.

See Nigeria's 2006 annual report to OIE at http://tinyurl.com/kjo2b7j, the 2007 report at http://tinyurl.com/m8p6a4r, and the 2008 report at http://tinyurl.com/luxfmdy. (Note: go to Section 3 of the report named "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present" for information on these outbreaks).

Subscribers may find it interesting to read the document titled "Qualitative risk assessment on the transmission of HPAI (H5N1) virus, from backyard and medium-scale commercial farms to household free-range poultry in Nigeria", published in 2010 by "International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and Royal Veterinary College (RVC)." According to this assessment, "The Nigerian poultry industry, comprising both commercial and rural poultry systems, experienced the 1st highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in 2006. This industry provides an affordable source of protein to millions of Nigerians through poultry eggs and meat. The rural poultry production system is essential in poverty alleviation, food security, and the promotion of gender equity, while meeting important social and cultural needs and obligations of Nigerians. In addition to the death and culling of thousands of poultry, HPAI in Nigeria negatively affected poultry farmers, farm attendants, feed millers, animal health service providers, poultry product sellers, poultry processors, mixing/grinding machine fabricators, and other poultry input providers. There was also a drop in the consumption, demand, and price of poultry and poultry products, an increase in unemployment, loss of income, and increases in the cost of other sources of protein such as fish and beef. Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Nigeria has resulted in one known human fatality and a risk of contamination of underground drinking water where depopulated poultry have been buried."
