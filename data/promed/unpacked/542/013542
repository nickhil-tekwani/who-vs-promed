September 2011 Survey of Public Concerns About Vaccines
-------------------------------------------------------
Our team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [LSHTM]
is collaborating with ProMED-mail to monitor public concerns about
vaccines around the world. We invite you to play a part in our
initiative by completing this survey, part of a regular series of
surveys, by clicking the link below. It will only take a few minutes
to complete:
http://vaccinetrust.lshtm.ac.uk/vaccinetrust/survey/survey.html?ListCode=123638

Please be sure to include your email address at the end of the survey
in order to receive regular reports of our findings.

Many thanks to those who took part in our 1st survey in August 2011.
We look forward to receiving your updated responses.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

A note about the initiative: Despite the historic success of
immunization in reducing the burden of childhood illness and death,
episodes of public concerns about vaccines have occurred around the
world, spreading quickly and sometimes seriously eroding public
confidence in immunization, and ultimately leading to vaccine refusals
and disease outbreaks. Our project seeks to listen for early signals
of public questioning and concerns about vaccines and, where needed,
provide risk analysis and guidance to engage the public early and
pre-empt potential program disruptions.
