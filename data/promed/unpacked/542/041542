Thailand: another suspected human case of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A patient suspected of having contracted avian influenza has been
admitted to the hospital in Thailand's central province of
Phitsanulok. A 6-year-old boy from Bangrakam district has had a
record of close physical contact with chickens. He is currently under
constant medical supervision.
Government officials are worried about the avian influenza outbreak
in the province. The Prompiram district has been worst hit, where the
H5N1 virus has been detected in 8 different localities. The
authorities are preparing to destroy poultry in the affected areas to
help prevent the spread of the disease to nearby districts. So far,
more than 1000 chickens have been culled in 2 villages in Prompiram
district.

[A 7-year-old boy, a resident of tambon Matoom in Prompiram, was
treated at the Phra Buddha Chinarat Hospital on 6 Feb 2005 as a
suspected human case of avian influenza (see: Avian influenza, human
- East Asia (29): Thailand, suspected 20050210.0450). On 10 Feb 2005,
laboratory tests for avian influenza were declared negative (see:
Avian influenza, human - East Asia (31): Thailand, NOT
20050210.0454). The case described in the above report bears some
resemblances to the previous suspected case (young age, locality and
contact with poultry). Not enough detail is given, however, to be
confident that the 6-year-old is a new case of suspected avian
influenza and not simply a case of inaccurate reporting. More
detailed information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
