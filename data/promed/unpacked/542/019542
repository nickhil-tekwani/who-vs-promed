Dog fungal infection outbreak reported in UP
--------------------------------------------
Officials say a number of dogs in northern Marquette County have been
diagnosed with a fungal infection.

The Mining Journal of Marquette reports blastomycosis has been
diagnosed in dogs in Big Bay and surrounding areas. Dogs may be
exposed to the organism for 1 to 5 months before they start to show
signs of the infection, which is being seen more in the Upper
Peninsula (UP).

Blastomycosis is treatable if detected early. Clinical signs in dogs
include loss of appetite, weight loss, a cough and skin lesions.

[Blastomycosis, caused by the agent _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, is a
systemic fungal disease that primarily affects dogs and humans, but
has also been known to infect cats, sea lions and horses. _Blastomyces
dermatitidis_ is a dimorphic soil fungus that is found in the
Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River valleys, as well as the
mid-Atlantic states and the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Manitoba and
Ontario.1 Its exact ecologic niche has yet to be characterized, but
most agree it requires wet, sandy, acidic soils rich in organic matter
and in close proximity to water. At room temperature (25 deg C), the
organism is found in the mycelial (hyphal) form and produces conidia,
while at body temperature, the organism usually occurs in the yeast
form.1

Infection occurs primarily through inhalation. In the lung, alveolar
macrophages phagocytize spores and the organism transforms to the
yeast phase. Pulmonary macrophages transport the organism to the
pulmonary interstitium. Other routes of infection include skin lesions
or penetrating injuries that introduce the organism into the body.
Dissemination can occur in patients that are immunosuppressed.1

The organism can be found in the lungs, the urinary system, skin and
lymph nodes and even the eye. It has also been found in the prostatic
fluid of males and in joint fluid.

Cats may also be susceptible to this organism and it can cause disease
in cats as well.

Diagnosis should be made based on history, presentation, and clinical
findings. Unfortunately, identification of the organism is the only
definitive means of diagnosis. Hematologic and biochemical findings
are nonspecific. The most common hematologic abnormality in affected
dogs is a neutrophilic leukocytosis with a mild left shift.4
Hypoalbuminemia (77 percent), hyperglobulinemia (58 percent), and
corrected hypercalcemia (13.7 percent) may also be observed.4

Treatment of animals should only be performed by a licensed
veterinarian. Veterinarians should consult the current literature and
current pharmacological formularies before initiating any treatment
protocol.

Amphotericin B (AMB) is considered the standard treatment for systemic
fungal infections like blastomycosis. It is a rapid-acting, effective
treatment; however, it must be given intravenously and it is
nephrotoxic.

Itraconazole (ITZ) therapy has replaced AMB as the drug of choice for
treatment of blastomycosis because it as effective as AMB, but safer.1
While more expensive per dose, it is administered orally, allowing
patients to be treated at home. Considering the expense of
hospitalization, frequent renal function testing and IV maintenance
associated with amphotericin B treatment, the 2 treatments have a
similar overall cost. Furthermore, itraconazole penetrates the eye in
dogs with active disease.3 ITZ, however, is not excreted in the urine
and cannot be used for the treatment of urinary tract disease. ITZ is
also hepatotoxic and animals should be monitored for elevations in
liver enzymes.12

Prognosis for any animal diagnosed with blastomycosis is guarded to
good. In one retrospective study, the fatality rate for dogs with
blastomycosis was 41.4 percent (18 percent died and 23.4 percent were
euthanized).3 The 2 most important prognostic indicators are brain
involvement and severity of lung disease. Prognosis is poor for dogs
with brain involvement, but some can be successfully treated.
Approximately 50 percent of the dogs with severe lung disease die from
pulmonary failure within the 1st week of treatment.1

Recurrences occur in approximately 20 percent of animals that survive
treatment.1 Relapse after apparently successful treatment typically
occurs in the 1st 6 months but can occur up to 15 months
post-treatment. Recurrence of disease is treated with another 60 to 90
day regimen of Itraconazole. Recurrence usually occurs due to
reactivation of a residual site of infection. Retreatment has an 80
percent or greater chance of producing a cure.

It is interesting to note the occurrences of this fungus, as seen
below in the "see also" region of the ProMED-mail archives. It is
likely the emergence of this fungus and clusters of cases is related
to appropriate weather conditions in certain locales. - Mod.TG
