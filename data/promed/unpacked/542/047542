[1] News report
Date: Mon 28 Mar 2011

The Rhode Island Department of Health said a salmonella outbreak
appears to be connected to raw eggs. The department said Mon 28 Mar
2011, it has received reports of 33 possible salmonella cases
connected to tainted pastries made by a Johnston bakery.

"The investigation is ongoing as we speak. We do expect to see
reported illnesses through the end of this week," said Health
Department spokeswoman Annemarie Beardsworth. The department said of
those, 11 tested positive for salmonella and 17 people were
hospitalized.

Health officials said the common thread appears to be the consumption
of zeppoles, an Italian pastry similar to a doughnut, made by
DeFusco's Bakery in Johnston. "All of them had purchased a baked good
from either DeFusco's or a baked good that DeFusco's had supplied."

The department said the pastry shells had been stored in used egg
crates, which could have exposed them to infected raw eggs. Health
experts are now trying to pinpoint the source of infection in the
eggs.

On Fri 25 Mar 2011, the department announced a recall of all baked
goods sold at DeFusco's following an inspection of the Johnston store.
Officials said they found that pastry cream used in zeppoles and
eclairs was stored at unsafe temperatures.

"If anyone has any of these recalled products, whether it's on the
counter in your kitchen or if you have put them in your freezer to
save them for another time, please throw them out. It's not worth
taking a chance at getting sick," Beardsworth said.

[2] Rhode Island Department of Health report

The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) continues its
investigation of an outbreak of salmonella, possibly related to
zeppoles.

HEALTH has now learned that American Bakery Supplies, a distributor
in West Warwick, purchased zeppoles from DeFusco's. The company then
distributed the pastries to Roch's Market in West Warwick; Meal Works
in Coventry; and Touch of Class Catering in West Warwick. Meal Works
(a catering company) served these zeppoles at events on [17 and 18 Mar
2011] at West Warwick Manor Senior Center, St John and Paul Church in
Coventry, Sparrow Point (senior facility) in West Warwick, and
Crescent Park Manor in Riverside.

Zeppoles from DeFusco's Johnston store were also sold at all
DeFusco's locations; Colvitto's Bistro in Narragansett; Sal's Bakery
in Providence; and Focaccia World in Johnston. All 5 Crugnale Bakery
locations in Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston,
and Cumberland also sold DeFusco's zeppoles from 16 through 20 Mar
2011.

[Although the pastry shells were baked, it appears that the
contamination occurred after the baking process. In the same way,
ingestion of already baked cakes may spread salmonellosis via the
icing. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ responsible for the
outbreak is not stated in these reports. Distribution of some of the
suspected vehicles to a senior center could be particularly
problematic as the elderly are at higher risk for severe morbidity as
well as mortality from salmonellosis. - Mod.LL]
