Plague Case First This Year
-----------------------------
A Santa Fe County man suffering from the plague [infection with
_Yersinia pestis_ is the first person to contract the disease this
year in New Mexico, the state Department of Health says.
The 21-year-old man, whose illness was confirmed Thursday [21 Jun
2001 by the state Scientific Laboratory Division, was hospitalized
and should recover after treatment with antibiotics, health officials
said. The man's home was being investigated by the department to
determine the source of his infection, officials said Tuesday.
"Plague activity has been low this year except for Santa Fe County,
where several dogs and cats have been diagnosed recently with plague,"
said Dr. Paul Ettestad, state public health veterinarian.

[New Mexico is the state with the greatest number of cases of human
plague. Laboratories in non-endemic areas are unlikely to recognize
_Y. pestis_ but should be prepared to send those isolates in which _Y.
pestis_ cannot be "ruled out" to the appropriate local or state health
laboratory.
_Y. pestis_ has been misidentified as _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_,
_Shigella_ species, H2S-negative _Salmonella_, and _Acinetobacter_
species by commercially available biochemical identification systems
in clinical microbiology laboratories, because these systems often
have an inadequate number of _Y. pestis_ profiles in their databases
to provide the correct identification. If any of these identifications
are offered by a biochemical identification system, the
characteristics of the isolate should be reviewed. If the findings are
consistent with _Y. pestis_ (a facultative Gram-negative bacillus that
is oxidase-negative, not a lactose fermenter, is catalase-positive,
urea-negative, K/A on a TSI slant, grows more slowly than most other
Enterobacteriaceae on solid media and will typically form pinpoint
colonies after 24 hours of incubation at 35 degrees Celsius), the
possibility of _Y. pestis_ infection must be considered and the
isolate should be forwarded to the appropriate local or state health
laboratory (in the United States).
_Y. pestis_ usually grows better at 28 degrees Celsius than at higher
temperatures. In suspected cases of plague, an additional blood or
broth culture (BHI or TSB) should be incubated at room temperature (22
to 28 Celsius) and not shaken or rocked, as this slows the growth of
the organism. _Y. pestis_ grows very slowly in thioglycolate broth,
which should not be used. The bipolar staining characteristics of the
organism are not seen on Gram stain, but may be seen with
Wright-Giemsa stain.
Treatment of human plague is with streptomycin, or, if unavailable,
with gentamicin, chloramphenicol, or one of the tetracyclines.
Although penicillins and cephalosporins may exhibit in vitro activity,
they are not effective in treating infections with _Y. pestis_.
Multi-drug resistance has been reported in _Y. pestis_ isolates from
Madagascar. Of importance in the hospitalized patient is the potential
for human-to-human transmission of plague via the respiratory route. -
Man.Ed.DS
[_Yersinia pestis_ is the agent responsible for bubonic plague.
Endemic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the western USA and several
other areas of the world. Fleas are the vectors primarily responsible
for spreading _Y. pestis_ from these reservoirs, although contact with
infected rabbit carcasses has been a significant source of infection
for man during the winter. Throughout history, outbreaks of human
plague involving rats in densely populated agricultural or urban areas
have occurred when rats commingled with infected sylvatic rodents.
Prairie dogs are often considered sentinel animals because of their
susceptibility to the organism. However, cats are extremely sensitive
as well and may be the source that exposes humans. The swollen lymph
glands may be mistaken for normal cat-bite abscesses. If one of these
buboes (swollen lymph glands) ruptures, it may be the source of
bacteria to people associated with the cat.
In humans, the bubo in the groin or under the arm is most common.
However, there may also be a systemic infection involving the lungs
and, consequently, transmission between people is possible. Pneumonic
plague can be recognized by the bloody sputum coughed up by patients
that are TB negative. - Mod.TG
