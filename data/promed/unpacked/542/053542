Ringworm expert Dr. Sandra Newbury has been called in for
consultation to develop an effective ringworm control program for the
Ontario animal shelter outbreak.

Her book chapter on the topic of dermatophyte management in the
new textbook Infectious Disease Management in Animal Shelters
describes an effective surveillance and intervention program using
lyme sulfur dips, oral itraconazole, and serial cultures.

[We appreciate Dr. Levy sharing this encouraging news. We also hope
that the people involved with the situation will issue a "lessons
learned" report from this situation so that it may be avoided in the
future as well as avoided by other shelters. - Mod.TG]
