Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) has been endemic in cattle and small ruminants
in Jordan for many years. The first reported suspect cases of FMD for
1998/9 were on November 23 in Irbid Governorate situated close to the
Syrian and Israeli borders. Since then more than 20 outbreaks were reported
by the State veterinarians All these outbreaks have been north and east of
Amman as well as around the city.
Animals on 16 farms with clinical lesions consistent with FMD were
submitted to Kimron Veterinary Institute, Israel. Samples from 8 farms were
positive for O1 type FMD and included both cattle and small ruminants.
Losses were high in calves, lambs and kids, but very few adult animals were
lost. Control measures included ring vaccination, (using in stock vaccine),
isolation of clinically affected animals, disinfection and general advice
to farmers on preventing young animals from suckling. Media publicity was
also undertaken. Following an emergency declaration, an additional 1
million doses of vaccine were purchased by the Ministry of Agriculture and
distributed to affected areas.
