In several villages of the Akhal velayat, cattle are massively falling ill and dying. This is reported by Azatlyk correspondents in the region.

"Only in one village about 100 cows died. The corpses of dead animals are thrown into the field on the outskirts of the village. They are later eaten by hyenas, the Azatlyk correspondent reported on [18 Jun 2019]."

The epidemic is located in the west, 150 km [approx 93 mi] from Ashgabat. The editorial staff of Azatlyk refrains from mentioning the names of these villages in order to respect the confidentiality of their sources in the region.

According to the correspondent of Azatlyk, the local veterinary service puts the diagnosis "piroplasma" on the sick animals: "Many veterinarians say that this cattle disease is transmitted by ticks. Infected animals develop haematuria and jaundice. Then they have diarrhea. A week later, the cattle die."

According to local residents, who spoke with the correspondent of Azatlyk, the reason for the mass death of cattle is the late diagnosis and application of measures to prevent the disease: "The performance of the local veterinary service has long been deficient. Animal diseases are not timely diagnosed. For this reason, the disease has rapidly spread. In addition, after the diagnosis was made, the veterinarians did not have the appropriate drugs. They could not cure cattle with medicines on time, a resident of Akhal velayat, who spoke with Azatlyk on condition of anonymity, told on [18 Jun 2019]."

A resident of the Akhal region also added that for a long time, preventive medicines for animal diseases were not available in the rural areas, resulting in the massive death of livestock.

According to Azatlyk correspondents, discontent among the population, in connection with the animal mortality was growing. Residents, fearing diseases, sell their healthy livestock, hoping to resume livestock after the epidemic has ended.

Azatlyk Radio failed to receive an official comment from the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan.

In March of this year [2019] another outbreak of infectious disease, presumably pox, was seen among camels in the Balkan region of Turkmenistan. The authorities of Turkmenistan have not officially confirmed the presence of the disease.

[The cattle tickborne diseases known to be present in Turkmenistan are predominantly Anaplasmosis and Theileriosis. It may be assumed that babesiosis is present as well. According to the country's annual OIE report covering 2018, no anaplasmosis cases were recorded during that year; this may explain increased susceptibility. Theileriosis was recorded during 2018. Diarrhea has been known to occur sometimes in cases of theileriosis. Information on the attained diagnosis, by microscopic examinations of bloodsmears or otherwise, will be helpful.

From a reliable source acquainted with the regional conditions, we have been (gratefully) advised that tick-born disease is well possible; if there is suddenly a new type, "everything goes haywire". Piroplasmosis should be fairly easy to cure if diagnosed early enough, the typical hematuria (blood in urine) being readily observed. However, the observation may be delayed when animals are in the pastures with a less-attentive communal herd herder.

The Akhal (Ahal) veleyat is a region in the south-center of Turkmenistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. According to the above report, the event has taken place in the region's west, some 150 km [approx. 93 mi] from Ashgabat (see map at https://tinyurl.com/y5tfqapb). - Mod.AS
