Misinformation spreading
------------------------
[Excerpts:]
Sheffield-born Gwen Wilson, a health delegate with the British Red Cross (BRC), has just returned from Sierra Leone. "There's a lot of misunderstanding, which breeds fear, and it's that fear that presents the biggest challenge," she told HuffPost UK. Scaremongering has not been effective, she said. "Unfortunately some of the early messages simply said 'Ebola Kills' so it has been difficult to encourage people to go for treatment and into isolation -- instead many hide at home and ultimately infect other people. Some villages have refused to allow anyone in -- even Ministry of Health officials. In one tragic case a family brought 3 bodies home that had been prepared for burial by the Ministry of Health. They opened one of the body bags to check no body parts had been removed: all the family now have EVD" [as a result of touching the body - Mod.JW].

More often, misinformation is spreading faster than the health workers can counter it. Text messages have circulated in Guinea, according to Reuters, which claimed Senegalese researchers had found the cure for Ebola -- a mixture of hot chocolate, Nescafe, milk, sugar and raw onions taken once a day for 3 days. There are a lot of myths; some think the government has planted it in opposition areas; others believe the disease is a punishment, or a result of witchcraft. Some families believe that when their loved one goes into the ambulance they will be given an injection to kill them."

The outbreak of the notorious and much dreaded killer Ebola virus disease has spread fear right across Sierra Leone, and almost everybody is now concerned.

The latest report states that yesterday, 3 Jul 2014, thousands of people from all the 11 chiefdoms in the southern district of Bo marched through the principal streets of Bo City to raise awareness on the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak.

What was described as a 5000-man Anti-Ebola March reportedly attracted all the Members of Parliament, Paramount Chiefs and other traditional authorities, school pupils, drivers and other people from all works of life, all of whom processed from the Bo City Centre to the historic Coronation Field where various stakeholders delivered anti-EVD messages aimed at raising the awareness of the people about the disease.

As West African countries battle against a deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus disease [EVD], Moses Kortu reports from Sierra Leone on the devastating effect it has had in his home town:

Schools, markets, borders and banks have closed in my remote region of north eastern Sierra Leone as the government takes steps to prevent the spread of the virus. Public life in my home town of Kailahun [Kailahun District, Eastern Province], near the border with Guinea and Liberia, has come to a complete standstill. I have been tracking the change in attitudes of the people in my community, talking to them about the climate of fear that has spread across the region.

When the EVD outbreak 1st began, it wasn't taken seriously. My region is one of the strongholds of the opposition party, so people thought this was done to scare and disperse people. People in my community were fearful that deaths were caused by the injection given to EVD sufferers as a way for the government to kill them off. But now most believe the virus is the real killer.

Tamba Bundor is trying to spread this message: "I lost 5 of my family members, including my mother and wife, because of misunderstanding of EVD. Brothers and sisters, EVD is real -- take preventative measures." Gradually, because of education programmes and the increase in the number of infected cases and deaths, the majority are now starting to believe EVD is real.

There were other reasons preventing people from taking those suffering from EVD to the health centre. "It is because of the fear that we don't want to take our people to the health centre, and when they are there we can't touch them and nobody can go near them," said Finda Sahr. Now, however, those who fail to bring a sick person from their house or community to the health centre will be reported to the police.

It's not just the virus which scares the population of Kailahun. The government has restricted movement within the district by setting up checkpoints, instilling fear in people and preventing them from going about their usual business. Business owners have been particularly badly affected.

"I can't take my business outside because the police are all over," said Sahr Musu, a trader. With no market, people are asking themselves how they will survive -- especially as it is now the farming season -- and are waiting on the government to lift the ban. The head of the checkpoint at Kailahun, Sadie Jabbie, attempted to reassure me: "We are here to protect the lives of the people in this district, not to harm or unbalance anybody."

The government's attempts to control the virus have made it even harder for business owners to continue working. The First International Bank, the only bank in the region, has closed indefinitely, causing stress to the population. Markets, border checkpoints and schools have also closed. Even NGOs have started withdrawing for fear of being infected.

A public exam for secondary school pupils was postponed. Before the postponement, children were prevented from attending schools, and public gatherings were banned in Kailahun to prevent the spread of the virus. Tenneh Foryoh, head girl of Kissi Bendu secondary school in Koindu, told me: "The closure of schools ... has affected the academic pursuits of students in the district and has made students suffer, so I ask the government to allow students to complete the academic year."

Although people are still dying, the atmosphere is better than before: there is a sense that the situation is being brought under control as the community gains more of an understanding and awareness of the crisis. On [1 Jul 2014], President Koroma delivered a message of determination in his 1st address to the Sierra Leoneans on the EVD crisis: "We must defeat this threat to our nation. We must soldier on. We must prevail."

[4] Sierra Leone: strategy
Date: Fri 4 Jul 2014

http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/68717


Business tycoon and celebrated philanthropist, Momoh Konte, has declared an all out war against the much feared killer Ebola virus disease [EVD] which has started killing Sierra Leoneans. Recently he launched a serious anti-Ebola campaign in his natal district, Koinadugu, involving all the traditional authorities and other stakeholders in the district.

The campaign in Koinadugu/Kabala has been going on very effectively, even now as I am writing, mainly because traditional authorities -- the chiefs and other stakeholders -- are included. A collective awareness-raising campaign involving all and sundry was the strategy Momoh Konteh applied to succeed in Koinadugu. It is advisable for such a strategy to be tried in other districts as was the case of Bo City yesterday during the 5000-man march. EVD is everybody's business; therefore, it should be fought by the concerted effort of every Sierra Leonean, as I have yet to see a Sierra Leonean immunized against EVD [there is no vaccine]; all of us are highly vulnerable to the killer epidemic.

Involving especially the traditional authorities in the anti-EVD fight becomes more necessary when we consider this country's tradition in which traditional authorities command high respect and obedience. In the provinces, particularly, the chiefs are revered; whatever they say is taken as gospel truth, so they can be used very effectively to sensitize their people. There is also the need to decentralize the EVD war by setting up committees at various levels; district, chiefdom, town and village levels.

The Margibi County [Liberia] Health Team, in collaboration with the Administration of the Charles Rennie Hospital in Kakata, has listed 10 nurses from the C.H. Rennie Hospital and several others to be closely observed for suspected symptoms of the Ebola Virus Disease [EVD] in Margibi.

The decision came days after these people were noticed to have come in contact with a student of the Kakata Rural Teacher Training Institute (M.T.) who died recent from EVD at the C.H. Rennie Hospital. Speaking to this paper at the C.H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata on 2 Jul 2014, County Health Officer Dr. Hawa Kromah said the nurses are currently out of work from the Hospital and are being observed for 21 days. Dr. Kromah said there are other people who also came in contact with the late M.T. prior to his death, including trainees from the Kakata Rural Teacher Training Institute (KRTTI), most especially his roommates and others from the community.

She further disclosed that while the victim was alive, he visited a health center in Kakata for treatment before he was subsequently admitted at the C.H. Rennie Hospital, where he eventually died. She indicated that the administration of the KRTTI has been informed about the issue, and the names and contacts of those fellow roommates (students) are already identified for close monitoring. The Margibi County Health Officer said the students from KRTTI who are listed have all left the campus and they will only return for graduation, which is scheduled this month [July 2014]. For the rest of the people, she said they have been earmarked and are also needed for observation to make sure that they are not EVD positive.

The Medical Director of the C.H. Rennie Hospital, Dr. Adolphus Yeiah, said the hospital has had a series of meetings with the Margibi County Administration to contain the situation. Dr. Yeiah warned that EVD as a disease is real and people should not overlook its existence, adding that many people believe that it is not real. He said there is a need that everyone helps in containing the virus in Margibi County and Liberia at large in order to save lives. The Medical Director said people should not be afraid to go to the hospital for treatment or to report suspicious sicknesses, dismissing rumors circulating in the county that whenever a patient goes to the C.H. Rennie Hospital for regular medication, he or she can be detained falsely for suspected EVD symptoms. He said this has made many people afraid to go to the hospital for treatment.

[6] Overseas: foreign worker ban
Date: Fri 4 Jul 2014

http://globalnation.inquirer.net/107535/ebola-virus-stops-new-ofw-hires


The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) is temporarily suspending the processing and deployment of newly hired overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) bound for 3 West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- as the deadly Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in the region has worsened.

"We will be banning new hires to those 3 countries," said Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz, adding that POEA Administrator Hans Cacdac was drafting the resolution on the deployment ban. The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier raised to Level 2 the crisis alert level in the 3 countries, advising the more than 2000 Filipinos there to restrict their movements, avoid public places and take extra precautions. However, the deployment of returning OFWs with existing employment contracts will remain open, said Baldoz. "Only returning overseas Filipino workers with existing employment contracts will be allowed to go back to their host countries," she said. EVD is a highly contagious disease with no known cure [but it can be successfully treated if patients are seen early on - Mod.JW]. There have been 600 cases of the Ebola virus in West Africa, with 400 deaths [as of 2 Jul 2014: 779 cases including 481 deaths -- see ProMED archive (81) below - Mod.JW].

[While we may sympathize with the plight of the schoolchildren, it is for the good of the whole community that the schools in Kailahun have been closed, and public gatherings have been banned.

It is a matter for concern that 3 months after the appearance of the EVD epidemic, people still need to be convinced that the disease is real, and malicious gossip is circulating that hospitals are detaining people on suspicion of having the disease, when they are only being registered for follow-up if they have a history of contact with a case of EVD. And that ambulance crews are administering lethal injections.

Martin Haditsch, Prof., MD, PhD <leonding@travelmed.at> suggests that tagging EVD prevention messages onto radio or TV broadcasts of major international sports events such as the football World Cup could be very effective. I may be wrong, but I don't think there are many fans of international sports in the remote border regions of the 3 countries concerned -- perhaps there are in the capital cities.

Although WHO has not recommended a ban on travel or trade with the 3 affected West African countries, the ban on new recruitment of foreign workers by their own governments is a prudent measure to reduce the risk of infection being introduced by them on their return home. The risk is not eliminated, however, because workers with existing contracts are being allowed to return to West Africa.
