[1] Cholera - Iraq: (Baghdad)

Sources at the Kadhimiya Teaching Hospital said 6 new cases of
cholera have been detected in Baghdad. The sources, refusing to be
named, said the government was trying hard not to let news about the
contagious disease spread in Baghdad where fears are rising of a
massive outbreak unless the disease is contained.

Medical personnel have discovered at least 80 more new cases of
cholera but the authorities would not let media report on the spread
of the disease. The sources say most of the new victims are children
from the most impoverished quarters east of the capital, which lack
basic amenities such as pure water. A source said cholera has caused
the death of 2 people in Baghdad.

[How many of these cases were included in the recent update is not at
all clear but, either way, the continued upswing in cases in Baghdad
is of concern.

[2] Cholera - Iraq: (Baghdad)

Iraq will continue to suffer from cholera for the next 2 years until
projects for providing sanitized water and a new sewage system are
built, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday [4 Dec 2007].

"Since there is a defect in the infrastructure in providing sanitized
water and in sewage, the problem of cholera will stay deep rooted,"
Adel Abdullah, general inspector in the Health Ministry, told a news
conference. "Within 2 years there are ambitious projects to provide
all Baghdad's districts with sanitized water in sufficient quantities
and sewage projects. When these projects are complete, cholera will
become history."

Iraq has been hit by a cholera outbreak in 2007, focused mainly on
the north but lately spreading to the capital Baghdad. Abdullah said
4637 cases of cholera have been registered in Iraq, mostly in the 2
cities of Kirkuk and Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq. So far, 24 cases
have been fatal.

In November 2007, the United Nations children's agency UNICEF said in
a report that only 20 percent of families outside Baghdad had access
to proper sewage, and Iraq's sewage treatment plants operate at just
17 percent of capacity.

Abdullah said in the east side of Baghdad there had been 106 cases of
cholera, including one fatality. In the west there had been 9 cases,
7 of them, including 2 fatalities, in an institution for the severely disabled.

A World Health Organization clinic has been set up at the institution
and patients are being provided bottled water, the UNICEF report
said. "While national caseloads are declining, we are increasingly
concerned about a possible outbreak in Baghdad. The capital accounts
for 79 percent of all new cases," it said.

[3] Diarrhea - Indonesia: (Jakarta)

Overwhelmed by the number of diarrhea patients seeking care, Koja
Hospital in North Jakarta has transferred some nearby hospitals. The
city-run hospital had received as many as 350 diarrhea patients since
Tuesday [27 Nov 2007]. Most of them came from Lagoa and Rawa Badak
subdistricts. As of Thu 29 Nov 2007, 9 patients had died. "All of
them were children under one year old," Koja vice director Caroline K
told The Jakarta Post over the weekend [1-2 Dec 2007].

The hospital on 29 Nov 2007 treated 76 patients, 67 children, and 9
adults. As of last week it had transferred some 100 patients to other
hospitals, including Tanjung Priok Port Hospital, Atmajaya Hospital,
and Sukapura Jakarta Islamic Hospital. The hospital transferred the
patients because it has less space due to an ongoing renovation. As
such, patients are being treated in hospital corridors and in waiting
rooms on the 6th and 8th floors.

Atmajaya Hospital in Pluit treated 54 children with diarrhea on
Thursday [29 Nov 2007]. It has been receiving cases from Koja since
27 Nov 2007. "There are 14 patients who have recovered and none of
them died," said Sri, spokeswoman at Atmajaya.

Tanjung Priok Port Hospital, which began receiving patients from Koja
on Tuesday [27 Nov 2007], had 24 diarrhea patients, mostly children.
"All of them are treated in the emergency room," said Norma, a nurse.

As of Sun 2 Dec 2007, the Sukapura Jakarta Islamic Hospital in
Cilincing had treated about 70 patients with the ailment, which is
believed to have caused the death of a 9-month-old baby last week.
Most of the patients come from Cilincing, Koja, and Rawa Badak areas,
said doctor Eka Yuliyati. According to a doctor, when the number of
patients peaked on 27 Nov 2007, Sukapura was forced to use a meeting
room to treat patients.

[4] Cholera - Malawi: (Southern Region)

At least one person has died from cholera and 16 others have
contracted the water-borne disease in Blantyre, Malawi's main
commercial city, health authorities said on Tue 4 Dec 2007. All 17
cases were registered over the past week in Bangwe, one of Blantyre's
crowded townships.

Chimota Phiri, the deputy district health officer, said the disease
risked spreading further due to persistent water shortages that have
hit the city as a result of breakdowns at the state-run water
utility. With no safe supply of water, many Malawians may resort to
drinking water from unpurified wells.

"We did not expect to record so many cholera cases now as the rainy
season has not yet reached its peak and we fear the current water
problems could worsen the situation," Phiri said.

The people of Ajakajak community in Andoni Local Government Area of
Rivers State have cried out to the state government to rescue them
from a cholera outbreak, which has claimed the lives of more than 11
children as at press time on Thu 29 Nov 2007. A source in the
community told Saturday Tribune that the outbreak, which has
reportedly spread to some other communities in the area, was fast
assuming the form of an epidemic, threatening to wipe communities out.

Other sources from Ajakajak informed that records at the community's
health centre confirmed that the figure given was for last week alone
and that more cases had come in this week. It was gathered that the
epidemic was spreading very fast and that about 30 persons had died so far.

At least 14 people have died and scores of others are hospitalized
following an outbreak of cholera in the central Nigerian state of
Plateau, a government official said on Thu 29 Nov 2007.

Commissioner for Health Angela Miri said the waterborne disease broke
out in the remote district of Bokkos last week [19-25 Nov 2007] but
was reported late to the authorities. "When it started the people
thought it was a strange ailment so they refused to go to hospital.
By the time we got there 14 people had already died," Miri said.
