Between 8-22 Jan 2018, the surveillance and health watch mechanism of the Centre Region reported 3 deaths in a family residing in Yaounde, due to acute onset of fever, rashes and bleeding suggestive of viral hemorrhagic fever. One of the members of this family, whose vital prognosis is not [available], is currently receiving medical follow-up in the hospital.

Preliminary tests carried out were negative for Ebola, Marburg and Lassa viruses.

More investigation is ongoing. Mr. Andre Mama Fouda calls on anyone with fever accompanied by a rash with or without bleeding to go immediately to the nearest health facility.

[Melissa Dudley is thanked for sending in this press release.

Andre Mama Fouda, Cameroon's Minister of Public Health, has said there is no Ebola virus outbreak in Cameroon (https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/no-ebola-outbreak-cameroon-minister/). Although Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever virus infections have been ruled out in preliminary tests, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever remain a possibility. Undiagnosed cases of rash with fatalities have been reported previously from Cameroon by ProMED-mail, but not hemorrhagic illnesses. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about any additional cases that might occur or additional laboratory results. - Mod.TY
