Measles warning issued by Auckland Regional Public Health Service
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A warning has been issued by the Auckland Regional Public Health Service
after 7 [of measles] cases were diagnosed in young Aucklanders, including
one at Waitakere Hospital's emergency care centre. The patients are aged
from 3 to 16, 4 of whom were on a flight from Brisbane to Auckland on 11
Jan 2011. A family group caught the viral disease overseas. One Auckland
child was a severe case and was hospitalised, while another child was taken
to hospital but not admitted.

Dr Richard Hoskins of Auckland Regional Public Health Service says measles
is easily passed on through coughing and sneezing. In rare cases it can be
fatal. People who are suspected to have measles are isolated to prevent it
spreading. "Generally in New Zealand we have a pretty good immunisation
rate and so we tend to get control of these things during the 2nd wave, as
not everyone has to be isolated," he says. "There are no cast-iron
guarantees there won't be a 3rd wave this time but the signs are good and
we've been working very hard on it." Dr Hoskins says the health service
contacts principals if a child is infectious and needs to stay away from
school.

In New Zealand the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is free and
given to children at around 15 months, with a 2nd dose at 4 years. The
vaccination is 99 per cent effective [for measles and rubella, but not
mumps. - Mod.CP] after the 2nd dose.

Dr Hoskins says parents whose children have been immunised should not be
too concerned. "Check with your family doctor or your Whanau Ora provider
if you're not sure of your child's immunisation status. People start to
develop symptoms about 10 days after coming into contact with the disease.
They become infectious themselves the day before symptoms appear, which is
tricky. Symptoms to look out for are a runny nose, a high fever, red eyes
and in some cases small white spots in the mouth."

If parents are concerned they should call their family doctor or Healthline
for advice.
