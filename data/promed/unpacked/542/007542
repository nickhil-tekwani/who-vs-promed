Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections linked to onions
------------------------------------------------------------

Latest outbreak information:
- Since the last case count update on 7 Aug 2020, an additional 229 ill people have been reported in this outbreak, including 9 from 4 new states: Arkansas, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Texas.
- On 12 Aug 2020, cheese dips and spreads were recalled from the following stores: Kroger, Kroger Mid-Atlantic, Kroger Delta Division, Fry's Food Stores, Fred Meyer, and Smith's.
- A total of 869 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Newport have been reported from 47 states; 116 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.
- Epidemiologic and traceback information showed that red onions are a likely source of this outbreak. Due to the way onions are grown and harvested, other onion types, such as white, yellow, or sweet yellow, may also be contaminated.
- This investigation is ongoing. The CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

Investigation details:
As of 18 Aug 2020, a total of 869 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport have been reported from 47 states.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2020 to 4 Aug 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 102 years, with a median age of 40; 56% of ill people are female. Of 468 ill people with information available, 116 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 48 isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing of 3 clinical isolates by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also showed no resistance.

Whole genome sequencing analysis shows that an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections in Canada [see below] is related genetically to this outbreak in the USA. This means that people in both of these outbreaks are likely to share a common source of infection.

Investigation of the outbreak:
Epidemiologic and traceback information indicates that red onions are a likely source of this outbreak. Due to the way onions are grown and harvested, other onion types, such as white, yellow, or sweet yellow, may also be contaminated. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. A total of 88% of people reported eating onions or dishes likely containing onions in the week before their illness started. Of the 68 cases who were asked what types of onions they ate, 46 (68%) ate any white onions, 45 (66%) ate any red onions, and 33 (49%) ate any yellow onions in the week prior to illness. Most ill people ate more than one type of onion in the week before illness.

Many ill people were identified as part of illness clusters. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. Investigating illness clusters can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there.

A total of 28 illness clusters have been identified in 10 states. Information was collected on 21 of the 28 clusters at restaurants and grocery stores. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate red onions and other types of onions. Investigations conducted by states and the FDA identified that all 21 restaurants and grocery stores served or sold red, yellow, or white onions: 16 of the 21 clusters served red onions, 12 served yellow onions, and 10 served white onions.

The traceback information collected from several of these illness clusters identified Thomson International, Inc., of Bakersfield, California, as a likely source of red onions. Traceback is ongoing to determine whether other onions are linked to the outbreak. On 1 Aug 2020, Thomson International, Inc. voluntarily recalled red, yellow, white, and sweet yellow onions because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella_.

Other companies have also recalled onions or foods made with recalled onions. See the full list of recalled products here (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/newport-07-20/recalls.html).

Recalls:
Thomson International, Inc. was identified as a supplier of onions linked to this outbreak and issued a recall of red, yellow, white and sweet yellow onions. Additional recalls of onions and foods made with recalled onions have been announced as a result of this investigation. Please refer to the FSIS (https://bit.ly/325dYGR) and FDA (https://bit.ly/3aR31wR) websites for the latest recall information.

Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, serve, or sell recalled onions from Thomson International, Inc. or other companies, nor should they eat or sell other foods made with recalled onions. The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says 100 more people have become ill from _Salmonella_ contamination linked to a recall of US-grown onions, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 339. The agency said no deaths have been reported, but 48 people have been hospitalized. Those who became ill range in age from 3 to 100 years, and they ate red onions at home, at restaurants and in residential-care settings, the agency said.

As of Friday [14 Aug 2020], the breakdown of confirmed cases includes 78 people in BC, 208 in Alberta, 19 in Saskatchewan, 19 in Manitoba, 8 in Ontario, 6 in Quebec and 1 on Prince Edward Island.

The agency said people should not eat, use, sell or serve any red, white, yellow and sweet yellow onions from Thomson International Inc. of Bakersfield, California, or any products made with these onions. There is no evidence to suggest that onions grown in Canada are associated with the outbreak, it said. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it is conducting a food safety investigation and has issued food recall warnings for the brand of raw imported onions and some food products that contain these onions.

[This outbreak continues to grow in both the USA and Canada. Recalls have now expanded to some products made with the onions. Both in Canada and the USA, most of the cases are in the western parts of the countries. - Mod.LL
