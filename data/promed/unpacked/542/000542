A pig farm located in the parroquia [parish, county] of Puerto Limon, in Santo Domingo, was placed in quarantine due to an outbreak of swine fever.

The Ecuadorian Agency for Agro Quality Assurance (Agrocalidad) is conducting a census in the area in order to determine the porcine population that must be vaccinated.

Agrocalidad detected the outbreak since December [2012], for which they have maintained the quarantine of the farm where the focus of the outbreak is; Milton Cali, the provincial coordinator [?of Agrocalidad] said that as of now [24 Jan 2013] 200 piglets have died.

Meanwhile, members of the Pork Producers Association of Santo Domingo are requesting assistance to subsidize the vaccination campaigns, as is done for FMD [foot & mouth disease]; Marcelo Lopez, president of the union, said that the cost of a dose is [USD 0.35] per unit.

Quarantine will be lifted next week; for now movement of the pigs in areas surrounding the [affected farm] is not permitted and they are conducting testing [of pigs] at the Santo Domingo Cattle Fair, where pigs and cattle are sold on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

[This article does not give us much information to discern if this is classical swine fever or African swine fever. While they can look very similar initially, they are very different viruses. However, the ultimate outcome, death, may be a point in common between the viruses.

Hopefully there will be more information coming quite soon regarding which disease they have. Classical swine fever was reported in 2006. However, the world has become a very small place as diseases can travel around the world quite rapidly. These diseases clinically are similar and waiting for the laboratory report is appropriate.
