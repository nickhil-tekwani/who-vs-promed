Highly contagious virus strikes second site in Tanba; dead crows test
positive for H5
---------------------------------------------------
The bird flu virus detected at a second bird flu-hit poultry farm in Tanba,
Kyoto Prefecture, is of the highly contagious H5N1 strain, the National
Institute of Animal Health said Monday.
Self-Defense Forces personnel prepare a ditch to bury dead chickens at a
poultry farm near Asada Nosan Funai Farm in Tanba, Kyoto Prefecture.
H5N1 was detected at the first farm in the town, meaning there is a higher
possibility that the virus spread from Asada Nosan Funai Farm to the Takada
farm.
The Funai farm failed to alert authorities of the bird flu outbreak even
after a week's time and after birds died at the farm by the thousands.
Local authorities inspected the farm 27 Feb 2004, based on an anonymous tip.
Preliminary tests Wednesday on the dead chickens at the family-run Takada
farm, about 5 km from the Funai farm, were positive for bird flu.
Meanwhile, crows found dead at the poultry farm and in a nearby town last
week were confirmed Monday to be infected with H5 avian influenza, the
agriculture ministry said.
The strain was detected in a test by the animal health institute on samples
taken from 2 crows. The virus is the same general strain found in chickens
at the farm, it said.
It is the first case in Japan of the virus having been detected in wild birds.
The birds were among 4 crows found dead Friday. 2 were found at Asada Nosan
Funai Farm in the town of Tanba, where thousands of chickens had died
before authorities were alerted to the disease.
The others were found some 8 km to 9 km away, in the nearby township of Sonobe.
Japan's first case of bird flu in 79 years was detected at a poultry farm
in Yamaguchi Prefecture in January. The second outbreak occurred in
February among bantams kept as pets in Oita Prefecture. Both cases have
been found to involve the H5N1 strain.
No human infections have yet been confirmed in Japan.

Kyoto Prefecture to test crows
------------------------------
The Kyoto prefectural government on Monday placed cages to capture crows in
3 areas within a 10-kilometer radius of Asada Nosan's Funai Farm in
Tanbacho, Kyoto Prefecture, following the detection of avian influenza in 2
dead crows found at the farm and also in neighboring Sonobecho in the
prefecture.
Officials of the prefectural government set traps for crows in a forest and
other locations, but failed to catch any, a failure they blamed on the
crows' cautious nature.
The officials plan to test captured crows' throats and droppings to
determine whether they have bird flu at the Kyoto Prefectural Institute of
Hygienic and Environmental Sciences.
The Hyogo prefectural government decided the same day to perform a simple
test for avian influenza on wild birds that die in the prefecture. The
prefectural government also plans to capture crows in 13 municipalities
within a 30-kilometer radius of Funai Farm and a 5-kilometer radius of the
Arinobe poultry-processing plant in Yachiyocho, Hyogo Prefecture, and test
them for bird flu. Farmers in the areas have been requested not to make
shipments of chickens and eggs.

Bulletin on avian flu lays out advice, assurances to public
--------------------------------------------------
In a rare move aimed at calming fears before they can take flight, the
government's top spokesman issued a bulletin Tue, 9 Mar 2004 advising the
public on the possible dangers of avian flu and what can be done to prevent
the disease from spreading.
The bulletin comes in the wake of the nation's most recent reports of avian
flu since January 2004.
In the latest cases, the flu wiped out tens of thousands of chickens at
poultry farms in Tanba, Kyoto Prefecture.
The announcement, made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, advises
bird owners to contact a veterinarian or public health official if their
fowl start dying off suddenly and successively for no apparent reason.
Owners are also warned not to handle dead birds with their bare hands or to
bury them.
Furthermore, bird owners are advised to keep pens clean and to keep out
wild birds that may carry the avian flu virus.
On a more assuring note, the bulletin points out that humans are not in
danger of contracting the disease through eating chickens or eggs. Still,
despite the fact that there have been no reports of infection through
consuming raw eggs, people worried about infection are advised to heat the
eggs to at least 70 degrees C.
The bulletin also advises cooking chicken meat thoroughly, but to avoid
food poisoning rather than the avian flu.
Chicken meat and eggs that have been shipped to retailers will not be
recalled. However, government officials are considering rounding up and
destroying chickens in certain areas to prevent the disease from spreading
among birds.
Only in rare cases, the bulletin notes, have humans come down with avian
flu. Those who were infected inhaled feathers or powdered waste from
infected chickens.
With little chance of coming into close contact with sick birds, the
bulletin concludes there is only the remotest possibility that an average
citizen will contract the disease.

Taiwan reports outbreak of less virulent bird flu
-------------------------------------------------
Taiwan has reported a new outbreak of a less virulent form of bird flu and
plans to slaughter 12 000 chickens to curb its spread.
The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine told the
AFP news agency the virus was discovered from samples sent in by the farm
in the southern Pingtung county on 1 Mar 2004.
Taiwanese authorities have slaughtered 467 000 birds since H5N2, a less
virulent strain of the bird flu which has hit the Asian region, was first
detected at a chicken farm in the central county of Changhua on 15 Jan 2004.
Authorities insist the outbreaks do not pose a threat to humans.
The origin of the infection remains unknown

Thailand Resumes Some Exports to Japan
--------------------------------------
On Mon, 8 Mar 2004, Japan announced it will resume imports of processed
chicken items from 22 factories in Thailand. The plants had passed
inspections by Japanese health officials. Products made in Thailand
represent about 30 percent of Japans imported processed chicken. Stocks of
Charon Pokphand Foods and GFPT were higher on 8 Mar 2004 following Japans
resumption of cooked chicken imports from Thailand.
Thailand declared the country free of avian influenza on Mon, 8 Mar 2004
and announced that farmers will resume breeding chickens in April. Thailand
said no areas of the country have had an active case of avian influenza
since 25 Feb 2004. OIE, the World Organization of Animal Health, allows the
breeding of new chicken stocks 3 weeks after no new cases have been found.

[According to Article 2.1.14.2. of OIEs International Animal Health Code,
"A country may be considered free from highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) when it has been shown that HPAI has not been present for at least
the past 3 years. This period shall be 6 months after the slaughter of the
last affected animal for countries in which a stamping-out policy is
practised with or without vaccination against HPAI."
However, countries may also declare certain zones within their boundaries
to be free from HPAI. According to Article 2.1.14.3. of the Code, "an
infected zone may become free if at least 21 days have elapsed after the
confirmation of the last case and the completion of a stamping-out policy
and disinfection procedures, or 6 months have elapsed after the clinical
recovery or death of the last affected animal if a stamping-out policy was
not practiced." Zones declared free from HPAI after complying with the
described requirements may be eligible for export of susceptible animals
and/or their products, under conditions agreed upon between the exporting
and importing countries.
Obviously, processed (heat treated) poultry products are regarded safer
than live animals or unprocessed products.
Chapter 1.3.5. of the Code deals with Zoning and Regionalisation; a
proposal for a revised chapter 1.3.5., renamed ZONING, REGIONALISATION AND
COMPARTMENTALISATION, will be considered by the International Committee of
the OIE during the due General Session in May 2004 (see in OIEs
web-site,<http://www.oie.int/eng/AVIAN_INFLUENZA/zoning.htm>.- Mod.AS].
