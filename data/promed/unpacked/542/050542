7 more children succumbed to the deadly encephalitis here today [1 Nov
2009], taking the toll of the viral fever in the district this year
[2009] to 471. Additional Director of Health, LP Rawat, said 29
patients suffering from the fever have been admitted to various
hospitals in the region. He said a total of 2738 patients suffering
from Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)
were admitted this year to BRD Medical College and other hospitals of
the region; out of this number, 471 died. The dead include 3 each from
Kushinagar and Deoria and one from Gorakhpur.

Chief medical officer of Gorakhpur RN Mishra said that all children
below 15 years would be immunised for JE in a campaign to be launched
around autumn next year [2010] in all districts of Gorakhpur division.
Joint Secretary (immunisation) in the Union Health Ministry Shakuntala
Gamlani had asked local authorities last month [October 2009] to
launch an immunisation drive.

Japanese encephalitis is caused by mosquito bite, while acute
encephalitis syndrome spreads through contaminated water. Both affect
the central nervous system and brain causing paralysis and death.

[This is yet another report of an encephalitis outbreak in the
Gorakhpur area of Uttar Pradesh. The outbreak is of apparent mixed
etiology, including JE virus and an undesignated agent reportedly
responsible for the acute encephalitis syndrome that is due to
something other than JE virus. ProMED would appreciate receiving
information about the agent(s) responsible for that syndrome,
indicating its relation to contaminated water.
