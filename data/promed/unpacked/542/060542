A 27-year-old man presented to the otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinic with a 3-month history of progressive obstruction and bleeding from the right naris. Physical examination showed a red, granular, pedunculated, nonpulsatile mass that obstructed the right nasal cavity and bled on touch (see Panel A at the source URL above). The patient reported bathing frequently in the local pond. The mass was excised, and the base of the lesion was cauterized.

Histopathological examination revealed multiple thick-walled sporangia in various stages of maturation, surrounded by dense inflammation (see Panel B, hematoxylin and eosin, at the source URL). A diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis was made.

Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by the aquatic protistan parasite [it is a fungus] _Rhinosporidium seeberi_. The typical presentation is a reddish, friable mucosal polyp, commonly involving the nasal cavity, that bleeds profusely on touch.

The oropharynx, conjunctiva, rectum, and external genitalia may also be affected. The disease is endemic in India and Sri Lanka, although the infection also occurs in other parts of the world, including Africa and South America. At follow-up 8 months later, the patient had areas of recurrence in the nasopharynx that were removed.

[_Rhinosporidium_ has tentatively been classified as a lower aquatic fungus. _Rhinosporidium seeberi_ is causing rhinosporidiosis, a disease that affects humans, horses, dogs, and, to a lesser extent, cattle, cats, foxes, and birds and is most commonly found in India and Sri Lanka. Its natural habitat is water (Kaluarachchi K, et al. The identification of the natural habitat of _Rhinosporidium seeberi_ with _R. seeberi_-specific in situ hybridization probes. J Infect Dis Antimicrob Agents 2008;25:25-32). - Mod.EP
