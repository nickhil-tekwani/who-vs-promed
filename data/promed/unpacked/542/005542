As of 27 Jun 2014, a total of 18 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O121 (EHEC O121) have been reported from 5 states. Since the last update on 10 Jun 2014, one additional case has been reported from Washington. The total number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Idaho (3), Michigan (1), Montana (2), Utah (1), and Washington (11).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 1 May 2014 to 20 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 11 years to 45 years, with a median age of 27 years. 76 percent of ill persons are female. Among those persons with information, 7 (44 percent) of 16 have been hospitalized. No ill persons have developed HUS, and no deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that began after 4 Jun 2014 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.

Investigation Update
--------------------
According to FDA, Evergreen Fresh Sprouts has reported further production and distribution of raw clover sprouts grown from the same seed lot that was associated with the outbreak. Sprouts from this seed lot may still be in the marketplace.

On 26 Jun 2014, the FDA and CDC held a meeting with the owner of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts to advise the firm of FDA's concerns that the seed lot used to grow clover sprouts linked to this outbreak may be contaminated and to encourage Evergreen Fresh Sprouts to discontinue using that seed lot for producing clover sprouts for people to eat. CDC is concerned that continued distribution and sales of raw clover sprouts produced from the same seeds pose a risk to human health.

At the end of the meeting, the owner of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts informed the FDA that the firm planned to discontinue using the sprout seed lot that was used to grow the sprouts linked to the outbreak. The FDA will continue to work with Evergreen Fresh Sprouts to ensure the use of this seed lot is discontinued.

This investigation is active and ongoing, and CDC will update the public when more information becomes available. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them about foods eaten before becoming ill.

[Since the 1st CDC posting on 22 May 2014, the number of states has increased from 2 (Idaho and Washington) to 5, with the addition of the states of Michigan, Montana, and Utah, and the total number of cases increased from 10 to 18. It is of concern, additionally, that sprouts from the implicated seed lot may still be in the marketplace.

As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
