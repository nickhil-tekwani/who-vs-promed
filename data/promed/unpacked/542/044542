I must admitt I did not read all the last messages concerning FMD in
Taiwan. But something in the last one (LIVESTOCK DISEASE SUMMARY: OIE FEB
25) puzzles me. It is about the vaccination undertaken a few days before
the detection of FMD in the goat herd. I suppose the vaccine is adapted to
the local situation of FMD, that is against the O/Taiwain/99 strain. Is
there no possibility the outbreak in this goat farm could be a vaccination
accident? This has already happened, particularly in France, in 1981 if I
remember well.
