[On 6 Jan 2022, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) published the following statement regarding the origin of the omicron variant of concern. - Mod.CRD]


Statement from the [OIE] Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Evolution in Animals
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of species, and both mink and white-tailed deer have been identified as potential reservoir hosts. Recently, there has been much speculation that the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant of concern, which has an unusual constellation of mutations, may have evolved independently in an animal host.

While all the omicron mutations, including those identified as affecting receptor binding and immune escape, have previously been observed in human viruses (although some at very low frequencies), a rapid assessment of available sequence data does not suggest a close relationship with an animal virus characterized to date. However, the number of amino acid changes in the spike protein sequence does suggest that the virus may have been subjected to positive selective pressure.

A search of the public available genetic sequence databases indicates a need for enhanced genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in animals. For example, there are over 6 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from humans available on GISAID EpiCoV database, but only approximately 1500 sequences from animals. Similarly, there are over 2.5 million sequences from humans on the NCBI database but less than 250 animal sequences. Many different species on 4 continents are represented, but the vast majority of the sequences are of viruses from mink, cats, and white-tailed deer.

The possibility that omicron emerged from an animal host cannot be dismissed as an alternative to other hypotheses, including viral evolution during persistent infection in an immunocompromised person. It appears there are no mutations shared by omicron and viruses from animals that have not been identified in human viruses. However, some mutations in the omicron spike are associated with adaptation in mice, and based on in silico investigations, it has been suggested by one research group that omicron may have evolved in mice before spilling back into humans.

Epidemiological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to/by animals exposed to COVID-19 patients, targeted surveillance of potential hosts, and continuous monitoring of SARS-Cov-2 mutations in animals will assist our understanding of how viruses evolve in animals, whether new variants arise, and whether they pose any threat to public health. It is essential that both animal and human sequences combined with epidemiological data are shared globally in real time.

["Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogenic agent that causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have emerged from an animal source, likely a bat, and then spilled over to the human population. Although genetically closely related viruses have been isolated from _Rhinolophus_ bats, the exact source of SARS-CoV-2 and route of introduction into the human population has not been established.

"The current COVID-19 pandemic is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. Animal infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported by several countries. [See https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-3, last updated 3 Jan 2022. - Mod.CRD] Several animal species have proven to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 either naturally and/or by experimental infection. Important livestock species do not seem to be susceptible to infection through experimental studies. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2.

"It is important to monitor infections in animals to better understand their epidemiological significance for animal health, biodiversity, and human health. Evidence from risk assessments, epidemiological investigations, and experimental studies indicate that animals do not play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which is sustained by human-to-human transmission."

"The information presented in this technical factsheet reflects the epidemiological observations and research done to date and will be updated when additional information is available."

"In the framework of the OIE Incident Management System, several expert ad hoc expert groups have been established."
