White spot disease was found to be infecting prawns in another farm on the Logan river [Queensland] on [Fri 30 Dec 2016].

A 5th prawn farm has tested positive for the highly contagious virus more than a month after the initial case was identified.

The farm has been destocked, and chlorine was being used to treat the water at the premises 4 km [2.5 mi] down river from the 1st case.

Biosecurity Queensland has ramped up surveillance at nearby farms and locations in an effort to keep the virus in check. The government department is also investigating the source of the virus, testing a "range of materials" to identify potential for further spread.

Since the 1st case, the movement of all crustaceans, worms, and salt water has been halted in the Albert and Logan rivers, which are under a biosecurity emergency order.

Testing will continue on the Logan, Brisbane, and Pine rivers as well as in Moreton Bay, but Biosecurity Queensland does not believe the disease has established itself in the wild crustacean population.

The aquaculture industry is currently developing a compensation scheme, but it has not been finalised, and farmers will not have access to compensation other than statutory compensation. Statutory compensation is only available for stock that would not have become infected, and those provisions have not been enacted.

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The virus was 1st detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil last year (2016). This episode, detected in December 2016, represents the 1st confirmed case of white spot syndrome in an aquaculture center in Australia.

Acutely affected shrimp are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic, and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "white spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
