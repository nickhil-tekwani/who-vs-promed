Abstract
---------
In late September 2017, Bwabwata National Park [BNP] in Namibia experienced a sudden die-off of hippopotamuses and Cape buffalo. A multiorganizational response was initiated, involving several ministries within Namibia and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Rapid interventions resulted in zero human or livestock cases associated with this epizootic.

The study
---------
On 25 Sep 2017, Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) learned of 2 hippopotamus carcasses found in the western side of BNP. During unrelated aerial surveillance in the area on 1 Oct 2017, MET observed 10 hippopotamus carcasses, and on 7 Oct 2017 observed an additional 107 hippopotamus and 20 Cape buffalo carcasses. MET then notified the Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Forestry and the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MOHSS), which together established a joint action plan. The presumptive diagnosis was anthrax based on clinical and microscopic evidence; however, culture confirmation was not initially possible because of sample collection and laboratory challenges. CDC was consulted for assistance with the investigation.

To address possible human exposures, MOHSS developed a questionnaire and administered it beginning on 12 Oct 2017 to identify persons living in communities adjacent to BNP who were exposed to the carcasses. In total, 1050 persons were identified as having contact with or consuming meat from the carcasses and were immediately provided with postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the form of 2 weeks of ciprofloxacin and symptom monitoring. MOHSS returned 2 weeks later to assess PEP adherence among exposed community members and reported successful PEP adherence and no severe adverse events associated with taking PEP. Field workers performing carcass disposal continued PEP use until 2 weeks after activities concluded. MOHSS led community education to raise awareness of the ongoing outbreak, communicate the importance of not having contact with or consuming meat from animals found dead, and urge persons to seek healthcare if exposed or symptomatic. No human anthrax cases were associated with this outbreak.

CDC developed a protocol to collect specimens from affected wildlife carcasses. A field team collected several paired samples from 7 carcasses: ear and eyelid tissue biopsy samples and swab specimens of the nasal cavity, rectum, and other pooled blood when available. We recorded geographic coordinates by using a Garmin Montana 650 GPS unit at carcass locations for eventual geospatial analysis.

To test samples, we used the InBios Active Anthrax Detect (AAD) Rapid Test (InBios, http://www.inbios.com), a lateral flow assay that detects capsular polypeptide of _B. anthracis_. This novel assay was developed as a point-of-care diagnostic aid for human inhalation anthrax and is available for investigational or research use only. A laboratory evaluation conducted on animal tissues by CDC before deployment indicated that the test had 98% specificity and 95% sensitivity (C.B. Kolton, unpub. data). Use of the AAD Rapid Test under field conditions is beneficial because the test requires only a small sample volume, provides results within 15 minutes, and does not require refrigeration.

We performed the AAD Rapid Test in the field on tissue and swab samples collected from wildlife carcasses, following standard protocol provided by InBios We suspended tissue samples in 600 microliters of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortexed the suspension for 10 seconds. After pipetting repeatedly, we applied 10 microliters to the AAD Rapid Test cassette. For swabbed exudate samples, we transferred 10 microliters of fluid to the cassette without PBS.

We subsequently confirmed _B. anthracis_ infection by using culture, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

All 6 anthrax-suspected carcasses tested positive by AAD Rapid Test and were confirmed positive for _B. anthracis_ by culture, rRT-PCR, and/or IHC. A carcass of a buffalo that died from a vehicle collision was included as a negative control and tested negative by all assays.

Livestock vaccination is an effective means to prevent anthrax infection in domestic animals and subsequent transmission to humans and is required annually in Namibia. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Forestry secured [approximately] 10 000 doses of livestock anthrax vaccine to prevent spillover of anthrax from wildlife into susceptible domestic animals and will enforce future annual vaccination in the affected area. MET organized vaccination of wildlife. No cases of anthrax in livestock were associated with this outbreak.

Incineration is the recommended disposal method in cases where reducing the carcass to ashes is possible to enable complete destruction of any viable spores. However, because of the large size and number of carcasses, burial was an alternative method of disposal. We recommended limiting the distance that carcasses were moved for burial to decrease dissemination of spores and ensuring a depth of greater than 2 m [6.6 ft] was reached to prevent scavenger disruption to carcasses. Spraying the carcass and burial site with 10% formaldehyde minimized external contamination.

By early December [2017], the wildlife deaths subsided, and 155 hippopotamus and 86 Cape buffalo carcasses had been disposed of in the Mahango and Buffalo Core areas of BNP. MET conducted an aerial survey in the same area in September 2017 that recorded 588 hippopotamuses and 2216 Cape buffalo; roughly 26.4% and 3.8% of each population were affected, respectively.

Conclusions
------------
Our investigation highlights a successful public health outcome with zero human or livestock cases after an anthrax outbreak in wildlife in BNP. We demonstrated the successful use of the AAD Rapid Test for presumptive diagnosis of anthrax in wildlife under field conditions and the use of culture and IHC for confirmation of _B. anthracis_ in hippopotamuses and Cape buffalo. The AAD Rapid Test has potential to improve the ability of low-resource countries to quickly diagnose and effectively manage anthrax epizootics, thus reducing the risk for transmission to humans.

Swift response in organizing PEP dissemination, community education, livestock vaccination, and carcass disposal contributed to the prevention of anthrax transmission to humans and livestock. Our investigation emphasizes the importance of a multiagency coordinated response for zoonotic disease outbreaks and continued efforts to raise awareness of the risks of consuming meat from animal carcasses in anthrax-endemic areas.

[For reason of space this brief report has been abridged and edited, so members interested in how _B. anthracis_ was confirmed should read the full article.

The combined response to this 2017 wildlife outbreak in the Bwabwata National Park involving 243 carcasses, consisting of 155 hippos, 86 buffalo, and 2 impalas, was successful at the time, though in 2018, a total of 32 buffalo carcasses were picked between September and November [2018] in Bwabwata National Park, Kavango East region. A subsequent investigation ascertained the beasts were killed by the highly contagious anthrax disease. The carcasses were tested positive for anthrax, and 31 carcasses were found in the Buffalo Core Area and one at Mahangu Core Area. With that amount of potential soil contamination in 2017, a recurrence in 2018 was in the books.

That they claim the 1050 individuals treated with 2 weeks of PEP ciprofloxacin and system monitoring was successful with no severe adverse events strikes this moderator as extraordinarily fortunate, having myself suffered a severe bout of _Clostridium difficile_ infection after merely 10 days of cipro, which is why I prefer to advise the 3-day use of doxycycline. But they make a fair point of the benefits of PEP in such circumstances when there are many involved in not-always-certain circumstances. - Mod.MHJ
