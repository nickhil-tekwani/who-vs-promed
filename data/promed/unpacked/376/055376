2nd bird flu outbreak suspected
-------------------------------
A recent 2nd outbreak of suspected bird flu in southern Viet Nam was
reported today [Mon 18 Oct 2004], but officials played down the latest
outbreak. "Chickens only died in a few farms so it's not a big deal," said
Bui Quang Anh, the head of the veterinary department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development.
Chickens began dying in Tan My Chanh commune in Tien Giang province at the
beginning of October 2004, said a local official, who declined to be named.
Samples from the one-month old chickens from Tien Giang province have been
sent for tests, Anh said. Around 2000 chickens died, and another 3000 were
culled.
On Saturday [16 Oct 2004], local officials confirmed another outbreak [or
rather other outbreaks? - Mod.AS] of bird flu in Long An and Hau Giang
provinces in the Mekong Delta.
The 1st reports of large-scale chicken deaths in January this year [2004]
came from the southern Mekong provinces, before the virus spread throughout
the country.
Bird flu has claimed 20 lives in Viet Nam. The last confirmed case was a
14-month-old boy who died at the beginning of September 2004.

Viet Nam reports more poultry deaths
-----------------------------------
Viet Nam has recently detected some 6000 sick and dead fowl in 4 southern
provinces. A portion of the samples taken from the birds involved have
tested positive for the bird flu virus strain H5.
On Monday [18 Oct 2004], the local newspaper Youth quoted the director of
the Department of Animal Health, Bui Quang Anh, as saying that between 4
Oct and 16 Oct 2004, the country discovered 2000 sick poultry in Long An
province, nearly 1000 in Soc Trang province, 150 in Tien Giang province,
and a small number of fowl in Ben Tre province.
Out of the flock in Soc Trang, 500 have already died he said, noting that
some samples taken from affected poultry have tested positive for the virus
strain H5. The National Anti-Bird Flu Steering Committee will hold a
meeting and a press briefing on Monday [18 Oct 2004] to announce new
measures to deal with bird flu outbreaks, he noted.
The newspaper, in a separate story, said that the number of affected
poultry in Tien Giang rose to around 3000 in the period, not 150 as stated
by Anh. Chickens died in mass in 2 farms in the province's My Tho city,
resulting in the forced culling of some 3000 birds.
On 10 Oct 2004, chickens from a 2000-head flock on a farm owned by Nguyen
Thanh Hai, in the city's rural area, started dying, and the same thing
happened to a 1000-head flock owned by Pham Van Tam, said the story.
Veterinary cadres are inspecting all flocks in the city in an effort to
detect poultry deaths which may be concealed by raisers.
In a press briefing held last month [September 2004], Anh said that, after
having reappeared in 11 southern provinces and cities since June 2004, bird
flu [was] no longer [active] there, and that the reappearance of bird flu
had either killed or led to the forced culling of over 44 000 poultry,
mainly chickens and quail.
Viet Nam, which is beefing up anti-bird flu measures, such as disinfecting
farms, monitoring the transport and import of fowl and their eggs, and
raising public awareness of the disease, hopes to completely eradicate bird
flu viruses, the H5N1 strain in particular, within the next 5 or 6 years.
[If indeed "years" is the expression used, then this is a rather
pessimistic scenario -- although, unfortunately, more realistic than the
declared freedom of the disease, announced by the Vietnamese authorities in
March 2004. - Mod.AS].
In late March 2004, the country declared an end to the bird flu that had
killed 17 percent of its poultry population and claimed 16 human lives
since its previous outbreak last December [2003]. A total of 43.2 million
fowl nationwide either died or were culled, causing direct losses of 1.3
trillion Vietnamese dong (USD 82.8 million) to the local poultry industry.

[When Viet Nam prematurely announced the completed eradication of avian
influenza, at the end of March 2004, ProMED-mail remarked: "The main
concern is that political decisions, such as the one currently underway in
Viet Nam, might negatively affect professional, science-based attitudes --
with special reference to the highly needed, but politically unpopular,
early reporting of possible new cases". Most unfortunately, the said
statement can be repeated at present.
In view of the confusion reflected in the above postings, providing the OIE
with an official update on the precise locations and epidemiological data
concerning the recent HPAI outbreaks in Viet Nam will be an appropriate
step. - Mod.AS]
