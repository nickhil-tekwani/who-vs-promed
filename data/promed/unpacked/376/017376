[Final count: 11 cases, including 4 deaths
Authorities have contained the outbreak of an endemic viral disease called
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in Kinta [Perak, which has claimed four lives
over the last two months.
No new cases have been reported this month and based on this the Health
Ministry decided to declare that the outbreak was over, said the minister
Datuk Chua Jui Meng. The ministry had not received any further report of JE
cases since 30 Nov 1998 or over the past fortnight, he said.
"The disease has an incubation period of five to 15 days, and once the
incubation period ended and no new cases are reported, the [outbreak is
considered to be over," he said.
Despite declaring the outbreak was over, Chua had directed the Perak Health
Department to continuously monitor the situation and enforce regulations on
cleanliness and hygiene especially in pig farms in Tambun, Ampang and Ulu
Piah. Since the outbreak in the three areas last October and November, 11
JE cases were confirmed.
The disease is spread from animals such as horses and pigs to humans
through the culex mosquito which breeds in dirty and stagnant pools.
Chua said viral encephalitis, an endemic disease in the Asian region,
occurs sporadically in Malaysia but the current case was unusual since a
large number of people were affected at one locality.
He said the government would continue giving free vaccination to residents
in the affected areas and the ministry had sent a back-up medical team from
Kuala Lumpur. This was to ensure that all the 6,864 people identified as
the high risk group were vaccinated simultaneously rather than in stages,
since so far only 2,442 had been given the jabs. Those in the high risk
group are pig farm workers and residents in areas within a two kilometre
radius from the pig farms.
"More than 10,400 houses and 189 pig farms have been fogged following the
outbreak, 5,123 people were given talks on the disease and 3,742 pamphlets
distributed," he said.
Chua was also asked whether the ministry would penalise doctors under the
Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 for not reporting
the JE outbreak. Initial feedback to the ministry showed that there was a
communication breakdown between the Ipoh City Council and the state Health
Department. He said doctors handling the case had in fact reported the
outbreak to the Ipoh City Council health authority but this was not
conveyed to the Perak Health Department. Chua directed all medical
practitioners to directly inform the department of any confirmed disease
outbreak for preventive steps to be taken immediately.
He said he had asked the Veterinary Research Institute here to come up with
a cheaper local vaccine especially to protect pigs against the encephalitis
virus. The vaccine currently used is imported from Japan costing RM12 for
two doses per pig. Chua said pig farm owners had complained that this was
very costly.
