WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was cited as announcing
today that imports of raspberries from Guatemala for 1998 have been blocked
after outbreaks of food-borne illness were linked to the imported fruit
during the past two seasons.
Robert Lake, director of policy for the FDA's center for food safety, was
quoted as saying, "We've taken the extraordinary step of informing the
Guatemala government that raspberries will not be accepted from this
country until this problem is solved."
Lake was cited as saying at a day-long FDA meeting on food-safety issues
that the ban becomes effective March 15 and continues through August 15,
the normal Guatemala raspberry exporting season.
Roberto Rosenberg of the Guatemala embassy in Washington was cited as
saying that the nation had voluntarily halted exports of raspberries in May
following an outbreak of the cyclospora disease among U.S. consumers last
spring, adding, "We are still cooperating with the FDA to see how things
are going to work next year."
The story adds that more than 1,300 cases of cyclospora infection were
reported in 1997 to the federal Centers for Disease Control and most were
linked to Guatemalan raspberries.
