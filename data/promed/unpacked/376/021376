Meningitis has claimed 102 lives in Chad since the beginning of the
year, Health Minister Ngombaye Djaibe said on Tuesday [14 Apr 2009],
warning that the outbreak had reached epidemic proportions. "We're
declaring a meningitis outbreak in Chad," he told a press conference.
"At present, the cumulative number of cases is 871 (since 1 Jan
2009), of whom 102 have died, giving a mortality rate of 11.7
percent."

The health minister of the poor, mainly arid central African nation
said that medical workers had managed to identify different strains
of meningitis, including "W 135, a strain held to be very virulent".

The infectious disease causes inflammation of the tissues surrounding
the brain or spinal cord, with symptoms including fever, nausea,
strong headaches and a stiff neck. In its most severe bacterial form,
it can lead to a coma and death.

Meningitis is widespread in west and central Africa, though it can be
prevented by vaccination campaigns. In 2005-2006, more than 100
people died in an epidemic in Chad, but had been relatively spared
until this latest outbreak.

[Meningitis due to the _Neisseria meningitidis_ occurs sporadically
or as epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, which is known as the
"Meningitis Belt," an area that stretches from Senegal in the west to
Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east and that includes Chad
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>). Numerous
cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in this region of
Africa each year during the dry season, between December and June,
and every 6-12 years a large outbreak occurs
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>).

There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on
the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease
due serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common. All serogroup
polysaccharides but B, are immunogenic in humans.

From a prior ProMED-mail post (archive number 20071207.3954): To
control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the
appropriate vaccine, depending availability, in every involved
district in an attempt to induce herd immunity (whereby transmission
is blocked when a critical percentage of the population have been
vaccinated
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).

There are several different types of meningococcal vaccines.
Polysaccharide vaccines, which have been available for more than 30
years, exist against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various
combinations (such as, a bivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a
tetravalent ACYW-135 polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent
conjugate vaccine against serogroup C and a tetravalent against
serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135. The conjugate vaccines are immunogenic
for children under 2 years of age, whereas polysaccharide vaccines
are not. All these vaccines have been proven safe and effective with
infrequent and mild side effects. For both the meningococcal
conjugate and the polysaccharide vaccines, approximately 7-10 days
are required following vaccination for development of protective
levels of anti-meningococcal antibodies.

During the 1st 10 weeks of the 2006 meningitis season, outbreaks in
eastern Africa were mainly caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_
serogroup W-135, whereas in West Africa the outbreak was due to
mainly serogroup A.
