Panic and anxiety have prevailed in the village of Algiaa -- a western rural area of Dayr az Zawr [governorate] -- after the death of a child previously diagnosed as [having contracted] rabies after being bitten by a rabid dog. One of his relatives became infected as well amid the severe shortage of medicines and appropriate vaccines in the whole western rural area of Dayr az Zawr.

[Dayr az Zawr is one of the 14 governorates of Syria, situated on its eastern region, bordering Iraq; map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor_Governorate.

The described case must represent a much larger number of actual cases in Syria; since 2009, an upsurge of rabies has been reported from north eastern Israel on the border with Syria, in spite of the oral vaccination of wildlife applied within Israel's borders. This has been found to be caused by the penetration of rabid stray dogs from Syria, infecting local pets (if unvaccinated) and susceptible domestic ungulates, particularly cattle, with the canine virus. Several cases involved wolves.

Most if not all of the cases on the northern frontier, with Syria and Lebanon, are caused by a rabies strain new to the country, designated V7. The importance of this strain is that dogs can both serve as a reservoir and also transmit the disease. This is in contrast to the fox strain (V1-V4), which was the major reservoir strain before introduction of the oral vaccination. The genetic strain V7 is genetically closely related to isolates obtained in 2007 in Turkey, where dogs are considered a reservoir of rabies. For more details, see archived post 20140103.2150545 and the following reference: David D and Yakobson B. Dogs serve as a reservoir and transmit rabies in Israel. Is history repeating itself? Israel Journal of Veterinary Medicine 2011; 66(1): 3-8; available at http://www.isrvma.org/UserFiles/vet_eng_lowRes.pdf.

It may be assumed that the said strain is widely circulating in Syria, as well as in Lebanon (see maps in the above reference).

Update of the rabies situation in Syria and Lebanon would be useful, though the political situation, particularly in Syria, may be an obstacle. - Mod.AS
