Samples taken from the Isiro area of Province Orientale have been sent to
South Africa to test for [evidence of the presence of haemorrhagic fever
[viruses, a WHO official told IRIN on Friday. A WHO team was sent from
Kampala to Isiro on Thursday for a one-day investigation after one man in
the town was reported to have died of haemorrhagic fever on 29 August. Six
other cases of suspected haemorrhagic fever were reported in Durba between
8-22 August, of whom four have died, humanitarian sources told IRIN this
week. The laboratory results on the Isiro samples are expected on Monday,
the WHO official said.
>From late 1998 to May, a haemorrhagic fever outbreak [caused by Marburg
virus in the Durba and Watsa areas of the province had affected about 90
people, of whom 60 died.

[In DRC Monthly Humanitarian Bulletin, 15 Jun - 15 Jul 1999 it was stated
that "In comparison to May and especially June 1999, the epidemiological
situation somewhat stabilised during the reporting period. With some degree
of certainty the outbreak of Marburg (haemorrhaged fever) in Orientale
province can be declared over." We shall see. This would be a rare
opportunity for research into the source and natural history of Marburg
virus, if not for the unsettled political situation in D.R. Congo. - Mod.CHC
