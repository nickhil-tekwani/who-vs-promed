Victoria's Health Department is investigating whether Murray Valley
encephalitis (MVE) [virus infection] as a possible cause of the death
of a man from north west Victoria. The man died in a Melbourne
hospital this week and the Health Department says his case is still
being investigated.

MVE [virus infection] is an inflammation of the brain; [the virus] is
transmitted by mosquito bite. It can lead to convulsions, coma, and
even death.

There has not been a case of MVE in Victoria since 1974. However it
has been detected in sentinel chickens last month at Mildura,
Robinvale, Kerang, Barmah, and Tooleybuc [see ProMED-mail archive
number 20110223.0595]. The member of parliament for Mildura, Peter
Crisp, says it is a warning for people in areas where mosquito numbers
are high. "Not everybody who does show positive to the virus will have
symptoms, and of course not everybody who has the symptoms will have
them serious," he said. "However it is a cautionary warning for
everybody that we need to be careful. We know it's out there and it's
something we all have to be aware of."

And tests are expected to confirm this week whether or not the virus
caused the death of a horse at Cohuna, in the state's north west. Vet
Paul Clavin says if laboratory tests confirm his diagnosis, it will be
the 1st case of MVE he has treated in his 23 years of practice.

Mosquitoborne Murray Valley encephalitis [virus infection] has been
found in horses in South Australia's Riverland. It comes following
similar findings and the death of a horse, in north west Victoria.

Veterinarian Dr John Hammond says 3 horses in the Riverland have been
diagnosed, and Primary Industries and Resources SA is investigating
the matter. "We've had horses that seem to have classic Ross River
Virus symptoms, with swollen joints and a bit of a fever and very
stiff and sore," he said. "We've had some horses that have had
neurological symptoms. They've been weak and wobbly and have had some
trouble walking."

[The previous report of suspected MVE virus infections in horses (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20110311.0784) has now been confirmed and
there is a current suspected human case under investigation. The most
recent human cases of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) in humans in
Australia have occurred in the Western state and Northern Territories
in 2009, far distant from Victoria state. The active sentinel chicken
surveillance effort for detection of MVE virus transmission has
provided an early warning alert in Victoria after a 37 year absence of
human cases.

Recent heavy rains and flooding in Victoria, especially along the
Murray River have doubtless created a significant increase in mosquito
breeding habitats. MVE virus is transmitted by the common banded
mosquito (_Culex annulirostris_), which bites after sundown in the 1st
2 hours of the night. It is found throughout Australia. Avoidance of
mosquito bites it the only practical measure for prevention of MVE
virus infection. There is no commercially available vaccine.

An image of the common banded mosquito, the vector of MVE virus can
be viewed at the CSIRO (Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation) website at
<http://www.ento.csiro.au/aicn/name_c/a_938.htm>.

As Mod.CP pointed out in ProMED-mail archive number 20100417.1251,
MVE virus is considered to be close to Alfuy virus (together forming
the Murray Valley encephalitis virus species). Both species are
members of the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses.
