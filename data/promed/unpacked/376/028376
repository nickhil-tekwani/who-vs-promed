Analyses performed by the National Veterinary Institute show that 4
more bovine animals in the province of Halland have been infected by
the livestock disease bluetongue. The animals belong to the same
owner as the animals that were confirmed to be infected last weekend.
The Board of Agriculture has decided to expand the blocked-off area
(the so-called 20-km area) as a result of the new cases, but the
restricted area remains unchanged.

It has been confirmed that a total number of 6 bovine animals in the
province of Halland have bluetongue. Due to the 4 new cases, the
blocked-off area with a radius of 20 km that the Board of Agriculture
introduced last weekend will be expanded. The new animals have been
kept at a pasture some distance away from the farm. Efforts to track
the disease will intensify around this pasture, and other ruminants
in that area will be tested and vaccinated as soon as possible. At
the moment, the Board of Agriculture has many veterinarian teams at
the site to carry out this work.
