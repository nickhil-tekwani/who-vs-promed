The Ministry of Health [MINSA, according to its Spanish initials] exhorted all citizens to take prevention and control measures because of the increase in the number of cases of acute conjunctivitis in Colon province, especially in Chagres and Colon districts.

According to the institution, the 1st cases were reported on [3 Jul 2017], and to date 36 cases have been diagnosed in persons of both sexes between 2 and 67 years old.

Amongst personal hygiene measures, MINSA recommends frequent hand washing with water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and not sharing make up, contact lenses, or eye glasses.

Should symptoms occur, MINSA recommends affected persons to go to a healthcare facility, not to self-medicate; and, in the case of children, do not send them to school.

Symptoms of conjunctivitis include sudden reddening and inflammation of the white part of the eyes or the inner aspect of the eyelids, increased tear production, eye secretion that may be transparent, yellow, white, or green, rheum on the eyelids or upon the eyelashes, eye pruritus, irritation or burning sensation, greater sensitivity to light, and feeling like there is 'sand in the eyes'.

MINSA also reminded that the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) recently published an updated document on conjunctivitis in the Americas, reporting outbreaks in many countries, including the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, and Brazil.

[The PAHO epidemiological update mentioned above is dated 16 Jun 2017 and is available at http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=40576. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as "red" or "pink" eye, and is the indication of inflammation generally accompanied by discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water).

A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A mucopurulent or purulent discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea.

As mentioned in the report above, there has been an increase in the number of conjunctivitis cases in Colon province of Panama, but the specific clinical features or diagnostic data are unavailable, so inference to the cause is difficult. - Mod.UBA
