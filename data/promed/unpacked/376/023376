A New Tomato yellow leaf curl virus Strain in Southern Spain.
G. Morilla, C. Ant√∫nez, and E. R. Bejarano, Departamento de Genetica
Universidad de Malaga, 29071 Malaga, Spain; and D. Janssen and I. M.
Cuadrado, CIFH "La Mojonera" El Ejido, Almeria, Spain. Plant Dis. 87:1004,
2003; published on-line as D-2003-0611-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication
19 May 2003.
Tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) has affected tomato crops annually
in southern Spain since 1992, when Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus
(TYLCSV-ES) was first described. In 1997, the presence of a different
begomovirus species (TYLCV-[ES7297]) was reported in common bean
(_Phaseolus vulgaris_). In 1999, TYLCV-[ES7297] was found in pepper
(_Capsicum annuum_) (2).
In September 2002, we observed tomato plants of TYLCD tolerant tomato
cultivars (Kampala and Tiway) showing strong TYLCD symptoms (shortened
internodes, curling of leaflet margins, and leaf blade reduction).
Samples from 90 of these plants were collected from greenhouses located in
the Province of Murcia and analyzed by Southern blot using the intergenic
region of TYLCSV-ES[2] and TYLCV-[ES7297] as specific probes. Positive
signals were obtained for TYLCV-[ES7297] and TYLCSV-ES[2] in 88 and 23 of
the plants, respectively.
Samples from 8 TYLCV single-infected plants (4 'Kampala' and 4 'Tiway')
were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers
(OTYA7:GCTCCCTGAATGTTCGGATGG A and OTYA8: ATCATGGATTTACGCACAGGGG) designed
to amplify a 1.9-kb fragment of any isolate of TYLCV/TYLCSV.
Subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the
amplification products yielded a restriction pattern different from that
obtained for TYLCV-[ES7297]. Fragments from the 8 samples were sequenced
and showed 97.9 percent identity to a TYLCV strain previously reported in
Israel (X15656) (1) and only 92.7 percent identify with TYLCV-[ES7297].
To our knowledge, this is the first report that this strain of TYLCV has
been detected in Spain.

[TYLCV-infected tomato plants grow slowly and are stunted and dwarfed.
Leaves are greatly thickened and leathery. Yield losses are extreme because
fruit production is drastically reduced and the fruit that is produced is
usually not marketable. The virus is present in most tropical production
areas worldwide. A concerted effort is being made to locate sources of
tolerance/resistance to TYLCV; _L. cheesmanii_ ssp. minor, _L. hirsutum_,
_L. peruvianum_, and _L. pimpinellifolium_ are being assessed. The
replication-associated protein (Rep) from TYLCV-Sardinia is being evaluated
in transgenic tomatoes transformed with Rep. Hopefully these measures will
result in tomato selections that are tolerant to virus infection and also
able to sustain good yields.
