It emerged yesterday [8 Sep 2008], hundreds of British holidaymakers
may have been struck down with salmonellosis. Some have already been
diagnosed with the potential serious infection after returning from a
hotel complex in Turkey. These numbers are expected to rise. The
tourists affected were staying at the Holiday Village Turkey in the
resort of Sarigerme. They suffered sickness and diarrhea and some
were so ill they had to be taken to hospital for treatment.

It has been stated that, "From all reports coming out of the resort,
we expect the number of cases to rise significantly over the next few
days. Estimates put the figure of those affected at well over 1000.
Anyone returning to the UK from Sarigerme who has been ill should see
their doctor immediately."

Last night [8 Sep 2008], a spokeswoman for travel agency involved
said "a very small proportion" of guests at the resort reported being
ill and were being treated for an "airborne virus." She added, "We
are taking every precaution possible to safeguard the health and well
being of our guests."
