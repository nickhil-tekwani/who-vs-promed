Fatal Disease Claims 150 Lives in Afghanistan
A fatal disease called cirrhosis has claimed more than 150 lives in
Afghanistan's Herat province, a U.N. spokesperson said here Sunday.
Stephanie Bunker said that the disease has erupted in Gulrang district of
Herat province claiming 150 to 200 lives. A number of people, she said, are
still suffering from it.
The basic cause of the disease, she said, is a poisonous plant that grows
along with the wheat crop. When the people use the wheat bread, they suffer
from the disease.
Bunker said that the U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations
recently held a meeting in Herat province to evolve a strategy for coping
with the situation.
After the meeting, a joint team of the World Health Organization (WHO),
Public Health Department and Agricultural Department of the Taliban
authorities and U.N. Foods and Agricultural Wing visited Gulrang district
and examined the situation in 11 villages.
Bunker said that the United Nations with the cooperation of the Taliban
authorities have now dispatched medical supplies to the disease-hit area in
Herat province.
The disease had for the first time erupted in Gulrang district some 25
years ago and now it has broken out for the second time this year.

[The following publication refers to an outbreak that occurred about 25
years earlier.
Tandon HD; Tandon BN; Mattocks AR, An epidemic of veno-occlusive disease of
the liver in Afghanistan. Pathologic features., Am J Gastroenterol 1978
Dec;70(6):607-13
(Edited abstract) In that outbreak there were approximately 7,800 cases out
of a population of 35,000 estimated to have been affected (?exposed). The
outbreak was due to consumption of wheat flour that was heavily
contaminated with seeds of a plant of the heliotropium species. The seeds
were found to contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, chiefly heliotrine.
Morphological changes in the liver found on percutaneous liver biopsies and
postmortem specimens included centrilobular hemorrhagic necrosis followed
by occlusive changes in the hepatic veins, with resultant nonportal
cirrhosis. According to the authors, the changes noted suggested primary
parenchymal injury and possibly obstructive lesions at the sinusoidal
level. - MPP
