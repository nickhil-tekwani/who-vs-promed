Anthrax Alarm Uncovers Response Flaws
-------------------------------------
Pentagon Procedures Baffled Other Agencies, Delaying Health Officials
The anthrax scare at the Pentagon this week exposed gaps between the
military's procedures in handling biohazards and the rest of the
federal government's that could have increased the threat to public
health had the deadly bacteria actually been present, health experts
and federal and Virginia officials said Wednesday.
Health officials inside government and out said the Pentagon's
reliance on detection and response systems that are isolated from
those at other federal agencies delayed Virginia health officials,
the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in moving to protect the public from a possible biohazard
in the mail.
"The takeaway for me is, the government hasn't learned too many
lessons from the last few years," said Scott Becker, executive
director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. "The
Department of Defense appears to be developing their own detection
systems. ... The linkages to public health just didn't seem to be
there. Clearly, things broke down."
In the muddle, local hazardous materials teams were confused by
sensor equipment that differed from equipment used by the Postal
Service and Department of Homeland Security, said Robert Stroube,
Virginia's health commissioner. [Also] State and federal officials
responsible for deciding public health actions said scientists had
trouble interpreting the findings from a Pentagon contract lab, which
is not part of the CDC's national network of labs that respond to
bioterror.
Local officials, meanwhile, including the top elected officeholders
in Fairfax County and Washington D.C., along with key members of
Congress, called Wednesday for a summit to discuss the federal
response. They said they were kept out of the loop during Monday's
anthrax scare at the Pentagon and a subsequent biohazard alarm at a
Defense Department office complex in the Baileys Crossroads section
of Fairfax.
Now that anthrax tests have come back negative and the buildings are
beginning to reopen, several officials also are concerned about the
differing testing guidelines.
Since the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Postal Service has spent $1.4
billion to install a biohazard detection system at 283 mail
facilities; the federal government has spent $370 million to boost
state and local public health labs, the backbone of the CDC's 140
bioterror Laboratory Response Network; and Homeland Security has
launched a $60 million-plus BioWatch system to monitor air in more
than 30 U.S. cities. All rely on the same CDC protocols.
But the Defense Department has not signed a federal memorandum of
understanding that standardizes alerts, terminology, data sharing and
response when biohazard systems at military sites within the United
States are triggered, a senior federal health official said. The
Pentagon is spending $1 billion on a 5-year program to develop
biohazard warning systems and procedures at 185 U.S. and 15 overseas
bases.
"Why are they using a private facility to do environmental testing
when we have invested billions of dollars to enhance public health
and defense facilities to deal with 21st-century public health
threats?" said George Foresman, homeland security adviser to Virginia
Gov. Mark Warner.
The BioWatch system has gone 2 years without a false positive. The
Postal Service's system has reviewed 500 000 samples without a false
positive.
Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood defended the department's actions
while acknowledging that "we're looking at all those issues. The
contractor laboratory has worked well. We have protocols in place. .
. . Until we get all the information, I could not go beyond that,"
Flood said.
The Postal Service reopened its main government mail processing
center at V Street NE at noon yesterday [16 Mar 2005] [and advised
about 200 employees that they could stop taking antibiotics]. Last
night, Pentagon officials awaited more lab results from the
Pentagon's Remote Delivery Facility and the Baileys Crossroads office
complex.
The Pentagon expected to reopen its intake facility today. The
Fairfax buildings will reopen today except for a suite in one of the
towers, where more testing will be done, Homeland Security officials
said.
The events began last Thursday when one of 4 swab samples taken daily
from sensor filters at the Pentagon delivery facility tested positive
for anthrax at Commonwealth Biotechnologies Inc. in Richmond, a
Pentagon subcontractor. The finding was confirmed by a highly
accurate polymerase chain reaction test and forwarded Friday to the
prime contractor, said Robert B. Harris, president of the Richmond
lab.
Pentagon officials say they were notified Monday morning of the
finding. That afternoon -- apparently by coincidence, military
officials said -- a machine on the 8th floor of the Fairfax complex
that receives mail from the Pentagon sounded an airborne biohazard
alarm.
Military officials said that although Army scientists at Fort Detrick
confirmed the initial positive finding, quality control problems at
the lab probably spoiled the sample.
"We stand by our results, and the work is ongoing," said Harris,
whose company has processed 2000 samples from the Pentagon over 2
years. "To say the way the release was made was premature,
unfortunate and unwarranted is an understatement."
A federal health official familiar with Pentagon operations said its
lab practices vary from those of civilian agencies, complicating the
interpretation of scientific data.

[ProMED members will have already noted the delay ... "last Thursday
when one of 4 swab samples ... facility tested positive for anthrax
at Commonwealth Biotechnologies Inc. in Richmond. ... The finding was
confirmed by a highly accurate polymerase chain reaction test and
forwarded Friday to the prime contractor. ... Pentagon officials ..
were notified Monday morning." What if it had been a public holiday
Monday? Or had involved the dispersal of a '2001' product. The mind
boggles.
Also it is clear that valid questions can be asked regarding the
comparative sensitivities and specificities of the 2 -- military and
CDC -- testing systems in place, and their track records since
installation.
In reference to Robert Harris's somewhat obscure comment about the
"release ... was premature" I don't think he was referring to a
premature release of this contaminant but to the news release. The
problem was, I am told, that the local news people in Fairfax were
notified by someone on seeing the Hazmat team going into the facility
there -- hard to miss these guys in their full gear -- and started
asking questions. DOD responded with a press report. - Mod.MHJ]
