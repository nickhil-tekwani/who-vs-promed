[excerpt:]
... We provide early epidemiological information arising from the ongoing investigation of this outbreak.

Methods
---------
We classified cases as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministère de la Santé Publique. We investigated all cases to obtain demographic characteristics, determine possible exposures, describe signs and symptoms, and identify contacts to be followed up for 21 days. We also estimated the reproduction number and projected number of cases for the 4-week period from 25 May - 21 Jun 2018.
...
The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Early detection, rapid patient isolation, contact tracing, and the ongoing vaccination programme should sufficiently control the outbreak. The forecast of the number of cases does not exceed the current capacity to respond if the epidemiological situation does not change. The information presented, although preliminary, has been essential in guiding the ongoing investigation and response to this outbreak. ...

At present, the source of the outbreak is unknown. Investigations are ongoing, but one hypothesis is that this outbreak is linked to a cluster of 15 cases of febrile illness in Ingende and Bikoro health zones in February 2018. Of those 15 people, 11 had haemorrhagic signs, of whom 8 died. According to the investigation report, the 1st person died on 20 Dec 2017. The cause of that cluster has not been confirmed. Although a link between the 2 clusters cannot be ruled out, the long period of time between these 2 events without identified chains of transmission calls into question whether they were causally linked. However, there are epidemiological links between the ongoing clusters in the different locations, which underscores the potential for geographical spread, even in remote areas.

Forward projections suggest that if interventions remain as effective as they were between 30 Apr and 24 May 2018, an estimated twice as many cases would occur by 21 Jun 2018. Even in this pessimistic scenario, the current isolation capacity available in the affected communities would be sufficient. Nonetheless, considering that a period of 42 days after the last potential exposure is required before the outbreak can be considered to be over, the ongoing occurrence of cases would mean that the response will need to continue for at least the next 3 months or more. Furthermore, it is not possible to rule out further expansion of the outbreak if there is exportation of cases to new areas, or if there are ongoing but hitherto unrecognised chains of transmission. It is also possible that a new chain of transmission could occur after sexual transmission of the virus from a male survivor, if appropriate services and counselling are not provided, requiring an even longer response.

As for all outbreak investigations, some data are collected retrospectively, and some data are incomplete. Data about signs and symptoms for some patients were collected retrospectively from medical records, which might have resulted in errors or missing data. Detailed information about chains of transmission is being compiled by field investigation teams and is not yet available. The dynamic nature of outbreaks and response means that case numbers and the analysis presented will be revised as additional information becomes available.

A major sustained response is, therefore, needed to ensure ongoing case identification, isolation, contact tracing, and other control measures. Implementation of WHO's Early Warning Alert and Response System, a data collection system that uses handheld devices, represents a major improvement for data collection since the 2014-16 West Africa epidemic. However, this information system is not optimally designed for contact tracing. Collecting, managing, and analysing epidemiological data in real time continues to be a substantial challenge in the field. Nonetheless, our analysis presented shows that real time data collection and epidemiological analysis for the control of complex Ebola virus disease outbreaks is achievable.

The epidemiology of the current Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar features to previous Ebola outbreaks. This similarity suggests that early detection of the outbreak, combined with tried-and-tested interventions such as early isolation and treatment, contact tracing, safe burials, and community engagement, which are currently being implemented, along with the additional benefit of targeted vaccination, should be sufficient to control this outbreak. However, the combination of remote communities and spread to an urban centre that is connected to the capital city and neighbouring countries makes this outbreak the most complex and highest risk ever experienced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

[While this outbreak was, as stated above, the most complex and highest risk ever experienced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the response was well organized, comprehensive, rapid, and carefully executed, even with the inherent difficulties of the situation. This should serve as a model for what are likely to be future outbreaks in the region not only of Ebola, but of other infectious diseases. - Mod.LK

Democratic Republic of the Congo - Ebola outbreak (DG ECHO, WHO, DRC Ministry of Health, media) EUCPM activation
------------------------------

- The Ebola outbreak, which was declared on 8 May 2018, is not yet over but has been "largely contained" according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The organization views the situation with "cautious optimism." The last confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was reported on 6 Jun 2018. The incubation period of the Ebola virus is 21 days. The end of the outbreak will be declared once 42 days have passed without a new Ebola case.

- The epidemiological situation on 28 Jun 2018 was as follows: In total, 56 reported cases with 38 confirmed EVD cases, 15 probable cases and 3 suspected ones. 29 people died. All remaining contacts and contacts-of-contacts of EVD patients have been followed up.

- This 9th outbreak of Ebola in the DRC since the virus was discovered there in 1976 has been "the most challenging and complex outbreak the country has ever had to face, mainly because it started in 2 rural zones at the same time and quickly reached a city of more than one million inhabitants directly connected to Kinshasa," said the Congolese Minister of Health.

- Ring vaccination with an experimental vaccine was a new element in the response and used for the very 1st time. It is seen as a paradigm shift for Ebola control. "The use of vaccination in this Ebola response has been a game-changer, as it allowed us to break the chain of transmission and contain the virus more quickly," said Dr. Kalenga. In total, 3330 persons -- health workers and contacts -- were vaccinated.

- That the outbreak has not turned into an enormous epidemic has only been possible thanks to the rapid and robust response and the collective intervention by national authorities, WHO and other international organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). WHO's response plan required USD 57 million and was quickly funded.

- The European Union has mobilised all EU emergency response instruments, including humanitarian aid worth EUR 3.43 million [USD 4 million] (plus individual EU Member States' contributions), logistical support through the Commission's humanitarian air service called "ECHO Flight," and the activation of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) at the request of WHO, which allowed for the deployment of medical personnel and equipment. As EU Ebola Coordinator, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, continues to follow the situation closely until it is safe to say the outbreak is over.

The National Centre for Disease Control denied on Sat [30 Jun 2018] the registration of any cases of Ebola disease at Sabha Medical Center. On its Facebook page, the Centre explained that the management of Sabha Medical Centre has an electronic system for early warning of communicable diseases, denying the news about recording any Ebola cases in Sabha.

The Centre for Disease Control also explained that it is issuing a weekly epidemiological bulletin to inform specialists and analyse the epidemiological situation of communicable diseases in the country and confirm the diagnosis of all communicable diseases detected in the World Health Organization's Reference Laboratory for Community Health.

Several social networking sites have reported recently the registration of cases of Ebola disease in the city of Sabha.

[Sabha is on a migration route from sub-Saharan countries. Sabha is an oasis city in southwestern Libya, approximately 640 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli. It was historically the capital of the Fezzan region and the Military Territory of Fezzan-Ghadames and is now capital of the Sabha District. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabha,_Libya). - Rapporteur Mary Marshall]

[Any information on these possible cases of Ebola is welcome. How many cases have been reported? How is the situation being monitored? Who is participating in the investigation, and what tests are being done to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of the possible cases? - Mod.LK
