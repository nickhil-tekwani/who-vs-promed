LISTERIOSIS - USA: (MASSACHUSETTS), UPDATE

Investigators probing the source of a listeria outbreak said Thursday
[17 Jan 2008] the strain that killed 3 people was found at a dairy
processing plant in central Massachusetts. But officials have not yet
determined exactly where the milk was contaminated.

"We know that there's a problem in that plant and we have connected
the patients to the products to the plant, now it would be nice to
know exactly how that happened, but that is part of the ongoing
investigation," said Dr Alfred DeMaria, state director of
communicable disease control.

Since June [2007], 3 elderly men have died after drinking
bacteria-contaminated milk from the Whittier Farms plant in
Shrewsbury, about 35 miles (56.3 km) west of Boston. The same strain
of listeria sickened a pregnant woman, who then miscarried. A 2nd
woman also was sickened after drinking milk from the plant. No new
cases have been identified and health officials say the public health
risk is low.

The deadly strain was found in 7 bottles and on the floor near the
homogenizer at the Shrewsbury plant. Different listeria strains were
found inside 4 other bottles of milk and at 3 different areas inside
the plant -- in a drain, in a bottle washer, and in an empty unwashed
bottle. More than 100 samples were taken.

It remains unclear how the milk was contaminated, but one theory is
that processing equipment may have unintentionally been contaminated
during cleaning, state officials said. The processing plant, which
distributes milk under various brand names to homes and stores across
central Massachusetts and also operates a 500-acre (202 hectares)
farm in the town of Sutton, has been closed since December [2007]. It
will remain closed during the investigation and until the bacteria is
eradicated, officials said. A call to Whittier Farms on Thursday [17
Jan 2008] was not immediately returned.

Listeriosis is a kind of food poisoning that can be dangerous to the
elderly, newborns, pregnant women, and people with chronic medical
conditions. Symptoms include fever, headache, stiffness, nausea,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

[This continues to be an ongoing epidemiologic investigation
previously reported in ProMED-mail 20071230.4186. The source of the
contamination of milk has still not been defined, although it is
apparent that several strains of listeria have contaminated the plant
and one of the strains is linked to the patients with listeriosis. In
addition, there now seems to be an additional patient linked to the
outbreak since the last posting, a woman whose comorbidities are not
stated. A surviving pregnant woman, who miscarried, was previously
reported. All 3 elderly men who were previously reported have now
died of listeriosis. We await any further findings.
