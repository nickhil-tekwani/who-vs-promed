Pediatric Hospitalizations Associated with 2009 Pandemic Influenza A
(H1N1) in Argentina
-----------------------------------------
Abstract of NEJM article by: Romina Libster and others.

Background: While the Northern Hemisphere experiences the effects of
the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, data from the
recent influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere can provide
important information on the burden of disease in children.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series involving children
with acute infection of the lower respiratory tract or fever in whom
2009 H1N1 influenza was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase
polymerase-chain-reaction assay and who were admitted to one of 6
pediatric hospitals serving a catchment area of 1.2 million children.
We compared rates of admission and death with those among age-matched
children who had been infected with seasonal influenza strains in
previous years.

Results: Between May and July 2009, a total of 251 children were
hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza. Rates of hospitalization were
double those for seasonal influenza in 2008. Of the children who were
hospitalized, 47 (19 percent) were admitted to an intensive care unit
(ICU), 42 (17 percent) required mechanical ventilation, and 13 (5
percent) died. The overall rate of death was 1.1 per 100 000
children, as compared with 0.1 per 100 000 children for seasonal
influenza in 2007. (No pediatric deaths associated with seasonal
influenza were reported in 2008.) Most deaths were caused by
refractory hypoxemia in infants under one year of age (death rate,
7.6 per 100 000).

Conclusions: Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza was associated with
pediatric death rates that were 10 times the rates for seasonal
influenza in previous years.

[Some points from the authors' analyses and discussion include the
following: The pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus has spread
rapidly through the Southern Hemisphere. Morbidity and mortality were
particularly high in Argentina, with numbers of confirmed cases and
deaths 2nd only to those in the United States. Previously, seasonal
influenza viruses were associated with a high rate of hospitalization
but low mortality among children. During the pandemic season,
pediatric units in Buenos Aires provided medical care to 1.2 million
children and collectively reported 13 influenza-related deaths.

A preexisting diagnosis of asthma was significantly associated with
the risk of admission to an ICU, whereas patients with
immunosuppression associated with human immunodeficiency virus
infection and those with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy were
less likely to be admitted to an ICU

12 of the children who died had only 2009 H1N1 influenza, and one was
coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus. The median duration of
illness before death was 5 days (range, one to 15). Three children
(23 percent) died within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. The
majority of patients died from refractory hypoxemia (62 percent). No
patients who died had bacteremia; 3 had presumptive or confirmed
bacterial pneumonia (one with sterile empyema). Nine patients (69
percent) had a preexisting illness that was associated with increased
mortality, including a neurologic disorder and chronic lung disease
(including asthma). Of the 13 patients who died, 5 were hospitalized
within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms; none received timely
oseltamivir. The authors conclude that overall pediatric 2009 H1N1
influenza is distinguished by its severity.
