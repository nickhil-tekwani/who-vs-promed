Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Russia
-----------------------------------------------
Follow-up report No. 1
See also: 29 Jul 2005
Information received on 5 Aug 2005 from Dr. Evgueny A. Nepoklonov,
Head of the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture and
Food, Moscow:
End of previous report period: 24 Jul 2005 (see Disease Information,
18 [30], 218, dated 29 Jul 2005).
End of this report period: 5 Aug 2005.
Precise identification of agent: influenza virus type A, subtype
H5N1. An isolate from the village of Suzdalka has been subjected to
an in-depth examination. The preliminary results of sequencing show
that the isolate can be considered highly pathogenic.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 23 Jul 2005.
Date of start of the event: 18 Jul 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Details of outbreaks:
1st administrative division (region): Novosibirsk (Novosibirskaya oblast)
Lower administrative division (district): Kupino
Type of epidemiological unit: village
Name of the location: ...
Species: avi
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Jul 2005
Number of animals in the outbreaks:

Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Jul 2005
Number of animals in the outbreaks:

... / ... / ... / ... / ...
Description of affected populations: chickens, turkeys, ducks and
geese in backyard holdings.
The disease has been reported in a total of 13 villages:
In 5 villages, birds have shown clinical signs of the disease, and
deaths have been reported; birds have tested positive to antibodies
to H5, and the virus has been isolated.
In 4 villages, no deaths have been reported, but birds have tested
positive for antibodies to H5, and the virus has been isolated.
In the remaining 4 villages, no deaths have been reported, nor has
the virus been detected in any of the birds. However, birds have
tested positive to antibodies to H5.
Diagnosis:
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Federal Centre for Animal
Health (ARRIAH)
Number of animals examined: 70
Diagnostic tests used: ELISA(1) for antigen detection
Dates: 23 Jul - 5 Aug 2005
Results: positive
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: All-Russia State Research
Institute for Control, Standardization and Certification of
Veterinary Preparations
Number of animals examined: 5
Diagnostic tests used: PCR(2) (M-protein gene)
Dates: 23 Jul - 5 Aug 2005
Results: positive
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Association for Scientific
Production NPO Vektori
Number of animals examined: 62
Diagnostic tests used: hemagglutination test
Dates: 23 Jul - 5 Aug 2005
Results: positive
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Novosibirsk inter-regional
veterinary laboratory, Federal Governmental University
Number of animals examined: 5324
Diagnostic tests used: ELISA(1) for antibody detection
Dates: 28 Jul 2005
Results: positive
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: the epidemiological
analysis has shown that the disease started in poultry in contact
with wild waterfowl at open water reservoirs. Waterfowl are
considered the primary source of the virus. In addition, there are
reports of the disease in wild birds. Infection of domestic birds in
all the affected localities, some of which are up to 600 km apart,
occurred simultaneously. In all cases, the source of infection was
wild waterfowl in lakes frequented by domestic birds.
Control measures undertaken:
- Stamping out: stamping out of birds suspected of being infected has
begun. In all 3 affected districts, a total of 18 513 domestic birds
of 5 species have been destroyed.
- Quarantine.
- Movement control inside the country.
- Screening: all localities in Novosibirsk region are being screened
for circulation of the virus and presence of seropositive birds.
- Zoning.
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.
Other details/comments:
- No signs of the disease have appeared in commercial poultry farms
in the region. Monitoring of all 14 commercial poultry farms did not
reveal any circulation of the virus or seropositive birds.
- In localities where the infection has resulted in deaths of birds,
mortality since the beginning of the epizootic has not exceeded 3.3
percent.
- The application of control measures has sharply reduced mortality.
There are no longer any deaths accompanied by characteristic clinical
signs among domestic birds, and total daily mortality in the
different localities is only some thousandths of the total flock.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(2) PCR: polymerase chain reaction

[This confirms recent reports that the virus in Russia is an H5N1,
not an H5N2 as previously reported in the media. This sequence of
events confirms the importance of being cautious concerning
conclusions about the types of viruses involved in any outbreak,
particularly prior to having definitive laboratory results. - Mod.PC]
