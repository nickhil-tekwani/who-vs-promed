Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Izumi City 1, Izumi, Kagoshima
Started: 12 Nov 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 38 500 / 23 / 23 / 38477 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on 12 Nov 2021, the local veterinary service (Livestock Hygiene Service Centre; LHSC) in Kagoshima Prefecture received a notification from a domestic laying hen farm on an increase in the number of dead birds. The samples were collected from dead birds by the LHSC and tested positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On [13 Nov 2021], the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. Subsequently stamping out on the affected farm was started. On [14 Nov 2021], stamping out was completed. Other control measures (including disinfection) in the affected farm are being implemented. On [15 Nov 2021], the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1 and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. This is the 2nd subtype of HPAI confirmed in domestic poultry in Japan in the 2021-2022 season after the H5N8 subtype was confirmed on [11 Nov 2021]. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on farms within a radius of 3 km [2 mi] and 3-10 km [2-6 mi] of the affected farm respectively. Note: The date of the last occurrence for the H5N1 subtype in Japan is [25 Mar 2011].

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; traceability; quarantine; screening; stamping out; disinfection; movement control inside the country; ante- and post-mortem inspections
Wild control measures applied: screening

[As mentioned in the epidemiological comments above, this is the 2nd subtype of HPAI confirmed in domestic poultry in Japan in the 2021-2022 season, after the H5N8 subtype was confirmed on 11 Nov 2021.

The current avian influenza season began in October 2021, with several countries in Europe and Asia reporting cases of HPAI, mainly subtype H5N1, which differs from the previous season when the HPAI subtype H5N8 predominated.

Unfortunately, everything seems to indicate that this new season 2021-2022 will be another challenging situation for the poultry sector in the region. Most cases thus far have been associated with the introduction of the HPAI virus from migratory wild birds, who are considered to be the main reservoir of avian influenza viruses. - Mod.CRD
