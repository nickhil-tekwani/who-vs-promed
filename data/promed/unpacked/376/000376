MAF investigates pig disease
----------------------------
Agriculture officials are investigating an apparent disease outbreak after
weaner pigs failed to respond to veterinary treatment, raising the
possibility that it is the nation's first known case of post-weaning
multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).
The incurable disease is specific to weaner pigs aged 6 to 12 weeks and
features a progressive loss of weight and appetite, visibly enlarged lymph
nodes, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, gastric ulcers, and jaundice.
It can vary in severity and virulence, but generally there is a low
incidence of disease in affected herds, and a high death rate among those
pigs which fall sick. Overseas experience shows that the disease might
spread between pig herds through the movement of pigs, and possibly in semen.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's national manager of surveillance
and response, Allen Bryce, said if the disease was confirmed as PMWS, it
would be the 1st time in New Zealand.
"This is a complex disease and confirming the diagnosis is difficult -- it
may be some time before MAF can say conclusively whether PMWS is involved
or not."
Meanwhile, the farm had been declared a "restricted place". A MAF
spokeswoman declined to disclose where the farm was, or even which island
it was on. The issue of which island may be infected is important, because
at present Australia only accepts pork from the South Island -- a legacy of
the outbreak of Aujeszky's disease at a Hawera piggery from 1973, which
spread in the North Island only, before being eradicated in 1997.
Australia is the only other significant pig-farming country that claims to
be free of PMWS. It accepts pork from the South Island, Canada, and
Denmark, but requires the Canadian and Danish pork to be deboned and cooked
on arrival.
In August, after 5 years of research, Biosecurity Australia announced that
it might allow imports of pork from other countries, but said that for
countries that have PMWS, only cooked or cured deboned pig meat would be
permitted, subject to those countries meeting all other requirements.
If PMWS is confirmed in New Zealand, the location of the outbreak, and the
extent to which Biosecurity Australia will accept the concept of a
"disease-free" zone (as it did with Aujeszky's disease), would be important
issues for exporters.
PMWS is associated with several other pig diseases including porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Diagnostic tests have
definitely excluded the presence of PRRSV on the affected farm. Mr Bryce
said the affected piggery was isolated from other piggeries and did not
pose a risk while the investigation was underway. "Management and control
options are being explored as part of the investigation," he said.
PMWS is an emerging viral disease of pigs that is being diagnosed with
increasing frequency in Canada, the United States, Europe, and Asia. A
definite diagnosis is confirmed by post-mortem examination of samples from
pigs showing the characteristic clinical signs.
It is thought that the disease might be spread through the movement of pigs
or possibly semen. Death rates vary between 4 percent and 10 percent, but
farms with post-weaning mortality up to 60 percent have been reported. In
the suspected New Zealand case, the farmer has had death rates of 30
percent among his weaners, though he is thought to have had other health
problems among the animals.
Guidelines from the European Commission to control PMWS are:
1. limit litter-to-litter contact of piglets, both through fostering and
multi-suckling, and indirectly from shared needles, equipment, and mud;
2. reduce animal stress and susceptibility to disease by limiting exposure
to micro-organisms; and,
3. practise good management, hygiene and biosecurity on the farm.

[Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) was initially detected
in 1991 in Canada, while the presence of this disease in Europe was first
noticed in France (Brittany) in 1996. The disease is known to be caused by
Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), a single-stranded circular DNA virus of
pigs. - Mod.AS]
