Outbreak of Meningococcal Disease Due to a Novel Serogroup C Clone
-------------------------------------------------------
Capital Health Authority (CHA) serves a population of 827 500 in Edmonton,
Alberta and surrounding counties. The region has experienced significantly
increased rates of invasive meningococcal infection since Dec 1999
associated with a novel serogroup C clone.
The usual incidence of invasive meningococcal disease in the region is 0.5
to 1.5 /100 000 annually. Between Dec 1999 and Dec 2000 inclusive 49 cases
of invasive meningococcal disease occurred in CHA (47 in 2000). All cases
have been sporadic affecting all parts of the region (although 2 cases in
Dec 2000 attended the same rave-like event). Routine public health
follow-up including contact tracing and prophylactic antibiotics has
occurred with each case. The age groups most affected were 0-4, 15-19 and
20-24 years with rates of 21.6, 27.3 and 10.6 per 100 000 respectively in
2000.
The outbreak was declared in Feb 2000 when the rate in the 15-19 year
group reached 10/100 000 in less than 3 months. A mass immunization
campaign in Edmonton and surrounding counties using quadrivalent vaccine
was undertaken with the cooperation of Alberta Health & Wellness with 168
000 children aged 2 to 19 immunized over a 2-week period in Feb 2000 (an
80% coverage rate).
Cases continued to occur through the spring and summer in all age groups
but primarily in those 19 years or less. Vaccine effectiveness rate was 92%
between Feb and Oct with 2 cases in immunized children and 6 cases in the
population eligible for immunization but unimmunized.
The case occurrence accelerated in the Fall of 2000, resulting in a rate of
10.6/100 000 in the 20-24 year age group. In Oct 2000 quadrivalent vaccine
was again offered to unimmunized 2-19 year olds and the vaccine campaign
was expanded to all 20-24 year olds. A further 60 000 young people were
immunized with resulting in a coverage rate of 87% of 2 to 25 year olds.
The Microbiology & Public Health Laboratory (M&PHL) of Alberta (Edmonton)
identified a novel strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C through
DNA characterization of involved strains by Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphisms using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) as the
causative organism in 92.9 percent (39/42) of the recovered serogroup C
isolates.
PFGE was performed within days of specimen isolation. The lab examined the
previous 4 years of meningococcal isolates in Alberta and did not find a
similar strain. Isolates from other jurisdictions are currently being
tested with no similar isolate being identified to date.
In summary, CHA has experienced an outbreak of meningococcal disease caused
by a new serogroup C clone previously unrecognized in this province. The
demonstration of the disease consequences of a new clone in a community
combined with timely laboratory characterization of different serogroup C
clones may prove to be ground breaking in the future management of
meningococcal disease.

[Our thanks to Dr. Johnson for this very rapid and thorough reply.
According to the original ProMED-mail posting, this outbreak was described
as a community-wide person-to-person outbreak and not institutional-based.
In the USA, living in college dormitories has been associated with higher
risk of disease so that recommendations now include meningococcal
vaccination prior to college entry. One wonders if the 20-24 year old
population affected by this outbreak were students and would have
classified as eligible for vaccination in the USA within the 4 to 5
year protective range of the vaccine. Some questions that remain are: Is
the outbreak still ongoing? and, have other provinces in Canada seen the
introduction of this novel type of Group C meningococcus? - Mod.MPP
