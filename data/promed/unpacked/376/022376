Odisha Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak today [3 Oct 2016] visited the areas where Japanese encephalitis [JE] has claimed at least 27 lives so far and said preventive steps are being taken to contain the disease. The death toll due to Japanese encephalitis increased to 27 with 6 children falling prey to the disease since [Sun 2 Oct 2016], Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) US Mishra said.

The outbreak of [encephalitis] in 21 villages under 6 blocks of [Malkangiri] district was reported last month [September 2016] and affected mostly children. While the deaths have taken place in about 25 days, around 5 patients are now undergoing treatment in a hospital, he said.

Nayak, who visited the district along with Secretary to Health Department, Arti Ahuja, and Secretary to Animal Resources Department, Bishnupad Sethi, said measures required to deal with the situation are being taken.

Since mosquitoes are the vectors for the disease, which spreads from pigs to humans, mostly children, the immediate task is to isolate the animals and relocate the pig farms away from the villages. Necessary steps in this regard are being taken, he said.

While a team of doctors and experts had been sent earlier to the affected areas to take stock of the situation, another expert team was sent there on [Sun 2 Oct 2016]. They would camp there and plan various measures required to deal with the situation, he added.

A team of veterinary doctors are also being sent to the disease affected areas to identity the infected pigs.

Health assistance booths have been opened in the affected areas, while fogging work was intensified to control mosquitoes, official sources said.

Blood samples of pigs are also being sent to laboratory for thorough examination, they added.

[The number of JE fatalities in this area has increased to 27. Health officials indicated that preventive steps are being taken. In this report, the steps appear to be moving pigs away from the village houses. A previous report indicated that vector mosquito control would also be implemented.

Curiously, no mention is made of vaccination, which is the most effective way to prevent cases. Mosquito control, at least temporarily, may be possible (but difficult) but eradication is not possible with current technology. The virus is actively transmitted in this area. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts of JE virus, mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors, and pigs are amplifying hosts.
