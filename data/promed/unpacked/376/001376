The Viral Hemorrhagic Fever laboratory team of Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), normally in charge of VHF diagnostics, was directly responding to the Ebola outbreak in Freetown, Sierra Leone and in Monrovia, Liberia. Therefore, the United States Agency for International Development PREDICT-INRB Laboratory in Kinshasa, DRC, was requested on August 22nd to test samples from Boende in DRC where the occurence of an unknown hemorrhagic fever epidemic was reported. PREDICT-INRB was the first laboratory to make that diagnosis and to confirm the occurence of the 7th Ebola outbreak in DRC. Sequencing was done by GATC Biotech in Germany.

Based on our available data for analyses, the two sequences (553 bp fragments of the L-gene) detected this August in DRC are clearly a strain of Ebola Zaire and do not cluster near the sequences from the current outbreak in West Africa, suggesting that this outbreak is independent from the outbreak in West Africa.

The two sequences (553 bp fragments of L-gene) can be accessed in Genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with the following accession numbers: KM517570, KM517571.

[Our thanks to Prof Tamfum and his team for providing this sequence data and putting them in the public domain. The data appear to confirm that the outbreak in DRC is due to Zaire ebolavirus isolates that are genetically distinct from those appearing in West Africa.

The sequences of the L protein gene fragments can be accessed directly at:

ProMED applauds the release of primary data (such as genome sequences) prior to their publication and believes that such practices are in the best interests of public health.

This is also a success story for the USAID-sponsored PREDICT project, as the virology lab personnel who would normally conduct Ebola diagnostics were all in West Africa, supporting outbreak response there, so the government requested PREDICT assistance and this early assistance may have helped reduce the impact of this tragic outbreak by allowing prompt control efforts.
