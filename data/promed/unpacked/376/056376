A federal agency hopes to help save an ailing species of bat with new regulations.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service [Wed 13 Jan 2016] announced the final "4(d) rule" it's implementing to help protect the Northern long-eared bat from human interference as scientists try to stop white-nose syndrome, which has devastated bat populations.

Director Dan Ashe, Fish and Wildlife Service, called the deadly fungal syndrome "one of the most devastating diseases for wildlife in North America."

Scientists recently confirmed the presence of white-nose syndrome in Nebraska, the 30th state to be exposed, Ashe said. The Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Northern long-eared as a "threatened" species under the Endangered Species Act last year [2015].

The rule focuses on protecting the bats during their 2 most vulnerable periods of activity: hibernation and raising young, Ashe said during a press conference call.

"Our hope is that these actions are going to help the Northern long-eared bat weather the storm of white-nose syndrome until research identifies effective treatments for the disease," Ashe said. "It's currently expected to spread throughout the bats' entire range in an 8-13 year period, and that may require us to reclassify the bat at some point in the future as an endangered species as opposed to a threatened species."

Named for section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act, a 4(d) rule allows the wildlife service more leeway to hand-tailor the regulations than if animals were classified as endangered. In the case of the bats, the rule prohibits purposeful "take:" harassing, killing, or capturing the bats.

Purposeful take isn't banned if the bats are taken in the defense of human life, removing hazardous trees, for certain research projects, or while removing bats from human structures.

Incidental take, or taking bats while in the practice of doing something else, is banned within the "white-nose zone." Within the zone, the incidental take of Northern long-eared bats is prohibited in hibernacula (the places where they hibernate); and altering a known hibernaculum in a way that impairs an essential behavioral pattern.

In addition, incidental take through tree removal, like logging or clearing for development, is also banned under certain circumstances. Banned tree removal is any that results in the incidental take of Northern long-eared bats within a quarter-mile [400 m] of a known hibernaculum, or harms known occupied maternity roost trees, or any other trees within a 150-foot [46 m] radius from the maternity roost tree, during the pup season from 1 June through 31 July.

Since it falls in an area within 150 miles [241 km] of county with a confirmed case of white-nose syndrome in hibernacula, Crow Wing County is among the counties in Minnesota affected by the rule.

The rule, which takes effect [16 Feb 2016], is aimed at both protecting the bat and limiting the regulatory burden on landowners and private companies, the wildlife service stated.

In the event the bats are listed as endangered rather than threatened, the blanket rules against any kind of bat take would be implemented.

Ashe said the fight against white-nose syndrome was beginning to see "glimmers of hope" due to international response of governments, nonprofits, and academia and more than USD 45 million in private and public funding from the US.

"There are promising treatments that have been identified, and scientific research is continuing to try to advance and test those treatments in the field," he said. "We are hopeful that a solution to white-nose syndrome is within our grasp. It is important, certainly, to the bat -- but also to our nation -- that we succeed."

[The Northern long-eared bat (_Myotis septentrionalis_) is one of the species of bats most impacted by the disease white-nose syndrome. It is found in the United States from Maine to North Carolina on the Atlantic Coast, westward to eastern Oklahoma and north through the Dakotas, even reaching into eastern Montana and Wyoming. In Canada it is found from the Atlantic Coast westward to the southern Yukon Territory and eastern British Columbia.
