[Serotype O is the most prevalent serotype in many parts of Africa and the Middle East. Based on information provided to the OIE, countries in the immediate region around Kuwait have recently reported the following FMD events:

1.Iran: In 2014, reported 1741 outbreaks of FMD serotypes A, O and Asia 1. See 2014 annual report at http://tinyurl.com/hrv7gd6. Most recently FMD serotype A Asia, genotype VII was reported , see ProMED-mail 20160104.3909811.

2.Iraq: In 2014, reported 178 outbreaks of FMD serotypes A and O. See annual report at http://tinyurl.com/ht3857g. During Jan-Jun 2015 period, 45 FMD outbreaks were reported, but no serotype was noted. See report at http://tinyurl.com/zqm8ugt.

3.Saudi Arabia: during the period Jul-Dec 2014, reported FMD serotype O as present in the country, but no quantitative information is available, see http://tinyurl.com/hv9u7tq. In addition, in 2015 FMD serotype A Asia, genotype VII was reported, see ProMED-mail 20151229.3899816.

According to the report, vaccination "in response to the outbreak(s)" is being applied; the vaccine,reportedly, includes 4 valencies, namely O, A, Asia 1 and SAT-2 serotypes. It would be interesting to note which vaccine strain of serotype O is included in the vaccine. We'll return to the issue when the genoyyping at Pirbright is completed and published. - Mod.ARN
