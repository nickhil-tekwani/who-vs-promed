From: Motleyone@aol.com (Pat Isaacs)
Thanks for all the responses, both to the list, and personally. I have
included a publication by Jo Balliet which may partly explain the concerns
I have. Her protocal with raccoons is used by us.
[I am including the protocol more because it represents the perspective of
wildlife rehabilators than as a suggestion for clinical actions, as I
cannot vouch for the source and am not a specialist in viral diseases as
some of the other moderators are. I have therefore chosen to publish "as
is" rather than assess the validity of every possibility raised in the
protocol. I was relieved to know that rehabilators who handled the
raccoons are themselves vaccinated. - Mod. pc]

TO: WOUNDED KNEE WR VOLUNTEERS (JULY 1995)
FROM: JO BALLIET, DIRECTOR
SUBJECT: COMPARING VIRAL DISEASES OF RACCOONS
These last two weeks have been difficult for all of us who helplessly
watched Feline Distemper (FD) destroy many of our hand raised orphan
raccoons. An animal to animal (not zoonotic) contact virus, we ask
ourselves where it came from. Was it from a free-roaming feral cat we
occasionally see on the refuge grounds? Could it have been harboring the
virus and came into
nose-to-nose contact with the raccoons while foraging for an errant piece
of food under the low, wire-bottom weaning crates? Was it from another
source of which we'll never know? FD is generally considered a "cage
disease" and in the past, our outside weaning crates were considered
inviolate with the coons being vaccinated before graduating to the back
rehabilitation cages. A new protocol will be established for 1996.
Immunization against FD will be administered before being transferred to
the weaning crates.
To attempt to save "to be released" raccoons exhibiting clinical signs of
FD through efforts except vaccine is inviting disaster for the regional
raccoon population, possibly for years to come. We painfully learned that
lesson in 1987. We had allowed another rehabilitator to place an
"artificially" saved raccoon into our empty Coonrad Hilton in the late fall
of 1986. At that time there was a large pitch pine in the middle of the
cage. The raccoon loved to
lie on the highest branches. A few weeks following his "slow" release
(there was no translocation policy at the time) we began finding healthy
appearing raccoons dead on or near the property. We had no idea if others
had died throughout the woods and beyond. The first two were diagnosed
positive for FD through pathological testing at U of P. The following
spring the Coonrad I-Elton was disinfected thoroughly and a new pea gravel
floor laid to prepare for the eventual housing of that year's hand-raised
raccoons. Even though we
scrubbed down the tree trunk, we never thought of the possibility of the
towering tree limbs being contaminated.
At that time we were inoculating raccoons with the recommended FD vaccine
(which is no longer being marketed). Following two weeks of housing in the
Hilton with accomplished climbing to the height and breadth of the tree,
our hand-raised raccoons began exhibited clinical signs of FD and death
followed. Pathological testing was positive for FD! During the early
stages, we
obviously carried the virus on our shoes or supplies into adjacent raccoon
cages! It was a horrible time with more than 25 raccoon juveniles
succumbing to the deadly disease. One life cost more than 25 lives!
In laboratory experiments, the FD virus has withstood temperatures as high
as 175 degrees for more than 30 minutes and freezing had little effect.
The FD virus doesn't enter the brain of the infected animal. The virus in
the "artificially" saved animal may lay dormant, not affecting the host
animal, but erupt and intermittently be shed in its feces, urine, saliva,
and nasal secretion: sort of a raccoon "Typhoid Mary"! However, natural or
vaccine produced antibodies will destroy the virus which leaves none to be
shed. Antibodies induced by vaccine may last only a few months while the
animal's natural immune system takes over and produces natural antibodies.
The raccoon with a compromised immune system, a condition we can't
determine, will not survive long in the wild. (Per conv, EVANS-1987)
Also this year we have seen more than our share of Canine Distemper (CD),
an animal to animal (not zoonotic) airborne virus, in incoming raccoon
orphans. CD has been at epizootic levels throughout the area with many
young nursing females succumbing to the disease.
Being airborne, the virus can be infective up to 30 feet away. As the
virus travels through the infected animal's system, secondary infections
such as diarrhea and ocular and nasal mucosa will occur. Early vaccine can
create antibodies which will destroy the virus before it reaches the brain.
As we found, supportive care can reverse all secondary infections.
If the virus reaches the brain and the animal has survived all secondary
infections, it will have intermittent or permanent problems which will
reduce its chance to survive in the wild. Chronic CD affects the brain and
foot pads, areas that can't be reached by antibodies. In the brain, the
virus may cause swelling and excruciating pain, a condition called "Old Dog
Encephalitis". In the pads of the feet, the virus will cause thickening
and the pads become hard and painful. The condition is referred to as
"Hard Pad Disease", another common name for CD.
As a comparison, let's take another look at Rabies. Rabies is a zoonotic,
inoculated virus without secondary signs or infections as it moves toward
the brain. It is not shed in feces, urine, nasal or ocular secretion,
maternal milk, or in musk glands such as that of skunks. The virus is not
carried by the vascular system (in blood) nor does it cross the placental
barrier to the fetus. A baby raccoon can not be born with rabies, but it
can be exposed at
birth by a viral shedding mother as she grooms the newborn. That, however,
is really a moot point since the baby isn't removed from the mother as it
pops from the birth canal!
Once the rabies virus crosses the brain stem (a barrier to antibodies) the
virus enters the salivary glands and multiplies while brain changes take
place. The viral laced saliva can then be "inoculated" into another animal
by biting, or by contaminating open wounds that have bled within 24 hours
and by entering exposed mucous membranes, i.e., mouth, nose and eyes.
The virus is very fragile and easily destroyed by soap, water, sunlight and
air. It has no potential to contaminate soil or other objects other than
during the period in which the salivary secretion leaves the oral cavity
and is not yet dry.
TO SUMMARIZE:
FELINE DISTEMPER (FD): A CONTACT virus that survives outside the body.
CANINE DISTEMPER (CD): An AIRBORNE virus that survives outside the body.
RABIES: An INOCULATED virus that DOES NOT survive outside the body.
For the well being of the wild animals that are susceptible to all three
viruses, the rabies virus, even though it is zoonotic, is the least complex
virus to deal with!
SUGGESTED PROTOCOL FOR WORKING WITH RACCOONS:
from: Rehabilitating The Rabies Vector Species, Jo Balliet
(1) Only pre-immunized handlers should work with raccoons.
(2) All raccoons should be considered rabies exposed.
(3) Latex examination or household gloves should be worn at all times while
working with nursing raccoons. Soiled bedding, bottles and nipples, and
soiled housing should be handled with latex gloves.
(4) Raccoon litters should not be housed together until such time that
killed rabies vaccine inoculation has been boostered; a minimum of three
(3) weeks. (See publication #11 of the PACIFIC WILDLIFE PROJECT
publication list.)
(5) Inoculation should be considered at intake regardless of age.
(6) To each litter, assign a bottle/nipple which will carry a number
corresponding to the number assigned to the housing tank. (Aquarium tanks
are recommended for neonates for many reasons including ease of
disinfecting.)
(7) After use, thoroughly disinfected each bottle (externally) with
Nolvasan Surgical Scrub (while hands are still gloved), dry, encase in a
plastic sandwich bag, and refrigerate. If empty, the bottle should be
cleaned internally in the normal manner before storage. Sterilize bottles
and nipples at least once daily.
(8) After care of litter, disposal of latex examination gloves is a must.
Latex household gloves shall be disinfected in the manner prescribed- above.
(9) Do not hold the animal near your face. (Prevents accidental mucous
membrane transmission.)
(10) Do not place soiled gloves, bottle, or bedding near your face.
(11) If unknown mucous membrane invasion is questionable, the use of a face
mask and safety glasses is recommended. (one doesn't go scuba diving
without the necessary equipment!)
(12) Use latex household gloves during all phases of outdoor cage and
accessory cleaning. Disinfect gloves frequently.
(13) Each raccoon's assigned admission number should follow it from intake
to release.
NOTE: Excluding vaccination, these procedures should be applied to all
mammal species with the possible exception of squirrels and rabbits.
