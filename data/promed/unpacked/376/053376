Suspected Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) discovered in Scotland
-----------------------------------------------------
The Scottish Executive said on Friday [23 Feb 2001 it had discovered a
possible case of FMD on a pig farm in Aberdeenshire, raising fears the
highly contagious disease had spread throughout Britain.
"A possible case of FMD is being investigated by the state veterinary
service on a pig farm in Fyvie in Aberdeenshire," the Executive said in a
statement. "Movement restrictions have been applied to the farm and a
standstill notice is in effect for an 8 km radius around [the farm."
The executive said the restriction would halt the movement of all livestock
in and out of, as well as within, the exclusion zone. The statement added
that samples had been taken to a laboratory for diagnosis and results were
expected this evening.
Earlier, Britain's Ministry of Agriculture confirmed its fifth case of FMD
on a pig farm in northern England, saying the farm could also be the source
of the country's first outbreak of the disease in 20 years.
