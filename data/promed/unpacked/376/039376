EU Vets Say Source Unknown of UK Swine Fever Virus
Epidemiological Investigation of Classical Swine Fever
------------------------------------------------------
In the course of its ongoing investigation of the recent outbreak of
classical swine fever (CSF) in the UK the European Commission (EC) has
consulted the Community Reference Laboratory at the Institute of Virology
of the School of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany.
In the field of animal health the Community is assisted by a number of
specialised Laboratories (Community Reference Laboratories). The Community
Reference Laboratory for (CSF) is the Institute of Virology of the School
of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. This laboratory maintains a
collection of more than 600 CSF virus isolates derived from outbreaks of
the disease in different parts of the world and it works in close
co-operation with the National Reference Laboratories of the Member States.
Segments of the nucleic acid of these viruses have been sequenced and
according to the sequence data the viruses were subgrouped. This work is
aimed at the identification of specific clusters of infection and it is of
great help in understanding the origin of CSF when it enters a previously
free area.
Sequence data from the recent CSF outbreak in East Anglia were provided to
the Community Reference Laboratory by the UK National Laboratory
(Veterinary Laboratories Agency-Weybridge), where the virus was isolated.
According to these data, specialists from these 2 laboratories assigned the
British isolate to subgroup 2.1. However, this
virus isolate is not identical to any of the viruses previously isolated in
the European Union. Therefore, they concluded it is a virus newly
introduced into the Community, although the source is not known.
However, viruses of subgroup 2.1 appeared infrequently in pigs in Western
Europe during the last 10 years and have never been isolated from the
European wild boar. The first isolation of a 2.1 virus was reported from
Vienna in 1993, when veterinary authorities confiscated a shipment of wild
boar meat illegally imported from China. One year later this virus was
isolated from an outbreak of CSF in domestic pigs in Switzerland. In 1997 a
CSF virus belonging to subgroup 2.1 caused a serious epidemic in the
Community which involved Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and
Belgium. The sequence data of the recent East Anglia isolate differ from
the one which caused those outbreaks, although they both own to the same
2.1 subgroup. Viruses of the 2.1 subgroup have been reported in a number of
East Asian countries.
