The World Health Organization is releasing more than a million doses of yellow fever vaccine from its emergency stockpile after the deadly mosquito-borne disease killed 10 people in southwestern Ethiopia, a WHO report said on [Mon 5 Nov 2018].

The outbreak was confirmed in Wolaita Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region and has been traced back to a patient who fell ill on [21 Aug 2018]. It has caused 35 suspected cases of the disease.

"This outbreak is of concern since the population of Ethiopia is highly susceptible to yellow fever due to absence of recent exposure and lack of large-scale immunization," the WHO report said.

Symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue, and although only a small proportion of patients who contract the virus develop severe symptoms, about half of those die within 7-10 days.

All the confirmed cases came from Offa Woreda district, and there have been no more confirmed cases since an immediate reactive vaccination campaign was conducted there in mid-October [2018], reaching around 31 000 people. However, the WHO said there was a risk of further spread of the disease, partly because of conflict in the region, and it was releasing 1.45 million doses of vaccine for a mass campaign that needed to take place "without further delay".

Ethiopia, the home country of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is within the geographic "yellow fever belt" and had frequent outbreaks until the 1960s, but no more until 143 cases were confirmed in the SNNP region in 2013, the weekly report said.

The introduction of yellow fever vaccination into routine immunization in Ethiopia is planned for 2020.

[This situation illustrates the need to maintain yellow fever (YF) routine vaccination coverage at 80% or above to prevent outbreaks as happened in Angola. This is not easy to do since YF cases are sporadic and cases are often separated after a lapse of several years. The cost of maintaining ample coverage is less than emergency expenses of dealing with an outbreak. - Mod.TY]

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on [Thu 1 Nov 2018] called on clinicians in Gombe State to be vigilant and report suspected cases of yellow fever promptly. Dr. Nasir Mohammed, a Consultant with WHO in Gombe, made the appeal during a forum with implementing partners in the state on [Thu 1 Nov 2018]. The forum was organised by the state Ministry of Health. He confirmed that cases of yellow fever had been under reported in the state, making it to spread within the communities.

"I call on clinicians to reports to Local Government Disease Surveillance Unit and notification officers, any case that fits in to yellow fever definition. "Health experts will take the blood samples immediately and send to the National Laboratory. "If there is any positive result, we in the organisation will take action,'' he said. He called on various groups to educate the communities on the symptoms to look out for in the disease.

Mohammed also noted that Routine Immunisation (RI) had not been effective in the state, necessitating the declaration of state of emergency by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) on immunisation.

He said WHO would visit various communities and work directly with community leaders, and conduct a micro census on children under the age of one year.

According to him, the exercise will also include new born babies, to determine that each settlement at the catchment area of health facility had the number of eligible children for RI. "We are going to recruit some personnel at community level, to engage them to work with community leaders to enable us track the eligible children," he said.

He however said that the state was not totally doing badly in the area of RI when compared to other states with many development partners. He said in the 1st quota of 2018, the state recorded 45% RI coverage and 60% in the 2nd quota.

[Although the WHO representative in Gombe state indicated that cases of yellow fever (YF) have been underreported, no information is provided about the number of cases nor when or where they occurred. Given the apparent urgency in case finding, the cases may have occurred recently. The actions to improve YF vaccine coverage is prudent since the routine immunization program in Gombe has not been active. Yellow fever has been active in Nigeria this year [2018], and a proactive vaccination campaign is underway in other states to help to prevent an outbreak. A 3 Jun 2018 Nigeria CDC report indicated that confirmed cases were recorded in 10 states (Kwara, Kogi, Kano, Zamfara, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Niger, Katsina, Edo, and Ekiti) in 21 local government areas (LGAs). Gombe state is not mentioned in this list of affected states, but the Gombe state WHO representative is concerned about future risks of a YF outbreak there. - Mod.TY]
