[In the above table, fau stands for wildlife -- in this case, a wild boar.
In 2003, OIE handistatus reports 37 cases in wild boars leading fortunately
to the infection of only 5 domestic swine.

In previous years, however, the spillover from feral swine into domestic
swine was more costly. In 2002, there were 451 instances of a wild boar
being identified with CSF, resulting in 5839 domestic swine who were
exposed and subsequently slaughtered. In 2001, 373 feral boars were
identified with CSF, resulting in the slaughter of 6369 domestic pigs.
These data highlight the important "wild/domestic animal" epidemiologic
interface. Over the past few years, we have been seeing the growing need to
develop more sophisticated strategies to control disease at this interface.
