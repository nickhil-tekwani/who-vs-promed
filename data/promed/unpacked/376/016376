Bird flu reappears in Tripura
-----------------------------
Bird flu has reappeared in Lembucherra area, about 45 km from here [Agartala], official sources said Thursday [26 Jan 2012].

Following reports of deaths of poultry birds in the area, blood samples were collected and examined and H5 strain of avian influenza virus was found, officials said.

More than 2000 ducks and birds would be culled tomorrow [Fri, 27 Jan 2012] in the area.

Meanwhile, the state administration has formed 16 rapid response teams to cull the ducks and birds in the area.

Sources said, BSF [Border Security Force] was alerted so that no poultry could enter into Indian territory. Tripura has 856-km-long border with Bangladesh.

[Tripura is a state in North-East India, with an area of 4051 sq mi (10 490 sq/km. It is the third smallest state of India, based on total area, surrounded by Bangladesh on the north, south, and west. The Indian states of Assam and Mizoram lie to the east. The statement "no poultry (from Tripura) could enter into Indian territory" could be read while keeping in mind that Tripura was formerly an independent kingdom, merged with independent India in 1949.

[3] Bhutan - free range birds

Free range birds presage spread of H5N1
-----------------------------------------------------
Poultry farmers in Trashigang who rear poultry birds would rather have their non-egg-laying chickens freed into the farms than have them confined within their coops or culled for meat.

Elsewhere in the world, once a hen’s egg-laying ability ceases after 12 months of laying, they are slaughtered and used in processed foods or for soup.

With the recent case of bird flu in the country [see item 4], the free range chickens in the villages of Trashigang are being seen as posing risk of infecting rest of the birds with the flu.

Trashigang livestock officials and those of the veterinary hospital said that by coming in contact with wild birds, the risk of [H5N1] spreading in the villages was grave.

Home to third largest poultry population in the country it has many chickens both local and improved breed left out in the open to stray.

Farmer Jigme Wangchuk from Tapting under Samkhar gewog has been leaving his local breed of chicken to loiter along the peripheries of the village.

Almost every household in Tapting keep 2 to 3 chickens and they are all left to stray throughout the day. “We free the birds in the villages, especially when everyone’s out in the fields working and have no one to feed the birds,” Jigme Wangchuk said.

A poultry farm owner in the village, Tshering Wangdi scowls at his neighbours who have set their poultry birds free to mingle wild birds like crows and pigeons [see item 5].

"Many of these birds flock in the dozens into the village from various parts of the country," Tshering Wangdi said.

While Tapting has only a handful of local breed birds let loose in the open, villages like Benshingmo in Kanglung have in the hundreds.

Opposed to the idea of culling spent up birds for religious reasons and sentiments, commercial poultry farms in the village have used the community as a dumping ground.

"I gave around 150 spent up birds to a villager from Younphupam for free," poultry farm owner in Drakmawoong Ngawang Dorji said. "I’m opposed to the disposal strategy of culling."

Ngawang Dorji said he gave away between 10 and 15 spent up birds to several villagers.

"I still have 400 layers," he said. "I’m planning them give away to the villages in the next one and half years."

The trend has spread among poultry farm owners in other gewogs [geographic administrative units composed of a group of villages] of Trashigang, where they have been giving away birds to villagers for free or setting them free as tshethar ["saving lives of animal", a cultural compassionate trend in Bhutan].

Although some villagers, who took the birds given to them for free have built a poultry shed, many are rearing in free range.

Dzongkhag veterinary officials said the risk of bird flu outbreak and spreading from the wild birds to the poultry increased manifold if non-laying chickens were left to stray open in the villages.

“Raising birds in free range at such times is risky and poses danger to humans as well,” officiating livestock officer Tandin Gyeltshen said.

Free range poultry were also exposed to outbreak of bird flu from people and vehicle movements in the villages. Veterinary officials said the movement of people in the villages could also transmit the flu if someone coming from an affected area visited the place.

“Bird flu is a viral disease that can be transmitted even by humans,” Tandin Gyeltshen said. “So any unprotected contact with birds can cause an outbreak.”

It is also reported that even in town areas including Melphey and Keyling where people and vehicle movements have been increasing in recent times, people have been rearing free range birds.

Meanwhile, some villagers in Younphupam are believed to be rearing poultry birds at the basement of their houses.

This Trashigang medical officer, Dr Kalpana Chhetri said was unhealthy, unhygienic and risky for both humans and birds.

“Certain safe distance should be maintained,” Dr Kalpana Chhetri said. “Living with birds in the same house would cause acute respiratory infection and aggravate chronic asthma if someone is suffering from it.”

Except of recent sensitisation program on bird flu, little bio-security measures have been taken up.

“We’ve yet to put up to agriculture ministry about the bio-security measures just in case of a bird flu outbreak,” dzongda Lungten Dorji said. “So far, nothing has been done.”

Meantime, veterinary officials said it would explore more precautionary measures to confine the free range birds.

Bird flu detected in wild birds
-------------------------------
After chickens, the contagious bird flu has now been detected in wild birds.

Investigations will begin tomorrow [25 Jan 2012] in Phuentsholing to find out if the flu would affect the wild bird population in the country.

The investigation is carried out after the National Incident Command Centre (NICC) for bird flu received reports of some 18 wild birds death that died simultaneously over the last week.

First, about 15 “house crows” were found dead on 19 Jan 2012 near the junction of Rabten workshop and GREF camp. House crows are a species that are found in sub-tropical areas like Phuentsholing.

The satellite veterinary laboratory officer in-charge Tuku Rai said all 15 crows had decomposed and could not be used for laboratory investigation. “But we managed to find a sick crow from the same area,” Tuku Rai said. “The sample tested positive for H5 and influenza “A” virus during the filed investigation.”

But, the bird tested negative for N1 strain. Livetsock officials said there is a high chance of a different kind of bird flu virus affecting the wild crow population. “The sick crow has died but we have collected its bone marrow and brain,” Tuku Rai said. “No further crow deaths have been reported so far.”

Focal person for bird flu Dr Tashi Dorji said a “Blue Fronted Red Start” was also found dead near the regional livestock development centre in Tsimasham campus. It tested positive for H5N1.

Another pigeon that was found dead near the bird flu outbreak area at Tsimasham had also tested positive for H5N1 as well as the pigeon and a sparrow that were found dead in the Chukha hydro power colony campus.

A team comprising a wild bird specialist from the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute of Forest and Environment, veterinarians from the livestock department and an official from the satellite veterinary laboratory in Phuentsholing will investigate the deaths and study the flu’s risks to the country’s wild birds.

Dr Tashi Dorji said the investigation will monitor and find out different species of wild birds breeding in Phuentsholing,” he said. “We’ll have to collect fresh sample and find out the diseases spectrum to understand.”

The main objective of the investigation, Dr Tashi Dorji said, is to see the role of wild birds in the outbreak of bird flu in the domestic poultry population [see item 3 abobve].

Another surveillance team are also doing the same investigation in Thimphu and Paro even though no deaths of wild birds have been reported so far.

All reports and samples will be sent to Bhopal, India for virus sequencing and phylogenetic studies.

With thousands of crows in Jharkhand, India reported to have died in the last 2 months, the NICC on 10 Jan 2012 had already notified all agencies in the country dealing with wild life to alert their field offices on the mortality of any wild birds.

“We urge the public to report any wild bird deaths and request poultry owners to protect their poultry birds from mixing with wild birds,” Dr Tashi Dorji said.
