Dozens Contract Bacterial Illness in Borneo Adventure Race
----------------------------------------------------
ATLANTA, Georgia: Dozens of people who paddled rivers and climbed mountains
in Borneo as part of an adventure race contracted a sometimes-fatal
bacterial illness often transmitted by rat urine, the U.S. government said
Thurs 18 Jan 2001.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it has confirmed
68 cases of leptospirosis, which lurks in contaminated water and soil,
among participants in the race. None of the cases was fatal. The racers
were infected during Eco-Challenge Sabah, a grueling 2-week contest in late
Aug and early Sept [2000 in which 4-person teams slogged through flooded
rivers and hiked mountains in the jungles of Malaysian Borneo. Contestants
came from more than 20 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia as well
as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.
Symptoms of the disease, including chills, diarrhea, headaches and eye
infections, were reported by 44 percent of the 158 race participants who
have been contacted. Most of these racers were sick for about a week in
September.
The CDC said health officials are trying to reach 146 other racers and
expect roughly the same extremely high rate of infection. Most of the
victims probably became infected from swimming in the Segama River, the CDC
said. Leptospirosis is often transmitted by the urine of infected rats and
mice and can cause fatal kidney and liver damage. It is not believed to be
passed person-to-person. About 5 percent of cases end in death.
Though 41 other racers reported they became ill after the race, it is
unclear what made them sick, said Dr. James Sejvar, a CDC
epidemiologist. Robyn Benincasa, a San Diego, California, firefighter who
contracted the disease, said her symptoms still linger -- fever, fatigue
and upper-respiratory problems that keep her from training for more
adventure races.
"I'm just really, really slowly getting over the whole thing," she
said. "The water was just really dingy, murky and muddy, and at that point
we had had so many leech bites and open wounds. So it's not really
surprising."
Officials at Eco-Challenge, based in California, did not immediately return
calls for comment Thurs. Eco-Challenge has held similar races in the United
States, Argentina, Morocco, Australia and Canada and plans an event in New
Zealand in October.
