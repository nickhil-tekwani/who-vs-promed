While 600 fatalities is certainly terrible, I believe that the mortality is
closer to 25% (not 10%) with a severe neurological morbidity rate around
30% (of the survivors). This coming from the CDC's vaccine recommendation
guidelines and description of diseases.

In the matter of the press release by the Minister of Agriculture, Dr
Sulaiman Daud, I would like to clarify that Universiti Malaysia Sarawak
(UNIMAS) has not been called in to assist in the investigation of the "JE"
outbreak referred to in your posting, and the university has not sent
anyone to the peninsula. We are merely surprised that it is taking so long
for the Ministry of Health to make a confirmatory diagnosis of JE (if in
fact we are seeing a JE outbreak in the peninsula). We have offered to run
confirmatory tests on human specimens if our assistance should be needed,
but our offer has not been taken up.
It might be worth pointing out to readers of ProMED-mail that JE is largely
seasonal in Malaysia and normally occurs during the months of Nov/Dec/Jan.
The fact that we are seeing an increase in JE cases during this period is
therefore nothing new nor particularly unusual. What is unusual about the
fatal cases in the peninsula is that they are young adults, and they are
dying. Although they are mostly are pig farm workers, raising suspicion
about JE, we must not forget to rule out other possible occupational
causes. This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that there has
not been a confirmatory laboratory result for most of these cases weeks
later.
In Sarawak (separated from the peninsula by an ocean), we are able to
deliver a specific IgM result for JE with a 24 hour turnaround time. RT PCR
is not terribly useful in cases already with encephalitis because virus is
often undetectable by then. We are successfully using RT PCR to determine
which febrile children with convulsions have JE. These children seroconvert
for IgM a couple of days later, and then the RT PCR is normally negative.
