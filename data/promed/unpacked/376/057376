[This new case of rabies, the 15th since the beginning of the year
(2010) in the territories of Israel and the Palestinian autonomous
territory (PAT; West Bank), underlines the spread of the disease from
the north-eastern borders with Syria and Jordan in a south-western
direction, approaching central parts of Israel and the West Bank. A
map of the 2010 rabies cases in Israel, including the current case in
the West Bank, is available at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2010.html>.

Since 2007, the biological and molecular characterization of the
rabies isolates in Israel showed that stray dogs have become the main
animal reservoir. This situation has, so far, been limited to the
north-east, with a distinct, separate canid-borne virus lineage
emerging as the predominant virus. This clade seems to be similar to
Turkish strains and is probably the one circulating in other Middle
Eastern countries, including Syria and Jordan, from where it has
penetrated Israel by stray dogs and other canids (jackals, wolves).
The transition, in Israel, from fox-mediated rabies to dog-mediated
rabies is of great concern to public health because of the close
contact between dogs and the human population. A concerning example
is case No. 14, lab-confirmed on 16 Mar 2010, which was diagnosed in
a puppy which was adopted by children; its cohort died several days
earlier after showing cerebral signs but was not sent for testing.
Many contacts -- including several children -- have to undergo
post-exposure treatment, hopefully timely. For further background on
the evolved rabies epidemiology, please refer to commentary in
previous postings referenced below.

Since January 2009, 3 cases of rabies have been lab-confirmed in
foxes in Israel (all during 2009), compared to 41 dogs and 13
jackals. No case has been detected in foxes in 2010; the number of
rabies cases (all animal species) in Israel and the West Bank during
the period 1 Jan - 16 Mar, since 2005, was: 2005 - 4, 2006 - 1, 2007
- 0, 2008 - 0, 2009 - 7, 2010 - 15.

The absence of rabies in foxes is indicative of the efficacy of the
oral vaccination campaign, applied in Israel and the West Bank, in
immunizing this species, which is widely distributed and abundant
throughout the country, and which has been -- up to 2005 -- the main
rabies reservoir. The reasons for the appearance of rabies in
jackals, which are expected to have had access to the same vaccine
baits, when exposed to the dog/canid mediated virus deserves explanation.

Though wolves are not abundant in Israel, they are present. During
2005-2009, 3 rabid wolves have been lab confirmed, all on the Golan
Heights (bordering Syria and Jordan). The statement in the above
notification of "Sub-clinical infection" may be indicative that the
animal may have been detected near human dwellings without apparent
signs of disease when shot; explanation will help.

Reportedly, the required measures to protect public health by
controlling the stray dog population are still pending, awaiting a
decision of the environmental protection minister (for details, see
posting 20100224.0616). - Mod.AS]
