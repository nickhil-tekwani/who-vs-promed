Scientists were struggling Monday [25 Jul 2011] to understand why the
northern coast of Queensland has become littered with sick and dying
turtles and dugongs.

More than 400 bodies have been discovered along the coastline near the
Great Barrier Reef, and experts believe hundreds more animals could
have perished in remote areas or simply sunk to the bottom of the
sea.

"The bodies we are finding are just the tip of the iceberg," Ellen
Ariel, a virologist with the James Cook University in Queensland,
said. "We are only finding the bodies because they appear on beaches
where people are walking but there will be many others in places no
one can access."

Ariel, who attended an emergency summit in Townsville on Friday [22
Jul 2011] to discuss the deaths, called the situation "an
environmental disaster."

Experts think the fatalities could be the result of extreme weather in
northern Australia. Devastating floods in December [2010] and January
[2011], and a cyclone in February, caused a runoff of nutrients into
the ocean, potentially killing the seagrass that both turtles and
dugongs -- or "sea cows" -- feed on. The grass provides nutrients and
improves the animals' ability to breath underwater.

"There is evidence that marine animals, including turtles, are
suffering from poor nutrition because of a lack of seagrass," Vicky
Darling, the Queensland Environment Minister, said.

Ariel said the impact on the turtle population was potentially as
severe as the devastation to marine life caused by an oil spill.
"If this is taking out a whole generation of juvenile turtles you
won't have a new population for 60 years," she said. "It's really
dramatic. It's right up there with the oil spills in the US."

The Townsville turtle hospital was at full capacity Monday, and James
Cook University set up a rehabilitation center for sick sea life.

[This article does not tell us which type(s) of sea turtles is/are
dying. There are only 7 species of sea turtle found worldwide and 6 of
them are found in Australian waters. These are the loggerhead, green,
hawksbill, olive ridley, flatback and leatherback turtles. Most sea
turtles are found in warm, tropical oceanic waters and so are mostly
seen in northern Australian waters. leatherback turtles have a global
distribution and can also be found in colder waters, such as around
southern Australia.

Dugongs are large grey mammals which spend their entire lives in the
sea. Fully grown, they may be 3 metres [10 feet] long and weigh 400
kilograms [882 pounds]. They have nostrils near the top of their
snouts. Dugongs swim by moving their broad spade-like tail in an up
and down motion, and by use of their 2 flippers. Dugongs' only hairs
are the bristles near the mouth.

Dugongs are highly migratory, which means Australia shares populations
with other neighbouring countries. In Australia, Dugongs swim in the
shallow coastal waters of northern Australia from the Queensland/New
South Wales border in the east to Shark Bay on the Western Australian
coast. They are also found in other parts of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans in warm shallow seas where seagrass is found.

The scientist mentioned in this article believe this is only the "tip
of the iceberg" but if the bodies of animals are not washed up on
shore how do they know there are other unaccounted for dead animals?
Have they sent divers down looking for this? While the water is
relatively clear and shallow, the bodies could be washed to other
regions, if indeed there are dead ones that are not accounted for.

While the lack of sea grass is a huge issue for both of these animals,
it is also sad that there are places in Australia where the dugongs
are hunted with firearms. I suppose people eat them, just at they eat
the turtle eggs, even of turtles that are endangered. It might be one
issue if these people were starving but rather they are used as some
delicacy.

While nature may have played a role in eliminating sea grass, and we
hope it comes back, I did not see a proposal on how to help these
animal in the meantime. Dugongs are similar in many ways to the
manatee in the northern hemisphere.
