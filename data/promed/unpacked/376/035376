Ebola response roadmap - situation report 12 Nov 2014
-----------------------------------------------------
There have been 14 098 reported cases of Ebola, with 5160 reported deaths.
Transmission remains intense in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and case incidence is still increasing in Sierra Leone.
Interventions to contain the disease include infection prevention and control; diagnosing, isolating and treating patients; contact tracing; and safe and dignified burials.
A total of 4 confirmed and probable cases and 4 deaths have been reported in Mali.
All Ebola patients in the United States of America have been discharged from hospital.

Summary
-------
A total of 14 098 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the USA) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal) up to the end of 9 Nov [2014]. There have been 5160 reported deaths.

Interventions to contain the disease in the 3 most affected countries include isolating and treating patients, identifying their contacts and conducting burials in a safe and dignified manner. In those countries, 19 of 53 planned Ebola Treatment Centres are now open. A total of 140 trained burial teams are on the ground, and more than 4400 burials have reportedly been conducted in a safe and dignified manner since the outbreak began. Samples from all 53 Ebola-affected districts can be sent to a laboratory within 24 hours by road.

Situation reports are now presented in a web-based format to provide detailed information at the country level, including data and maps, in a more interactive way.

[2] Mali: Dozens in quarantine after Mali Ebola death

Authorities in Mali have placed dozens of people in quarantine at the home of a 25 year old nurse who died from Ebola in the capital, Bamako, and at the clinic where he treated an imam from Guinea who died with Ebola-like symptoms. The government said in a statement on Wed [12 Nov 2014] that the nurse was confirmed to have Ebola on Tue [11 Nov 2014] and died later that evening. All necessary steps to identify people who had come into contact with the nurse had been taken, it said. Ousmane Doumbia, secretary-general of the Health Ministry, said so far 70 people have been placed in quarantine.

The imam from the border town of Kouremale was never tested for the disease, and his body was washed in Mali and returned to Guinea for burial without precautions against the virus, health officials said. Two aid workers said that another person who lived in the house where the imam stayed in Bamako had died this week and was buried without being tested. A doctor at the Pasteur Clinic where the nurse worked -- one of Bamako's top medical centres -- is also suspected to have contracted Ebola. The Pasteur Clinic was locked down by police on Tuesday [11 Nov 2014] night.

Concern is growing at the time it took between the imam dying and the steps needed to contain the deadly disease being put in place. Dr Samba Sow, head of Mali's Ebola response, said the imam died on 27 Oct 2014, 2 days after going to the clinic. "This case shows the lack of training of doctors in Bamako. This training should have been done 6 months ago," one aid worker told Reuters news agency, asking not to be named.

[3] Mali battles Ebola outbreak

In Mali, the latest country to see Ebola infections, Bamako's Pasteur clinic has been quarantined, with around 30 people trapped inside, including medical staff, patients and 15 African soldiers from the United Nations mission in Mali. Teams of investigators are tracing health workers, scouring the capital and the imam's home district in north eastern Guinea for scores of people who could have been exposed.

The deaths have raised fears of widespread contamination as they were unrelated to Mali's only other confirmed fatality, a 2 year old girl who had also arrived from Guinea in October [2014]. A doctor at the clinic is thought to have contracted the virus and is under observation outside the capital, the clinic said. A friend who visited the imam has also died of probable Ebola, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Mali's health ministry called for calm on Wed 12 Nov 2014, as it led a huge cross-border operation to stem the contagion.

WHO said the 70 year old cleric, GS, from a village on Guinea's porous border with Mali, fell sick and was transferred via several treatment centres to the Pasteur clinic. He had travelled to Bamako by car with 4 family members, all of whom have since gotten sick or died at home in Guinea. Multiple lab tests were performed, WHO said, but, crucially, not for Ebola, and he died of kidney failure on 27 Oct 2014.

The imam's body was transported to a mosque in Bamako for a ritual washing ceremony before being returned to Guinea for burial in his home village. Traditional African funeral rites are considered one of the main causes of Ebola spreading, as it is transmitted through bodily fluids, and those who have recently died are particularly infectious. "Although these events are still under investigation, WHO staff assume that many mourners attended the ceremonies," the agency said. Although the imam cannot now be tested, his 1st wife died of an undiagnosed disease last week, while his 2nd wife and brother are sick at an Ebola treatment centre in southern Guinea, where his son tested positive for the virus on Tue [11 Nov 2014]. All were with him on the car journey to Bamako, the WHO said, adding that his daughter died in Guinea on Mon [10 Nov 2014].

WHO said 28 health care workers who had contact with the imam at the Pasteur clinic had been identified and were under observation. A 2nd team of investigators is scouring Bamako, including the mosque, for possible infections while WHO staff in Guinea trace the man's family history. The nurse who died treating GS, identified by family as 25 year old SD, was the 1st Malian resident to be confirmed as an Ebola victim.

[So now we have 2 confirmed and 2 probable deaths -- of the 2 year old, another visitor from Guinea, a Malian nurse and a contact, and a suspected case in a Malian doctor -- and now at least 70 contacts. There does not seem to have been an adequate level of suspicion in medical circles in Bamako of the risk from visitors from Guinea during the more than 2 weeks since the imam's arrival in Bamako and now.

The new cases in Mali follow WHO's confirmation that 25 of the 100 people who were thought to have come into contact with the 2 year old girl were being released from quarantine... Health department spokesman Markatie Daou said around 50 people were still under observation in Kayes, western Mali, and would be released in a week if they continued to display no symptoms... http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30019895.
