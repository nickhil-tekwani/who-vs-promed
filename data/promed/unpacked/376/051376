POST WEANING MULTISYSTEMIC WASTING SYNDROME - NEW ZEALAND (02)

The previous report of an outbreak of PMWS in New Zealand once again
raises questions about case definition of PMWS and vectors of the
disease.
The current case definition of PMWS (Sorden, 2000) is presence of
some of the following clinical signs: enlarged lymph nodes,
progressive dyspnea, diarrhea, pallor, jaundice and wasting and
histological lesions characterised by depletion of lymphoid tissue
and a high concentration of PCV2 virus [porcine circovirus type 2]
within the characteristic lesions. In addition, wasting in the
post-weaning pigs must be non-responsive to intervention and
otherwise unexplained.
'Red Eyes', mentioned in the report as a clinical sign, has not been
a feature in outbreaks of PMWS in other countries, while a doubling
of the death rate in young pigs (weaners?) is certainly not specific
for PMWS. The 'significant difference in the strain of the disease'
is very interesting, as it could explain the difference in morbidity,
mortality (and clinical signs?) that is observed throughout the world.
Unfortunately, the report does not mention whether the 'strain
difference' refers to PCV2, the suspected cause of PMWS (see comments
from the Moderator on ProMED-mail 20060307.0738).
In previous reports to ProMED-mail, the outbreaks of PMWS in New
Zealand have been linked to 'feeding imported uncooked pig meat
during more relaxed border controls' and 'birds'. To my knowledge,
neither pathway has been proven to work in laboratory settings, and
to me it looks more like 'the usual suspects'. Given that movement
restriction of pigs and semen seems to have worked in New Zealand in
2003, the main suspect for me is movement of pigs and pig-products.

[Indeed, strain differences may explain the differences, but there
was no reference in the previous posting about strain typing. If
there is any information regarding proven pathways involving birds,
pork meat, or strain differences, we would appreciate receiving that
information. - Mod.TG]
