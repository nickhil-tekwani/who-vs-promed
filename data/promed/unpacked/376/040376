The West Nile virus is reported to have been a contributory factor in
2 more deaths -- a man and a woman -- in southern Saskatchewan this
month [August 2007].
The latest victims were from the Saskatoon and Sunrise (Yorkton)
health regions. The 1st victim was a woman in her 80s who lived in
the Sun Country Health Region in southeast Saskatchewan. All 3 had
underlying chronic medical conditions, according to Dr. Ross
Findlater, chief medical health officer for the province.
"Our West Nile numbers on the Web site have increased by 308 compared
to last week. We are up to 647 (confirmed and suspected) cases this
summer,'' Findlater told reporters on Friday.

** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above.]
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.
