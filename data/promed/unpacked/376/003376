Patient with trypanosomiasis probably infected in Serengeti national park
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have hospitalized (last night) [10 Jul 2005] a patient with African
trypanosomiasis who acquired the infection in the Serengeti between 18 Jun and
1 Jul 2005, with symptoms starting on 4 Jul 2005. The other 8 people on the
trip (according to the patient) are not sick nor have been sick since the
return. It was a group of American tourists only.��

[In 2001 ProMED-mail reported 10 cases of trypanosomiasis in tourists visiting
Serengeti and Tarangire national parks. No additional cases had been reported
since, but it appears that the problem has returned, and a comment on control
activities by the authorities would be appreciated. ProMED would be interested
in posting further reports of cases. - Mod.EP]
