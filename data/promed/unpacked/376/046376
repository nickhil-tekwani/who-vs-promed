Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - 27 Dec 2013
----------------
On [20 Dec 2013], WHO has been informed of 4 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia.

Two cases are female health workers from Riyadh who have not reported any symptoms.

The 3rd case is a 53-year-old male from Riyadh with underlying chronic diseases. He was hospitalized on [26 Nov 2013] and is currently receiving treatment in an intensive care unit. He had no exposure to animals and no travel history outside Riyadh region. He had contact with a confirmed case.

The 4th case is a 73-year-old male from Riyadh with underlying chronic diseases who died on [18 Dec 2013], 3 days after being hospitalized. He had exposure to animals but no travel history.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 170 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 72 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients, and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immuno-compromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[2] Saudi Arabia, new death

Saudi health authorities announced Thursday [27 Dec 2013] a new MERS death, bringing to 57 the number of people killed by the coronavirus in the country with the most fatalities.

The health ministry said in a statement on its website that a 73-year-old Saudi man, who suffered from chronic illnesses, died in the capital Riyadh after he contracted MERS.

Authorities also registered 4 other new MERS cases in Riyadh.

Two of them are Saudis; one is a 57-year-old who is chronically ill and is in intensive care, and the other is a 27-year-old medic.

The other 2 people infected are foreign medics, a 43-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man.

The ministry said 141 cases have been reported in the country since the virus appeared more than a year ago.

Experts are struggling to understand the disease, for which there is no vaccine.

MERS is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected 8273 people, 9 percent of whom died.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Jonathan Madara <jmadara@vet.upenn.edu> for submitting a similar media report on this update.

The global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by WHO is now 170, including 72 deaths. The pattern of severe disease seen in individuals with underlying co-morbidities is continuing, with milder or asymptomatic infections seen in younger individuals without pre-existing co-morbidities. In addition, there continues to be limited person-to-person transmission in the healthcare setting.

Comparing the media report above in [2] with the WHO report in [1], there is a discrepancy in the ages of cases reported. In trying to reconcile these numbers, this moderator went to the Saudi MOH website viewing the English pages (most recent report 20 Dec 2013 (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CoronaNew/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx, reflecting the report from 20 Dec 2013 seen on the MOH Arabic page and shown in [3] above) and then to the Saudi MOH website viewing the Arabic pages, where there was an additional report on the Saudi MOH Arabic page from 25 Dec 2013, reporting 5 new cases (and shown in [4] above). These 2 summary reports confirm a total of 9 newly diagnosed cases in Riyadh (and confirmed by Dr. Ziad Memish, the Deputy Minister of Public Health of Saudi Arabia):

20 Dec 2013 report
age N/A Healthcare Worker [HCW] asymptomatic contact
age N/A HCW asymptomatic contact
53 y/o Saudi multiple co-morbidities in ICU
73 y/o Saudi multiple co-morbidites died

25 Dec 2013 report
57 y/o Saudi multiple co-morbidities in ICU
73 y/o Saudi multiple co-morbidities died
43 y/o non Saudi HCW asymptomatic contact
35 y/o non Saudi HCW asymptomatic contact
27 y/o Saudi HCW asymptomatic contact

In total, there have been 141 cases and 57 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CoronaNew/PressReleases/Pages/default.aspx for the Saudi MOH tally in English).

The WHO global tally update report above (in [1]) refers to the cases contained in the 20 Dec 2013 report from the Saudi MOH website presented above in [3]. Hence, the addition of the 5 cases reported on 25 Dec 2013 presented above in [4] will bring the global total of MERS-CoV infections to 175 including 73 deaths.
