On [19 Oct 2017], a positive equine infectious anemia (EIA) result was confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) national reference laboratory for a horse located on premises in Lacombe County, Alberta. This animal had been sampled by the CFIA to comply with export conditions and no clinical signs of the disease were reported. A CFIA investigation is currently underway and as per program policy. A quarantine has been placed on the infected animal and its on-premises contacts. Initial reports indicated that there were several equine animals on the premises. The quarantine will remain until all follow-up testing has been completed and the positive horse is euthanized.

[Horses to be exported must be tested for EIA. However the discovery is certainly sad for the current as well as prospective owners or for their event plans. - Mod.TG
