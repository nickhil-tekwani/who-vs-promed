COMMUNICABLE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, SCHOOLS: REQUEST FOR INFO

A ProMED-mail post

From: Vivien Cleary <viv.cleary@shaw.lslha.sthames.nhs.uk>

I am currently evaluating a voluntary surveillance system for reporting
communicable diseases in schools in an inner city (London).
Has anyone else had experience of schools surveillance systems and have
they found them useful?
