Portugal: Suspected 1st Case of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Portuguese Main Directorate of Medical Services (DGS) announced yesterday
the existence of the 1st probable case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
young adult male.
The announcement was made through the Internet page of the organisation
(<http://www.dgsaude.pt/>). The patient resides with his family and is
receiving specialized medical aid. The DGS made clear that variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease is not transmitted between people.

Human Cases of vCJD Reported in France (13th) and Portugal (1st)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Portugal announced its 1st suspected [probable] case of variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], while
France said it had identified its 13th case of the degenerative brain ailment.
vCJD is a human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), caused by a
rogue protein that proliferates in the brain, turning it spongy. A total of 177
people have died or been diagnosed with the fatal condition, according to
[figures] compiled by Agence France Presse from official data.
So far 150 people have died of vCJD in Britain, where another 6 people are
still alive who have contracted the disease, according to figures posted on
Friday on the official British vCJD website [see: CJD (new var.) update 2005
(06) 20050607.1584].
There have been 2 cases in Ireland, with single cases reported in Canada,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States. Britain was the epicentre
of the BSE outbreak that occurred in the late 1990s. Its suspected source was
cattle feed that came from cows with brain disease. The pathogen leapt the
species barrier to humans through the consumption of contaminated beef, experts
believe.
However, its impact is unlikely to be known for several years, given unknowns
about the incubation period and whether some individuals may be genetically
more vulnerable than others.

[It is not surprising that a probable case of vCJD has been identified in
Portugal, since the risk of human disease is presumed to relate to the amount
of bovine meat consumed or extent of exposure to bovine products. According to
the latest figure compiled by the European Union and the OIE, Portugal ranks
3rd in the world in terms of total number of BSE-affected cattle (949) after
the UK (184 138), and Ireland (1470). France ranks 4th with 946 cases of BSE.
In the current year the UK, Ireland and Portugal reported 126, 29, and 17 cases
of BSE respectively. The containment of BSE in Portugal has been less
successful than in France, where only 2 cases of BSE have been reported in the
current year (see: BSE update 2005 (02) 20050606.1574). - Mod.CP]
