We have had a Louisiana case attributed to sinus irrigations using tap water in a Neti Pot [A photo of a Neti Pot is found here: http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/files/2011/12/neti_pot_in_use_wiki_cc_Aikhan.jpg].

It is my understanding that tap water from the house was tested positive for amoeba but that the water tested at the intake to the house was negative. I thought the CDC information as quoted in the South Carolina account had been updated to reflect warnings about using water directly from the tap for sinus irrigations.

In addition, at least in the above case, the diagnosis was straight forward and did not require a brain biopsy. The lab tech easily saw the amoebic forms in the CSF. Believe me, it was an easy diagnosis, as otherwise it would never have been made, as the hospital where I practice has never been brought back to quality and size since it was flooded by Katrina. We are essentially a 60-bed First Aid station operating in the shell of a former 400-plus bed hospital.

[ProMED thanks Dr Brobson Lutz for his comments. Sinus irrigation is a practice not recommended by mainstream medicine and can be dangerous, as pointed out. If untreated tap water is used for the procedure and there are free living amebae like _Naegleria_ in the water, it should be considered a high risk procedure, and at least the water should be boiled (and cooled) before use.

We agree that the diagnosis of Neagleria meningoencephalitis is done by microscopy of the spinal fluid because it causes an acute, rapidly progressing CNS infection, and amebae are seen in the spinal fluid. In contrast, meningoencephalitis caused by _Acanthamoeba_ spp., _Balamuthia mandrillaris_, and _Sappinia diploidea_ are more slowly evolving and usually require a brain biopsy with PCR to diagnose the infection.

Further information on infections with free-living amebae can be found at the CDC website: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/index.html. - Mod.EP
