Background information on Trichinella infection in Russia
-------------------------------------------
1383 cases (2 fatal) were reported during 1995 to 1997. _Trichinella
pseudospiralis_ is found in sylvatic animals (raccoon dog, corsac fox,
tiger cat, tawny eagle, and rook) in remote regions (Caucasus, Kazakhstan).
An outbreak of approximately 30 cases of human infection has been reported
in Kamchatka; local domestic pigs and brown rats were found infected at the
time. As many as 61 persons may have been infected by bear meat in Zima
(Siberia) during an outbreak in 1997, with additional cases in Sayansk,
Angarsk, and Irkutsk. In Samara in 1998, 9 persons developed the disease
after ingestion of barbecued badger meat.
