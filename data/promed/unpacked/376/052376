At least 9 British pensioners have received hospital treatment for Legionnaires' disease after a stay at Spanish hotel, it has been reported.

A 76-year-old man is in an intensive care unit at the Benidorm Clinic; 2 more are being treated on regular wards while a 4th has already been allowed home. Dr Delfin Arzua from the clinic said: "4 British holidaymakers were admitted with symptoms of pneumonia and tests have confirmed Legionnaires' disease." 5 more pensioners were treated in UK hospitals after suffering symptoms when they returned home from Spain.

They all fell ill after holidaying at the 4-star AR Diamante Beach hotel in Calpe, on the Costa Blanca, local journalist Tom Worden told Sky News. Legionnaires' disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia most likely to affect the elderly or ill. People catch the disease by inhaling small droplets of water from the air that contain the bacteria.

A spokesman for travel agent Saga said holidaymakers were moved to another nearby hotel after the cases were reported and a British scientist was sent to investigate the suspected outbreak. The scientist found no trace of the bug in the hotel but he did recommend some changes to the plumbing. A spokeswoman for the Alicante health authority said: "Once the alert was raised the entire water and sanitation structure of the hotel was cleaned. As the incubation period is 10 to 12 days we cannot rule out new cases in the next few days."

A total of 3 British tourists have died after catching Legionnaires' disease in a Spanish seafront hotel, regional authorities said, as they shut the hotel down to prevent further spread of the deadly bug.

"Analyses on the 3 deceased, of British nationality, aged between 73 and 78 years, found pneumonia caused by Legionnaires' [disease]," said the regional government of Valencia in a statement published late Thursday [2 Feb 2012].

14 cases of infection -- including 10 British tourists and 4 Spaniards -- were detected in the hotel at the resort of Calpe, on Spain's east coast. "We will close the tourist establishment as a preventive measure," the statement said, adding that the authorities were certain there would be no new cases.

The disease, caused by the bacteria _Legionella_, leads to a severe form of pneumonia, which can be fatal. It is contracted through inhalation of contaminated water droplets and is not known to be transmitted from person to person.

[ProMED-mail previously posted a report of this outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease (see Legionellosis – Spain (02): (AN) hotel 20120122.1018077) among British nationals who stayed at a hotel (named in the 1st news report above as the AR Diamante Beach Hotel) in Calpe, Costa Blanca, Spain. In the earlier post (22 Jan 2012) there were 4 confirmed cases of Legionnaires’ disease, 5 possible cases and 16 cases still being investigated. There are apparently now 14 confirmed cases (10 British and 4 Spanish nationals), with 3 deaths among the British nationals.

For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post: Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142. Dr Steve Berger has noted that rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain (http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It is not known if this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase in acquisition of this infection.

Benidorm is a coastal town located on the Costa Blanca, in the province of Alicante, Valencian community, Spain. Costa Blanca refers to the over 200 kilometers of Mediterranean coastline in the province of Alicante, Spain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Blanca). Calpe is a coastal town in Alicante province, 67 km north of the city of Alicante (http://wikitravel.org/en/Calpe#b). The province of Alicante is located in the southern part of the Valencian Community, one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain.
