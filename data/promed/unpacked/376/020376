Starting 6 Dec 2005, some cattle on a Changqing District farm began
suffering from fevers and poor appetites. By Sunday, 25 Dec 2005, the
number of ill cattle on the farm grew to 48.
On Mon 26 Dec 2005 the provincial veterinary authority initially
attributed the mass illness to the Asian type 1 foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD].
A state FMD lab confirmed the diagnosis on Thu, 29 Dec 2005,
according to the ministry report. The ministry said authorities
culled the 48 cattle and another 43 raised in the same herd.
In spring [2005], China restricted the FMD Asia 1 outbreaks to 5
provincial regions: Beijing, its neighboring province of Hebei,
eastern China's Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, and northwestern
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. [See an interactive administrative
map of China at:
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/03/content_815413.htm>].
The disease was reported on 2 cow farms in Tai'an City, Shandong and
Jiangsu's Wuxi City in early April 2005.
Early in May, local veterinary authorities also confirmed the
outbreak in the Hoboksar area of Xinjiang, Yanqing County of Beijing
and Hebei's Sanhe City.
By late May, medical workers had culled about 4000 cattle across the
country, mostly cows. For each culled animal, the central and local
governments offer compensation ranging from 4000 yuan (USD 496) to
6000 yuan (USD 744), according to the ministry.
FMD is a highly contagious degenerative viral disease attacking
cattle, pigs and other cloven-hoofed animals. It is not considered
dangerous to humans.

China confirmed Friday [30 Dec 2005] an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD], type Asia 1, in a farm in East China's Shandong
Province.
91 cattle have been culled in the farm in the Changqing District in
the provincial capital of Jinan where the outbreak was reported.
Some cattle on a farm developed symptoms of bad appetite and fever on
6 Dec 2005, and 48 cattle had fallen ill by 25 Dec, Xinhua News
Agency reported.
The provincial veterinary bureau reported the case to the health
ministry after initial tests on 26 Dec 2005. It was confirmed by the
state laboratory for FMD control on 29 Dec 2005.
Apart from culling the entire herd to which the sick cattle belonged,
the Shandong provincial government and the Ministry of Agriculture
also ordered an immediate disinfection and quarantine of the outbreak
site, as well as a thorough inoculation of all vulnerable animals in
the region.
Epidemic monitoring to be enhanced
-----------------------------------
Every village in China should have an epidemic monitoring worker next
year, to ensure animal disease and death in remote rural areas can be
reported and diagnosed in a timely fashion.
A contingency team of consisting of experts will be set up under the
Ministry of Agriculture to cope with major outbreaks among livestock.
These actions are among a raft of countermeasures the ministry plans
for 2006 to effectively control any animal infections, chief
veterinary officer Jia Youling said this week.
"As epidemics like bird flu and FMD are likely to break out
sporadically, the situation this winter and next spring still allows
for no optimism, " he said. Epidemic prevention and control could be
arduous in 2006, Jia warned.
China reported 31 outbreaks of fatal bird flu among poultry in 2005.
In July, _Streptococcus suis_, a pig-borne bacterium, killed 38
people in Southwest China's Sichuan Province.
All outbreaks have been stamped out, according to ministry sources.
But avian influenza virulence has become stronger, as the virus has
killed large flocks of migrating birds and waterfowl, which in the
past only carried the virus and rarely fell ill, Jia said. It has
also infected 7 people this year, involving 3 fatalities.
In addition, risks remain that other animal diseases may transmit to
humans, and foreign epidemics such as mad cow disease might make
their way into China, Jia warned.
Despite steady efforts to improve preparedness and reinforce
prevention efforts in 2005, epidemic control at grassroots level
still needs to be strengthened, Jia said. Therefore, the country will
step up training of anti-epidemic workers for townships and villages,
and prioritize vaccination against major animal infections in 2006,
including bird flu and Newcastle disease for poultry, and FMD for
cattle, pigs and sheep, he said.
Aside from closely monitoring epidemics nationwide, animal disease
reporting mechanisms will be further improved in rural communities,
according to Jia.
By the end of 2005, China had 635 000 people engaged in monitoring
and reporting epidemic situations in villages, but such workers are
not available in every village. [The total number of villages in
China -- with directly elected village chiefs -- exceeds 660 000. -
Mod.AS]
"We'll strive to ensure all villages will have monitoring and
reporting workers," Jia said.
In emergency responses to outbreaks, the ministry will build an
emergency taskforce composed of experts from its affiliated
institutions in 2006, and similar contingency teams must be launched
at provincial levels, he said.
To improve quality of veterinary drugs, all producers that fail to
meet GMP (good manufacturing practice) standards by 30 Jun 2005 will
have their licences revoked, the official said.
Despite the epidemics, China's animal husbandry industry [profit?] is
expected to reach 1300 billion yuan (USD 160 billion) in 2005, a jump
of nearly 30 per cent from 5 years ago, according to Shen Zhenzhao,
director of the ministry's Animal Husbandry Department.
Intensive farming also gathered steam in 2005. In swine farming, for
example, 34 per cent of the livestock came from farms that each
raised at least 50 pigs. The percentage was 11 points [percent?]
higher than 5 years ago, Shen said.

[It seems that FMD of serotype Asia 1 has become, or remains, endemic
in China. The recent outbreaks in Russia along its borders with
northeastern China may indicate the prevalence of the virus in the
adjacent Heilongjiang province, and probably Jilin. These provinces
have not been included among the 5 officially notified by China as
infected. Previous outbreaks caused by FMD serotype O illuminate the
need for investigations regarding its possible presence as well.
The FMD situation in China was discussed earlier this year in a
Special Disease Analysis Report (Information compiled by EMPRES
working with the EUFMD Commission Secretariat, FAO); see
20050624.1774. The report included the following concluding remark:
"The extension of Asia-1 to eastern China may allow significant
exposure of pigs. In general for FMD, pig infections are of
significance, since aerosol excretion provides a potent source of
airborne virus for ruminants, and the virus contamination and
survival in meat is more likely than in ruminants, providing a
vehicle for infection to spread to other locations (including
international)".
Enhanced surveillance in pigs is clearly needed.
The current Chinese resolution to improve the surveillance and
control of infectious animal diseases, an issue of great concern --
for China, her neighbours and the world -- is indeed encouraging.
Regarding FMD alone, it includes vaccinating (at least once a year!)
more than 900 million animals of susceptible species (FAO statistics
for 2004, in millions: Cattle -- 106.5; buffaloes -- 22.3; pigs --
472.9; sheep -- 155.7; goats -- 183.4), against one or more
serotypes. This is an exceptionally ambitious undertaking.
Combined with the other mentioned issues -- effective control of the
manufacture, testing, certification, and field application of animal
vaccines; implementing disease surveillance in all villages; as well
as improving the diagnostic capacities and (last but not least)
improving overall communication -- the Chinese animal-health
authorities have a huge task ahead. In view of the approaching New
Year's festivities, this seems a favoured time to wish them success.
