Chytridiomycosis -- a disease that is wiping out amphibians around
the world -- has jumped across the Panama Canal, report scientists
writing in the journal EcoHealth. The news is a worrying development
for Panama's rich biodiversity of amphibians east of the canal.

Chytridiomycosis is caused by _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, a
fungal pathogen that has been implicated in the extinction of more
than 100 species of frogs and toads since the early 1980s. While
scientists don't yet know the origin of the fungus, they suspect it
might be the African clawed frog, a species that has been shipped
around the world for research purposes. The fungus is highly
transmissible and has spread to at least 4 continents, in some cases
probably introduced unintentionally by humans in the treads of their
shoes. As it spreads, the disease lays waste to more than 80 percent
of amphibians across a wide range of habitats, including those that
are undisturbed by humans. Some researchers have suggested that
climate change could be creating conditions that exacerbate the
impact of the pathogen -- which predominantly affects highland
species -- although the theory is still controversial.

In Panama scientists have been closely monitoring the spread of the
pathogen as well as setting up emergency conservation measures to
capture wild frogs and safeguard them in captivity until the disease
is controlled or at least better understood. Still there has been
cautious hope that the Panama Canal would serve as a natural barrier
to slow or even stop the spread of chytrid to eastern Panama, a
particularly species-rich region that had so far avoided the
decimation seen in western Panama and Costa Rica. Now an
international team of researchers report that _B. dendrobatidis_ has
been detected in 3 species east of the Panama Canal at Soberania
National Park. Although the scientists note that the results are
preliminary and more work needs to be done to determine the origin
and incidence of the chytridiomycosis in Soberania, the finding is
bad news for Panama's amphibians.

"Our results suggest that Panama's diverse and not fully described
amphibian communities east of the canal are at risk," the authors
write. "Precise predictions of future disease emergence events are
not possible until factors underlying disease emergence, such as
dispersal, are understood. However, if the fungal pathogen spreads in
a pattern consistent with previous disease events in Panama, then
detection of [_B. dendrobatidis_] at Torti and other areas east of
the Panama Canal is imminent."

The scientists say that physical barriers to the spread of chytrid --
including salt water, deforested lowlands where high temperatures
kill the fungus, and the Panama Canal -- are being "easily overcome"
in Panama by "human movement of the pathogen." In other words, human
activities like tourism, scientific research, and construction are
facilitating the epidemic. The authors suggest that measures to
reduce transportation of chytrid, such as "bleaching boots and
cleaning field gear between sites, and providing information at
eco-lodges" could help contain the disease.

Adding to the gloom for amphibians
----------------------------------
But even the containment of chytrid might not be enough to save
amphibians, which face a barrage of other threats including
pollution, the introduction of alien species, habitat destruction,
over-collection, and climate change. According to the Global
Amphibian Assessment, a comprehensive survey of the world's 6000
known species of frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians,
about one-third of amphibians are classified as threatened with
extinction. Scientists say the worldwide decline of amphibians is one
of the world's most pressing environmental concerns, one that may
portend greater threats to the ecological balance of the planet.
Because amphibians have highly permeable skin and spend a portion of
their life in water and on land, they are sensitive to environmental
change and can act as the proverbial "canary in a coal mine,"
indicating the relative health of an ecosystem. As they die,
scientists are left wondering what plant or animal group could follow.

In an effort to save the most at-risk species, last year [2007] saw
the launch of the Amphibian Ark, an initiative by zoos, aquariums,
and botanical gardens to establish captive populations for 500
species at about USD 100 000 per species. Overall the coalition is
looking to raise USD 400 million over 5 years for long-term research,
protecting critical habitats, reducing trade in amphibians for food
and pets, and establishing captive breeding programs. Amphibian Ark
hopes to return rescued species to the wild once chytrid and other
threats have been controlled.

[Biosecurity is a not a buzz word, it is a practice. The practice
must extend to all aspects dealing with animals and diseases. It
extends into filed investigations of every kind. Clearly this fungus
is nothing to be toyed with. There is not enough information on its
origin or its mode of transmission but there is piling up of a
laundry list of the species it affects. - Mod.TG]
