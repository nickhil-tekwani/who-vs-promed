[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region when feasible. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there have been 3 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, 3 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau. A total of 1771 imported cases have been reported. The imported cases were all in Guangdong province. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 2 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, both imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The previous report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was on 4 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported. Prior to that 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020 and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 51 cases and no new deaths compared with 39 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (4 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 62 consecutive days. Today's (5 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 43 cases were locally transmitted, and 8 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (23), Incheon (10), Gyeonggi (7), and 1 each in Gangwan, Chungnam, and Gyeongbuk. Imported cases were in Incheon (1), Gyeonggi (1), Gyeongnam (1), and Quarantine (5). Note that 10 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page, notice 356 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030), update on clusters from 5 Jun 2020:
- Coupang logistics center cluster in Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi Province, 4 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 124* cases -- 79 employees, 45 contacts: Gyeonggi (57), Incheon (46), Seoul (21)
- Newly planted churches in Seoul Metro Region, 10 new cases were confirmed. In total, 76* cases have been confirmed -- related to church (30), contacts (46): Incheon (42), Seoul (20), Gyeonggi (14)
- Richway in Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 19 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 29 cases have been confirmed. All persons who have visited Richway (Seoul Gwangak-gu Siheungdae-ro 552 Seocheon Building Floor 8) between 21 May and 3 Jun 2020 are advised to get tested regardless of symptoms. Seoul (18), Gyeonggi (5), Incheon (4), Chungnam (2)
- Seoul Seocho-gu family, 1 additional case was confirmed. The new case was a staff at AXA General Insurance Call Center in Jongno-gu, Seoul. In total, 7 cases have been confirmed related to this cluster.
- Jesus Malsseum Silcheon Church, 1 new case was confirmed on [1 Jun 2020] and 5 cases have been confirmed in total to date. Investigation on the chain of transmission and contact tracing are underway.
- In Dalseo-gu, Daegu City, a middle school student who presented with fever and sputum was tested through a screening clinic and was confirmed by a positive test. Investigation on the chain of transmission and measures to stop further transmission are underway.
- Through testing of all persons related to boarding schools in Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongbuk Province, a teacher at Gyeongbuk Food Science Meister High School tested positive. The school has switched to remote learning and disinfection of the school facility is underway.
- The data on chains of transmission for the infection during the last 2 weeks show that most (73.2%, 385 cases) are local community clusters. Also, 9.7% (51 cases) are under investigation (on the chain of transmission); 96.6% (372 cases) of the local cluster cases are in Seoul Metropolitan Region; and 74.5% (38 cases) of the cases under investigation are in Seoul Metropolitan Region.
- Recently, COVID-19 transmissions are occurring through various venues such as religious small group meetings, PC cafes, after-school academies in Seoul Metropolitan Region (Seoul and nearby areas) with high population density and foot traffic. If the transmission continues and occurs at a highly crowded and confined space with a large number of people, a massive outbreak may occur at any time.

Impression: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts), and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one superspreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 234 531 cases, including 33 774 deaths, up by 518 cases and 95 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (4 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 177 cases and 88 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. The major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 402 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4862_0_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Liguria. These 4 provinces combined today (5 Jun 2020) account for 93.1% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the most newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (420), and the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), with another 3 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (420), followed by Piedmont (49), Emilia-Romagna (17), Liguria (14), and Lazio (9).

Italy is now 32 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 16 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. The increase in positive cases in Lombardy related to screening activities bears watching.

[As of 5 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 167 156, including 8134 deaths, an increase of 2886 new cases and 63 deaths since 4 Jun 2020, and a decrease in daily newly confirmed cases from 3574 newly confirmed cases and slight increase in deaths from the 59 reported in the preceding 24-hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear there is now a 2nd wave most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.

The daily number of newly confirmed cases has reached an all-time high since the epidemic began in Iran.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. I have tried to find where the 12 800 newly confirmed cases in New York State came from, unless it is the addition of enhance screening and contact tracing that has begun. These data do not sync with the official published data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 965 708 including 111 390 deaths, an increase from 1 924 051 cases and 110 173 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York State represents 20.2% of the cumulative case reports and 30.7% of the newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours (if there is an explanation for this major jump), showing a decrease in the proportion of cumulative cases and a major increase in daily newly confirmed cases. New York City had a cumulative total of 202 829 as of 13:00 EDT on 5 Jun 2020 (an increase of 510 newly confirmed cases since 4 Jun 2020) including 17 055 confirmed deaths (an increase of 63 deaths since 4 Jun 2020) and an additional 4727 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are New York, Michigan, California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Illinois, Maryland, and Georgia.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, Florida, and Maryland. A total of 35 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) when known.
