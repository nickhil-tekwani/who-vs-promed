Foot-and-mouth disease recurs
-----------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease recurs
-----------------------------
[On Mon 19 Jan 2009] the National Animal Health Department reported
that foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is spreading in the country after
new outbreaks were reported in Long An and Kon Tum provinces.

The department reported that it found 17 cows in Nhut Minh District
and 56 others in Chau Thanh District of the Mekong Delta's Long An
Province infected with the contagious disease. These cow samples are
positive with foot-and-mouth disease virus type A.

According to the provincial animal health, these cows are bought from
small traders and re-sold to a cow-raising project managed by the
province's Women Association.

The Long An Animal Health Department said that they had isolated the
outbreaks and disinfected the environment to prevent the disease from
spreading out.

The National Animal Health Department also said on Monday [19 Jan
2009] the dangerous disease continued to hit the Central Highlands
province of Kon Tum where 4 cows in Dak Glei Commune were killed by
the disease.

Kon Tum Province's Animal Health Department said that outbreaks were
also reported in 6 other communes in the provinces.

The department said the outbreaks recurred due to the cows being
transported from Long An to the highland province. At least, 111 cows
have been transported from Long An to the province.

[Viet Nam reported to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
an outbreak of FMD serotype Asia 1 on 18 Jul 2007; this outbreak
spread in the central area (Quang Tri) and was declared to have
become endemic on 23 Feb 2008 (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5748>).

According to PRO/MBDS posting 20081218.3973, FMD virus serotype A
appeared during December 2008 in the central province of Nghe An and
was subsequently detected also in the province Ha Tinh in the central
region and in the provinces of Yen Bai and Thai Binh in the north.

The current newswire indicates a further spread of FMDV serotype A to
Kon Tum province in the central region and Long An in the south. This
means that the serotype A has spread to all 3 regions of the country;
