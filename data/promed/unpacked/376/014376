N.Y. lists anthrax victim's death as homicide
------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK (CNN) -- The city's medical examiner's office Wednesday listed the
death of the first person to in New York to die from inhalation anthrax, as
a homicide. "Spores were delivered with criminal intent," said Ellen
Borakove in the city's medical examiner's office. The cause of death was
confirmed to be inhalation anthrax after an autopsy was completed at noon
Wednesday, she said. The affected woman complained of chills and headache
at work Thursday. She came to work Friday but co-workers said she seemed
very ill. By Sunday night the illness had progressed, and she checked
herself into the hospital around 11 p.m. At that time the case was reported
to the mayor's office.
The deceased woman, 61, worked in a basement supply room of Manhattan Eye,
Ear and Throat Hospital, or MEET. She died early Wednesday morning. "So far
we have not been able to trace this back to any specific thing that put her
in contact with anthrax," said New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik.
"We have 2 teams out there, criminal and clinical."
The affected woman might have had spores on her clothing when she checked
into the hospital on Sunday night, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday.
Items of clothing tested were a pair of jeans, a shirt, a sweater, and
sneakers. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said 2 preliminary
tests from specimens taken from the clothing were not definitive and
"further testing has to be done." Environmental samples taken at the
woman's workplace and home have tested negative for anthrax, and no
contaminated letter has been linked to the case, officials said.
Giuliani said one hospital employee among several tested as a group
"complained of having a lesion." A biopsy was sent to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for testing. "At this point, people should
not jump to conclusions about a second case," Giuliani said.
Giuliani called on the New York Police Department and the FBI to re-create
the deceased woman's steps of the past 2 weeks to track down "where could
she possibly have contracted inhalation anthrax. There is no quick, easy
thing to attribute it to."
Antibiotics are being offered to everyone who has been inside the building
for more than an hour since 11 Oct, including employees, patients, and
visitors.
One neighbor told CNN that the deceased woman had "not been out of New York
in 5 years" and that her last trip abroad was to Jerusalem in 1996.
The storage area where the woman worked shared space for a time with the
mailroom, but her co-workers said she never handled mail. A total of 40
environmental samples from MEET tested negative for anthrax contamination,
and 30 samples from the woman's home in the Bronx also showed no signs of
the bacteria.

Miscellaneous developments
-----------------------------------
- State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday traces of what
appeared to be anthrax were detected in 2 mail bags in the U.S. Embassy in
Vilnius, Lithuania. More testing is under way and the embassy mailroom has
been sealed, he said.
- [Suspected lesions have been noted at the Manhattan Hospital, in a
Delaware postal worker, and at a mail distribution center in Camden County,
New Jersey.]
- Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon said Wednesday postal equipment sent to a
company in his state to be repaired has tested positive for a small amount
of anthrax spores. He said he was concerned the U.S. Postal Service did not
quickly notify Indiana officials about the equipment's exposure to anthrax
in Washington.

Anthrax Found at ABC
-----------------------------
ABCNEWS announced Tuesday that tests confirmed the presence of anthrax in a
small mailroom at the network's headquarters in New York. The 7-month-old
son of an ABCNEWS producer who visited the building tested positive for
cutaneous anthrax earlier this month, but the cause of the infant's
infection was not immediately known. The baby is recovering.
ABCNEWS President David Westin said the entire second floor, where the
contaminated mailroom is located, has been disinfected.

Anthrax - Weapon Of Mass Destruction -- Over 60 Scientific Government
Reports Available From The National Technical Information Service
-----------------------------------------
SPRINGFIELD, Va.: Throughout the 1990s, the federal government recognized
the dangers of biological weapons as weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In
1995, the United States made one of its highest priorities developing
effective capabilities to detect, prevent, defeat, and manage the
consequences of nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) materials or weapons
use by terrorists.
In response to requests from researchers, subject specialists at NTIS have
searched its database of nearly 3 million U.S. government scientific,
technical, and business related information products. A bibliography of the
reports they found on anthrax can be accessed on the NTIS website at :
