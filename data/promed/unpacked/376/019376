[From a previous ProMED-mail post: "There never has been a documented case
of human-to-human transmission of rabies, except during corneal transplants"
The accent should be on the word "documented." There have been anecdotal
reports of human-to-human transmission prior to these most recent ones.
Since the report from Ethiopia comes from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, I wonder why they did not choose a wider form of
distribution than the Ethiopian Medical Journal.
The material Dr. Hartmann was quoting from was developed in order to
minimize the inappropriate use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in
hospitals following the diagnosis of a human rabies case. It is striking
that world-wide the number of human rabies deaths is estimated by WHO to be
between 35 000 and 50 000 annually, many of whom are cared for in
healthcare facilities, without a documented or even recently reported case
of transmission to a healthcare worker. Yet it is not uncommon for 50 or
more healthcare workers in the U.S. to receive PEP following the diagnosis
of a human case; in 1984, PEP was administered to 179 persons in
association with a case in California, the highest number reported in the
U.S. since 1980 (Noah et al, Annals of Internal Medicine, 1998;128:922-930).
We have used a 3-pronged approach to the management of healthcare worker
exposure to human rabies for all 5 cases that have occurred since 1993:
(1) distribution of a Fact Sheet titled "Is There Risk From Contact With
Rabies Patients?" from which the quote about lack of documented cases came
(which still applies to healthcare workers); (2) In-service sessions with
healthcare workers conducted by someone with expertise on rabies; and (3)
administration of a "Healthcare Worker Rabies Exposure Questionnaire" based
on one used by CDC, that serves as both a tool to collect information about
possible healthcare worker exposure and an additional educational tool
(most of those filling it out realize at the end that they have not been
exposed). With these tools we have reduced the inappropriate use of PEP
while not denying it to any potentially exposed person who requests it, and
don't believe based on the available information that our approach should
be modified.
