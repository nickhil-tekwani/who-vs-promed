Some of the effects from the massive flooding that struck the Pacific island nation in January [2012] are still making themselves known. The Fiji Ministry of Health advised the public Friday [27 Apr 2012] that anyone experiencing the symptoms of leptospirosis needs to seek medical attention immediately. This comes after reports of 7 confirmed fatalities from the bacterial disease. In addition, there are 13 other deaths, although not confirmed, that are suspected to be due to the pathogenic organism.

National adviser for communicable diseases Dr. Mike Kama said, 279 people have contracted leptospirosis since the January floods and 85 per cent of these are from the Western Division.

Other post-flood diseases being watched by government health officials include typhoid and dengue fever.

Increases in leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfalls and typhoons when flooding of fresh water occurs and rats search for higher ground.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic, but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira.

Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a disaster (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/leptoclin.asp). The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into Four Major Divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather).
