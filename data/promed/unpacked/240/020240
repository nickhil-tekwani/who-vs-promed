Special attention on chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Indian Ocean
territories was implemented after its spreading from Eastern Africa
to Comoros, Mauritius, Mayotte, and La Reunion islands in late 2004
(1). Since the end of La Reunion outbreak in June 2006, no new cases
were reported by local authorities or the networks for imported viral
diseases. In Madagascar, CHIKV and dengue virus type 1 were
responsible for a large outbreak in 2006 in Toamasina (Tamatave),
coastal town located 350 km [217.5 mi] northeast from Antananarivo
(2). Then outbreaks caused by CHIKV were confirmed in February 2007
in the Sava region (North-East coast), in March 2007 in Antsiranana
(Northern Coast) and in May 2007 in Mahajanga (North-West coast).

Since March 2009, chikungunya confirmed cases have been reported by
the national sentinel surveillance network of the Malagasy Ministry
of Health. These cases occurred in the Toamasina. The 1st case was
confirmed by RT-PCR and virus isolation by the National Reference
Centre for arboviruses at the Institut Pasteur, Antananarivo, on 13
Mar 2009. In May [2009], 2 confirmed cases and one probable case (IgM
positive) were reported. By now 2 confirmed cases have been
registered since [1 Jun 2009]. The riposte to this alert has been
organized by the Ministry of Health including mosquito (_Aedes
albopictus_) control measures and public and medical staff awareness.
An epidemic situation has not been detected and the beginning of the
austral winter will contribute to stop the transmission.

On 29 May [2009], a 67-year-old man returning from Madagascar was
been hospitalized in Limoges, district Haute-Vienne (Central-Western
France) for an acute febrile syndrome associated with arthralgia and
cutaneous rash. Chikungunya diagnosis (IgM and RT-PCR positive) was
confirmed by the National Reference Centre for arboviruses (Institut
Pasteur, Paris). No recognized competent vector for chikungunya
[virus] (that is, _Aedes albopictus_) has been in evidence at present
in the Haute-Vienne department, so this imported case does not
represent any risk of chikungunya endemization in this French region.
[Nor is there a risk of a seasonal outbreak. - Mod.TY]

Altogether, these data support an active circulation of chikungunya
virus in the main Indian Ocean's island. Reinforcement of
surveillance should be organized to prevent the risk of potential
re-emergence of the virus in surrounding archipelagoes. Specific
information of persons visiting these islands, focusing on individual
mosquito bites prevention, should be intensified both locally and in
Northern Hemisphere countries.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Grandadam, Renaudat, Despres, Andriamandimby,
Reynes, Randrianasolo, and Hantz for providing this report. This is
yet another case of long-distance, international movement of
chikungunya virus. Fortunately, there are no competent vectors yet
established in the region of France where the patient became ill.

Southeast Asia. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya: short epidemiological update, Southeast Asia -- [as of] 9 Jun 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, countries in Southeast Asia have been severely
affected by outbreaks of chikungunya fever. India was hit in 2006
after a quiescence of 32 years, following the re-emergence in Kenya
in 2004 and the spread in the Indian Ocean islands in 2005.
Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka have also been affected by
chikungunya. In 2008, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia
reported outbreaks.

Thailand
--------
In Thailand, in 2009, a large outbreak has affected mainly the
southern region, some of the areas being touristic destinations. A
total of 24 029 cases have been notified from 1 Jan-2 Jun [2009] in
36 provinces (no deaths are currently reported). The most affected
areas are the southern provinces: Songula (reporting 36.3 percent of
the cases), Narathiwat (28.6 percent), Pattani (14.2 percent), and
Yala (8.6 percent) (1). The 1st cases in Phuket were reported in
March-April [2009]. From 1 May-2 Jun [2009], a total of 5741 cases
were notified; for 9 provinces, it concerned the 1st reported cases
of this year.

Chikungunya infection seems to quickly be spreading from the southern
provinces to the upper parts of the country. Some confirmed cases are
now reported in provinces in Middle, North, and North-East of
Thailand (see map [at URL above]).

Malaysia
--------
A total of 2504 cases have been reported in Malaysia from the
beginning of the year 2009 to 30 May. Kedah is the most affected
province (reporting 27.3 percent of the cases), then Selangor,
Kelantan, Perak, and Sarawak. In week 21 (24-30 May), 475 cases have
been reported, mostly from the Northern provinces: Kedah (reporting
48.2 percent of the cases) and Penang (17.6 percent). The week before
(week 20) 475 cases have been notified, mostly for Kedah province
(87.8 percent) (2).

Singapore
---------
In Singapore, since the beginning of the year [2009] up to week 21
(30 May 2009), 275 cases have been notified including 28 imported
cases and 247 cases following autochthonous transmission (3 of whom
occurred in week 21) (3). In March 2009, one case of chikungunya
infection was identified in a French patient returning from a short
trip to Singapore.
