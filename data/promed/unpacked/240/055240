More Pennsylvania salmonella cases linked to chain
---------------------------------------------
More than 60 cases of salmonella poisoning have now been traced to a
convenience store chain where people ate, prompting a food supplier to
quarantine some of its inventory, authorities said Thu 15 Jul 2004.
Health officials initially traced 34 cases of salmonella poisoning,
throughout western Pennsylvania, to Sheetz stores, which has pulled the
lettuce and Roma tomatoes suspected of causing the illness.
The Altoona-based chain also switched produce suppliers, and disinfected
its sandwich counters, at more than 300 stores in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina.
Coronet Foods, of Wheeling, W.Va., which supplies produce to Sheetz, said
it had stopped buying and processing Roma tomatoes pending its own
investigation. The company also quarantined its remaining inventory,
reorganized the tomato processing line, and notified growers and suppliers.
In a statement, Coronet officials noted that sliced Roma tomatoes make up 1
percent of their line, and, most of it is distributed to Sheetz.
The Pennsylvania Agriculture Department was testing food samples Thu 15 Jul
2004 to confirm the presence and type of salmonella bacteria.
Salmonella bacteria can contaminate food or water, and those who are
infected by it generally suffer from diarrhea, fever, and cramps for up to
3 days. It can be fatal in rare cases.
Health officials said, on Thu 15 Jul 2004, that there were more than 60
confirmed cases (50 in 12 Pennsylvania counties). In Maryland, public
health officials confirmed at least 14 cases; West Virginia had one
confirmed case.
Ohio health officials were unaware of any cases linked to the convenience
stores. But, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
there were an unspecified number of cases in Ohio involving people who ate
at Sheetz stores.
Sheetz officials did not immediately return calls on Thu 15 Jul 2004.

FDA News, 16 Jul 2004, for immediate release
---------------------------------------------
Media Inquiries: 301-827-6242
Consumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA
FDA issues alert on food borne illness outbreaks in Pennsylvania and
mid-Atlantic States.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an alert to
consumers that 57 cases of salmonellosis may be associated with food
purchased at deli counters, contained in Sheetz Gas Station locations, in
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia, between 2 Jul through 9 Jul 2004.
The agency is working with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, other
state and county agencies, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to determine the cause and scope of the problem. At this time,
no product has been implicated, and the investigation is continuing.
Salmonella is an organism which causes serious, and sometimes fatal,
infection in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with
weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often
experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result
in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe
illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e. infected aneurysms),
endocarditis and arthritis.
Sheetz is a mid-Atlantic chain of gas stations with deli take-out sections.
Sheetz stores are located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia, and eastern Ohio, often along interstate highways.
Individuals who believe they may have experienced the same symptoms of
illness, after consuming food from this company, are urged to contact their
local health department. FDA will keep consumers abreast of the
investigation as information becomes available.

First samples from Sheetz negative for salmonella
---------------------------------------------
The 1st batch of food samples taken from Sheetz convenience stores, in
Pennsylvania, showed no trace of the salmonella bacteria that has sickened
dozens of people, all of whom ate at Sheetz stores.
State health and agriculture officials said the negative tests results
don't mean that people didn't get sick from eating the chain's food.
"Certainly the common thread is eating at Sheetz, and specifically at the
deli section," said Richard McGarvey, a state Health Department spokesman.
The negative test results "likely mean that the particular lot (of food)
that was causing the problem has been all used up" before the food samples
could be taken.
The test results, announced Fri 16 Jul 2004, came from 44 samples of
lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and mayonnaise taken from 10 Pennsylvania Sheetz
stores by the state Department of Agriculture. Results on the rest of the
197 samples taken aren't expected until this weekend.
Also on Fri 16 Jul 2004, the Food and Drug administration said it had
counted 57 people in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia who had
eaten at Sheetz stores and were sickened, but that was before Pennsylvania
health officials updated the number of Sheetz-related cases in that state
to 70.
Dozens more people are sick in Ohio, Virginia, and Maryland, but, health
officials haven't yet determined if those people also ate at the
Altoona-based chain. The FDA didn't immediately return calls for updated
interstate information.
Sheetz pulled all the tomatoes and lettuce in its 300-plus stores, after
the salmonella cases were 1st reported earlier this week [week ending Sun
18 Jul 2004]. The stores sanitized their deli areas, switched suppliers,
and brought in new produce.
State health officials said there is no evidence that Sheetz employees
spread the bacteria, and the multiple locations indicate that a tainted
food supply is most likely. Those sickened in Pennsylvania got sandwiches
from at least 16 stores in the Pittsburgh area, and along the Pennsylvania
Turnpike, company officials have said.
All the food samples tested by the state Department of Agriculture were
collected before the new produce was brought in, said Kristina Watson, a
state agriculture spokeswoman.
A lack of positive test results could prevent, or delay, efforts by the
Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, to
trace the source of the bacteria.
The FDA and CDC wait for specific food samples to test positive before they
review shipping manifests, and other records, that show where that food
originated. From there, federal officials interview others along the supply
chain to try to determine how the food was contaminated.
State health officials believe tainted tomatoes, or lettuce, or both, are
to blame, because those who got sick ate those items, and, because tests
show they ingested a kind of salmonella that is usually found on fresh
produce. State agriculture officials included samples of cheese and
mayonnaise, because most victims ate those foods also, even though the type
of salmonella found in this outbreak is usually not present on egg or dairy
foods.
"We want to make sure we're covering everything," Watson said. "We feel
it's important to test more (foods) than to test less, and maybe miss
something."
Salmonellosis, an infection caused by salmonella bacteria that can
contaminate food, or water, generally causes diarrhea, fever, and cramps
for up to 3 days. It is not often fatal. The bacteria are spread through
the feces of infected animals and humans.

[We, perhaps, have prematurely labeled this thread as "tomatoes,
convenience stores," before the actual etiology has been confirmed. As
there is still a high-likelihood of involvement, rather than add ":NOT" to
the thread, we shall continue this title, pending firm confirmation. While
tomatoes have not frequently been associated with salmonella transmission,
there was the earlier outbreak of _Salmonella javiana_ associated with Roma
tomatoes in 2002 (see references below).
As the 3rd article correctly states, the absence of identification of the
organism in the food samples does not rule out the possibility that earlier
batches of the food items were responsible for this outbreak. If all
specimens are negative, the epidemiological investigations may be the only
source of information for identifying the most likely source for the
outbreak. Obviously, it is "neater" if one can actually culture the
organisms from the implicated food(s), but, sometimes it remains as
"implicated" by virtue of the epidemiological investigation. Remember, John
Snow did implicate the Broad Street pump as the source of infection in the
cholera outbreak in London in the pre-Moore swab and bacterial culturing
days. We await further information on the final results of the laboratory
testing. - Mod.MPP]
