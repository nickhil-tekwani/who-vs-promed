Foot and Mouth Disease: Commission adopts urgent protection measures
after case in wild boar in Bulgaria
---------------
The European Commission adopted last night [6 Jan 2011] urgent
protection measures after a wild boar, which was shot by hunters at
the end of 2010 in Bulgaria, tested positive to foot and mouth
disease (FMD). The Commission's decision aims to reinforce control
measures for FMD already taken by the competent Bulgarian authorities.

In particular, the commission's decision defines the high risk area
(the province of Burgas) and low risk areas (the surrounding
provinces of Yambol, Sliven, Shumen and Varna). The dispatch of live
susceptible animals (e.g. pigs, cattle, sheep, etc.) from both the
high and low risk areas is prohibited. According to the decision, the
trade of semen, ova and embryos and other products of susceptible
animals coming from the high risk area is also prohibited. There are
no restrictions for the products of susceptible animals coming from
the low risk areas.

The decision also provides for the rules applicable to the trade of
safe products from the high and low-risk areas that either had been
produced before the restrictions (from raw materials originating
outside the restricted areas) or that had undergone treatment, which
is effective in inactivating the FMD virus.

The Bulgarian authorities had informed the European Commission on
Wednesday [5 Jan 2011] about the FMD case. Hunters shot 3 wild boars
at Bulgaria's Makevtci area in the Burgas region on 30 Dec 2010. The
area is located 2 km from the border with Turkey. One of the boars
displayed feet lesions. Preliminary laboratory tests for the
detection of the FMD viral antigen gave positive results, which
indicate a recent infection. Samples have been sent to the EU
Reference Laboratory for FMD for further confirmation.

The competent authorities also informed the commission about putting
in place measures provided for in Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29
Sep 2003 on community measures for the control of FMD.

The measures provided in the directive include epidemiological
investigation, suspension of hunting and a ban in feeding wild
animals, placing under official surveillance holdings keeping animals
of susceptible species, inspection by an official veterinarian of all
wild animals shot or found dead. They also include surveillance
programmes and prevention measures applicable to the holdings keeping
animals of susceptible species and, if necessary, in their
surroundings, including the transport and movement of animals of
susceptible species within, from, and to the area, etc.

This issue will be discussed with all the member states at next
week's meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal
Health (SCFCAH) in Brussels.

Foot and Mouth Disease in Wild Boar in Bulgaria, January 2011 -
Preliminary Outbreak Assessment
-------

1. Disease Report
-----------------
Bulgaria has informed the European Commission of an outbreak of foot
and mouth disease (FMD) in 3 wild boar in the Burgas region (European
Commission, 2011; see map). The location of the boar is just 2 km
from the Turkish border. They were shot during the regular hunting
season, but foot lesions on one of the boar prompted testing for FMD,
which detected strain O. Further characterisation is being undertaken
at IAH, Pirbright, the FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD
(WRLFMD). Disease control measures are in place.

2. Situation Assessment
------------------------
In the last 9 to 10 months, Turkey has reported over 1100 outbreaks
of FMD in all regions on the Asian (Anatolia) side of the country,
many of them identified as FMD strain O. According to the FMD World
Reference Laboratory, these were sequenced as FMD O ME-SA Pan
Asia(ANT-10), Pan Asia(SAN-09) and Pan Asia(FAR-09) isolates with
close relationship to isolates from Pakistan and Iran and with good
coverage offered by the O Manisa vaccine.

The exact reason for the high increase in outbreaks in Turkey in 2010
is unknown. Vaccination was being carried out, so it could be that
the vaccine is not working, due to either poor vaccine usage or poor
vaccine efficacy in the small ruminant population, leading to a
decrease in herd immunity and consequent increase in susceptibility.
However, to date, there have been no reports of disease on the
European (Thrace) side of Turkey.

Turkey, with support from the EU under EUFMD activities has worked
hard to improve the situation in the Thrace region, as part of the
West EurAsia FMD Control 2020 Roadmap, which aims for long term FMD
control in the region and to gaining disease-free status with
vaccination in the near future. To date, this appears to have been successful.

There are several possible routes of introduction of disease into the
wild boar, for example:
- the disease may be present in wild boar across all the region,
including EU and non-EU countries but was previously undetected;
- the wild boar were infected by contact with infected animals which
were illegally transported from infected regions such as Turkey;
- the wild boar were infected by contact with infectious material
(meat products, untreated dairy products, etc.) which was illegally
transported from infected regions such as Turkey;
- wild boar came into contact with other infectious material, such as
fomites on transport from infected regions or domestic waste products
including catering waste.

Full sequencing will indicate whether the wild boar were infected
with a strain similar to those in Turkey or if the disease has been
introduced from further afield (suggesting movement of people and
infected products), or whether the boar have come from another part
of northern Europe. The natural home range of a wild boar is in the
region of 10 000 hectares (100 sq/km) but they are not unknown to
travel large distances (Oliver & Leus, 2008).

Interestingly, there has been renewed concern about the level of
illegal immigrants crossing the border between Turkey and Greece with
an average of 245 people crossing each day and prompting the Greek
authorities to increase border security with a big fence. This
pathway is clearly a real threat to biosecurity as the illegal
immigrants may be bringing contaminated meat or dairy products with
them which are scavenged by wild boar.

According to TRACES and the Bulgarian authorities, no live pigs,
fresh pig meat or products of pig origin have been dispatched to the
UK from the Burgas region of Bulgaria.

3. Conclusions
---------------
We currently consider that there would be a constant low risk of the
introduction of FMD into the EU from any currently affected region.
This latest outbreak in wild boar would not significantly increase
the risk to the UK, as the risk of wild boar reaching the UK would be
considered negligible. Nevertheless, it is concerning that the
disease has crossed into the EU, and determining the source is
paramount, in particular whether the infection was introduced with
people and, if so, if further contamination may have occurred in the
region. We reiterate that it is important for all animal keepers and
veterinarians, not just those specialising in pigs, to report suspect
disease immediately, to maintain high levels of biosecurity to
prevent access of animals to infectious material and to uphold the
ban on swill feeding.

We will continue to monitor the situation.

full text, list of references and a map showing FMD outbreaks in
Turkey during 2010 including their serotype, please refer to the
original at the above URL.

Thrace, Turkey's territory on the western, European side of the
Bosphorus has been maintained for decades free of FMD as a buffer
zone meant to prevent the introduction of the disease into southeast
Europe from Asian Turkey (Anatolia), where FMD is endemic. In
contrast to Europe, where FMD vaccination has been discontinued (in
fact, prohibited) since 1992, Turkey's livestock is vaccinated. The
current vaccination scheme is the following:

- Mass vaccination of bovine animals twice a year;
- Mass vaccination of ovine and caprine animals, once a year.

The vaccines are produced by 3 contracted vaccine producers, one of
them being local.

The enhanced vaccination efforts during recent years are claimed to
have improved the FMD situation in Turkey. This has been expressed by
the declining number of recorded outbreaks (2006: 1557 reported
outbreaks, 2007 - 809, 2008 - 253, 2009 - 214). As indicated in the
above DEFRA review, the number has dramatically risen during 2010 to
exceed 1100. A partial explanation of this change may be found in the
following statement by Saban Aydemir, general coordinator of the
Turkish Veterinary Medical Association (TVHB), in September 2010.
Noting that FMD is also seen in large farms, as well as livestock
markets and villages, Aydemir said: "Most large farms hide the
existence of the disease as they are trying to protect their
commercial standing. Provincial Agriculture Directorate teams are
aware of the existence of the disease, but they do not want to
highlight the quarantine implementations" (see in archived
20100908.3226). In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine(s) used has
to be assured, and vaccination coverage, particularly in small
ruminants, improved (official 2009 data for Anatolia - 63 percent). A
recent report on Turkey's FMD control scheme and situation is
available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/excom79/App16.pdf>.

It will be surprising if the 3 discovered cases in wild boars on
Bulgaria's territory, 2 km from the Turkish border, remain solitary.
They may reflect a similar situation within the wild boar population
in adjacent Turkish Thrace. Surveillance in wildlife as well as
enhanced alertness in livestock in Thrace is indeed paramount.

The results of the serotyping and genotyping of the strain involved
are anticipated with great interest, as well as the conclusions and
decisions of early next week's meeting of the Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in Brussels. - Mod.AS]
