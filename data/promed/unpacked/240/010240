The number of people in Rockland County who have come down with mumps has
jumped to 152 as part of what state and federal health officials are
calling the largest outbreak of the disease nationwide in years. Just about
all local cases of the highly infectious disease are among Orthodox Jewish
and Hasidic residents of Monsey and New Square, according to the Rockland
Department of Health. So far, there is no indication that people outside
those communities are coming down with mumps, she said.

The outbreak started in August [2009] in a Sullivan County, NY summer camp
for Orthodox boys, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Health officials traced the outbreak to an 11 year old
camper who had recently returned from England, where at least 4000 people
have come down with the disease. That camper spread the illness to 25 other
people at the camp ranging in age from 9 to 30, with a median age of 12,
according to CDC.

When the campers went home later in the summer, they apparently brought the
disease with them to Jewish communities in Rockland and Orange counties,
the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, Lakewood, N.J., and Quebec [Canada],
according to health officials.

"The outbreak has spread and gradually increased in size and is now the
largest US mumps outbreak since 2006," CDC said in a bulletin. It's also
the largest outbreak in New York since 2005, according to Tom Allocco, a
spokesman for the state Department of Health. More than 300 cases have been
reported statewide outside of New York City, with half in Rockland and half
in Orange County, primarily in the [village of] Kiryas Joel, according to
health officials.

As of late October [2009], there were 79 confirmed cases in Brooklyn, 40
cases in Lakewood, New Jersey, and 15 cases in Quebec, primarily in
Montreal, according to CDC. At least 3 people have been hospitalized,
according to CDC. The median age of the patients is 14 years, and most (83
per cent) are male, according to the federal agency.

Mumps is caused by a virus that usually spreads through saliva and can
infect many parts of the body, especially the salivary glands. It can lead
to inflammation and swelling of the brain and other organs. It can cause
deafness and leave men sterile.

The vaccine, which also protects against measles and rubella, is given in 2
doses: one when a child is 12 months old and the other between the ages of
4 and 6 or when the child begins kindergarten. The vaccine [measles, mumps,
and rubella (MMR) vaccine] is thought to be 85 per cent effective during an
outbreak. At least 60 per cent of the people in Rockland who have
contracted mumps during the current outbreak had not been fully immunized,
Facelle said.

The Rockland Department of Health is reaching out to community leaders,
including rabbis and yeshiva directors, to stress the importance of
immunization, Facelle said. Many of the parents who were interviewed by
health officials indicated that they did not immunize their children
because of their religious beliefs. But local religious leaders said there
is nothing in Jewish law that prohibits vaccination. Rabbi David Eidensohn,
a frequent Orthodox Jewish commentator on family issues said: "Any parent
who doesn't get their child vaccinated is being foolish and endangering the
entire community." Dr Yakov Tendler, a Monsey internist whose patients
include many of the Orthodox community, said that he has treated some
adults with mumps who had been fully immunized but contracted the disease
from a child. "There are a lot of crazies out there who are putting their
children and everyone else at risk," he said.

Religious leaders have to make it clear that children must be vaccinated,
he said. "The rabbinic community has to chastise congregants who are not
vaccinating," he said.

[This outbreak, initiated at a summer camp in New York state where the
disease had been imported by a single camper, continues to extend
throughout New York State, almost entirely confined to Orthodox Jewish
communities, where there has been past reluctance in a minority of the
population to accept protective MMR vaccination.
