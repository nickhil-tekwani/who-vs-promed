USA (California): Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreaks at Nursing Homes
-------------------------------------------------
A virus causing symptoms similar to those of norovirus infection has
affected at least 600 people around Alameda County, including many elderly
and frail people in at least 13 nursing homes. County health officials
haven't confirmed that the sickness, which causes uncontrollable diarrhea
and vomiting for 24 to 48 hours, is caused by norovirus, which sickened
hundreds of cruise ship passengers last year. But whatever virus it is, it
has put health officials, firefighters, and nursing home administrators on
alert.
Since 6 Jan 2003, viral gastroenteritis has been found at nursing homes in
Alameda, Oakland, Livermore, Pleasanton, and Fremont. The number of cases
in each home has varied. At the Water's Edge Nursing Home in Alameda, at
least 50 percent of the 100 residents have been ill at one time or another
since Wed 5 Feb 2003, said director of nursing Darnelle Zimmerman. "No one
remembers seeing this many cases in Alameda County before," said Sherri
Willis with the Alameda County Public Health Department.
To stop the spread of the virus at nursing homes across the county,
residents are taking meals in their rooms instead of in the communal dining
room, social activities have been curtailed, and signs outside the homes
warn visitors of the virus. Staff members are required to wear gloves and
gowns in facilities grappling with the infection. The county has banned
staff from a facility with an outbreak from visiting or working in
unaffected nursing homes. In Alameda, a handful of firefighters who have
treated and transported sick patients are now sick themselves, Diaz said.
Fire officials have ordered all Alameda firefighters to use a bleach
solution to sterilize rig steering wheels, station counter-tops, floors,
hand-held radios, and anything touched by a crew member called to one of
the 3 facilities where residents are sick. "We are taking extra
precautions," Diaz said. "It can knock an emergency services department out
easily." Nursing homes are using a heavy-duty bacteria-killing chemical for
cleaning.

Canada (Surrey): Many Schools Affected by Norovirus Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Surrey school officials have been scrambling to contain an extraordinary
outbreak of norovirus infection that has hit students in 15 to 20 schools.
Dale Versfelt, Health and Safety Manager for the Surrey school district,
said although no schools have been closed, activities were restricted in 10
schools as of Tuesday morning. By afternoon, that number had fallen to 4
but was fluctuating so much that Versfelt declined to name the schools. "I
don't want to create a panic," he said, adding that by today the
restrictions on those 4 schools might be lifted and there could be others
in place.
Surrey district dispatches a cleaning squad to scrub down schools whenever
absenteeism exceeds 10 per cent or when 3 or more students are away ill
from any one class, Versfelt said, adding: "It's got me working full-time
just trying to coordinate activities to keep control."
In schools where absenteeism is high, sports teams aren't allowed to play
against other schools, students aren't permitted to work in cafeterias, and
outside groups aren't allowed to use the schools after hours. Versfelt is
asking parents to advise schools if their children have symptoms so that
school and health officials will have a better idea about the prevalence of
disease. Some student absences are a result of parents keeping their
children home in the hope they won't get sick.
Don Bower, spokesman for Fraser Health Authority, said the incidence of
illness linked to norovirus infection is 4 times higher than in previous
years. "There's a lot of norovirus in the community ... it's an unusually
unnerving year," he said. But he doesn't think Surrey has been hit harder
than other municipalities. "We have seen it in the Tri-Cities area and
there has been some in the [Fraser] Valley. I don't think it's unique to
Surrey at all."
Recently 3 Langley elementary schools were scrubbed down after a
significant number of students were away with norovirus infection symptoms,
district spokesman Craig Spence said. But the cleaning seems to have
worked, he said, adding: "It hasn't got out of hand."
Coquitlam school district asked parents to keep children away from Como
Lake Middle School last Friday after 270 of the 550 children were away
Thursday with the illness. On Friday, only 3 children showed up and one
went home ill before the end of the day, said assistant superintendent
Julie Pearce.
