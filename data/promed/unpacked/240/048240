Three people are being treated at the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Hospital for a serious infectious disease -- Crimean Congo fever, said Amiran Gamkrelidze, head of the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health. Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a particularly dangerous natural focal disease characterized by fever, severe intoxication, and hemorrhages on the skin and internal organs.

According to him, the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health is actively working with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture to ensure that livestock is properly treated. The disease was first identified in 1944 in Crimea.

CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. Symptoms come on suddenly with fever, myalgia (muscle pain), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, back or lower back pain, headache, eye inflammation, and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in the abdomen and throat, followed by sudden mood swings and confusion. After 2 to 4 days, excitement may be replaced by drowsiness, depression, and fatigue, and pain in the abdomen may be localized in the right upper part.

In Tokat, where the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was first seen in Turkey, cases started to be seen again with the arrival of spring.

Tokat State Hospital Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Specialist Bahadir Orkun Ozbay stated that tick complaints started in the spring. Reminding that the 1st case in Turkey was seen in Tokat in 2002, Ozbay warned the citizens to be more careful in the spring period. Ozbay, who advised the citizens who will go to the picnic, especially those who deal with livestock and farmers, to be careful against ticks, listed the measures to be taken.

Ozbay said, "We need to wear light-colored and closed clothes in vineyards, gardens, forests, and rural areas. This tick is not transmitted by jumping, it is transmitted by climbing up the human body and then clinging to it. We need to lay a light-colored cloth on the ground so that we can spot the tick at the picnic. After leaving the countryside, we need to check ourselves when we return home. In particular, we need to check places such as the bottom of our hair, our neck, and armpits," he said.

Ozbay underlined that the tick should not be touched with bare hands and said, "If we see a tick clinging to our body, we definitely do not touch it with bare hands. We can remove it with a plastic glove or nylon. Or the most important thing is to consult a health center as soon as possible for the prompt removal of the tick. The 2nd most important point is that chemicals should not be spilled on it, cigarettes should not be extinguished at work, and should not be crushed by hand. If the person can remove the tick it should be removed appropriately or quickly apply to the health institution.

Stating that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease like COVID-19, Ozbay said, "The tick is the carrier here. A virus in the tick causes the disease. It can be transmitted by ticks clinging to bare skin. Apart from that, it can be transmitted by breaking or crushing the ticks we see on the animal with bare hands."

Infected animals and people can transmit the virus via their blood, tissues, and secretions. This is one of the important points. Some of our CCHF patients do not have a history of tick contact. Therefore, those living in endemic areas need to know what symptoms they may develop.

Since these are viral diseases, general symptoms such as weakness, nausea, vomiting, fever, muscle pain, and diarrhea can be seen. Of course, there is no such thing as CCHF disease when these symptoms are seen. But a blood test can be done in this respect by applying to the hospital," he said.

With the increase in temperatures, tick cases started to be seen. Citizens were warned that the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF], which may occur as a result of tick bites, will seriously threaten human health, and that the tick population will increase with the warming of the weather.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was first recognized in Turkey in 2002-2003. CCHF still exists in Tokat and Kelkit Valley. The disease affects many people every year, especially in Central Anatolia and the adjacent provinces of the Eastern Black Sea Region, especially in the Kelkit Valley area. While the disease is common in the center of Erzincan and in the rural areas of its districts, the 1st case of the year [2022] was seen in Tokat again.

Assoc Dr Faruk Karakestated that with the warming of the weather, the number of cases will increase in the coming period, as it was last year [2021], and said, "As you know, as we enter the hot summer months, we expect to see cases in the spring. Frankly, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a disease we see in our region every year. Normally, we have been seeing around 30-40 cases in the last 10 years, until the [COVID-19] pandemic period in 2019. However, we have detected a significant increase in this number in the last 2 years, around 100 cases. We saw the cases and the cases were a bit more severe. Another important point is that when we interviewed the surrounding provinces where the cases were intense, such as Erzurum and Sivas, there was a similar situation there. Of course, there were many reasons for this. Social reasons came first. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in restrictions, curfews, etc. Then we realized that the tendency of people to go to rural areas increased. Again, in the fight against this tick, it was a little secondary when dealing with the fight against the pandemic, such as spraying, etc., in rural areas. We know there is a little more.

This year [2022], we have passed mid-April and the year has been very rainy and a little cold. We have not seen a definite case in our province yet, but as the weather warms up, the cases will probably start to come and it will continue until October-November. We see the largest case density as of May and peaks in June-July, as it does every year. In this respect, I would like to especially warn our citizens in rural areas. The disease progresses with similar findings to those of COVID-19 -- fever, muscle pain, weakness, etc. It can come with symptoms such as bleeding and can cause serious disease and death. In this respect, our citizens in rural areas need to be alert to diseases, and when their complaints begin, they should immediately go to health institutions, so that we can provide the necessary support and care with early intervention and treatment.

"What can be done to prevent ticks?"
Assoc Dr Faruk Karake also warned the citizens about the precautions they can take and said, "What can be done for those who go to the countryside or go for a picnic? As we all know, we say that ticks are on the ground. They do not fly and they do not fall on us from trees, etc. For example, one of the simplest and most effective methods is to tuck the trousers into the socks. Very simple precautions can be taken, such as, wearing light-colored clothes, wearing closed shoes instead of sandals, and spraying insect repellent on trousers or feet if going to the countryside. "If there is, we need to find it," he said.

The Ministry of Health reported that the spread of the [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever virus is still limited, but it warned against ignoring the preventive measures, stressing that most of the infections and deaths occurred in Dhi Qar Governorate. Ministry spokesman, Saif Al-Badr said, "the epidemiological situation of (the Crimean-Congo) hemorrhagic fever so far is the registration of 40 cases, 8 of which have died, 20 have recovered, and 16 others are still receiving medical care in health institutions."

Al-Badr continued "the most infections (cases) were in Dhi Qar, which accounted for the largest number of deaths, with 5 cases." He pointed out "the other cases were distributed by a case (the 2nd) in Babil, Al- Muthanna governorate, and the 3rd in Kirkuk," stressing that "there are other cases suspected of being infected, subject to isolation procedures until confirmed." Al-Badr indicated that "all health institutions in Iraq can diagnose cases and provide medical services, especially in their early stages," reiterating that "there is no vaccine or direct treatment for the virus until the present time." He also stated, "the procedures for protecting animals and combating the tick that transmits the virus, are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture," noting that "random slaughter and transportation of animals fall on the shoulders of the municipal authorities and the Baghdad Municipality, and there are measures taken by the Ministry of Interior in this regard," Al-Badr explained.

He stated that "the symptoms of the disease are high temperature, pain in different areas of the body, fatigue, headaches, and stomach aches, and this is the 1st stage in which the symptoms are relatively simple, but once detected, the recovery rates will be very high after providing supportive treatment." Al-Badr warned against "reaching the 2nd stage, which is the most dangerous of bleeding under the skin in the form of bruises or bleeding from the openings (orifices), and here the complications will be more severe and may end in death."

Al-Badr added, "the most vulnerable groups to infection are livestock breeders of all kinds, such as sheep, cows, goats, horses, and those who work in transporting livestock or butchers." He also stressed that "the risk will be greater if the patient has immune disorders, and an important point that must be emphasized (is) that the infected person can transmit the infection to another, and this constitutes a challenge for us, in addition to the possibility of transmission through contact with the infected animal or through the vector (tick).

Al-Badr concluded, "The cases are still limited and followed up by us, and we hope not to raise fears without justification, but at the same time we warn against indifference to this virus, and therefore we should deal with reality professionally and scientifically because they are sensitive issues." For his part, Deputy Speaker of Parliament Shakhwan Abdullah warned of the danger of the repercussions of the outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever virus and the high number of infections and deaths. Abdullah, according to an official statement received by Al-Mada, demanded the "Federal Government accelerate the formation of a joint committee by the Ministry of Health that is supported by all relevant entities and security institutions to contain the infection and the health impact of the virus" and calling for the isolation of the affected areas.

Abdullah emphasized "the need to prevent contact, apply precautionary measures, take urgent health measures by the Ministry of Health, and allocate hospitals and health centers to treat the infected and provide the medicines and medical supplies they need."

The Ministry of Health had confirmed in previous statements that Iraq has recorded limited cases of [Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever annually since the [1970s], but these numbers have increased during the current year [2022].

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although several tick genera are capable of becoming infected with the CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals.

Furthermore, appropriate capacity building and training of public health rapid response teams (RRT) should be carried out to equip them to control any future outbreaks of this anthropo-zoonotic disease. - Mod.UBA]
