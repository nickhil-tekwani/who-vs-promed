A mystery illness left a little girl in the hospital for a month. Now, the family has answers, but no cure. Doctors pinpointed it to a mosquito borne virus.

An 8-year-old girl in Savannah is fighting to regain normalcy after a virus left her hospitalized for a month.

Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE or triple E] is a [virus] disease spread by mosquito bites. "It's very rare," said Pediatric Director Stephen Thacker. "Only about 7 reported cased on average [each year] in the US."

The girl was admitted to the Children's Ward at Memorial on [4 Nov 2019]. Her mother did not know what was wrong with her little girl until [Mon 2 Dec 2019].

"It's been very hard," says the girl's mother. "The good part is that I know. But it's been hard." Doctors diagnosed the girl with triple E. But answers did not mean cures.

"Despite our best efforts to understand this virus there is no vaccine and there is no treatment," said Thacker.

The disease impacts humans in 2 ways. Either as a full body flu-like illness or as encephalitis -- swelling of the brain.

"They did pronounce her as brain damaged but she's now making sudden movements," said [the girl's mother]. Her mother says she's slowly regaining the ability to interact. "No, still no talking, no conversations. She's able to respond to commands but not as much. But she's getting there," she said. [The girl] has gotten through the worst of the disease, despite not knowing where she picked it up. In fact, she's now immune to it. But the damage done to her brain could be permanent. Her mother wants to warn people.

"Now that I know I can let other people know just to be aware because it's obviously still out there. So just to be aware, let everyone know about it. Keep the kids safe," she said.

Doctors say now that they have a diagnosis, they know how to help [the girl] get back on her feet. "She continues to surprise us each day with improvement with how she is moving and engaging with her family," said Thacker.

[One hopes that the affected girl will recover from her EEE virus infection. About 1/3 of individuals who develop EEE encephalitis subsequently suffer neurologic sequelae. One hopes that the girl is an exception. This year (2019) has been an unusually active one for EEE virus transmission to humans, horses, and some wild animals in the eastern and Midwestern USA.

The 1st reported EEE case in the 2019 season was a horse in Georgia (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America: USA (GA) horse 20190320.6377189). There have been sporadic human and equine EEE cases in the southeastern USA states this year. The 2019 transmission season has ended in the northern and other states with the occurrence of freezing temperatures terminating mosquito activity. It is not possible to predict if next year (2020) will have as many human and horse cases, but as the summer progresses people should avoid mosquito bites and horse owners should vaccinate their animals. - Mod.TY
