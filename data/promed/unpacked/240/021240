In the IFST Position Statement on BSE and in discussions on BSE-L and other
listserves there have been frequent past references to the "BSE signature"
or "fingerprint" and to the technique (Western blotting) used by John
Collinge which first established it in October 1996.
In their evidence at the BSE Inquiry on 3 June, Robert Will and James
Ironside were asked to give what amounted to an account for non-scientists
of what was involved in the application of molecular genetics and Western
blotting methods. This may be helpful also to those among us not directly
familiar with those techniques.
Here is the relevant extract from the evidence transcript. As a reminder,
Mr. Walker is the Counsel for the Inquiry, Sir Nicholas Phillips is the
judge chairing the Inquiry (he interpolates an uncharacterisic question --
I'm sure he really knows what "homogenisation" is!)
MR WALKER: The other aspect that you mentioned was western blotting. Who
was your collaboration with in that regard?
DR IRONSIDE: Our collaboration there was both with Professor Collinge and
also with Dr Hope in the Neuropathogenesis Unit. At this time, on the state
of knowledge we had then, it seemed to us and indeed to Professor Collinge,
that western blot was viewed really as an alternative to
immunocytochemistry in terms of diagnosis. We did in all cases try to keep
the material, because in order to perform western blotting, one needs to
use frozen tissue which was not available in all cases that we were called
to investigate. Sometimes, their only formed fixed tissue was available.
Now that is suitable for immunocytochemistry but is not suitable for
western blotting. So we decided to develop immunocytochemistry whilst
keeping material available for western blotting wherever possible. Since
then, we have collaborated extensively with Professor Collinge and others
on this. Indeed it is this work that enabled the identification of what I
referred to earlier as the BSE signature in cases of new variant CJD using
the western blotting technique.
MR WALKER: Perhaps this is a convenient moment to ask you to explain how
the western blotting technique identified such a signature?
DR IRONSIDE: Yes. The western blotting technique is a technique to
identify proteins in tissue, and this requires tissue which is frozen and
then homogenised. It cannot be used on material which is used for
pathological diagnosis because that requires fixation in the formalin.
To employ western blotting techniques for prion protein, you need to have
two things: firstly, the antibody which will detect the protein, but you
also -- and this is rather technically complicated -- but you also need to
make sure that the normal version of the protein is destroyed or is
completely broken down because the antibodies we have will detect both the
normal and the abnormal versions of the protein. So the destruction of the
normal protein and digestion of the normal protein can be achieved with an
enzyme, called proteinase K, and when that is done, the only residual
protein that will be stained by the antibody is the disease-associated form.
SIR NICHOLAS PHILLIPS: Is this the process you have described as
"homogenisation"?
DR IRONSIDE: No. To start with, you have a piece of tissue, usually brain
tissue, which is frozen, thawed, and then ground up or homogenised so that
proteins can be extracted from it. It is then run on a gel, and after
enzymatic digestion, stained with the antibody, and linear stains or bands
can be detected which tell us that the abnormal protein is there.
As well as saying whether the protein is there or not, you can then look at
the cases where the protein is present and look for different patterns in
the protein, and these different patterns depend on how the protein is
configured and how other entities such as sugars are bound to the protein.
On the basis of these two factors, the sugar binding, or glycosylation, as
it is called, and the molecular sizes of the protein fragments that we can
detect, you can have a number of different subtypes of the prion protein.
What Professor Collinge found is that the molecular -- the subtypes of the
prion protein in all the cases of new variant CJD were identical.
In sporadic CJD, there are a range of other different subtypes present
which are not present in new variant CJD, and likewise the new variant CJD
subtype is not present in any of the cases of sporadic CJD that we or
others have studied.
The subtype of the protein that is present in new variant CJD is heavily
glycosylated. It is very similar to the type of prion protein that is
present in the cattle brain in BSE, which is also heavily glycosylated, and
it is also similar to BSE which has been transmitted experimentally to
other animals, including mice and primates. So this pattern of
glycosylation and the fragment size is the basis of what has been called
the "BSE signature", and that is how we have identified this.
Since that paper was published with Professor Collinge and his team in late
1996, we have gone on to study many other cases of sporadic and indeed
other cases of new variant CJD, and this association is well maintained.
We have also found that using this technique, we can detect the same
signature in tonsil and other lymphoid tissues in new variant CJD, and we
can also use the antibodies in immunocytochemistry to see which cells in
the tonsil contain the abnormal protein. So the two techniques are really
complementary. But at the time in 1991, the knowledge of prion protein
subtypes simply did not exist, and this came out of some work done by
Professor Prusiner, and also work done on the transmissible mink
encephalopathy.
