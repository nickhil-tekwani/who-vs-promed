Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 11
---------------------------------------------------
As of 11 Apr 2005, 231 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Angola. Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province,
with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected
area.
The present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented
in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding.
Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains
patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance
continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths
and collection of bodies.
The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and
WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis.
To bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of
patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the
public understands the disease and the high risks associated with
treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in
health care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective
personal protective equipment, for both national and international
staff, adapted to conditions in African countries.
A welcome development is the decision by the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in
Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers
mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education
campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and
traditional healers.
Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social
mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed
to deliver public talks at markets and schools.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and
has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under
control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are
usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that
this added and welcome support to response activities will help
create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk
behaviours.
Advice for travellers
---------------------
All currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no
role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission
requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other
bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible
signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following
exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently
contaminated by a patient.
In addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate
equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their
proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost 3
decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic
fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment
of patients in Uige.
To date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred
in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases
in Uige. WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any
destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions.
Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg
haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill
persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require
hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to
Angola, particularly to Uige Province.
Those travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care
settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg
haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective
equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in
such settings.
Travellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention
should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their
departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be
included when symptoms are reported. Health care workers and health
authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the
symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for
cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating
frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the
introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms
in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of
screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be
considered.
WHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be
treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during
which time their temperature should be monitored daily.

The Angola Outbreak - A Possible Environmental Factor
-----------------------------------------------------
Recent news about Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Uige Province, Angola,
has said relatively little about climatic and other environmental
conditions that may have facilitated the epidemic.
However, 2 unusual aspects of the current epidemic have been noted:
its emergence outside the cave or mine environment where the disease
has often originated in the past (1-3), and the large percentage of
victims who were children. I would like to suggest an environmental
factor that may have been one of many conditions contributing to the
early stages of the epidemic in Uige Province, before
person-to-person transmission became more prevalent: the floors on
which the victims lived.
My reasoning is this: (a) The epidemic in Uige emerged during the
rainy season, which (as far as I can judge from online sources) has
been as wet as or wetter than usual in northeastern Angola. (b) The
dwellings of many of the victims, particularly outside urban centers,
were likely to have floors of packed earth, and were also likely to
be dimly lit, at least during the daylight hours with the cloudy
conditions of the rainy season. With the combination of climatic and
domestic conditions, rooms of non-urban dwellings might often
replicate in miniature the cave/mine conditions where Marburg
infection has occurred in the past. If the virus or its unknown
host(s) or vector(s) may benefit from an environment of damp, dark
dirt, then the floors in many Uige dwellings during the rainy season
may have created such an environment. Furthermore, (c) small children
may have stayed and played more of the time indoors during the rainy
season, increasing their exposure to a Marburg-support!
ive environment, relative to adults.
This conjecture can be debunked in many ways: for example, if the
climatic or domestic conditions where early infections occurred
differed in many cases from the damp/dark/dirt description I have
given, if the children infected were not spending an unusual
percentage of time on the floors of relatively dark rooms, or if
there is no consistent evidence of the virus in dwelling places of
victims or in the organisms that are likely to be found there.
Obviously, the conditions I have described are far from sufficient to
explain the rare occurrence of a Marburg epidemic. Also, there are
many other reasonable hypotheses already being considered to explain
patterns of the current epidemic (such as re-use of hypodermic
needles on children, or perhaps greater human contact with some
vector species because of rainy season conditions). However, if there
is even a very small chance that floor conditions were one of the
many factors contributing to a horrible epidemic, it seemed
obligatory to suggest this possibility.

[Dr. Wilsnack raises some interesting environmental observations.
We await the results of investigations in progress to learn more
about the actual epidemiology at the onset of the outbreak. From the
information that has become available, it does appear as though the
hospital was the main locale of amplification of transmission of
Marburg virus. As mentioned in an earlier posting, there were
probably a few cases that occurred outside of the hospital in the
early stages of this outbreak, one of them a child who was admitted
to the pediatric ward in the hospital where nosocomial transmission
then took over as the primary route. The occurrence of cases in
health care workers (14 to date, according to newswires)
unfortunately is not unusual for viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF)
outbreaks in Africa. It further confirms nosocomial transmission,
most likely due to lack of supplies for adequate barrier isolation
techniques. It is highly likely that in a situation with reduced
resources and dedicated staff, many of the infected health-care
workers c!
ontinued to work during the early stages of their own illness,
thereby contributing to further spread in the health-care
environment. Again, all of this is speculation based on prior
outbreaks of VHF, awaiting further "real" epidemiologic information
as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
