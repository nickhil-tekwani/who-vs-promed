Sacramento County Public Health officials are investigating a botulism outbreak after several people who ate prepared food from the Valley Oak Food and Fuel gas station in Walnut Creek contracted the possibly fatal form of food poisoning.

County Public Health Officer Dr Olivia Kasirye said 5 cases are under investigation and the affected people are in serious condition at local hospitals. 4 of the 5 confirmed they'd eaten prepared food from the gas station. Kasirye said the county wants to ensure that anyone who has eaten at the gas station since 23 Apr 2017 and is experiencing botulism symptoms receives immediate medical attention.

"The symptoms do vary a bit," Kasirye said. "The most common ones a person might [initially] experience are stomach cramping and vomiting." The more serious symptoms are blurry vision, slurred speech, droopy eyelids, and trouble breathing. Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal type of food poisoning caused by a bacterium called _Clostridium botulinum_, which produces a nerve toxin. If it affects the respiratory system, it can cause a person to stop breathing, Kasirye said.

Hospitals treat botulism with an antitoxin followed by intravenous liquids and [if needed] breathing support, she said.

Outbreaks of botulism are rare enough that Kasirye said she can't remember the last time the county had one. Individual cases pop up occasionally, but it's unusual to see 5 cases in 2 weeks. County officials learned of the cases because hospitals are required to report patients with botulism.

A county news release said the department is collaborating with the state Department of Public Health and the county Department of Environmental Management, which has the authority to stop the sale of prepared food at the gas station

In foodborne botulism, particularly that involving toxin types B and E, the gastrointestinal symptoms nausea and vomiting may precede neurological symptoms as noted in the post. It is not clear if these symptoms are caused by direct action of botulinum toxin, other products of _C. botulinum_, or some other contaminant of food. Early gastrointestinal symptoms do not seem to occur in cases of wound botulism, nor have corresponding signs been observed in primate experiments in which pure toxin was administered intragastrically or intravenously (1). Of note, type E botulism has been reported with predominantly mild, mostly gastrointestinal symptoms (2).

ProMED awaits more information regarding the food reservoir of this cluster of botulism. It is curious that 2 cases of botulism were reported in southern California last week (week of 1 May 2017), thought to be related to deer antler herbal tea, but it is not known if these clusters are related. The 1st cluster was in Orange county near Los Angeles whereas Sacramento county is almost 400 miles (about 644 km) north of the LA metropolitan area. - Mod.LL
