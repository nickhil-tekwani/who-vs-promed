Identified public exposures [list available at the source URL above]

What to do if you think you have measles
----------------------------------------
If you have a health care provider, contact him/her by phone and let them know that you may have been exposed to measles. They will let you know when to visit their office so as not to expose others in the waiting area.

If you do not have a health care provider, you may need to be seen at your local hospital emergency room/urgent care center. Please call before going to let them know you may have measles.

You are immune to measles if you have received 2 measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccines or were born before 1957 and have received one MMR vaccine. Health care providers are required to report suspect cases of measles to their local health department.

Public health continues to investigate contacts and places of exposure for these new cases. The Department will continue to provide updates and additional information on confirmed cases and potential public exposure as information becomes available.

For information on signs and symptoms of measles, or where you can find the vaccine, please visit StoptheSpreadAZ.com. Medical questions should be directed to your health care provider. For outbreak-related questions, community members may call 602-839-2275.

Last year's [2015] outbreak
---------------------------
Seven Arizona residents caught the measles in a nationwide outbreak that started at Disneyland in California in January 2015.

Up to 1000 people -- including 200 children -- in 3 Arizona counties were potentially exposed to the disease.

There were 147 cases reported nationally, the majority of them in California. In addition to the Arizona cases, there also were patients in Colorado, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, as well as in Mexico and Canada.

"The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles, then visited the amusement park while infectious; however, no source was identified," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Many of those who got sick had not been vaccinated.

The outbreak was declared over in mid-April [2016].

According to the CDC website, 2014 saw nearly [24] measles outbreaks throughout the US. One outbreak in Amish communities in Ohio accounted for more than half of the 667 confirmed cases that year.

Many of the 2014 cases were linked to an outbreak the Philippines. The CDC believes that outbreak was also connected to the 2015 outbreak that originated at Disneyland.

"Analysis by CDC scientists showed that the measles virus type in this [2015] outbreak (B3) was identical to the virus type that caused the large measles outbreak in the Philippines in 2014," according to the CDC.

[2] School vaccine coverage

About 3 in every 10 kindergartners who enrolled during the most recent school year [2015-2016] without measles vaccines were missing the required exemption forms, according to Arizona Department of Health Services data analyzed by azcentral.com.

The data include schools with kindergartens with 20 or more students. The numbers were similar to an analysis a year and a half ago, despite last year's [2015] measles scare.

Arizona immunization law calls on schools to suspend students who are not vaccinated and do not have exemptions. The waiver requires parents who choose not to vaccinate to sign that they understand the risks, essentially forcing them to make a conscious decision about whether to vaccinate their kids.

But hundreds of Arizona schools did not require all parents to turn in signed waivers when they enrolled their unvaccinated children in 2015, according to records reviewed by The Arizona Republic.

The state's Department of Health Services has been aware of schools' violation of the immunization law at least since 2012. That is when the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson reported it. And in early 2015, when an outbreak of measles was reported in Kearney, The Republic reported it in 3 stories.

The state for the 1st time began sending letters to schools that included notification of their exemption-form compliance rates for the most recent school year, said Jessica Rigler, bureau chief of epidemiology and disease control.

Schools use exemption papers to track unvaccinated students so they can send them home if another student contracts measles. The forms also serve as a way to ensure the state has done everything it can to educate parents about the dangers of the diseases, Rigler said.

But the state does not have enforcement measures behind the law, Rigler said, and all her staff can do is work with the schools to bring them into compliance. The law clearly instructs schools to suspend students who are missing vaccination documents and exemption forms but does not define any penalties.

The data aren't perfect. Schools must send reports by November, so students missing vaccines or exemption forms may have turned them in after the deadline or may have moved. Some schools also don't report accurate information. Also, Rigler said, the state expects some portion of the students with exemption forms to actually have been vaccinated, but their parents found it easier to sign the form than to locate medical records.

What is your kindergarten's vaccination rate?
[See URL above to] search for your school to see what measles vaccination rate the school reported to the state for 2015-2016 school year. Schools report the data by the end of November of each year to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Schools with fewer than 20 children enrolled in kindergarten are not included.
