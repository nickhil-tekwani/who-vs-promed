Farmers in Iceland are baffled by the unexplained deaths of thousands of the country's sheep. About 5000 sheep died this spring [2015], with the northern and western regions worst affected, and so far experts haven't been able to work out why, Morgunbladid's Iceland Monitor website reports. One theory is that sulphur emitted during a recent volcanic eruption might be to blame, as it could have contaminated vegetation and caused malnutrition in the sheep. The huge eruption at the Holuhraun lava field lasted for 6 months, and released millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere.

"When the ash cloud moves over the country from the east, it is often accompanied by rain," Prof Jonas Eliasson, from the University of Iceland, tells the site. "The rain cleans the sulphur out of the air and snow does the job even better. When the snow melts in the spring, the sulphur remains on vegetation and in the soil."

Many ewes died after the lambing season, and farmers reported signs of malnourishment in their animals even though they were eating properly, Iceland Magazine reported in June [2015]. In the most extreme cases, farms lost up to 30 percent of their flock. There have been other theories surrounding what might have caused the deaths, including disease, cold weather, and poor-quality hay. Blood samples from the sheep have been sent to Norway for testing, with the results expected around the end of July [2016], according to the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority.

[A similar report was published from Iceland in early June 2015. No numbers, age, husbandry methods (such as, housed or pasturing animals) and other epidemiologically significant data were specified; they were requested, so far without response.

The number of deaths mentioned in the previous posting was estimated to be in the hundreds; the number seems to have increased since.

Results of the lab tests, reportedly applied in Norway, are expected soon and will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
