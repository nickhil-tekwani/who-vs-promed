The capital, Antananarivo, is no longer immune to the epidemic of the plague; 10 suspected cases were identified according to arrivals information at Compte-Gouttes.

The progress of the plague epidemic becomes increasingly worrying. The districts around the capital do not seem to be the only ones infected. According to information gathered from the Ministry of Health yesterday [6 Jan 2015], 13 suspected cases were registered in the urban commune of Antananarivo, from 4 Aug 2014 to 29 Dec 2014. The disease has infected several neighborhoods, including Anosibe, Anosimahavelona, Anosizato, Manjakaray, Antanimora and Ankasina.

Faced with this situation, a source from the Public Health Service District reacted, stating that: "The situation is now under control; all these people were registered as suspects, as they presented the symptoms of this disease, namely high fever and buboes. Only 3 cases have been confirmed after laboratory analysis," the source said.

Ndranto Rakotonanahary, director of population and health at the town hall of Antananarivo, has not confirmed these 13 suspected cases. "There is only one case, in the district of Ankasina, which was treated by the municipal health service. We are not aware of other cases," he said.

Since the "beginning" of the plague season, between 4 Aug 2014 and 29 Dec 2014, 224 cases of plague were reported in the Big Island. 58 of the cases have died. The meeting between the WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, on 10 Dec 2014 in Anosy, reported 47 deaths. The number of people identified as infected with the disease was 189 at that time.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.

The following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-81; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
