Loch sealed off as dogs die of mystery illness
-------------------------------------------------
A loch in Fife has been sealed off to the public after reports of 5
dogs dying from a mystery illness after swimming there at the weekend.
An investigation was conducted into the incidents, and experts from
the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) have taken samples
from Townhill Loch to check for pollution. The initial suspicions of
poisoning by a blue-green algae blue were proven groundless.
Signs have gone up at the loch, located at Townhill Country Park,
north of Dunfermline, warning the public to keep dogs on leads for
the time being.
Adam Tjolle, a local vet, said 2 dogs brought in to his surgery
[veterinary clinic] in recent days had died and a third survived. He
said he understood that animals may have been taken to other
veterinary surgeries in the area. The dogs had shown signs of sudden
respiratory failure within hours of swimming in the loch.
[Dr.]Mr Tjolle, from Inglis Veterinary Centre, said the owners had
been left "devastated" by the sudden loss of healthy pets. He said,
"These have been extremely upsetting incidents for the owners
involved, because the signs were so sudden and dramatic. I am hopeful
there [will be] no more cases once dog owners are made aware of the
dangers." [Although upsetting to the owners, a necropsy may help
establish the cause of death. It would be interesting to know whether
a necropsy was done and what tests were run. - Mod.TG]
Meanwhile, Fife Council said access to dog walkers and visitors was
being restricted from the loch area. The council's community service
manager, Grant Ward, said: "We have taken a precautionary measure of
temporarily restricting public access to the loch area at Townhill
Country Park after reported incidents of dogs taking ill after
visiting the loch."
SEPA's ecology unit manager, Brian Clelland, said: "The local council
have acted appropriately in this matter, which is a public-health
issue. Although the cause of the dogs' deaths cannot yet be
confirmed, the council have acted sensibly by closing the loch to
the public until it can be determined what was responsible for the
death of the dogs at Townhill Loch," he said.
The results of the SEPA tests showed the blue-green algae was not
responsible for the dogs' death. A statement from SEPA said: "After
taking water samples from the loch at Townhill Country Park, SEPA
officers can confirm that the results of the blue-green algae
analysis showed only small amounts were present."
These levels were below any guideline limits that would normally
prompt warning signs or other safety measures, and so it is highly
unlikely that blue-green algae was involved in the death of the dogs.
Officers for Fife Council's Environmental Health Unit were
responsible for taking all other biological, bacteriological and
chemical tests of the water.
[The statement continued,] "At present there is no evidence of any
environmental pollution at the site, however, SEPA officers will be
maintaining a presence over the coming days and continuing to liaise
with officials from Fife Council."
Blue-green algae cannot be removed -- environmental officers have to
wait for the bloom to disperse before the loch can be declared safe
again.
The operators of the Scottish National Water ski Centre, which is
based at Townhill Loch, have also been told to suspend its activities
until after the investigations have been completed.

[There are not enough clinical signs to begin to guess at the cause
of death. Respiratory distress may be caused from intoxication with
blue-green algae. Although the level of blue-green algae was below
standards, some blue-green algae can produce toxins capable of
causing a relatively rapid death. The toxins may be present despite
low levels of the algae.
It is unlikely that it would be pesticide/insecticide run-off into
the Loch, as there would be a tremendous dilution.
If there are results of a necropsy or other testing, ProMED-mail
would be interested. - Mod.TG]
