From: "Theodore G. Andreadis" <tgand@caes.state.ct.us>

The report on cow deaths in Connecticut due to West Nile virus was
erroneous. No doubt a typograpical error on the part of someone. What we
are investigating is a rather large die-off of *crows* in southweastern CT
which we now presume is due to WNV and is linked to the "epidemic" of human
cases in New York City. Currently, we have isolated this same West
Nile-like virus from the brain of a dead crow collected on 13 Sep 1999 in
the town of Westport and and from 2 pools of _Culex pipiens_ and _Aedes
vexans_ [mosquitoes collected on 14 Sep 1999 at a golf course in Greenwich,
CT. These have been confirmed by CDC. The State of CT has implemented
ground spraying of pesticides in the affected region.
No human cases have been reported. We continue to trap mosquitoes throughout
the area and to attempt virus isolations from brains of suspect crows.

[ProMED really fell for that one! What a difference one letter can make.
Crows are carrion feeders, but it is probably going too far to postulate
that they may be getting preferentially infected by eating dead rabbits or
rodents that are the actual reservoir of this strain. They may just be more
susceptible than other avian species - Mod.JW
