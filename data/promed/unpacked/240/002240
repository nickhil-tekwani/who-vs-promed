Foodborne outbreak of Chagas, Para State, Brazil
--------------------------------------
The Abaetetuba municipality, in the northeast of the [Para] state, has a Chagas disease outbreak. Of the 35 cases registered in Para state, the city registered 11. The suspicion is that the occurrences are related to consumption of acai [a palm, _Euterpe oleracea_, cultivated for fruit, juice or hearts of palm. - Mod. TY].

"We have an recent outbreak in the Abaetetuba municipality. We have about 11 people who are ill, including a man who grinds up acai and 2 people in his family. We know that this number [of ill individuals] is going to increase. Health Surveillance and Epidemiology of the municipality is working [on the situation] and we, as state government [officials], are supervising their actions," explained Elenild Goes, state coordinator for Chagas disease. According to the state Secretariat of Health (SESPA), Para is the state [in Brazil] with the most cases of the disease. In 2011, 141 cases were registered. From 1 Jan - August, 2012, the Secretariat total is 35 cases.

The researcher Ana Maria Guaralda explained that the cause of the disease is the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_ , which is very resistant and can survive in frozen acai. "Freezing does not interrupt transmission. Contaminated ocai maintained at -20C for 24 hours can still kill laboratory mice," stated the researcher.

Adequate preparation of the acai is one method to avoid contamination. It should be passed through a sieve, washed 3 times in tap water and later soaked for 20 min in hypochlorite. Before being ground up, the acai must go through a a bleaching process, which consists of immersing the fruit in water at 80 C for 10 seconds, then cooling the fruit again.

[It was the outbreak of Chagas disease (South American trypanosomiasis) in Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2005 that showed that oral transmission is an important route of transmission. Since 2005, ProMED have reported several outbreaks (see below) and oral transmission is probably an important for maintaining the human reservoir of chronic Chagas infection. An excellent reference on Chagas disease is Shikanai-Yasuda MA,Carvalho NB. Oral transmission of Chagas disease. Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Mar;54(6):845-52.- Mods. RNA/EP
