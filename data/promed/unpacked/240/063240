Experts claim fears over heroin contaminated with anthrax led to a
drop in the number of drug deaths in Scotland this year. The deadly
batch hit streets at the end of 2009 and claimed the lives of 10
addicts. But Tayside Police figures reveal the number of drug-related
deaths in their area has fallen to 32 this year, compared with 50 in 2009.

Dr Kirsty Licence, chair of the Tayside Drugs Death Review Group,
believes the anthrax scare may be behind the drop. She said: "The
risk of anthrax-contaminated heroin has been an issue this year and
may have changed behaviour. Clearly it is good that there have been
far fewer drug deaths in Tayside this year."

[It would be interesting to see if parallel drops in drug associated
fatalities have occurred in other areas of the UK. Admittedly Tayside
was one of the worse affected by the cases of injection anthrax. If,
all in all, any changes were with the normal annual variation, it was
just coincidence. But it would be nice if we could achieve reductions
without mortality but probably I am naive.
