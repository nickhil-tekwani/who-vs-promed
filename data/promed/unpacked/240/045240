A bacterial infection with the potential of high case-fatality rates resulted in the deaths of 2 people in 2 months in Punta del Este. The 1st was an 84-year-old man at the beginning of December 2014, and the 2nd a 90-year-old Argentine in January 2015. The bacterium is known as _Vibrio vulnificus_ and is located in the water in hot seasons and enters the body through wounds that have not healed. In addition, it can be acquired from eating shellfish contaminated with the bacterium.

According to the [US] CDC, in reasonably healthy people the infection can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In people with compromised immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease, it spreads through the bloodstream, causing a severe and potentially threatening disease characterized by fever and chills, reduction in blood pressure, and hemorrhagic blisters.

Rachel Rosa, Director of Epidemiology, said in a press conference today, 26 Jan 2015, that from December 2014 to now, in addition to the 2 deceased, there were 3 other cases that recovered. The Departmental Director of Health, Beatriz Lageard, said that there is no reason for "public alarm" because, in general, patients recover with antibacterial agents.

[Punta del Este is a city and resort on the Atlantic Coast in the Maldonado Department of southeastern Uruguay.

The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070473.htm:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and fin fish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism.

The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html). - Mod.LL
