An outbreak of diphtheria was registered in one of the children's boarding houses in the Lviv region, where people who have been disabled since childhood are also housed.

"During the planned preventive examination of the wards of the boarding school, signs of the initial stage of diphtheria were found in 7 of them. All of them were hospitalized at the Lviv Regional Infectious Disease Clinical Hospital," the message reads.

Specialists of the Lviv Regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a selection of material for bacteriological examination from 165 contact persons. Their vaccination status is also being studied.

Disinfection of boarding school premises and chamber disinfection of personal belongings were carried out. An epidemiological investigation is ongoing. Samples for further bacteriological studies will be sent to the reference laboratory of the Public Health Center.

The PHC (Public Health Center) reminded that diphtheria is an acute infectious disease transmitted by airborne droplets. It is characterized by local fibrinous inflammation, mainly of the mucous membranes of the oropharynx, and general intoxication of the body with damage to the cardiovascular and nervous systems and kidneys.

As reported by Ukrinform, the Ministry of Health received from foreign partners 600 000 doses of vaccine against poliomyelitis, as well as 70 000 doses of drugs against tetanus and diphtheria.

In the early 1990s, Ukraine had among the highest diphtheria incidence in the world; a diphtheria epidemic emerged in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, which included Ukraine; the diphtheria epidemic was attributed to the disruption of vaccine supply and economic difficulties associated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/4/98-0404_article). In 1995 and 1996, as a result of concerted national and international efforts, the NIS raised adult and childhood coverage and began to control the epidemic (<https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/181/Supplement_1/S35/843033), although over 2700 cases were still reported in 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4753a1.htm).

However, cases of diphtheria were still being reported most years in Ukraine, although the annual number of cases has been less than 10 since 2010:
2017 / 2016 / 2015 / 2014 / 2013 / 2012 / 2011 / 2010 / 2009 / 2008 / 2007 / 2006 / 2005
0 / 4 / 2 / _ / _ / 5 /8 / 17 / _ / 61 / 81 / 68 / 96 (ProMED post Diphtheria - Ukraine (02): low vaccination rate 20180907.6012908).

In September 2018, ProMED posted a report of 4 cases of diphtheria in the presence of a very low diphtheria vaccination rate (only 19% of children born in 2016 were vaccinated against diphtheria) (ProMED post Diphtheria - Ukraine (02): low vaccination rate 20180907.6012908). This, of course, was before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 Feb 2022, in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 in eastern Ukraine.

Lviv (estimated pop., 717 510 in 2021) is the largest city in Western Ukraine and the 6th-largest in Ukraine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv). A map showing the location of Lviv can be seen at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lviv,+Lviv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+79000.

Many of the complications of diphtheria, such as myocarditis and polyneuropathy, are due to toxin production. Respiratory difficulties can result from paralysis of the diaphragm and obstruction of the airways due to the membrane that forms on the pharynx, tonsils, and soft palate that may extend to the larynx and trachea. Without treatment, as many as 1 out of 2 patients can die from the disease. Survival requires access to antibiotics, anti-toxin, and intensive medical care, which may not be available in war-torn regions. - Mod.ML
