Pet owners are being warned that a deadly flesh-eating dog disease may have spread to Crawley.

Other cases of the disease - Alabama Rot - have already been reported at various sites across Sussex.

Now Vets4Pets - based inside Pets at Home in County Oak, Crawley - has reported its 1st suspected case. The practice says that the disease, which leads to kidney failure and usually proves fatal "in 9 out of 10 cases," is the 1st case it has had. The cause of Alabama Rot - cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy [CRGV] - is still unknown and there is no known way to prevent dogs from contracting the disease. There have been 11 confirmed cases within a 20-mile radius of Crawley, including one at West Chiltington, south of Horsham, earlier this year [2017].

The mysterious illness 1st appeared in the late 1980s affecting greyhounds in America.

[The following letter to the editor was published in the Veterinary Record of 16 Jan 2016, signed by David Walker and Laura Holm (Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, Hursley, Winchester) and Rosanne Jepson and Ludovic Pelligand (Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Hertfordshire):

"It is challenging to know whether an erosive or ulcerative skin lesion of unknown cause is the result of CRGV or something else, as azotaemia is typically absent at initial presentation, and urine-concentrating ability may be retained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement may allow early detection of pre-azotaemic AKI and thus direct appropriate management.

"We invite veterinary surgeons presented with a dog with skin lesion(s) of unknown cause to contact Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists (medicine@andersonmoores.com; 01962 767920) to discuss GFR measurement. Samples can be collected in their practices, and laboratory testing will be performed at the Royal Veterinary College; results will be available within 24 hours, thus aiding clinical decision making. Aside from blood sampling, all costs will be covered."

A one-day-conference addressing CRGV was reportedly held on 10 May 2017 in Reading, Berkshire. The publication of its proceedings and conclusions could be helpful.
