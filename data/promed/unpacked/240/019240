Vesicular stomatitis (VS) has been detected in 3 horses at a Pecos County premises located about 30 miles [48 km] north of Fort Stockton, Texas. The animals were tested after the owner observed blistering and swelling on the animals' tongues and lips, and contacted their veterinary practitioner. Testing at the USDA National Veterinary Services lab in Ames, Iowa confirmed the New Jersey serotype of virus in the affected horses.

Vesicular stomatitis primarily affects horses and cattle causing blisters or sores on the tongue, lips, muzzle, nose, hooves, and/or teats. Because of the contagious nature of VS and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) urges livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian or the TAHC immediately. Although the lesions may be painful, most animals recover well with supportive care.

VS can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, contaminated objects (fomites), or by insect vectors such as sand flies and black flies. The disease usually occurs in warm months of the year when insect vectors are active. VS may also affect people causing a mild flu-like illness with symptoms of fever, weakness, and muscle aches.

The newly identified infected horses are currently under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected and exposed horses will be monitored by TAHC or USDA personnel until all lesions have healed and a decision is made to release the quarantine (a minimum of 14 days).

"If you suspect your animal(s) have VS, you should notify your veterinarian immediately," said Dr Dee Ellis, Texas' state veterinarian and TAHC executive director. "Texas had its largest VS outbreak in history last year [2014], and we must remain vigilant in protecting our livestock industry in 2015."

The 1st case of VS this year [2015] was found in New Mexico on 29 Apr 2015. Since then, VS cases have also been confirmed in Arizona and Utah.

Some states and other countries may restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for susceptible species moving from states with active cases of VS. It is important for shippers or haulers of livestock to contact states of destination well in advance of scheduled movements to determine their entry requirements. For international export information, the USDA Veterinary Services office in Austin, Texas should be contacted.

[The transmission of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and the relative importance of the different transmission routes for each virus, are incompletely understood.

Insect vectors seem to introduce vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) into populations of domesticated animals. Important biological vectors include sand flies (_Lutzomyia_ sp.) and blackflies (family Simuliidae). _Culicoides_ midges may also be biological vectors. Blackflies can transmit VSV-NJ (vesicular stomatitis virus, New Jersey serotype) to uninfected blackflies feeding at the same time on an uninfected host. Transovarial transmission has been demonstrated in sandflies and blackflies, and it may be possible in _Culicoides_. VSV has also been isolated from _Aedes_ mosquitoes, _Chloropidae_ (eye gnats), and flies in the genus _Musca_ or family Anthomyiidae; these insects may act as mechanical vectors. In addition, grasshoppers (_Melanoplus sanguinipes_) can be infected experimentally, and cattle that ingest experimentally infected grasshoppers develop clinical signs. There is also some speculation that VSV could be a plant virus found in pastures, with animals at the end of an epidemiological chain.

Once it has been introduced into a herd, vesicular stomatitis can spread from animal to animal by direct contact. Broken skin or mucous membranes may facilitate entry of the virus. Infected animals shed VSV in vesicle material, saliva, and to a lesser extent, in nasal secretions. In experimentally infected horses, VSV has been found in the saliva of animals with or without oral lesions. Fecal shedding has been reported occasionally in experimentally infected swine, but it has not been seen in horses. VSV does not appear to be shed in milk. Animals can also be infected by exposure to contaminated fomites including food, water, and milking machines. VSV in saliva can survive for 3-4 days on fomites; however, this virus is inactivated by sunlight, and does not remain viable for long periods in the environment except in cool, dark places. Experimental infection of livestock by aerosols has been demonstrated, but this route did not result in skin lesions in most species. VSV does not appear to cross the placenta or cause fetal seroconversion.

The reservoir and amplifying hosts for VSV are unknown. Viremia sufficient to infect insect vectors has not been reported in any domesticated or wild animal; however, insects could become infected by feeding on lesion material or contaminated secretions. Overwintering has been reported in some but not all outbreaks in the US.

Humans may be infected by contact with the lesions or secretions from infected animals, particularly vesicular fluid and saliva. Aerosol transmission occurs in laboratories. In addition, some people are probably infected through insect bites.

Because of the insect involvement, it is likely that a frost will kill off some of the insect vectors and decrease the outbreaks of this virus. As this virus is showing up early in the season, it is a long way to frost time in this region.
