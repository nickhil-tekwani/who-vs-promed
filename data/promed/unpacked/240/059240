The Mississippi State Department of Health is participating in the investigation of a multistate outbreak of norovirus linked to raw oysters from Texas. So far, at least 9 cases have been reported in the state linked to raw oysters distributed to Mississippi restaurants. Additional cases may be identified as the investigation continues. Restaurants and food retailers should not serve raw oysters from harvest area TX 1, Galveston Bay, Texas, harvested from 17 Nov 2022 to 7 Dec 2022, and consumers should not eat raw oysters from these areas. If you have oysters at home from the areas listed, throw them away. Norovirus infection can cause an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain.

[Norovirus appears to be the cause of this outbreak.

The following are myths about oysters (adapted from https://www.fda.gov/food/health-educators/raw-oyster-myths).

Myth: Eating raw oysters is safe if you drown them in hot sauce, which kills everything.
Fact: The active ingredients in hot sauce have no more effect on harmful bacteria than plain water. Nothing but prolonged exposure to heat at a high enough temperature will kill bacteria.

Myth: Avoid oysters from polluted waters and you'll be fine.
Fact: Many pathogens in oysters have nothing to do with pollution. Some harmful bacteria thrive naturally in warm coastal areas (such as the Gulf of Mexico) where oysters live.

Myth: An experienced oyster lover can tell a good oyster from a bad one.
Fact: These pathogens can't be seen, smelled, or even tasted. Don't rely on your senses to decide if an oyster is safe.

Myth: Alcohol kills harmful organisms.
Fact: Alcohol may impair your good judgment, but it doesn't destroy harmful bacteria.

Myth: Eating oysters in months with an "R" in their name is safe.
Fact: Even though cold-weather-harvested oysters are likely somewhat safer, many oysters come from warmer climates and are imported into the colder climate.

Myth: Raw oysters are an aphrodisiac and will cure a hangover.
Fact: There is no scientific evidence that either of these commonly held beliefs is true.
