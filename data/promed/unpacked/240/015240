Dengue - USA (Texas) 971129105608

It is good to have knowledgeable people standing by in case we err, which I
have done. Duane Gubler, Director of CDC's Division of Vector-Borne
Infectious Diseases, pointed out two errors in some comments I made
regarding cases of dengue in south Texas [see: Dengue - USA (Texas)
971129105608.
First, as Duane correctly indicated, "indigenous cases of dengue have not
'occurred nearly every year for many years'. After an absence of 35 years,
there were cases in 1980, 1986, 1995 and 1997. Granted, indigenous cases
are becoming more frequent and are associated with imported cases, mainly
from Mexico. We have had imported cases nearly every year, however."
Duane also is quite correct when he says that person-to-person transmission
of dengue is not known to occur, except for a few cases of mother to child
vertical transmission. I know this and should have worded my comments
better. What I meant was that there might have been local transmission
(i.e., person-to-person VIA MOSQUITOES) of virus.
My apologies for any misconceptions I have disseminated. - Mod.CHC
