[The following section is extracted from OIE Terrestrial Code, 2019 Chapter 3.1.18 Rift Valley fever (infection with Rift Valley fever virus) https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.18_RVF.pdf:

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Phenuiviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favoring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.

RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favoring the proliferation of mosquitoes.

Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.

Low-level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.

During an outbreak, preventive measures to protect workers from infection should be employed when there are suspicions that RVFV-infected animals or animal products are to be handled. - Mod.CRD

RVF (animals) was last reported in Mauritania in January 2019, in the southwestern Trarza region, bordering Senegal.

According to FAO's Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin 36 (July-September 2020, at http://www.fao.org/3/cb0160en/cb0160en.pdf; see page 34), the RVF threat ("likelihood of occurrence") for July-September 2020 in Mauritania was generally "moderate": Disease occurrence was "likely in some localized areas, due to the presence of suitable environmental conditions for vector amplification, animal movement and informal marketing of infected animals."

Flooding and invasion of mosquitos was recently reported from the Assaba region, central south Mauritania. Clinical RVF signs in camels, observed in (northern) Mauritania in 2010, are presented in the reference below.
