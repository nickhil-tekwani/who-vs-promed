A 5-star hotel in Dubai is testing for Legionnaires' disease after 3
guests contracted the illness. One of the guests of the Westin Dubai
Mina Seyahi, a British cricket scorer and broadcaster, died on
Thursday [29 Jan 2009] after leaving Dubai. A spokeswoman for the
hotel said all tests for the bacterium that causes the disease had
been negative so far but that checks were still being made.

The owner of the Westin hotel chain, Starwood Hotels and Resorts,
said it was working with the Dubai authorities to find out how [the
man] and the other 2, unidentified, guests became infected. The
69-year-old was a guest of the hotel in mid-January [2009], returning
to the UK on 20 [Jan 2009] from a tour to Dubai with his charity
cricket team, the Lord's Taverners. The team said no other members
were showing symptoms of Legionnaires' disease.

Tests by European and American experts on the Westin Dubai have so
far not found the bacterium, _Legionella_, that causes the disease,
said Starwood spokeswoman Amalie Craig. The disease has never been
detected at the hotel, according to its own regular checks, she said.
The Westin Dubai's staff has begun contacting guests to inform them
of the 3 cases, Ms. Craig said.

People become infected by inhaling water droplets containing the
bacterium, says the European Working Group for Legionella Infections
(EWGLI) -- a group of scientists working on the disease. Since the
disease was first identified in 1976 -- at a meeting of retired US
military personnel, or legionnaires -- outbreaks have been linked to
hotels, cruise ships, and other types of holiday accommodation. The
_Legionella_ bacterium only poses a risk if it gets into water
distribution systems such as air conditioners or plumbing, says the EWGLI.

About 5-15 percent of cases prove fatal, with elderly people most at risk.

[ProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland sent another, similar news
release
(<http://7starsdubai.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/dubai-hotel-tests-for-legionnaires-after-guest-dies/>).

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About
80-90 percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immunosuppression.

_Legionella_ are usually found primarily in the hot water portion of
plumbing systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of
25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the
organism in plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded
in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's
pipes and containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can
be increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols
can be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems,
shower heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

An epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of
_Legionella_ organisms should be initiated when the 1st case of
legionellosis is identified. Genotyping patient and environmental
isolates will help to confirm the environmental source.

Dubai is one of the 7 emirates and the most populous city of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai>).
Dubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum dynasty since 1833. Dubai's
current ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the prime
minister and vice president of the UAE (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai>).
