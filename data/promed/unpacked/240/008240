Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of West Nile virus lineage 1 and lineage 2 from human cases of infection, Italy, August 2013. Barzon L, Pacenti M, Franchin E, Lavezzo E, Masi G, Squarzon L, Pagni S, Toppo S, Russo F, Cattai M, Cusinato R, Palu G.

Summary:
A human outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infection caused by WNV lineage 2 is ongoing in northern Italy. Analysis of 6 WNV genome sequences obtained from clinical specimens demonstrated similarities with strains circulating in central Europe and Greece and the presence of unique amino acid changes that identify a new viral strain. In addition, WNV lineage 1 Livenza, responsible for a large outbreak in north-eastern Italy in 2012, was fully sequenced from a blood donor during this 2013 outbreak.

Background:
A human outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infection is ongoing in northern Italy. We report here the clinical presentation, laboratory test results, and WNV full genome sequences from human cases of WNV infection which were diagnosed in August 2013 in the Veneto region. This region is one of the most affected by the outbreak. WNV genome sequences obtained from clinical specimens of infected individuals were subjected to phylogenetic analysis in order to gain information on the origin and evolutionary history of the responsible viral strains.

Conclusion:
Overall, the results of this molecular epidemiology study show that genetically different lineages of WNV are capable of establishing themselves in Europe, of remaining in circulation for several years in the same territory, and of spreading slowly to neighbouring areas, in agreement with other reports from Europe. In this local transmission and spread dynamic in Europe, WNV overwintering in mosquitoes and amplification in local susceptible bird populations are key factors, while WNV re-introduction by migrating birds from long-distance Euro-African routes seem to be less relevant.

In conclusion, a novel WNV lineage 2 strain of the Greek/Hungarian cluster is responsible for a human outbreak of neuro-invasive disease that is ongoing in northern Italy. The virus is co-circulating with the WNV lin1 Livenza strain that caused a large human outbreak in 2012.

[It is interesting that 2 WNV lineages are co-circulating in the same areas in Europe. WNV overwintering in these European areas seems very likely, in which event one can expect more cases in these areas in future years.

The number of West Nile fever cases has reached 43 in Volgograd and the Volgograd region. The whole area has been declared a focus of this dangerous disease.

The largest numbers of cases have been registered in the southern regions: 11 infected persons in Krasnoarmeiskiy district, 10 in Kirovsky district. Next on the list is Krasnooktyabrskiy with 8 ill persons. In the rural areas, only 4 inhabitants were infected, who were in the Gorodyshchensky, Mikhailovsky and Kalachevsky districts of the region.

In the current year [2013], one person has already died [from WNV infection].

[210 cases of WNF have been recorded in the Volgograd region; 4 of them have died. Usually, cases of WNF are registered in the region up until December. This situation is associated with populations of mosquitoes in flooded basements of apartment houses. - Mod.NP
