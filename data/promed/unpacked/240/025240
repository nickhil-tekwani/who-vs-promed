Plague destroys five hectares of plant cultures
------------------------------------------------
Five hectares of maize and bean cultures were destroyed in Bocoio
district, central Benguela province, by a plague still unknown to
technicians of the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA), thereby
affecting the 2nd season of the 2008 agricultural campaign.

Speaking to ANGOP, the chairperson of the Association of Farmers and
Cattle-Raising Cooperatives (UNACE) in Bocoio, Henrique Handa, said
that the situation is of great concern, because the plague that began
in the 1st fortnight of the current month [March 2008] has already
affected the district headquarters and Sibol village.

According to the source, the district's population might soon face a
food crisis, due to the destruction of the cultures, 1st by the
drought and now by the pestilence. The 2nd season of the agricultural
campaign in Bocoio district involved 2664 farmers, organised into 20
associations.

[From this report it is not possible to speculate on the diseases or
disorders referred to. It appears that the crops are being destroyed
quickly, so perhaps fungal pathogens or even insect pests may be
involved. It is also unclear what type of 'bean' is affected since
the term may be used for a number of different crops. However, maize
and beans of any kind are not related species, and there may be
different causes affecting the 2 crops. We would be grateful for any
further information on the problem described.
