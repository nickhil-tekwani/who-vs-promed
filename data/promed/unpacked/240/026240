The National Centre for Disease Control on Wednesday [6 Nov 2019] said 113 suspected cases of Lassa fever were reported in 12 council areas in 9 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The NCDC said on its website that 13 of the cases were confirmed, with 2 deaths recorded.

The states affected are Edo (72), Ondo (18), Ebonyi (5), Bauchi (11), Nasarawa (1), Plateau (1), the FCT (2), Adamawa (1), Benue (1), and Ogun (1).

The agency said the national Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group would continue to coordinate response activities at all levels, while a rapid response team had already been deployed in Benue state.

It added that the centre, in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Environment and World Health Organisation, had conducted Lassa fever national environmental response in Edo and Ondo states.

[Lassa fever (LF) cases continue to occur in Nigeria in 9 states. The above report does not specify the time period or dates that the report covers nor if any cases were contracted in healthcare centers or in villages. The report appears to be for one week and probably covers the most recent epi week. This is normally the time of year when there are fewer Lassa fever cases.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/. (The rats shown in the report at the source URL above are brown rats, not the multimammate rats that are reservoirs of Lassa fever virus.)

There is no mention in the plans above for public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
