Iran: Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Update: 22 Aug to 31 Dec 2004
---------------------------------------------------
The following is the latest updated report on Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic
Fever (CCHF) in Iran, from the Arbovirus and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers
Laboratory, (National Center) of Pasteur Institute of Iran, in Tehran. This
supplements our last report, published on ProMED-mail on Sun 6 Sep 2004
[see: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - Iran (02) 20040906.2492] and
completes reporting for the year 2004.
For the period of 22 Aug to 31 Dec 2004, the total number of suspected case
of CCHFs was 29. Among the 29 suspected cases from different provinces of
Iran, we found 10 IgM antibody-positive and 7 RT-PCR-positive [cases], and
there were 4 deaths among the confirmed cases. The province of
Sistan-Baluchistan (located in the south-east of Iran) had the highest
number of cases in Iran during this period.
So, in 2004 we recorded a total of 82 suspected cases, 22 [were]
IgM-positive cases, 15 [were] RT-PCR-positive cases and there were 5 deaths
among confirmed cases.
It should be mentioned that with some of the biological reagents used in
serological survey, such as antigens, we have had scientific assistance
from the Pasteur Institutes of Paris and Dakar. And also, for different
aspects of our molecular survey, we have had scientific collaboration with
the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, the Canadian Science
Center for Human and Animal Health(Winnipeg, Canada) and the University of
Texas Medical Branch (Galveston).
