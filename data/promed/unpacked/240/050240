An Emmet County cow is found positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB),
now all cattle herds within a 10-mile radius of the farm will have to
be tested within 6 months. Routine bovine tuberculosis (TB)
surveillance testing, conducted by the Michigan Department of
Agriculture (MDA), found a bovine TB positive herd in Emmet County in
Northern Lower Michigan's Modified Accredited Advanced Zone (MAAZ).

"If we test all the cattle herds within a 10-mile radius circle
around the positive herd, and they are negative, the status of the
MAAZ will not be impacted, as there would have to be at least 3
positive cattle herds in the zone in a year, for the status to drop,"
said Dr. James Averill, MDA's bovine TB project coordinator. "There
are 67 farms that will be contacted and informed of the need to test
for bovine TB."

An informational meeting for Emmet County producers is scheduled for
Wed 21 Apr 2010, from 7-9 p.m. at the West Traverse Township Hall,
8001 M-119, Harbor Springs, Michigan.

On 4 Jan 2010, the MDA, in coordination with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), expanded the MAAZ to include Antrim, Charlevoix,
Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, and Otsego counties. Michigan rules
divided the MAAZ into subzones, which are areas with decreasing
prevalence of bovine TB in both cattle and wildlife. Emmet County is
in Subzone 1 of the MAAZ. In this Subzone, cattle producers test
their herd every 1, 2, or 3 years, depending upon the type of cattle they sell.

"All cattle and bison farms within the 10-mile circle of the positive
herd will be tested within the next 6 months and then revert back to
their normal testing schedule if they all come up negative," said
Averill. "This testing will protect all Michigan cattlemen from the
small chance of buying TB infected cattle. The ultimate goal is to
return bovine TB Free status to the entire state -- and we want to do
everything we can to ensure we reach that goal."

Although testing is an effective way to prevent bovine TB from
spreading to other herds, there is a continued presence of TB in the
wild white tailed deer population in Northern Lower Michigan. To
reduce the risk of a herd getting infected from surrounding deer,
producers can put practices in place and become verified in the
Wildlife Risk Mitigation program. Cattle farmers in Subzone 1 who
obtain this status are at lower risk, and can move cattle more freely
than those who do not.

While infection can occur by nose-to-nose direct contact, infection
is much more likely to occur when cattle feed is contaminated by
infected deer [saliva, nasal droplets, etc]. Beef and dairy farmers
can decrease the risk of exposing their cattle to bovine TB by
limiting cattle-to-deer contact and protecting cattle feed from deer
with wildlife risk mitigation tools.

MDA's Director Don Koivisto signed an updated Zoning Order on 23 Mar
2010, clarifying the testing requirements for Michigan cattle from
farms in the MAAZ Subzone 1 or the MAAZ that move without wildlife
risk mitigation plans. For complete details, go to the Emerging
Diseases website by clicking on

The Emmet County herd is the 2nd TB positive herd identified in
Michigan in 2010. A beef herd in Alcona County, which is in the MAAZ,
was found to be infected with bovine TB in early March [2010].

Since the bovine TB eradication effort began, all of Michigan's one
million cattle have been tested for the disease. Since 1998, the MDA
and the USDA have detected 48 cattle herds and 5 privately owned
cervid operations in Michigan's MAAZ with bovine TB positive animals
on the premises -- either the premises have been depopulated or the
herd was quarantined and placed under a test-and-remove program.

To date, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment
(DNRE) has tested more than 184 120 wild white-tailed deer, with 668
testing positive for bovine TB. Strategies adopted by the DNRE to
reduce bovine TB in the wild white-tailed deer have reduced the
prevalence rate of the disease from the high in 1995 of 4.9 percent
to 1.9 percent in 2009. The disease prevalence in wild white-tailed
deer has flattened in the last few years, and the risk of bovine TB
positive deer infecting cattle persists.

[Bovine tuberculosis is caused by _Mycobacteirum bovis_. While there
are other _Mycobactirium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_ are
among the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.

Disease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take
months to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only
replicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those
which can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can
infect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that
he has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active
disease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent
other animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled
from the herd.

The disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also
spread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission
is the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and
uninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact
or by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an
infected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by
ingesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have
been contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.
Carnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected carcasses.

Various factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread
within a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the
organism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within
a herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For
example, the more animals within a herd that are shedding _M. bovis_,
the greater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact
with an infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences
the efficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_
among animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because
of close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in
their feces, urine and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source
of bacterial transmission.

Environmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the
spread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is
primarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of
survival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging
from 54-75 F. Under laboratory conditions, _M. bovis_ has been
isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at 75 F and 14
weeks from various feeds kept at 32 F. However, under field
conditions, it is difficult to isolate _M. bovis_ from pastures
grazed by animals known to be infected with bovine TB.
