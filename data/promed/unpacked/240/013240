Mumps arrives in Manitoba
-------------------------
An outbreak of mumps in eastern Canada appears to have spread to
Manitoba. Public health officials have confirmed 2 reported cases of
mumps in Winnipeg, both in people in their 20s. Neither has been hospitalized.
Officials said the 2 were likely exposed to mumps when an infected
student from the east visited the University of Manitoba earlier this
month [May 2007]. There have been more than 300 cases of mumps in
Nova Scotia since the outbreak began there in Feb 20007.
Although there can be rare complications from mumps, most cases are
mild, with full recovery in a week or 2. Until now, cases in Manitoba
have been rare, with either no cases or one case reported a year.
Young children are routinely vaccinated for the virus, which causes
swelling and pain in the salivary glands.
