Federal laboratory testing has confirmed a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) case at a commercial broiler farm in Kent County, Delaware. Previously, cases had been found on the northern edge of the nation's largest broiler chicken area.

This avian influenza detection follows previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County and Cecil and Queen Anne's Counties, Maryland. Since the cases were found, federal and state partners have expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen.

State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and the birds have been killed to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus spreading quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, turkeys, and wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

New cases of the highly contagious bird flu have been discovered in Maine. This time, the cases have been found in birds in 2 more counties. So far, nearly 7 million chickens and turkeys in the US have been killed this year [2022] because of the virus.

In Maine, officials confirmed reports of it last month [February 2022] in Knox County. Now it's been found in flocks in Lincoln and York Counties. In York County, there are 2 new confirmed cases in a backyard flock of 173 birds. There are also 2 confirmed cases in Lincoln County in a backyard flock of 70 birds. In Knox County, cases have been confirmed in backyard pet chickens in a flock of 96. Also in Knox County, cases have been confirmed in a flock of 27.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has placed the properties under quarantine and have implemented safety measures. Those safety measures include monitoring properties with domestic flocks and notifying bird owners of the importance of safety measures to help prevent disease.

They say the risk remains high, and backyard flocks and commercial operators should keep their birds indoors to prevent the spread of the disease. Jim Britt with the Department of Agriculture says, unfortunately, death is a primary indicator of the avian flu. "The best thing a bird owner of or a backyard flock owner or a commercial flock owner is to keep those birds inside to keep them away from wild birds," Britt said. "Migratory wild birds are the culprit of bringing the flu to Maine." Britt says the avian flu is a very low risk to humans and as long as poultry and eggs are cooked properly, there should be no concerns if your food is safe.

A highly contagious and deadly avian influenza has been detected in an immense flock of egg-laying chickens in Northwest Iowa, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported on Friday [18 Mar 2022]. The Buena Vista County flock has 5.3 million birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department. The virus was confirmed on Thursday [17 Mar 2022]. It is the 2nd flock in the county to be infected and the 4th in Iowa this year [2022].

The county was among the hardest hit in Iowa by a bird flu outbreak in 2015 and is under a governor's disaster proclamation to assist with the detection and containment of the disease. State agricultural officials have said they have a goal to cull infected flocks within 24 hours of detection to prevent the virus' spread.

Migrating wild birds -- which often don't suffer the same deadly symptoms as domestic birds -- are the likely sources of the outbreaks, State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said. The state agriculture department doesn't identify the specific locations of the outbreaks.

The virus was previously identified in a Taylor County flock of about 919 000 egg-laying chickens on [10 Mar 2022], a Buena Vista flock of 50 000 turkeys on [6 Mar 2022], and a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on [1 Mar 2022].

It has been identified in a total of 39 commercial and backyard flocks in 17 states, with new confirmations coming on a nearly daily basis, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The latest affected flock in Iowa is the largest among them.

The series of outbreaks in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa. Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, as well as the United States Department of Agriculture, are both confirming another positive case of avian influenza (HPAI) in Warren County, Iowa. The virus was found in a non-commercial backyard flock. This marks the 5th case recorded by the state thus far.

Flock owners are recommended to prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual deaths to state/federal officials. A list of signs of the disease can be found at Avian Influenza | Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (http://www.iowaagriculture.gov).

If producers suspect signs of HPAI in their flocks, they should contact their veterinarian immediately. Possible cases should also be reported to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship at (515) 281-5305. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these HPAI detections do not present an immediate cause for public health concern.

The list of counties with confirmed cases as of 20 Mar 2022 are as follows: Buena Vista, Taylor, Warren, and Pottawattamie.

Dozens of birds have been euthanized after New Hampshire's first confirmed case of the current avian flu strain in domestic birds. The owners of Pumpkin Wall Farm animal sanctuary said they're devastated dozens of their animals have to be euthanized, but they're hoping it can be a teaching moment for other farm owners.

[BF] said she rescues all kinds of animals and brings them to Pumpkin Wall Farm. This week, 5 of her turkeys suddenly died. She said she contacted the state veterinarian, who determined they had avian flu.

"All our animals at the sanctuary have their own habitats," [BF] said. "It's not a farm where everybody's mixed together." She said wild ducks carrying the disease landed in their pond and infected the flock. The rest of her chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys then had to be put down.

"They said, 'Your farm is amazing. It's immaculate. It's clean. You did everything right. This isn't your fault,'" [BF] said. "We're not set up to have nets over an acre of land."

State officials said this was the first confirmed diagnosis of this strain of avian flu in domestic birds in New Hampshire. They said there's not a concern for food safety, and the risk to people is low.

BF said by state law, they can't do anything on the farm for about 5 months. The owners said they might consider releasing some geese into the pond on Labor Day weekend [3-5 Sep 2022].

[6] Nebraska (Butler County): commercial flock

Nebraska has confirmed its 1st case of the bird flu in a commercial flock of chickens. The state Department of Agriculture said the highly contagious disease has been found in a flock of 570 000 broiler chickens in Butler County.

The Agriculture Department said the farm has been quarantined and all 570 000 birds will be destroyed. It also has set up a 6.2-mile [10 km] control zone around the farm, and poultry producers within that radius will not be allowed to move poultry products on or off their premises without permission of the department. State veterinarian Roger Dudley said the farm had increased its safety practices and heightened observational testing. It quarantined itself after noticing higher-than-normal mortality among its flock and notified the department.

"Having a second farm in Nebraska confirmed to have HPAI is unfortunate but not completely unexpected," said agriculture director Steve Wellman. "NDA will use all the resources at our disposal, in coordination with our federal partners, to manage a quick response."

Bird flu so far has infected nearly 15 million birds in the US, the worst outbreak since 2015.

That outbreak led to nearly 5 million laying hens being euthanized at 6 farms in Dixon County [Nebraska]. Nationwide, more than 50 million birds were killed in what is considered the worst outbreak on record. An outbreak now could be even more devastating in Nebraska, as the state has since added dozens of operations raising millions of broiler chickens for the Costco processing plant in Fremont.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) has now identified 2 new counties which have confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) as the disease outbreak continues in Kansas and nationwide. Samples from birds exhibiting HPAI signs in a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (poultry) in Dickinson County and also in a non-commercial backyard mixed-species flock (non-poultry) in rural Sedgwick County were confirmed today by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

KDA is working closely with USDA-APHIS on a joint incident response in both of the new locations. KDA officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on both properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Find guidance on biosecurity on the KDA Division of Animal Health webpage at https://www.agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza. Going forward, any additional confirmed cases will be shared directly with local communities and announced on the KDA Avian Influenza webpage, rather than through a statewide news release.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a highly contagious viral disease which can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds. Attentively monitor your birds for signs of HPAI which include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren't showing other signs.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Birds and eggs from the infected flock will not enter the food system. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.

For more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to KDA's avian influenza webpage at https://www.agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza.

In early 2022, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 made its way on migratory pathways into the United States. This virus continues to fly westward, spreading death and destruction to commercial and non-commercial birds. Many wild birds and almost all commercial birds in North America have little defense against this virus.

To help your flocks, raise your level of biosecurity. Keep your birds inside, in a closed building with good ventilation. Be sure you are not tracking this virus into your birds. Change clothes, boots, gloves, and cover your hair and hands before entering the area where your birds are. Be sure to blow your nose before entering the birdhouses as well. Don't track this virus around. While flu flies, we each have to be careful to protect our birds at home or on the job. - Mod.TG]
