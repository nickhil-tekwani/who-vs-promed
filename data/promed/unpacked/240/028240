Acute encephalitis in eastern states such as Odisha and Jharkhand is caused by viruses of dengue and measles too, a latest study has revealed.

The study, which was recently published in the Epidemiology and Infection Journal, has showed that though herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were that of dengue and measles.

Over 16 per cent cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II while another 2.6 per cent cases were by measles. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus.

The study was conducted on patients admitted to major tertiary-care referral hospitals in Odisha which cater to patients from Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The subjects of the study were drawn from SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack; Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics, Cuttack; Capital Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalinga Hospital, Sum Hospital and High Tech Medical College and Hospital of Bhubaneswar between April 2011 and July 2012.

Experts from Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) and School of Biotechnology of KIIT University carried out the survey, the outcome of which is expected to throw more light on viral aetiology of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). This is the 1st time that such a study has been conducted and dominance of HSV will be useful in defining the plans of public health system, Director of RMRC Dr SK Kar said.

In majority of the instances, children were found to have been the victims. At least 12.1 per cent were in the age group of 1 month-5 years, while another 13.4 per cent identified with acute encephalitis were in 6-10 years age bracket. A whopping 55 per cent positive cases were children in 11-15 years age group.

The fatality rate among the cases caused by viral agents was significantly higher than those caused by non-viral sources. The study showed that close to 11 per cent cases were caused by viral agents against 6.2 per cent for non-viral.

Of the 526 cases which were studied, 37 patients (7 per cent) died during their stay in hospitals. Of them, 10 patients had viral agents. The average gap between hospital admission and death was barely 6 days. The research team also conducted a 6-month post-release follow-up on 489 patients who were discharged from the hospitals and found that 82 per cent of them recovered fully while the rest suffered from illness. Some of them died while others faced neurological disabilities.

This is the 1st report which shows HSV as the dominant viral agent for AES in India. At least 7 cases had the deadly Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as the agent and patients mostly belonged to 5 coastal districts of the state [Odisha]. Most cases were reported during the post monsoon periods.

The study team included Dr SK Rathore of School of Biotechnology, KIIT University and Bhagirathi Dwibedi, Dr SK Kar, J Sabat and M Panda of RMRC.

The Findings:
- Most patients afflicted by Japanese encephalitis virus belonged to 5 coastal districts of the state [Odisha]
- In majority of the instances, children were found to have been the victims

[This report provides evidence for yet another etiological agent as the cause of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Past reports have implicated Japanese encephalitis virus for some or all cases, related cases to polluted water implying enteroviruses, or making a case for heat stroke. The above results indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) should be included in the battery of laboratory tests done to diagnose AES illnesses. It would be of particular interest to test AES patients in eastern Uttar Pradesh as well as Behar state, where the majority of these cases have been occurring in past years, usually during the August-September period.
