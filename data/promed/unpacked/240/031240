Unusually high numbers of gastroenteritis cases are being admitted at the
three public sector hospitals, some with symptoms so acute that when first
examined, doctors cannot find their pulse or blood pressure.
Doctors said on Monday that most of the patients were being brought in by
relatives in collapsed or near-collapse condition, caused by diarrhoea and
vomiting, which led to loss of body fluids and electrolyte imbalance, said
emergency doctors.
Diarrhoea, a water-borne disease, is the biggest killer of children in
Pakistan, and children form about 50 per cent of the cases at the hospitals.
At Civil Hospital, which handles 460 emergency cases in a 24-hour period,
the number of gastroenteritis cases are about 60 per day.
"The largest number of cases these days, in terms of ratio to other
diseases, are acute gastroenteritis cases," said Dr Tarique Kamal Ayubi,
head of Civil's Casualty Department.
At Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre, which handles on average 360 cases
within a 24-hour period, the number of acute gastroenteritis cases have
been on average about 50 cases within the 24-hour period.
" I feel people, especially the poor, are not drinking boiled water, and
that is why we are getting the high number of cases," said Dr Seemin
Jamali, in charge of JPMC's Emergency Department.
At Abbassi Shaheed Hospital, which handles on average 375 emergency cases
in 24 hours, an average of 50 gastroenteritis cases are being admitted in
the same period, a source at the medical superintendent cadre level said.
These, however, are only the cases of very poor patients who rush to the
public sector hospitals in the city. Public health doctors said this was
only the "the tip of the iceberg." The lower-middle class, middle class and
well-off patients were taken to private clinics, private hospitals and
private emergency and trauma centres, and so the actual number of cases
were higher, the doctors said.
Doctors at all the three public hospitals said at least six or seven
patients brought in per 24-hour period were in such serious condition that
when first examined, doctors could not find their pulse and blood pressure,
and it was a matter of an interminable wait to see whether the patient
could be brought around or not.
Eighty percent of the gastroenteritis patients were stabilised and
discharged within 12 hours, and 20 per cent were admitted for further
observation and treatment, the emergency doctors said.
None of the patients are being examined to identify and isolate the
causative organism, as no such central management and laboratory facilities
exist in the province, including those for epidemiological reporting, and
documentation on health trends within the population.
Health Department sources said a clinical coordinator had not been notified
for the last two years. The clinical coordinator's job is to assemble a
team and intervene in cases where an outbreak has been reported. The last
coordinator was Dr Ghaffar Billoo, who retired two years ago.
Experts in public health have said an unusual situation exists whereby the
Health Department's cell known as Control of Diarrhoea Diseases, a line
operational unit which oversees diarrhoea cases, is centred at Hyderabad, a
carry over of the time when Karachi was the capital of the country and
Hyderabad was the provincial capital, and never changed over the years.
The Clinical Coordinator works in coordination with the CDD when outbreaks
occur, and at present a situation of skewed management and lack of
coordination exists between the two, they said.
They said in 1998, last year, sporadic cholera cases were documented from
Punjab, the NWFP, Balochistan and even Azad Kashmir. No cholera cases were
reported or documented from Sindh, or even Karachi where according to some
experts, a "silent undocumented epidemic" had occurred. In fact the health
managers in the other provinces, who documented their cases, felt that the
cholera cases they reported were "exported from Sindh".
When asked about the high number of cases, Dr Asad Ali Abro, the Sindh
representative for the World Health Organization, said that a high number
of gastro-enteritis cases had been occurring in Sindh, and the WHO was
ready to provide its services if needed.
"WHO is ready to provide transport media for analysis and culture of
organisms and other assistance if requested, and if there is danger of an
outbreak," said Dr Asad Ali Abro, the WHO's Sindh representative.
Yet it must be remembered that in hot weather, people will quench their
thirst wherever they can and the consumption of cold drinks increases. Most
push-carts selling cold drinks and ice cream, especially outside government
schools, do not boil the water from which they make their refreshments.
Some of the additive flavouring and food colours they use are actually
harmful to the throat, and create conditions for bacteria to multiply.

More than 80 people have been affected by cholera in Bargari village and
adjacent areas in Taunsa sub-division. However, the health authorities have
denied the spread of the epidemic in the village. People of the affected
village who visited the Nishtar Hospital told newsmen on Sunday that
Bargari, a village of 600/700 people, was badly hit by cholera a weeks ago
which broke out due to contaminated water and unhygienic conditions. It
affected some 400 people, including women and children, they claimed.
They said a team of private doctors comprising Dr Sher Muhammad Khosa, Dr
Muhammad Nawaz Dilshad, Dr Sarfraz and Dr Sajjad Ahmad Khan, was providing
them aid to save their lives.
They claimed that five people - Muhammad Iqbal, Faqira Khan, Haleema Mai,
Kaisar Nawaz and Siddiq - had been killed in last three days. They said the
Health Department had so far done nothing for saving their lives. When
contacted, the health authorities said they were not aware of any casualty
due to cholera, and said a team of specialists/doctors was being sent to
the village for investigating the cause of deaths. Meanwhile, the health
authorities have advised people to use boiled water and adopt preventive
measures.

Local hospitals have been receiving alarmingly increased cases of cholera,
meningitis and hepatitis for the last two weeks. According to a survey
conducted by this correspondent, almost 80% patients approaching the local
Divisional Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital, private clinics and nearby rural
health centres are victims of these epidemics.
