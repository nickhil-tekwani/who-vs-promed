Patch High School was closed on Friday [11 May 2007,] so cleaners
could disinfect the building because of a virus threat. One of the
school's teachers was recently hospitalized with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, a potentially fatal illness. Hantavirus is carried by
rodents, such as mice and rats, and is transmitted into the
atmosphere through rodents' urine, saliva, and droppings.
[According to a letter to parents from the school's principal, Susan
Page, during the spring break, the teacher had discovered rodent
droppings in a wood storage area (off-limits to students) adjacent to
the school.] Rodent droppings were also found under the sink in one
classroom, which was then closed. Patch Elementary School, located
next door, [was] scheduled to be disinfected over the weekend [12-13 May 2007].
Page said that it wasn't established that the teacher had contracted
hantavirus [infection] at the school. "We just have to take as many
preventive measures as we can," Page said. [She added that the school
backs to a wooded area and there have been problems with rodents
before.] In the past, extermination and cleaning had been done room
by room. This is the 1st time the entire school has been closed for
disinfection.
The most common rodent found at the school is the dormouse, which is
not a carrier of the virus, Page said. She also said the mild winter
had increased the risk of hantavirus [infection].
In addition to disinfecting, the schools are scheduled for a
follow-up cleaning, as well as blocking holes where rodents can enter
the school. "We're trying to be proactive," Page said.

[The hantavirus involved in this case is presumably Puumala virus.
This virus has been responsible for many hantavirus infections in
Germany this year (2007) (see ProMED-mail archive No. 20070506.1463).
Its reservoir is in bank voles (_Myodes glareolus_), which live
predominantly in forested areas.
