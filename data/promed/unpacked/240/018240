>From an aging memory:
To further Charlie Calisher's remarks, the Armed Forces Epidemiological
Board mounted a military operation to Alaska around 1950, complete with
Colonels and heavy equipment. They would ask the village leders where the
dead were buried. The Native-Americans, a bit resentful, pointed to the
nearest tundra and the military spent all summer digging, without a single
corpse. In 1951, I think, Bob Shope used a more humane approach and found
bodies well preserved near Ketchikan. With the techniques available then,
he isolated no virus, but did isolate that fragile organism, _H. influenzae_!
