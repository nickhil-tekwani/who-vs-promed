The Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe performs the serological survey of
dengue fever in this archipelago, which is one of the French departments in
the Caribbean basin.
In 1997 we examined 1080 sera with a MAC ELISA (immunoassay for revealing
specific IgM) [the immunoglobulin indicating recent infection] and we
have sent 145 of them to the Arbovirus regional center (Institute Pasteur
of Guyane) for detection of antigen (PCR + cell culture) [PCR = polymerase
chain reaction].
310 sera had high levels of specific IgM pointing to recent dengue fever,
and among those tested for virus (i.e. when sampled before the third day
after the onset), 25 had D1 virus [dengue type 1].
No other type was isolated in 1997 in Guadeloupe.
In comparison, in 1995 there were nine D1 and four D2 strains isolated
among 27 sera tested for antigen, and in 1996, fifteen D1, three D2 and one
D4 were isolated among 42 [sera tested].
