Summary
After [providing] information about a dengue case in Germany acquired
in Croatia, health professionals and the public in Croatia were
alerted to assess the situation and to enhance mosquito control,
resulting in the diagnosis of a 2nd case of autochthonous dengue fever
in the same area and the detection of 15 persons with evidence of
recent dengue infection. Mosquito control measures were introduced.
The circumstances of dengue virus introduction to Croatia remain
unresolved.

Introduction
_Aedes albopictus_ was for the 1st time recorded in Croatia in 2004
in the area surrounding Zagreb. Within 2 years, _Ae. albopictus_ was
found on the entire territory of the Adriatic coast from northern
Istria to Dubrovnik in the south. According to routine monitoring of
mosquitoes and published articles, _Ae. albopictus_ is now permanently
established in the coastal but not yet in the continental areas of
Croatia.

Discussion
After France, Croatia is the 2nd country in Europe in which
autochthonous transmission of dengue infection has been shown, which
had not been recorded in Europe since the epidemic in Greece in 1925
to 1928.

The assumption that the German tourist acquired dengue fever in the
region of the Peljesac peninsula was confirmed by the identification
of a 2nd case of dengue fever in a local citizen who had not travelled
outside the area. Although the antigen was not confirmed by RT-PCR in
the acute serum of the patient, taken 6 days after illness onset, the
presence of specific IgM antibodies (IgG was negative) pointed to
acute infection. This was confirmed in a sample taken on day 19 of the
illness when IgM and IgG antibodies were found.

Of the 14 samples taken from the Croatian patient's neighbours, none
of whom had travelled outside Croatia, 9 were IgG-positive, and we
assume that these were relatively recent infections, because 7 of them
were also IgM-positive. Some of them reported having an influenza-like
disease in August and early September [2010]. Moreover, DENV-specific
antibodies were found in 5.4 per cent of the anonymous serum samples
collected in October 2010 by the laboratory that covers the area of
Peljesac and Korcula. In this panel, 5 of the 6 DENV-positive sera
showed borderline or positive values of IgM antibodies against DENV.
Based on the available serological and epidemiological data, we,
therefore, assume that a cluster of acute DENV infections occurred in
the area, most probably during August and September 2010.

[This report presents another example of the consequences of the
spread and establishment of an introduced dengue virus vector
mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_. It will not be surprising to see future
cases of locally acquired dengue and chikungunya virus infections when
these viruses are introduced into areas where there are relatively
abundant population of this mosquito. In the current focus above,
presumably dengue virus transmission has ceased with the onset of cold
weather.

- Philippines (Pangasinan). 1 Mar 2011. The numbers of those
afflicted with the [dengue] viral disease continue to climb in
Pangasinan province in the past 2 months according to the local office
of the Department of Health (DOH) today [1 Mar 2011]. The DOH reports
a total of 157 people have been found positive with dengue, resulting
in 3 deaths thus far.

dengue fever case in North Jakarta reached 485 or lower compared to
same period last year [2010] by 723 cases.

- Saudi Arabia (Jeddah). 6 Mar 2011. In Jeddah, 33 cases of dengue
fever have been reported in the last 3 weeks, according to Health
Affairs Director Dr. Sami Badawood, adding that more infections were
likely in the coming weeks as the cool season comes to an end.

- USA (Miami, Florida). 2 Mar 2011. The 2nd locally acquired case of
dengue fever in Miami-Dade County was confirmed Wednesday [2 Mar 2011]
by the county Health Department. The Health Department said the person
showed symptoms of the illness, and lab tests confirmed it was dengue.
The person has fully recovered from the symptoms, the health
department said. The 1st case of locally acquired dengue in Miami-Dade
was reported this past November [2010]. That person also fully
recovered.
<http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Second-Miami-Dade-Dengue-Fever-Case-Confirmed-117246333.html>.

[One cannot help but wonder if this 2nd case is the result of a
recent importation of dengue virus, or if virus transmission continues
to smolder in the Miami area. It would be helpful to know whether the
current case is due to a dengue virus similar to any of the previously
reported recent cases in Florida.

- Honduras. 5 Mar 2011. The head of the Dengue Program of the
Honduras Ministry of Health, Roxana Araujo, reported today [5 Mar
2011] a "significant reduction" in dengue incidence that in 2010
produced the worst epidemic in 30 years with a total of 83 deaths. She
stated that since 1 Jan [2011] to date, 680 cases of classical dengue
fever have been registered, and during that same period last year
[2010], there were 2880. There are 5 DHF cases this year [2011], while
in the same period last year, there were 190, Araujo added.
