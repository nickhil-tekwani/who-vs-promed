Ebola virus triggers travel and immigration restrictions
--------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus [disease] in West Africa has prompted numerous national responses affecting travel and immigration rules and procedures around the world. The disease has infected an estimated [4269] people and claimed [2288] lives as of [6 Sep 2014], according to the most recent World Health Organization figures ...

[USA restrictions effective until 27 Feb 2015. - Mod.JW]

EVD evacuations to USA greater than previously known
----------------------------------------------------
Transports have included patients exposed to virus, air ambulance operator says. An undisclosed number of people who've been exposed to the ebolavirus -- not just the 4 patients publicly identified with diagnosed cases -- have been evacuated to the US by an air ambulance company contracted by the State Department.

"We moved a lot of other people who had an exposure event," said Dent Thompson, vice president of Phoenix Air Group. "Many times these people are just fine, they just had an exposure. But you have to treat it as though the disease is present." ...

Thompson said Phoenix Air has flown 10 Ebola-related missions in the past 6 weeks.... "Not everything we do is [related to] a sick person," he said, adding that the company has also flown supplies. "We do basically whatever needs to be done."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which is operating an around-the-clock EVD emergency operations center, did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about the exposure patient transports....

Phoenix Air's modified Gulfstream III jets are "literally intensive care units with wings," Thompson said. He said even evacuees without a confirmed EVD diagnosis are placed in an isolation chamber for the 12-14-hour flight from West Africa to the USA. Thompson declined to say where patients who have just been exposed to EVD have been flown to in the USA. "They all go to a hospital and they monitor them," he said.

[4] Convalescent serum therapy

WHO on EVD: Blood may offer help now
------------------------------------
"We agreed that whole blood and convalescent serum may be used to treat Ebola virus disease and that all efforts must be directed to help affected countries use them safely," Marie-Paule Kieny, PhD, the WHO's assistant director-general, told reporters in a press teleconference from Geneva.... Kieny said experts at the WHO meeting discussed the use of both whole blood and purified plasma. "There was a consensus that this has a good chance to work and can be produced now from the [affected] countries themselves," she said, adding that the countries will need help establishing the capacity to use the approach safely....

Kieny said whole blood transfusions have been used to treat EVD in the past, but she couldn't say in how many cases. "We'll try to get a better idea about these data in coming weeks," she added." ... [more]

Q. Is there a minimum time to wait between complete EVD recovery and harvesting blood from a survivor for passive therapy?

Dr. C.J. Peters: This is not known for EVD, but blood/serum from a survivor won't help here anyway. There's no evidence that it will help, but strong evidence that it won't help. For other viruses it can be critical, such as for the arenavirus Junin [cause of Argentinean hemorrhagic fever], for which it is used effectively on a regular basis. But for ebolaviruses it's just not effective. For Junin, they wait until 3 months after illness to harvest serum for therapy, but they don't know that 3 months is required, they just know that 3 months works.

(I was one of the 1st to suggest that passive immune therapy might help with this epidemic and I was surprised at this, but now have a better understanding. Because this is currently making headlines, I will be addressing it in a post soon.)

[An opposing view. We await further details from C.J., one of CDC's pre-eminent hemorrhagic fever experts. There was a considerable discussion about the use of survivor blood towards the end of WHO's virtual press briefing of 8 Sep 2014: http://who.int/mediacentre/multimedia/vpc-expert-meeting-5-sep-2014.pdf?ua=1. - Mod.JW]

[5] Recalculating the case fatality rate
Date: Wed 10 Sep 2014

Estimating the fatality of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------
"Case fatality rate" -- or CFR -- is a term that's been tossed around a lot lately in the context of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. But what does it really mean? ...

It tells us the probability of dying after infection. If estimated properly in the middle of an outbreak, it can even help us examine the efficacy of interventions as they take place.... Based [on] the WHO's most recent report, it seems that only about 53 percent of reported EVD cases thus far have ended in death since the 2014 outbreak began. However ... that 53 percent isn't really a CFR; it's actually the proportion of fatal cases -- or PFC.... PFC doesn't account for the lag between when a case is reported and when a case dies -- approximately 16 days for this outbreak. What this means is that the 2296 deaths reported as of 8 Sep 2014 were all likely reported as cases by 23 Aug 2014.

Adjusting PFC for this lag-time gives us a much better approximation of CFR well before the outbreak ends. [See chart in source] ... The lag-adjusted PFC -- about 80-85 percent -- is significantly higher than the unadjusted PFC but is consistent with recent fatality estimates by Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF]. This finding reiterates the magnitude of this outbreak -- not only in terms of scale, but also lethality. In light of this new estimate, a stronger global effort is all the more imperative.

[Byline: Maia Majumder]

[I recommend reading the whole article and studying the chart. These calculations suggest that the current CFR is actually close to 90 percent of the original ebolavirus Zaire strain. - Mod.JW]

[Re survivors: on Wed 10 Sep 2014, Gregory Kelly <gka25@sfu.ca> wrote, "There needs to a system for non-medically trained personnel to either volunteer on the ground or in the home countries of those that are volunteering on the ground, to help ease their absence. Surely there are things that non-medically trained personnel can do (other than fund-raising)."

Agreed. Ideally, survivors of laboratory-confirmed infections, as they are immune to reinfection, should be recruited in the affected West African countries. They are stigmatised, so cannot work in community education, but they could bring missing face-to-face human contact in isolation hospitals. However, the 1st priority must be clinicians who can ensure strict infection control procedures.

Re death rates: On the one hand, recalculation of these suggests they are much higher than the latest figures. On the other, a lot of the suspected and probable cases have very likely been due to malaria, Lassa fever and other tropical diseases, so in reality the reported case numbers may be vastly exaggerated. Perhaps reported cases of fatal malaria and Lassa are way down from the norm for the time of year.

In any case, transporting blood samples for hours over muddy tracks requires vehicles and fuel which they do not have, and may mean that many samples arrive at the lab in untestable condition and can never be confirmed.

Re Sierra Leone's planned 3-day lockdown: MSF warns that this will just ensure that anybody who has a sick person in the house hides them. Will the health workers have police powers to do a room-by-room search? And anything more than plastic gloves to protect themselves from contamination by the patients they will have to forcibly remove to hospital, and also from fomites in infected households?
