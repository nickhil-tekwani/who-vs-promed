In recent days, 3 students were treated by University Health and
Counseling Services (UHCS) after exhibiting symptoms consistent with
mumps virus infection. They were immediately isolated to prevent
further spreading of the illness while testing and evaluation by
public health officials are underway. Mumps is caused by a virus and
can be spread when the infected person sneezes, coughs or talks in
close proximity to others. University health experts are working
closely with state and public health officials and following their
advice on taking the necessary steps to make sure members of the
campus community remain informed and safe.

If your student has received 2 MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)
vaccinations, he/she is not likely to become ill with mumps. However,
if your student believes that he/she has any signs or symptoms of
mumps, including swelling of the cheeks and jaw, please advise them to
visit UHCS or see their health care provider if they are not on campus.

Prevention remains the simplest and strongest measure to combat the
spread of mumps, so please remind your student to practice good hand
hygiene and cough etiquette around others. Please visit the UHCS
website for more information on mumps.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[In late April 2009, a cluster of cases of mumps at Northeastern
University in Boston caused the university administrators to urge some
500 students to be especially vigilant for signs of mumps because they
could have shared classes with some 9 undergraduates believed to have
contracted mumps virus infection. From the above report, it seems that
not all vulnerable students responded to this advice. - Mod.CP]
