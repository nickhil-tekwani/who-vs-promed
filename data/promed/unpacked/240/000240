Two children died, reportedly of Nipah virus infection, in Faridpur
Medical College Hospital on Thursday and Friday [6 and 7 Mar 2008].
Sources in the civil surgeon's office and the Faridpur Medical
College said a [6-year-old girl] from Udaypur in Rajbari died Friday
morning, and a [16-year-old boy] from Goalanda in Rajbari died on
Thursday, [both] in Faridpur Medical College Hospital. Physicians at
the hospital said samples were sent to hospital in Dhaka for viscera
reports to establish the cause of the death.

The United News of Bangladesh reports that the Rajbari civil surgeon,
Bazlul Haque, after talking with the physicians at Faridpur Medical
College Hospital said [the 16-year-old boy] might have suffered from
Nipah virus infection.

Local authorities, meanwhile, began a campaign on Saturday [8 Mar
2008] to make people aware of Nipah virus infection.
