The World Health Organization (WHO) was recently notified of an outbreak of human infections linked to camels in Oromia and Somali regions of Ethiopia that has affected nearly 200 people.

In Oromia, 158 human cases were reported and a further 40 cases were reported in Somali state of Ethiopia as of 12 Jun 2021. Out of 40 hospitalized cases, 35 were treated and discharged. No deaths have been reported. Symptoms included diarrhea, fever, and vomiting associated with the consumption of camel meat. Samples from camels and human cases have been taken and are undergoing laboratory investigation.

At least 19 people were poisoned this week in Rabdhuure district in Bakool region, some of them seriously ill after eating meat from camels sick with a mysterious sickness, officials and activists said. Rabdhuure is a small district located in Bakool region near the border with Ethiopia.

The poisoning follows after locals slaughtered their dying camels -- sick with an unknown disease -- only to eat its meat before it dies, in what Somalis call, "Xalaaleyn". Officials said that those who drank the soup from the sick camel meat were more seriously affected than those who ate the meat.

Officials said that the disease, which is spreading rapidly among the camels has symptoms like pain, chills, diarrhea, fever, and swelling around the neck and abdomen. Breastfeeding camels suffer breast infection, which leads the breast to swell. Interviewed by Horn Observer, Hassan Moalim Yusuf Black, former Southwest State MP, a political activist from Bakool region called the situation dire and called for the federal government of Somalia, Southwest State of Somalia, and concerned international organizations to urgently investigate the situation of this unknown disease spreading among the camels for the last 3 weeks.

"The situation is very serious and people suffering meat poisoning need emergency treatment and the camels need to be rescued from this disease" Hassan Moalim Yusuf Black, former Southwest State MP, a political activist from Bakool region said, "I call on the federal government, the South West and Jubaland administrations, and international agencies to urgently investigate this situation and come to the rescue. reach the sick." So far there are no reported deaths related to this meat poisoning.

Camels are a central part of the cultural and pastoral life of many Somalis and are a source of income and food. The deputy governor of Bakool region Yahye Maalim told the local media that "if the camels are not treated promptly, the livestock in Bakool region will face extinction and people in the area will suffer droughts. Somalia is currently facing flooding, droughts, and locust invasion, this camel disease will add complicate the situation further and might likely force people to go towns if their camels die as a result of this disease.

The etiologies of the camel illness and that of the human illness associated with eating the meat from the ill camels are not at all clear. Nor is it established that the same infection or toxin is involved. There are cases in 2 southern regions of Ethiopia as well as in an area in Somalia adjacent to those regions. No deaths have been reported which makes gastrointestinal anthrax unlikely. Likewise, it is unclear if the undiagnosed illnesses and deaths in Kenya and Ethiopia reported in ProMED in 2020 are related.

Similar outbreaks have been reported in the past, including in Kenya:
- June 2015 https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/crisis-51-people-get-hospitalized-after-eating-meat-dead-camel
Isiolo General Hospital is facing overstretch of resources following the admitting of 51 people who became sick after feeding on meat from a dead camel. At first, 11 people went to the hospital complaining of headaches, stomachaches, diarrhea, and vomiting, just after they had consumed the meat and were admitted. Today, Saturday [19 Jun 2021], 40 more have been admitted with the same symptoms bringing the total number to 51.

Speaking to The Nation, Isiolo Medical superintendent Mohammud Guyo confirmed the incident saying that an isolation ward has been set aside to cater for the growing number of patients who fed on the camel carcass. The hospital has also sent specialists to treat people with similar symptoms from their homes, as the hospital resources are fast approaching limits. There are also concerns that there are sick people who might not make it to the hospital.

The incident comes in the wake of an ongoing drought in the area, which has seen livestock that make for the larger part of the residents' occupation die.

- December 2017 https://www.barfblog.com/2017/12/3-hospitalized-after-consuming-camel-meat-in-kenya/
George Kithuka of KBC reports that [3] residents of Muruangai village in Samburu central are said to have feasted on the uninspected camel carcass that left them with serious symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.

A mother and her 2 children are among residents of Muruangai village admitted to the Samburu county referral hospital for close monitoring. According to a nurse at the facility, the patients were brought to the hospital complaining of severe diarrhea and vomiting.

The sub-county disease surveillance coordinator says his office received a call that an entire village was complaining of similar symptoms and on arrival, it was established that residents had consumed uninspected meat.

The following is a review of zoonoses from camels:

Abstract
--------
"Dromedary, or one-humped, camels _Camelus dromedarius_ are an almost exclusively domesticated species that are common in arid areas as both beasts of burden and production animals for meat and milk. Currently, there are approximately 30 million dromedary camels, with the highest numbers in Africa and the Middle East. The hardiness of camels in arid regions has made humans more dependent on them, especially as a stable protein source. Camels also carry and may transmit disease-causing agents to humans and other animals. The ability of camels to act as a point source or vector for disease is a concern due to increasing human demands for meat, lack of biosafety and biosecurity protocols in many regions, and a growth in the interface with wildlife as camel herds become sympatric with non-domestic species. We conducted a literature review of camel-borne zoonotic diseases and found that the majority of publications (65%) focused on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), brucellosis, _Echinococcus granulosus_, and Rift Valley fever. The high fatality from MERS outbreaks during 2012-2016 elicited an immediate response from the research community as demonstrated by a surge of MERS-related publications. However, we contend that other camel-borne diseases such as _Yersinia pestis_, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever are just as important to include in surveillance efforts. Camel populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are increasing exponentially in response to prolonged droughts, and thus, the risk of zoonoses increases as well. In this review, we provide an overview of the major zoonotic diseases present in dromedary camels, their risk to humans, and recommendations to minimize spillover events."
