Michigan health officials are reminding residents to be careful around livestock after an outbreak of an illness called cryptosporidiosis, which is caused by a parasite, in 3 counties. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and local health departments are investigating the outbreak in residents in Livingston, Ingham and Oakland counties, according to MDHHS in a Thursday [8 Dec 2022] press release.

"The illnesses are believed to have been caused by a parasite called _Cryptosporidium_ and occurred after people came into contact with a group of sick calves," MDHHS wrote in the release. "To date, a total of 12 people between the ages of 19 and 56 (one confirmed, 4 probable and 7 suspect cases) became sick with diarrhea and other symptoms between 15-21 Nov 2022."

The parasite is identified in the stool of infected people or animals, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected calves and other livestock can spread it even if they don't seem sick.

If a person's hands, drinking water, food or recreational water are contaminated with small amounts of infected stool from either livestock or people, they could swallow the parasite and become sick. It is not spread through properly cooked meat from animals or pasteurized milk or dairy products.

"Symptoms in people include diarrhea, stomach pain and cramping, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, fever and weight loss, and can last for several weeks," MDHHS wrote in the release. "Treatment is available, so it is important to seek medical care if you have symptoms, especially if the symptoms do not resolve quickly."

[For the original Michigan state public health announcement, see https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/newsroom/2022/12/08/parasite. Livingston, Ingham and Oakland counties are 3 latitudinally contiguous counties in south-central Michigan roughly extending between the cities of Lansing and Pontiac.

_Cryptosporidium_ is an enteric pathogen that is transmitted through animal-to-person or person-to-person contact or through ingestion of contaminated water or food. In the United States, cryptosporidiosis is the leading cause of waterborne disease outbreaks and the 3rd leading cause of zoonotic enteric illness. Although cryptosporidiosis is a nationally notifiable disease, only a small percentage of cases are reported to the CDC (1).

_C. hominis_ and _C. parvum_ are the most prevalent species causing disease in humans. Because _C. hominis_ is transmitted only among humans, _C. hominis_ cases tend to come from more highly populated urban counties. Most human _C. parvum_ cases are due to animal exposure, including infected cattle, and thus are more likely to occur in more sparsely populated rural counties (2). This urban-rural dichotomy has also been noted in a survey of surface waters for enteric protozoal pathogens in Michigan itself (3).

In recent years, genotyping of _Cryptosporidium_ species and subspecies at the gp60 gene locus has become essential in identifying potential sources and scope of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis (4). As discussed in ProMED's most recent post on cryptosporidiosis concerning an outbreak of _C. parvum_ in Sweden (see below in the See Also section), the subtype IIaA15G2R1 is the most dominant _C. parvum_ subspecies infecting dairy cattle and humans in industrialized nations (5).

The report above states that the 12 human cases, despite residing in 3 different counties, are presumed to have all become infected from the same group of sick calves. _C. parvum_ is thus the most likely culprit in this outbreak. It is hoped that stool isolates from at least one of the human cases and one of the sick calves will be submitted to the CDC and/or appropriate state reference laboratory for genotyping to confirm the source of this outbreak.
