An Ontario County resident has a confirmed case of enterovirus D68 [EV-D68], the 1st known instance of the illness in the county.

Barbara Roszak, the county's director of preventive health services, said on Friday [3 Oct 2014] the county public health department was notified of a laboratory-confirmed case in an adult county resident. The person has a history of asthma and is recovering, but the County Director declined to give more detailed information on the patient, including where he or she lives and their age.

Enterovirus D68, which has now been seen in almost every state, has been linked to 4 deaths across the country. The latest fatality was a 10-year-old girl in Rhode Island who died as a result of a bacterial infection associated with EV-D68. According to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 500 people in the US have been sickened so far. Almost all have been children.

According to public health officials, enteroviruses -- which number more than 100 -- are responsible for 10 to 15 million respiratory illnesses each year in the US. The viruses tend to circulate in the summer and fall. "A laboratory-confirmed case of EV-D68 in Ontario County is not unexpected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported widespread circulation of this illness across the United States and recent cases have been confirmed in Western New York." Roszak said. Enterovirus D68 causes symptoms very similar to a cold or the flu, and can be mild, moderate, or severe. People with enterovirus D68 infection may cause body aches, runny nose, cough, sneezing, and fever. Children and those with asthma are at increased risk for more severe illness. Adults are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms. "Our public health message continues to focus on prevention." [There is no vaccine].

Ontario County Public Health remains in frequent contact with the state Department of Health, area hospitals, urgent care centers, physicians, and schools regarding the illness in the community.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the enterovirus D68 is present in central Ohio and is believed to have sickened many youngsters with upper respiratory illness. Columbus Public Health officials said the test results followed an increase in emergency department, urgent-care visits and hospitalisations. The confirmation comes after Nationwide Children's Hospital sent samples from infected people to the Ohio Department of Health, which then forwarded them to the CDC.

Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for Columbus Public Health, said local health officials were concerned when those with severe respiratory illness who visited emergency rooms jumped from 44 on [14 Aug 2014] to 123 by [9 Sep 2014]. He said that is not a determinant of whether the virus caused the illnesses because regular lab work cannot confirm the existence of the virus. However, the spike did lead medical professionals to believe something out of the ordinary was causing the uptick, he said. Health officials said there's no reason to panic. Most children will recover from the disease within a few days. However, there is potential for severe disease, so children who display wheezing, difficulty breathing or a fever should be checked out by a medical professional, Rodriguez said.

From mid-August to [24 Sep 2014], 220 people in 32 states were confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68, said Darlene M Foote, a spokeswoman for the agency. The cases were confirmed by the CDC or state public health labs that notified the agency. All the cases but one were among children. So far, no deaths attributed to EV-D68 infection have been documented, Foote said. Hospitals in Missouri and Illinois have had higher numbers of children with severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 than usual for this time of year, she said. Most states likely are affected by respiratory illnesses caused by EV-D68. As investigations progress, the CDC will have a better understanding of whether trends for enterovirus infections are going up or down, she said. Because the disease is caused by a virus, doctors can treat only the symptoms through supportive care. There is no vaccination for enterovirus, Rodriguez said.

[3] USA (New Jersey): child fatality

A medical examiner says a New Jersey child has died from enterovirus D-68 [virus infection]. It's the 1st such ruling in the country. Even more surprising, the young boy showed none of the cold-like symptoms before his death. Health officials say the death of a 4-year-old boy in New Jersey from enterovirus D-68 is extremely rare. The boy died last month [September 2014] in Hamilton Township after showing no typical signs of the virus. He went to bed with pink eye and never woke up. "The idea that a very rapidly progressive death in one's sleep is surprising but not completely unanticipated," said Dr Anne Schuchat with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Enterovirus D-68 [infection] is a respiratory illness that has sickened more than 500 people across the country, many of them children with pre-existing conditions such as asthma. 4 other deaths nationwide have been linked to EV-68 but it's not clear what role the virus played. "Even though enterovirus D68 is quite common this year [2014], it is mainly causing very mild illness and not this most horrific presentation that just occurred," said Dr Schuchat.

Some children with the virus have also experienced paralysis in their limbs, but at this point it's unclear if the polio-like symptoms are related to the virus or caused by something else. Health officials in New Jersey are also keeping an eye on another child in the same school as [the deceased pupil]. He is fighting a respiratory illness. Tests are pending to determine if he has enterovirus [infection].

The CDC recommends frequent hand washing, managing a child's asthma, and getting a flu shot as protective steps.

According to the CDC from mid-August to 6 Oct 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 594 people in 43 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.

The virus, uncommon until recently, typically causes only cold-like symptoms, but some children experience a severe illness with breathing difficulties. Almost all the recent cases involved children, many of them with a history of asthma. The new total reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 6 Oct 2014 is an increase of 56 from the 538 cases reported 3 Oct 2014. The number of affected states stayed the same, at 43 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html. The New Jersey case is significant in the abrupt death of the patient.

Last week (week of 29 Sep 2014) the CDC said 4 people who recently died were infected with EV-D68, but it was not clear what role the virus played. Also, Rhode Island officials said last week that a 10-year-old girl who had died of a _Staphylococcus aureus_ infection also was infected with EV-D68. The CDC also said that about half of specimens from patients with severe respiratory illness tested by CDC labs have come back positive for EV-D68. About a third have tested positive for other enteroviruses or rhinoviruses. The CDC and others have been looking into a possible association of the virus with a polio-like illness in children in Colorado and a few other states (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/10/ev-d68-blamed-nj-death-case-count-rises. - Mod.CP]
