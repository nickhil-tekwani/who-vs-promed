The official post to OIE from New Zealand regarding the foot and mouth
disease threat reads as follows:
Further update on letter received threatening release of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) virus on a New Zealand offshore island
A 2nd letter has been received, via media, stating that the original letter
sent last week claiming release of "a vial of FMD virus on an off-shore
island" was a hoax and that no FMD virus was released in New Zealand. A
police assessment has confirmed that the letter is highly likely to have
come from the same source as the 1st one.
Intensive surveillance on the island and extensive investigations over the
past week have shown no evidence of clinical signs of FMD or factual
substance to the original letter.
As a result of this additional information and the surveillance results
thus far, New Zealand now intends to remove the legal restrictions covering
the movement of animals and other goods off Waiheke Island by 5 p.m. on Tue
17 May 2005.

Country & Date: New Zealand. 17-May-05
Type: Unofficial
Issue: Most FMD restrictions on Waiheke Island will be removed from today,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Summary: "Given the potential implications for New Zealand's agricultural
sector and our international trading obligations, MAF always felt the need
to act in a cautious manner to ensure New Zealand's economy and trading
partners were protected." MAF now intends to remove the legal restrictions
covering the movement of animals and risk goods off Waiheke Island by 5pm
on Tuesday 17 May 2005. "MAF will, however, continue with a low level of
monitoring of livestock on the island until 23 May 2005," Dr. O'Neil said.
"The hoax has cost the nation at least 1 million New Zealand dollars (USD
714 000) a day," said police assistant commissioner Peter Marshall.
