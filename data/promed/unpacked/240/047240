The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA define an
emerging infectious disease as:
"A disease of infectious origin with an incidence that has increased within
the
past two decades, or threatens to increase in the near future. [1994]"
In the case of some diseases, this truly is the case. On the other hand,
some
conditions, eg. cryptosporidiosis, only appear to be on the rise. In fact,
improved diagnostic methods may be responsible for an increase in reporting,
though the actual rate of occurance remains unvaried.
Also bear in mind that some diseases, e.g. tuberculosis, are actually
making a
re-emergence due to socioeconomic and environmental factors; while others
still
are variations on diseases that may have not necessarily seen an increase in
incidence, e.g. antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

The intent of my (original) question .... was
rhetorical: one can read all of the definitive work which has been done on
emerging and resurgent diseases, yet many of the definitions are almost
the same as definitions of epidemics or pandemics: when there are more
cases than expected; when something arises de novo, which is exceedingly
rare; when a pathogenic process which has been present is recognized; when
changes in the human-environment relationship result in diseases which are
enzootic enter the human cycle.
I've just written several papers on
emerging diseases, and organized a session at the American Association for
the Advancement of Science on emerging diseases, and I realize that I am
frustrated with the looseness of definitions as this multidisciplinary
effort continues. I think that it is time to go back to some
fundamentals -- to begin a process of redefining, of modifying definitions
which are several years old, and assessing the appropriateness of current
definitions, to make sure that we are speaking in the same language.
Are some of our definitions inaccurate or too vague? What is an emerging
disease? A resurgent disease? It is a very philosophically complex
problem speaks to the epistemology of knowledge about emerging
diseases -- how do we know what we think we know? If we lack terms and
categories which are appropriate for a disease or a pathogen, then we will
run into problems of misclassification and misunderstanding. One of the
most tantalizing issues is this: how do we recognize a new disease? How do
we classify it as "new" or "emerging?" I think that if this exciting and
vital effort in emerging diseases is to go forward, to transcend old
definitions, then it is now time, about 5 years after the Institute of
Medicine's effort, to do some fundamental rethinking, even if we come up
with the same answers and definitions as before.
