From: "Dr. Richard H. Evans" <snaver@home.com

Over the past year I have received 13 cases of Synovial Chondrometaplasia in
Great Horned Owls from Illinois, bilaterally involving the shoulders,
elbows, wrists, knees, ankles and digits.
Stone, et al. at the Raptor Center in St. Paul, Minnesota have also recently
reported this syndrome in 14 Great Horned Owls and a Red-tailed Hawk from
Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota (J. Wildl. Dis. 35(1): 137-140,
1999).
Early cases exhibited synovial villous hyperplasia, distension of joint
capsule, bursae, etc. with large amounts of synovial fluid and multifocal
areas of subintimal fibroplasia (mesenchymal proliferation). In one case
18-20cc were aspirated from each elbow and 25-40cc from each shoulder. Fluid
analysis was normal with the exception of an increase in phagocytic cells
and some rafts of sloughed synovial cells.
These mesenchymal foci developed into fibrocartilage nodules, maturing to
hyaline cartilage (with minimal if any atypia) and finally enchondral
ossification. "Loose bodies" were rarely noted. Pathological changes in
articular cartilage were not noted. Mild to moderate, chronic
lymphoplasmacytic synovitis was not common but when noted was usually
associated directly with these bony nodules (probably secondary to pressure
trauma by these nodules.)
Bacteriologic, virologic and electronmicroscopic examination of synovia and
its fluid failed to identify a causative agent. Toxicological analyses are
in progress.
I am interested in corresponding with others who have seen similar cases
and might be willing to shares tissues from their cases as well as any work
being done on the pathogenesis of this condition.
