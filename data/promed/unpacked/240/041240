PAU finds fresh attacks of late blight disease on potato crop
-------------------------------------------------------------
Late blight disease continues to haunt potato growers of the state as
Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has found fresh instances of its
attack on the crop in some areas and warned the farmers to control it
before it acquires epidemic form. "Incidence of late blight on potato
has been noticed in certain fields in Hoshiarpur and surrounding
areas which came to light after conducting a disease survey," said Dr
HS Rewal, head of Department of Plant Pathology, PAU.

Stating that the current weather conditions are conducive to the
development and spread of disease, he asked farmers to spray
recommended fungicide to protect their crop. "This disease is weather
dependent and develops very fast during high humidity, and the
present weather conditions are quite favourable for it," he said. He
warned if the disease was left uncontrolled, it could lead to serious
losses. Late blight has been damaging the late varieties of potato
crops for the last 2 years in the state and has severely damaged the
crop.

Punjab has brought 75 000 hectares (185 329 acres) of land under
potato cultivation with total output of 1.6 million metric tonnes.
Punjab mainly grows seed potato varieties, which are supplied to
various parts of the country.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is
spread by plant material (including seed tubers), wind, and water. It
also affects tomato, and solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers
resulting in total tuber breakdown. Disease management includes
preventative fungicide treatment of seed tubers and additional
fungicide applications to the crop. For more information on PLB see
links and previous posts below.

In India, infected seed potatoes are often a problem, and therefore
this outbreak in a state that grows mainly seed tubers carries a
particularly high risk of spreading the disease. Cultivars with
reduced PLB sensitivity are being developed in the country.
