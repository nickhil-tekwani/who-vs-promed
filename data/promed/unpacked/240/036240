Data in WHO as of 19 Mar 2013 for 2013 data and 18 Mar 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- In Cameroon, due to continued circulation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), gaps in surveillance and influx of vulnerable populations from Central African Republic (CAR), the World Health Organization is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to 'very high'.
- Last week [week of 10 Mar 2014], 2 new WPV1s were reported from Cameroon, and 1 new case is reported this week, confirming continued transmission of this strain and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October [2013]. Outbreak response immunization activities since October [2013] has not been sufficient to stop transmission.
- A new case of WPV1 was also reported this week in Equatorial Guinea with onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2014] from Centro Sur province, close to the border with Cameroon. This is the 1st polio case reported from the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated virus is linked to transmission in Cameroon. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, outbreak response activities are currently being planned, including NIDs [National Immunization Days] in early April [2014]. Reported routine coverage of infants with 3 doses of OPV is estimated at only 40 percent.

Afghanistan
- No new WPV1s were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 14, and 3 for 2014. The most recent WPV1 case, with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014], was reported from Kunar province, Eastern Region.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.
- Mop-up immunization activities are being conducted this week in selected high-risk districts in the south, east and north of the country, with nationwide SIAs planned for late March [2014], using trivalent OPV.

Nigeria
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 53. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [1 Feb 2014], from Kano.
- One new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [9 Feb 2014] (from Damboa, Borno).
- Analysis of recent Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) indicates overall quality continues to improve, including in highest-risk areas. According to Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), almost 90 percent of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 11 high-risk states achieved coverage of at least 80 percent during last week's conducted IPDs. This compares to less than 65 percent of LGAs in these same states achieving the same level of coverage just 12 months ago.
- The next IPDs are planned for April [2014], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- 2 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, one from Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and one from greater Karachi, Sindh, bringing the total number of cases for 2014 to 29. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [15 Feb 2014] (WPV1 from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA).
- No new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 45 for 2013, and 4 for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Jan 2014] (from FR Bannu, FATA).
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunizations resumed in North Waziristan.

Central Africa
- A new case of WPV1 was also reported this week in Equatorial Guinea with onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2014] from Centro Sur province, close to the border with Cameroon. This is the 1st polio case reported from the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated virus is linked to transmission in Cameroon. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, outbreak response activities are currently being planned, including NIDs in early April [2014]. Reported routine coverage of infants with 3 doses of OPV is estimated at only 40 percent.
- In Cameroon, 1 new WPV1 case was reported in the past week, with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014], confirming continued WPV1 transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of cases in October [2013].
- Genetic sequencing suggests prolonged undetected circulation. Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance and influx of vulnerable populations from CAR, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high.
- Since confirmation of the outbreak in Cameroon in October [2013], 4 nationwide campaigns have been conducted. However, the quality of implementation varied greatly by region, and serious coverage gaps remain. As many as 40 percent of children remain under-immunized (with 30 percent having received zero doses) during SIAs.
- The confirmation of new cases in Cameroon has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns so that all children are reached multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.
- Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, and additional immunization activities are being considered in these countries.
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- NIDs with trivalent OPV were held from [28 Feb 2014 to 2 Mar 2014] with trivalent OPV, and the next nationwide campaigns are planned for late March [2014], using bivalent OPV.
- In CAR, additional campaigns are currently being planned, in response to the very high risk of international spread of polio from Cameroon.

Horn of Africa
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 217 since April 2013 (194 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, and 9 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2013 (from Bari, Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region.
- In particular, the TAG expressed concern at critical quality gaps in implementation in key areas of Ethiopia. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (17 positive samples collected this year, the most recent of which was collected on [16 Feb 2014]; in 2013, 169 positive samples were collected). (Data as of 2 Mar 2014).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule. However, no additional supplementary campaigns with OPV are being planned.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample were collected during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of laboratory-confirmed WPV1 cases is 25. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2014] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate.
- Additionally, there are 12 cases confirmed from contested areas but not yet reflected in official figures.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for April and May [2014] (multi-country).

[The original table showing the number of confirmed cases by country showed there were a total of 37 cases of WPV associated polio with dates of onset in 2014. This total did not include the newly confirmed case in Equatorial Guinea mentioned in the Central Africa update section of the report above. In addition there isn't mention of a case in Ethiopia with date of onset 5 Jan 2014, reported by ReliefWeb (see prior ProMED post Poliomyelitis - update (04): Cameroon, Ethiopia, global 20140317.2338423 for more details on this case).

The vaccination coverages reported by Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea are disconcerting as there are great risk factors for continued circulation of WPV in these countries.

In addition, ProMED has reported on a suspected case in Lebanon and one in Iraq, pending laboratory results. Clarification of the actual global count as well as results of laboratory tests on the suspected cases in Lebanon and Iraq would be greatly appreciated.
