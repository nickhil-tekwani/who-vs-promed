Several private individuals in Visby have reported to the County Board of Gotland that they have found sick and dead pigeons. After analysis at the State Veterinary Institute, SVA, they have concluded that the pigeons were infected with pigeon plague. The disease can also infect domestic birds.

If domestic poultry become ill, the disease can turn into Newcastle disease, a contagious and serious disease that must be reported to a veterinarian.

- It is serious. We are trying to inform those who raise domestic birds so that they do not get the infection into the flocks, says county veterinarian Agneta Karlsson Norstr√∂m, to SVT News East.

Infected birds do not have to die, but they may stop laying eggs or lay abnormally shaped eggs or eggs with a soft shell, the county administrative board writes on its website.

- I have sent 3 birds to SVA, but I also know that private individuals have sent birds directly there. I therefore do not know exactly how many infected birds have been found in Visby.

So far, there have been no reports of infected birds in the Gotland countryside.

[Visby is a town on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea; see map at <tinyurl.com/yc4ewe5r>.

Newcastle disease (ND), a WOAH-listed infectious disease of poultry, is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). In case officially confirmed, the strain which has allegedly affected Gotland's/Visby pigeons is likely to be the pigeon variant, PPMV-1.

ND occurs in most countries of the world. In the EU, all countries except Sweden and Finland currently vaccinate against the disease. Norway does not vaccinate, but Denmark started vaccinating in 2005. Even with vaccination, outbreaks occur each year in several European countries. Despite occasional sporadic outbreaks, Sweden has managed to maintain its status as a non-vaccinating country.

The following information, presenting ND incidence in Sweden since 2001, is derived from the State Veterinary Institute (SVA) website:
