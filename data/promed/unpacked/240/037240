In a potential epidemic, at least 61 people have died and 662
hospitalized due to encephalitis in the last 10 days in the district,
around 125 kms [78 mi] north-east of Lucknow.

The chief medical superintendent in-charge of the district hospital,
Dr RS Baranwal said encephalitis in the area was caused by
[transmitted by] mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.

Encephalitis is most often caused by a viral infection and exposure to
viruses can occur through mosquito, tick, and other insect bites,
contaminated food or drink, breathing in respiratory droplets from an
infected person and skin contact. The disease caused by the herpes
simplex virus is the major cause of fatal cases in all ages, including
newborns, especially during or after monsoons in India. Last year
[2010], a large number of deaths due to encephalitis were reported in
Bihar and UP [Uttar Pradesh). "Therefore, it is important to maintain
cleanliness with an aim to prevent the disease from spreading," Dr
Baranwal said.

On Monday [13 Sep 2011], 3 more children died due to the disease
[encephalitis], taking the death toll to 61 in the district. 10 new
patients have also been admitted to the district hospital. The number
of patients suffering from acute fever has crossed 662. Of them the
condition of 6 children is stated to be critical. The blood and serum
samples of 13 patients have been sent to Lucknow medical college for
examination.

The paediatrician of the district hospital Dr.K.K.Verma said that it
was for the 1st time in 2 years that the patients in such a huge
number had been coming to the hospital. He said that last Tuesday 350
patients had visited the Out Patient Department (OPD), which was a
record in itself. Earlier, the maximum number of patients to OPD were
150 to 175.

Dr RS Baranwal said that considering the increasing number of patients
in the hospital a letter had been written to the government for more
medicine and resources. A new lot of medicine would arrive in a day or
2, he added.

Due to the increasing number of encephalitis patients in the hospital,
new patients are now lying outdoors on the ground and hoping to get
medical treatment.

[This report mentions various etiologies of encephalitis in that
region of India without indicating which of these might be responsible
for the numerous cases in the hospital. Previous recent reports of
encephalitis in this region indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus
was responsible for at least some of them, while other were due to an
unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome, some associated with water
that suggest enteroviruses might be involved. ProMED will be
interested in learning of the results of the tests being conducted on
the serum samples submitted to the Lucknow laboratory.
