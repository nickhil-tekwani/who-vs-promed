Report from: Dr. Alessandro Parente, Francesca Scognamiglio, Giorgio
Galiero of IZS of Portici (Naples), and Dr. Ugo Mariani of IZS of Benevento

In Benevento Province (Campania Region - South Italy) about 70 km
[43.5 miles] from Naples on 25 Aug 2009 one goat died [near the
village of Bonea]. The [laboratory] analysis confirmed _Bacillus
anthracis_. The Anthrax Reference Institute of Foggia is working to
determine the genotype.

The epidemiological situation is not clear as the farmer declared
that 11 goats had disappeared. Probably they died while grazing. The
outbreak developed in a mountainous area and it is normally very
difficult to find dead animals.

An emergency vaccination of the susceptible animals that live in that
area was begun immediately.

Benevento Province is an endzootic area for anthrax. In the past
several outbreaks have occurred. The genotype of _Bacillus anthracis_
circulating in the Benevento Province is presently unknown.

[From previous work by Antonio, Aia is the strain typical for
southern Italy and I would be surprised if this caprine outbreak were
different. But there are always surprises in this business and
Campania is immediately north of the Aia type-specific regions of
Puglia and Basilicata. North of Rome it is usually Group 3, and in
Northern Italy it is B1. The presence of Aia in southern Italy would,
to me, indicate that it has been there since early historic times.

Anthrax in goats is not unusual but they are normally browsers, which
would make me suspect that this may not be the primary outbreak in
the Bonea area. However goats will graze and so a soil-based caprine
infection is possible. And if it is 'mountainous' one can speculate
that the primary cases might have been in local wild deer. Browse
normally gets contaminated by blow-flies feeding on a dead animal
nearby when vomiting up the bloody fluid in their stomachs to get rid
of excess fluids; and then they eat the remaining solids vomited. The
residue on the leaf will contain vegetative cells which sporulate in
situ. Thus shrub leaves within some 3m (10 feet) of an anthrax
carcass get contaminated and stay so until it rains.
