Case 1. On 9 May 2014, one CCHF [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] case was reported from FJCH, Quetta [Balochistan province]. The case was shepherd. He developed high grade fever with bleeding rectum [anus]and mouth a week before and became unconscious. Laboratory investigation revealed Hb [hemoglobin] 11.2 g/dl, platelets 28 000/cmm, urea 120 mg per cent, creatinine 2.2 mg per cent. Malaria was positive and his LFTs were deranged. A blood sample was collected earlier which was found positive for CCHF. There was no history of travel. Supportive treatment along with 8 pints of platelets was transfused but patient developed renal failure and passed away on 9 May 2014. No more cases were identified in the family or surrounding area.

Case 2. On 13 May 2014, one CCHF case aged 40 years was admitted in Isolation Room of Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar with history of fever, myalgia, mucosal bleeding and hypotension. A surveillance Officer of DEWS [disease early warning system] investigated the case. The case is milkman and belongs to Saraey Norang in Lakki district [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province]. He worked in a private farm in Karak [district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] when he developed the symptoms. His platelet count wasless than 50 000/mm3. A blood sample was taken and sent to the NIH [National Institute if Health, Pakistan] and was found positive for CCHF. Barrier nursing was ensured in the hospital [to protect the staff], but the patient did not survive; he expired on 14 May 2014. The Surveillance Officer and the DoH [Health district] in DIKhan was informed and requested to conduct a field investigation in Lakki.

[It is not clear if these 2 cases are the ones reported as suspected in the ProMED-mail post of 23 May 2014 (archive no. 20140524.2496690) and have been confirmed subsequently or are additional new cases. Case 1, and probably case 2, had contact with livestock. CCHF virus is transmitted to livestock via _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks, and people usually acquire infection with this virus from infected livestock. Nosocomial infections occur as well, so the barrier nursing mentioned in the hospital that attended case 2 is important.
