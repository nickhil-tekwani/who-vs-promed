[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of definite and probable
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), remain unchanged since the
previous monthly report; that is, the number of definite or probable
vCJD cases remains 164. Four definite/probable patients remain alive,
bringing the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases to 168.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, only one in 2008, and none so far in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2009
--------------------------------------
As of Mon 2 Mar 2009 in the UK so far this year [2009], there have
been 14 referrals, 3 cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial CJD,
one case of iatrogenic CJD, and no cases of GSS or vCJD.

disease, 1490 to sporadic CJD, 254 to familial CJD, 4 to iatrogenic
CJD, and 2 cases of vCJD, both contracted abroad.

In 2008, there have been 228 referrals attributed to prion disease,
182 cases of spordic CJD, 23 cases of familial CJD, and no cases of
iatrogenic CJD or vCJD. (This total includes 25 cases with type
determination pending in which the diagnosis of vCJD has been excluded).

[The proportions of the different etiologies of CJD in the USA and
the UK and France do not correspond closely. The reasons for this
remain to be established. - Mod.CP]

Title: Highly sensitive, quantitative cell-based assay for prions
adsorbed to solid surfaces By Julie Ann Edgeworth, Graham S. Jackson,
Anthony R. Clarke, Charles Weissmann, and John Collinge, At: Medical

Abstract
------
Prions comprise principally aggregates of a misfolded host protein
and cause fatal transmissible neurodegenerative disorders of humans
and animals, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. Prions pose significant public health
concerns, including contamination of blood products and surgical
instruments; they require laborious and often insensitive animal
bioassays to detect and resist conventional hospital sterilization
methods. A major experimental advance was the cell culture-based
scrapie cell assay, allowing prion titres to be estimated more
precisely and by an order of magnitude faster than by animal
bioassays. Here, we describe a bioassay method that exploits the
marked binding affinity of prions to steel surfaces. Using steel
wires as a concentrating and sensitization tool combined with an
adapted scrapie cell endpoint assay, we can achieve, for mouse
prions, a sensitivity 100 times higher than that achieved in standard
mouse bioassays. The rapidity and sensitivity of this assay offers a
major advance over small animal bioassays in many aspects of prion
research. In addition, its specific application in assay of
metal-bound prions allows evaluation of a novel prion decontamination
method.

[5] vCJD prion protein detected in spleen of plasma recipient
Date: Sun 15 Feb 2009
Source: The Daily Telegraph online [edited]
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/4624348/Scientists-warn-of-first-ever-case-of-human-mad-cow-disease-from-blood-plasma.html>


The 1st case of a person being infected with the human form of mad
cow disease after receiving contaminated blood plasma has been
identified by scientists. Scientists fear there could be a 2nd wave
of the human variant of mad cow disease, which was caused by cattle
being fed the remains of other cattle in the 1980s. Until now,
scientists had maintained that the 4000 people who may have received
plasma from infected donors were at very low risk of developing the
fatal brain disease. Warnings were issued to them as a "highly
precautionary measure."

But the Health Protection Agency is expected to announce on Tuesday
[17 Feb 2009] that an elderly man, who died from other causes,
contracted vCJD from plasma. Although vCJD has been transmitted by
blood donations in the past, leading to 3 deaths, no cases of
infection had ever been linked to plasma, which is used to clot
blood. Scientists had believed the processing and dilution of the
product before it is injected into patients significantly reduced the
risks.

BSE expert Professor Hugh Pennington, Emeritus Professor of
Bacteriology at Aberdeen University said the findings would have
"significant implications" for thousands of people who had been given
plasma before the dangers were suspected. "This looks like pretty
grim news for a group of people who have been through fire and water
for so long; they have already had increased exposure to hepatitis B
and HIV," he said.

Warnings were sent to 4000 hemophiliacs, and patients suffering from
other rare blood conditions in 2004 to warn them that they had had
received transfusions from 200 batches of blood products at risk of
contamination with vCJD. The plasma was collected from 9 people who
went on to develop the brain-wasting disease. All 4000 were advised
not to give blood or donate organs and to warn doctors and dentists
that they had been put at risk by the use of plasma.

To date, 164 people have died from vCJD in Britain, with most cases
linked to eating meat infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Prof. Pennington said details of the way the new link had been
detected would be crucial in determining further investigations.
"There is a lot more we still need to know. The fact that this person
is elderly, when most of the deaths from vCJD have been young people,
and that they died from another cause, is another area for research,"
he said, suggesting that it might mean that the disease progressed
more slowly in some people. He said restrictions over blood donation,
which means anyone who has had a transfusion cannot donate, and that
all plasma is now taken from stocks in the United States, meant the
risks to those receiving blood or plasma now were "vanishingly low."

The brain-wasting disease vCJD was 1st detected in the mid 1990s.
Most vCJD patients have been infected after eating BSE contaminated
meat. The number of deaths peaked in 2000, when there were 28 deaths.
That number has dropped to about 5 cases a year since 2005.

The epidemic of BSE in the 1980s and 1990s was caused by cattle being
fed the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal,
causing an infectious agent to spread. More than 4 million cattle
were slaughtered after almost 200 000 were infected with the fatal
neurodegenerative disease.

Scientists recently warned that Britain could see a 2nd wave of vCJD
affecting as many as 300 people after discovering that genetic
differences can affect how long it takes a person to incubate the
disease.

[6] vCJD prion protein detected in spleen of plasma recipient
Date: Tue 17 Feb 2009
Source: Health Protection Agency, Press Release [edited]
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1234859690542?p=1231252394302>


Evidence of infection with the agent (abnormal prion protein) that
causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) has been found at
post mortem in the spleen of a person with hemophilia. The patient,
who was over 70 years old, died of a condition unrelated to vCJD and
had shown no symptoms of vCJD or any other neurological condition
prior to his death. The vCJD abnormal prion protein was only
identified during post mortem research tests.

The Health Protection Agency is working with the UK Haemophilia
Centre Doctors Organisation to ensure all patients with bleeding
disorders are made aware of this preliminary information, which is
being further investigated. This new finding will not change the way
patients with hemophilia are cared for or treated.

A final view as to how vCJD abnormal prion protein was transmitted to
this hemophilia patient has yet to be reached, because investigations
are continuing to determine the most likely route of transmission. It
is known that the patient had been treated with several batches of
UK-sourced clotting factors before 1999, which is when measures to
improve the safety of blood in relation to vCJD were introduced. The
patient's treatment had included one batch of Factor VIII that was
manufactured using plasma from a donor who went on to develop
symptoms of vCJD 6 months after donating the plasma in 1996.

This is the 1st time that vCJD abnormal prion protein has been found
in a patient with hemophilia or any patient treated with plasma
products. This new finding, however, does not change the public
health vCJD "at risk" status of patients with bleeding disorders.

Hemophilia patients have previously been informed by their doctors of
their possible increased risk of exposure to vCJD via clotting
factors. In 2004, all patients with bleeding disorders who had been
treated with UK-sourced pooled plasma products between 1980 and 2001
were told that, owing to potential vCJD infectivity from these
products, they were to be classified as at-risk of vCJD for public
health purposes.

Professor Mike Catchpole, Director of the Health Protection Agency's
Centre for Infections, said: "This new finding may indicate that what
was until now a theoretical risk may be an actual risk to certain
individuals who have received blood plasma products, although the
risk could still be quite low. We recognize that this finding will be
of concern for persons with hemophilia who will be awaiting the
completion of the ongoing investigations and their interpretation.
The priority is to ensure that patients are informed of this
development and have access to the latest information and specialist
advice from their own hemophilia centre doctor as soon as possible.
This finding does not change our understanding of the risk from vCJD
for other people in any specific way. But it does reinforce the
importance of the precautionary measures that have been taken over
the years. Since the risk of vCJD transmission through blood was 1st
considered, a number of precautionary measures have been introduced
to minimize the risk from the UK blood supply. UK plasma has not been
used for the manufacture of clotting factors since 1999, and
synthetic clotting factors are provided for all patients for whom
they are suitable."

Notes:

1) The post-mortem tests were carried out as part of a research study
jointly coordinated by the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organisation
and the National CJD Surveillance Unit. The study was commissioned in
2001 and is ongoing.

2) The likelihood of a person who is infected with the vCJD abnormal
prion protein going on to develop symptoms of the disease is
uncertain and may depend on individual susceptibility. It is possible
that infected individuals may never develop symptoms.

3) Hemophilia is a genetic blood condition in which an essential
clotting factor is either partly or completely missing. This causes a
person with hemophilia to bleed for longer than normal. Treatment for
hemophilia is usually done by replacing the missing clotting factor
(factor VIII) through regular injections, which help the blood to
clot and minimize the likelihood of long term joint damage.

4) In 2004, all patients with bleeding disorders who had been treated
with UK-sourced pooled plasma products (e.g. clotting factors for
individuals with hemophilia) between 1980 and 2001 were told that,
owing to potential vCJD infectivity from these products, they would
be classified as at-risk of vCJD for public health purposes.

The start date of 1980 is thought to be the earliest date the agent
(abnormal prion protein) that causes BSE in cattle and vCJD in humans
could have entered the food chain. The end date of 2001 is the last
possible expiry date of any product manufactured by UK fractionators
that had been sourced from UK donors up until 1998.

5) The government introduced a number of measures from 1997 onwards
to safeguard blood and plasma supplies.

- Since 1997, all cases of vCJD that are reported to the National CJD
Surveillance Unit and diagnosed as having probable vCJD result in a
search of the UK Blood Services blood donor records. If the patient
has donated blood, any unused parts of that blood are immediately
removed from stock. The fate of all used components of blood from the
donor is traced and surviving recipients informed of their risk.

- In July 1998, the Department of Health announced that plasma for
the manufacture of blood products, such as clotting factors, would be
obtained from non-UK sources.

- Since October 1999, white blood cells (which may carry the greatest
risk of transmitting vCJD) have been removed from all blood used for
transfusion.

- In August 2002, the Department of Health announced that fresh
frozen plasma for treating babies and young children born after 1 Jan
1996 would be obtained from the USA, extended to all children under
16 years of age (Summer 2005).

- In December 2002, the Department of Health completed its purchase
of the largest remaining independent US plasma collector, Life
Resources Incorporated. This secures long-term supplies of non-UK
blood plasma for the benefit of NHS patients.

- Since April 2004, blood donations have not been accepted from
people who have themselves received a blood transfusion in the UK
since 1980. This has been extended to include apheresis donors and
donors who are unsure whether they had previously had a blood
transfusion (August 2004).

- Since late 2005, blood donations have not been accepted from donors
whose blood was transfused to patients who later developed vCJD.

- The UK Blood Services continue to promote the appropriate use of
blood and tissues and alternatives throughout the NHS.

[According to the following information extracted from the 16th
Annual Report 2007 Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance in the
United Kingdom
<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/report16.pd>:
"Up to 31 Dec 2007, there were 163 deaths from definite or probable
variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK. Of these, 115 were confirmed by
neuropathology. A further 3 probable cases were alive on 31 Dec 2007.
The clinical, neuropathological and epidemiological features of these
cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent with our previous
descriptions. Risk factors for the development of vCJD include age,
residence in the UK and methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the
prion protein gene; all 146 clinically affected cases of vCJD with
available genetic analysis have been methionine homozygotes.

It is important to note that although a peak has been passed, it is
possible that there will be future peaks, possibly in other genetic
groups. There is also the possibility of ongoing person to person
spread as seen with 4 instances of transfusion-association vCJD
infection to date who received blood from earlier cases. Three of
these individuals developed vCJD (one diagnosed in 2003 and 2 in
2006), whilst the 4th died from causes unrelated to vCJD, but was
found on post mortem examination to have abnormal prion protein
present in the spleen and a lymph node."

So far, no M/V heterozygote or V/V homozygote at codon 129 has
succumbed to vCJD, apart from the unresolved case of an M/V
heterozygote in a London Hospital exhibiting symptoms of vCJD (see:
Prion disease update 2008 (14): new vCJD wave imminent?
20081218.3980). It will be relevant to establish whether the
hemophilia patient (who died without symptoms of vCJD) lacked the M/M
susceptibility homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein gene
and consequently did not develop vCJD before death. - Mod.CP]

(This total includes 25 cases
with type determination pending in which the diagnosis of vCJD has
been excluded) should
