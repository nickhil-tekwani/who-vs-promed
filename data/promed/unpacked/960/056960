Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease kills 150 deer in state
---------------------------------------------------
Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) believes Epizootic
Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) caused the deaths of about 150 deer
in 8 southeastern Tennessee counties.
Ben Layton, deer biologist with TWRA's Region III office in
Crossville, said 3 deer have been sent to the Southeast Wildlife
Disease Study Unit at the University of Georgia for testing. One
has tested positive for EHD.
"A deer in Rhea County tested positive for EHD," Layton said in a
statement released by TWRA. "One from Sequatchie County tested
negative, and test results are pending on a deer found in Roane
County."
Most of the deer found were dead for several days, making testing
difficult. So far Marion, Rhea, and Sequatchie counties have
accounted for the most dead deer with 30 each. 15 carcasses
were found in Meigs County, 8 in Roane, 5 in Bledsoe, and 1 in
McMinn.
EHD, which is not always fatal, is a virus spread from deer to deer
by biting midges. The disease causes excessive hemorrhaging and
deterioration of blood vessels. While the disease can be spread via
the small biting flies, it cannot be spread directly from animal to
animal.
There are no known cases of the disease being spread to humans,
either through contact with an infected deer, eating the meat of an
infected deer, or via bites from midges.
Signs of the disease are uncontrollable salivation, loss of muscle
coordination, and lack of awareness. Deer that die of EHD are
often found near water.
