[The number of confirmed monkeypox (MPX) cases continues to increase, although more slowly, from 38 cases in 8 states on 7 Nov 2017 to 42 cases in 10 states currently. The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak is not mentioned. With no reported fatalities, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. Interestingly, some of the cases reported above negative for MPX tested positive for chickenpox, so there appears to be a mixed outbreak involving these 2 unrelated but clinically similar viruses. As noted in the previous post, this is an unusually widespread outbreak of the disease. It would be of interest to know whether there is evidence of a monkeypox outbreak in these states in rodents that are the suspected reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
