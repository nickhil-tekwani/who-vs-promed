The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus has been detected in Tambunan [Sabah], about 100 km (62 mi) from [the state capital, Kota Kinabalu], says the state agriculture and food industries minister Datuk Junz Wong on [Tue 16 Jul 2019]. He said Health Department officials in Sabah had detected the virus in a pig farm in Kampung Lubang, Tambunan on [11 Jul 2019].

On being informed, the Department of Veterinary Services started inspection at all 7 pig farms within the vicinity. "My officers are still on the ground and taking samples from the pigs in the area."

Wong's confirmation came after an internal memo from the Veterinary Department informing the department that health officials had found a [presumably human] case of JE in Tambunan.

There is no cure for JE, but vaccinations [for people] are encouraged by health officials as they provide a form of protection. JE is a type of viral brain infection that can affect both humans and animals. It can be passed on to humans by infected animals through the bite of an infected culex mosquito.

An infected person develops inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and suffers symptoms such as sudden onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, convulsions and muscle weakness, and might even fall into a coma.

Last month [June 2019], the Sarawak Health Department urged public to be cautious after confirming 5 JE cases in the state.

[JE virus is endemic in Malaysia's Borneo, including Sabah and its neighboring state, Sarawak. Pigs are susceptible to JE virus infection, develop high viremias that serve as infectious blood meals for culex vector mosquitoes. The report above does not indicate which tests were done to determine JE virus infection in the pigs, whether by virus isolation, PCR demonstration of JE virus genomic segments or development of antibodies. Pregnant sows may have transplacental infection of their fetal piglets with teratogenic effects. Piglets and very young pigs may develop encephalitis when infected by JE virus. Infected adult male pigs may develop orchitis with a loss of libido and reduced fertility. Since pigs are JE virus amplifying hosts, people in the areas where pigs are infected should be especially careful to avoid mosquito bites. Vaccination may be the best measure for avoiding JE. - Mod.TY
