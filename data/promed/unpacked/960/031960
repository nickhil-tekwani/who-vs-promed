Litchi [lychee] is an important tree fruit which grows abundantly in the northern region of the country. But this year [2016], farmers have become frustrated as an unknown disease attacked the orchards of Rajshahi district. Following the disease attack, the fruits turn black and leaves become dry. After that, the litchis fall down.

While visiting different litchi orchards at different [locations], it was found that many of the orchards have been affected by the unknown disease. As a result, the litchi growers have become worried over the possible poor yield of the fruit. Though the farmers have sprayed insecticides in the orchards, there is no improvement.

Agricultural officers advised the farmers to adopt necessary measures against the disease. A total of 395 hectares have been brought under litchi farming across the district this year [2016]. It would be very hard to achieve the target production due to the attack of the unknown disease, the DAE [Department of Agriculture Extension] said.

[Lychee (_Litchi chinensis_), longan (_Dimocarpus longan_) and rambutan (_Nephelium lappaceum_) of the family _Sapindaceae_ are important fruit and cash crops in parts of Asia.

The symptoms described above are not sufficient for identifying a likely pathogen. Reliable diagnosis is crucial for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
