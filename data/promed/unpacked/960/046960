At Michigan's Northville Downs to date, the diagnosis of active EHF-1
infection has been made in 3 horses based on deep nasal swab PCR and
on the manifestation of acute neurological signs consistent with
descriptions posted by others in this thread. All 3 animals were
euthanized by veterinarians upon the decision and request of owners.
A total of 12 contact animals remain under quarantine at an off-track
location and are, as yet, free of clinical signs of EHV infection.
These 12 were vaccinated against EHV with a commercial vaccine
product in early/mid December [2004], when the 1st 2 clinical cases
developed (Equine herpesvirus - USA (MI) 20041219.3349).
The 3rd clinical horse, a herd/stable mate of the quarantined 12, was
not available for vaccination at that time and subsequently "fell
through the cracks" and did not receive this treatment. She began to
display hind quarter instability and weakness on 12 Jan 2005, which
progressed through 14 Jan 2005 when she was killed. All 13 had been
vaccinated during the previous spring.
