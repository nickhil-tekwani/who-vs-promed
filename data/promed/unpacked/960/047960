The police are to investigate the cause of an outbreak of African swine fever in the Zlin region, the 1st ever recorded in the Czech Republic, Czech Television reported on [Tue 18 Jul 2017].

The local branch of the State Veterinary Administration has filed a criminal complaint against an unknown perpetrator over the spreading of the disease. On [Mon 17 Jul 2017] the minister of agriculture, Marian Jurecka, said it was likely there had been human involvement in the outbreak. More than 50 wild boars in the Zlin region have been identified as having African swine fever and hunters are being encouraged to shoot all wild boars around the country.

[On 18 Jul 2017 the Czech Republic submitted OIE follow-up report no 4 on the described event in wild boars, with details of the 25 added new cases, bringing the total to 50; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=24329.

The event has caused grave concern within the EU, presenting a striking westward bounce of the ASF virus into central Europe, namely the Czech Republic's south-eastern border. The new focus is situated western to the Slovak border. There is a distance of 400-500 km [approx. 250 to 310 mi] between the new focus and the closest infected areas, located In Ukraine's south-west and Poland's north east (see OIE interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/ycsevynz; click on the brown triangles in SE Czech Rep, presenting wild boar, and zoom in).

In view of the distance from affected areas, introduction by the movement of wild boars could be ruled out; the virus should have been introduced by human activities. Their nature is under investigations, described in the 2 following richly illustrated presentations addressing the ASF event in the Czech Republic:
