The Asahikawa City Public Health Center in Hokkaido announced on 23 Sep 2022 a resident of the city died of food poisoning after eating a poisonous herb, dog saffron [also known as autumn crocus - Mod.TG]. The plant is believed to have grown in his garden.

According to the health center, the resident ate some dog saffron around [17 Sep 2022], developed vomiting and diarrhea, and died the following day. There were marks in the garden as if the plant had been pulled out.

Inusafuran [Japanese for autumn crocus https://rxharun.com/autumn-crocus-wild-saffron-meadow-saffron-naked-boy-naked-lady/#gsc.tab=0] resembles garlic and onion in bulb shape and a leaf shape similar to that of garlic, and food poisoning has been common. The public health center urges people not to eat plants that cannot be reliably determined to be edible.

["Common name: autumn crocus, meadow saffron
Botanic name: _Colchicum autumnale_
Plant family: Colchicaceae
Habitat: garden or indoor potted plant
Distribution: introduced [to the US] from the Mediterranean area and Asia [which is its natural habitat. - Mod.TG]
Animals affected : all animals, including humans, are susceptible to poisoning
Autumn crocus (_Colchicum autumnale_)

"Toxic principle:
All parts of autumn crocuses are poisonous, the greatest concentrations of toxic alkaloids occurring in the flowers and seeds. The corm is also toxic, containing 0.05% alkaloids, in contrast to 0.2% in the seeds. However, the corms are large enough to contain toxic doses of the alkaloids. The primary toxic alkaloid is colchicine, which interferes with cell mitosis. Colchicine and its related alkaloids interfere with microtubular-dependent cell functions by binding to tubulin protein, thus blocking mitosis in multiple tissues (1). All animals [including human beings - Mod.TG] are susceptible to the toxic effects of colchicine. Multiple organ failure is characteristic of acute colchicine poisoning. Colchicine also causes marked decreases in prolactin, insulin, glucose tolerance, and catecholamine production. An estimated lethal dose of colchicine is 0.8 mg per kilogram body weight. Another plant also known to contain colchicine and similar alkaloids is the glory lilly (_Gloriosa superba_), which contains up to 0.36% colchicine in its tubers.

"Description:
Comprising the genus of some 60 species originating in Europe and North America and West and Central Asia. Many species originate from the Mediterranean area around Turkey and the Balkans. Arising from corms, almost all species produce flowers before they produce leaves. The leaves are basal, long, linear blades. Flowers are produced singularly or clusters atop long tubes and are generally purple, pink, or white in color. In contrast to _Crocus_ species, which have 3 stamens, _Colchicum_ flowers each have 6 stamens and 3 pistils. Many species tend to flower in the fall, but others may flower in the spring (Figures 1,2).

"Gastrointestinal: severe salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain and severe hemorrhagic diarrhea.
Musculoskeletal: weakness and collapse
Congenital defects: cleft palate
Treatment: Maintain kidney function with intravenous fluid therapy and other supportive therapy as necessary.
Cardiovascular system: cardiotoxic
Nervous system : seizures
Renal system: kidney failure
Reproductive system: cleft palate in the fetus
Hepatic system: liver failure
Diagnosis: Colchicine can be detected in the serum and urine.

"Special notes:
The best-known species of the genus is _Colchicum automnale_, called autumn crocus, as it is an autumn flowering species. This should not be mistaken for _Crocus sativus_, a member of the Iridaceae family, which also flowers in the autumn. The stamens of _Crocus sativus_ flowers are the source of saffron, an expensive food coloring and spice. Animals or people who are known to have eaten any part of the bulb, flowers, or seeds of the autumn crocus should be seen by a veterinarian or physician, as appropriate, as quickly as possible."

[The term "autumn crocus" is used both for species in the _Colchicum_ genus, as well as for _Crocus sativus_. However, the two should not be confused: _Colchicum_ are not true crocuses; they belong to the family Colchicaceae and produce colchicine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicum). Colchicine poisoning is caused by species in the _Colchicum_ genus, not _Crocus sativus_, _Crocus sativus_ is in the iris family Iridaceae. The spice saffron comes from filaments that grow inside the flower of _Crocus sativus_, which is also known as saffron crocus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocus_sativus). - Mod.ML
