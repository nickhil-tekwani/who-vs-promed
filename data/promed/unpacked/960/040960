LEGIONELLOSIS - AUSTRALIA: (WESTERN AUSTRALIA) ex INDONESIA (BALI) ALERT

Two middle-aged people in Perth, Western Australia, have recently
been diagnosed with severe pneumonia caused by _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (laboratory confirmed). Both cases had
independently holidayed in Bali, Indonesia at the same time
(overlapping between 29 Jul and 8 Aug 2010), and both stayed at the
same hotel in Kuta, Bali.

Onset dates were 10 Aug and 14 Aug 2010, after their return to
Australia. It seems most probable that they were infected in Bali,
quite possibly at their hotel. Information provided by people who
travelled with the cases has not identified places that both
frequented other than the hotel and airports. Both swam in the hotel
pool and one is thought to have used a jacuzzi or similar.

Please consider the diagnosis of legionellosis in people with
consistent illnesses recently returned from Bali. If you do detect
cases I would be interested to hear of this, and could provide the
name of the implicated hotel. Indonesian health authorities are being advised.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of
the disease; about 70 percent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis
that is less severe than Legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes
its name from an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA. Risk
factors for Legionnaires' disease include age over 50 years,
cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and
immunosuppression.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually
a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, and cooling towers.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful
tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one
genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common
source. Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies
without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative
infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping
methods (see <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).
