[1] Cargill outbreak

In Wisconsin 5 cases of _Escherichia coli_ [O157]-related illness are being
investigated and one has been confirmed as identical to the strain that
sickened consumers in Minnesota, launching Cargill Meat Solutions' ground
beef recall over the weekend [6-7 Oct 2007].
Three of the cases were reported in Milwaukee County and 2 in south eastern
Wisconsin, Milwaukee Health Commission Communications Manager Raquel
Filmanowicz told Meatingplace.com. The confirmed case was in Milwaukee
County. "We were made aware of these cases through our communicable
diseases area and started making the connections," Filmanowicz said, adding
that test results are expected in the next day or so on the 4 unconfirmed
cases.
Cargill Meat Solutions has recalled about 845 000 pounds (381 tonnes) of
ground beef produced at its Butler, Wisconsin, location and distributed
nationwide.

[2] Topps outbreak

Several state health departments, CDC, and the United States Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are
investigating a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. On 29
Sep 2007, USDA issued a notice about a recall of 21.7 million pounds (9843
tonnes) of frozen ground beef patties.
Health officials in several states who were investigating reports of _E.
coli_ O157 illnesses found that many ill persons had consumed the same
brand of frozen ground beef patties. Ground beef patties recovered from
patients' homes were tested by state public health department and federal
laboratories. Tests conducted by the New York State Wadsworth Center
Laboratory and by a USDA-FSIS laboratory on opened and unopened packages of
Topps brand frozen ground beef patties yielded _E. coli_ O157 isolates with
several different "DNA fingerprint" patterns.
Investigators compared the "DNA fingerprints" patterns of _E. coli_ O157
strains found in ground beef with "DNA fingerprints" patterns of _E. coli_
O157 strains isolated from ill persons. As of 12 pm (ET) 9 Oct 2007, 35
cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection have been identified with PFGE (pulsed
field gel electrophoresis) patterns that match at least one of the patterns
of _E. coli_ strains found in Topps brand frozen ground beef patties. Ill
persons reside in 8 states [Connecticut (2), Florida (1), Indiana (1),
Maine (1), New Jersey (8), New York (11), Ohio (1), and Pennsylvania (10)].
21 (91 per cent) of 24 patients with a detailed food history consumed
ground beef. 3 illnesses have confirmed associations with recalled products
because the strain isolated from the person was also isolated from the meat
in their home. The 1st reported illness began on 5 Jul 2007, and the last
began on 23 Sep 2007.
Among 24 ill persons for whom hospitalization status is known, 15 (63 per
cent) were hospitalized. One patient developed a type of kidney failure
called hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). No deaths have been reported. 15
(45 per cent) patients are female. The ages of patients range from one to
77 years; 52 per cent are between 15 and 24 years old (only 14 per cent of
the US population is in this age group).
