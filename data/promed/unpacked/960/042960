[The following message to answers the earlier ProMED request for
information about this Lassa fever outbreak (archive No.
20060929.2783). - Mod.TY]
The Lassa fever outbreak in Nimba appears to have begun in late May
[2006]. The index case was from Louplay, and about half the cases
appear to be linked epidemiologically to this case from 28 May
[2006]. The last reported case was 3 Sep [2006]. There are 20
suspected/confirmed cases. Ganta Hospital had 4 suspected cases. As
noted in the IRIN report, of the 10 confirmed cases, there were 7
deaths (all females). The cases come from 3 districts, widely
separated, in Nimba County.
A detailed map of Nimba County can be found at the Humanitarian
Information Center website:

[ProMED is grateful to Dr. Nisbett for providing this information so
soon after the request for information was posted. The fatality rate
in this report (7 deaths of 10 cases) is extremely high, the usual
case fatality for hospitalized Lassa fever cases being 1-15
percent. One wonders if all these females were pregnant (with higher
case fatality rates), if many more Lassa virus-infected individuals
were hospitalized but not diagnosed or not reported, or if many more
infected individuals did not seek medical attention. - Mod.TY]
