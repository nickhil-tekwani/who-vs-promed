[1] Ontario ex USA (NY): raccoon research

Scientists say they now have evidence suggesting a rabid raccoon hitchhiked more than 500 km [about 311 mi] into Ontario from southeastern New York state [USA] to ignite Ontario's 1st rabies outbreak in a decade.

Susan Nadin-Davis, a researcher with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] who focuses on rabies research, said she was surprised at the result and had to run tests again to make sure it wasn't a mistake. "I went back and re-analyzed the sample in order to confirm there hadn't been a mix-up or cross-contamination," Nadin-Davis said. "The results seem to hold true. It was quite a surprise."

A fight between 2 Hamilton [Ontario] dogs and an aggressive raccoon in the back of an animal control van in December [2015] led to the discovery of the 1st documented case of rabies in a raccoon in the province since 2005.

The outbreak has ballooned to 128 cases of raccoon strain rabies in both the masked creatures and skunks, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, which is charged with managing the outbreak.

Nadin-Davis says her laboratory in Ottawa [Ontario] has genetically analyzed the rabies strain with a new technique and compared the results to a database she has been building for the past several years that helps pinpoint where variants of the virus originate.

She said the virus is closely related to a strain from southeastern New York state, and quite distinct from the strains found closer to the border.

Chris Davies, the ministry's head of wildlife research, praised Nadin-Davis's work. "If we understand how rabies spreads, then we can identify tactics to prevent and reduce the chance of this happening again," Davies said. "If you don't know where it's coming from, how would you ever be able to do that?"

Nadin-Davis had expected the virus had come from "an incursion" from western New York state, where there are active rabies cases in raccoons, and was surprised it came from further afield.

But even with the presence of rabid raccoons closer to the Canadian border, they still would have faced a daunting task to bring the virus into Canada. Ontario has long had a nearly invisible barrier draped across its southern border that is designed to keep rabid raccoons away from their healthy Canadian brethren.

That barrier consists of thousands of edible rabies vaccine baits that have proven incredibly effective.

The CFIA's research has further galvanized the ministry's belief that its rabies vaccine, ONRAB, continues to work along the border.

"We don't know what it came on, but it was either a truck or a train," Davies said.

The ministry continues to carpet bomb a wide swath of southwestern Ontario with the vaccine, having dropped 600 000 baits since early April [2016], Davies said. They'll do it all again in the fall [2016], where they hope to vaccinate young raccoons because the vaccine won't work until they reach 16 weeks old.

Nadin-Davis said she will use her research techniques to look into the role skunks are playing in the outbreak, which represent about 30 per cent of the cases that have tested positive for the virus.

[2] Alberta: bat, human exposure
Date: Tue 14 Jun 2016 5:26 PM MT

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/airdrie-rabid-bat-bite-1.3635343


A bat confirmed to have rabies bit a person in [Airdrie], southern Alberta, but health officials say they are not "treating" a human with the deadly viral disease.

The bat was taken to the Heartland Veterinary Clinic on 4 Jun 2016, where it was immediately euthanized and sent for rabies testing, said clinic owner and veterinarian Dr Gheorghe Rotaru.

"The only test that can be done for rabies is by testing the brain," Rotaru explained.

"As far as we know, the person that was bit was seeking medical attention and hopefully everything is fine." [This person should be receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There is a time limit after a bite to receive PEP. - Mod.TG]

He said the bat was sent to Lethbridge [Alberta] for analysis where it tested positive for rabies.

Rotaru said that, if left untreated, rabies is virtually a death sentence for humans and animals. "For pets, domestic animals even wild animals and humans, it is 100 per cent lethal. It is as serious as it can be. A pet that is not protected with vaccination, if it is exposed to rabies, if it is not treated, more or less it is 100 per cent guarantee it will die," Rotaru said.

"The same with humans."

Dr Judy MacDonald, a medical health officer with Alberta Health Services, confirmed the case but said no human is being "treated" for rabies in the province. "It was the 1st [case of human rabies exposure] this year [2016] that we are aware of," MacDonald said, noting there were 4 [human exposures] last year [2015] in Alberta.

"If you have a pet, make sure they are immunized against rabies," MacDonald explained.

"If you are out and about, avoid contact with wild animals, not approaching them, not touching them. For domestic animals that you don't know, you should not be coming up to them and petting them. Avoiding bites is the most important thing."

Without treatment, Rotaru said the viral disease works its way through the central nervous system to the brain, which can take days, depending on where the bite occurred on the body. Humans who contract the virus and do not receive treatment can experience extreme symptoms, including nervousness, aggression, and even throat spasms, he said. "It is quite devastating."

Rotaru said bats are the most common carriers of rabies, but others include skunks, raccoons and, in rare cases, rats and rodents. Rotaru said, while not mandatory, vaccinations are critical, and treatment after a bite should be immediate.

[Please note, while similar, this article is different from the previous article and thus complicates the picture of whether or not the person is receiving treatment after the bite of the rabid bat. - Mod.TG]

Alberta Health Services has received reports a bat confirmed to have rabies bit a person in southern Alberta.

In a Facebook post, Heartland Veterinary Clinic said Airdrie Bylaw handed over a bat that officers said flew inside a person's car and bit an individual. The bat was sent to Lethbridge [Alberta] to be tested for rabies -- and the results came back positive.

Alberta Health Services suggests anyone who is bitten or scratched by a bat report the exposure so that preventative measures can be taken. The person bitten in Airdrie did not become infected. [Certainly, if the person were bitten we hope post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was administered. This article is unclear if the person is receiving PEP, or if they have not come in to receive the PEP. - Mod.TG]

Dr Judy MacDonald, a medical officer of health with the province, said the last human case of rabies in Alberta was in 2007. That person was bitten and then failed to receive medical attention. [Yet it is unclear if the individual here has sought treatment or not. - Mod.TG]

"It can take a long time from a bite to the time symptoms appear," MacDonald said. "It could be months later when symptoms occur, so it is important to receive post exposure prophylaxis right away to prevent symptoms and prevent the disease." "It's almost universally fatal at that point, unfortunately. Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. The disease is rare and preventable with vaccines."

MacDonald said thousands of animals in Alberta are tested for rabies every year. Last year [2015], 4 Alberta bats tested positive for rabies.

"In Calgary, for instance, last year [2015] we investigated and followed up on over 1300 reports of animal exposure. So it's kind of a daily occurrence for us," she said.

MacDonald believes this is the 1st case of human rabies exposure in 2016.

A Kalamazoo County [Michigan] resident exposed to a bat is receiving treatment for rabies after the bat tested positive for the disease.

Kalamazoo County lab-confirmed a rabies positive bat as of [Fri 17 Jun 2016], the 1st rabies positive bat found in the county since 2013, according to a news release from the Kalamazoo County Health and Community Services Department.

Courtney Davis, public information officer for the county health department's disease surveillance division, said a big brown bat found in a home was submitted to the county's animal services on 14 Jun 2016; there was concern that a person may have been bitten.

Health privacy rules prohibit the county from releasing the age or gender of that person, or the location of the incident, Davis said. The patient is expected to be fine, Davis said.

Bats are the most common carrier of rabies in Michigan but only a very small percentage of the bat population are carriers of the disease, according to the department's news release. In 2014, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Laboratories tested 3078 animal specimens. Of these, only 41 samples were positive for rabies, including 38 bats and 3 skunks.

Although rabies is a fatal virus found in the saliva of infected animals, fewer than 10 people die annually in the United States because of the availability of anti-rabies treatment and the careful evaluation of potential exposures by local health departments.

Rabies is usually transmitted by bite or scratch. Death from the disease is most frequently a result of individuals being unaware of their exposure, or from failure to seek medical attention after being bitten and/or scratched. Most human rabies deaths in the United States are attributed to bats.

If a bat is found inside the home, the Kalamazoo County Health Department recommends safely collecting the bat through the following means:
- wear leather gloves;
- place a coffee can or box over the bat;
- using a piece of sturdy cardboard, slide it under the can or box;
- tape the cardboard firmly to the container to secure the bat inside;
- a dead bat should be submitted for rabies testing as long as its skull is intact. Do not crush the bat or put the bat in the freezer;
- contact Disease Surveillance at the Kalamazoo County Health Department.

Bats are more active this time of year. They are retiring and are not active in the daytime. While rabies can only be confirmed by laboratory testing, any bat seen in the daytime or that is unable to fly is more likely to be rabid. A bat should never be touched or handled.

Most people know when they've been bitten. However, there are circumstances when exposure occurs without obvious evidence. Bats have small teeth and tiny claws. Bites or scratches can escape detection.

A sleeping person awakening to a bat in the room is considered exposed. It is also considered an exposure when a bat is found in a room with an unattended child, or a mentally impaired or intoxicated person. Under such circumstances, it is very important to capture the bat for testing.

If a pet has been exposed, it is still important to capture the bat and submit it for testing. If this can't be done, follow up is required with a veterinarian or Disease Surveillance.

All cats and dogs must have current rabies vaccinations.

[5] New York: skunk, raccoon
Date: Tue 28 Jun 2016 9:07 AM EDT
Source: WWNYTV.com [edited]
http://www.wwnytv.com/news/local/Skunk--Raccoon-Test-Positive-For-Rabies-384675931.html


Two animals killed in Jefferson County [New York] last week [week of 20 Jun 2016] -- a skunk and a raccoon -- have tested positive for rabies.

Public health officials say the raccoon was killed by a homeowner on Cornell Road in Henderson Harbor and the skunk was killed by military police on Fort Drum.

Neither case involved exposure to humans or pets. These 2 make 20 cases of rabies in the county since December 2015.

Health officials offer this advice:
1. Teach children to stay away from unfamiliar animals, either wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. Remind them to tell you if they have any unusual contact with an animal.
2. Do not leave pet food outside as it attracts wildlife.
3. Wash any wound from an animal encounter thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately.
4. Be a responsible pet owner by keeping your pets' vaccinations current. Getting your pet vaccinated by your vet or at a clinic can help stop the spread of rabies from wild animals to humans. The next clinic will be at the Adams Village Barn from 6 to 8 PM on [9 Aug 2016].
5. Monitor pets when they are outside. If your pet is involved in an altercation with a wild animal, do not get in between them. Do not touch your pet without gloves as rabies is spread through saliva. Cover your pet with a towel and contact your vet as your pet might need a booster shot.

Rabies is a fatal disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. It can take several weeks to several months for rabies symptoms to appear.

Early treatment after an exposure can prevent rabies in humans and in pets who are up to date on vaccination. Any mammal can get rabies, but it is most often seen in bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.

Animals with rabies may be aggressive, sick or unusually friendly.

[6] New York: fox suspected, human exposure
Date: Tue 14 Jun 2016
Source: Eagle News Online [edited]
http://www.eaglenewsonline.com/news/2016/06/14/rabid-fox-attacks-two-people-on-east-lake-road


An apparently rabid fox attacked 2 people on East Lake Road in Cazenovia [Madison County, New York] Tuesday afternoon [14 Jun 2016], after which the animal was killed and disposed of. Neither of the people were bitten or injured, although both the truck, driven by one individual and the riding lawnmower operated by the other person were damaged from the fox's attacks.

Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It is transmitted from infected mammals to humans and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.

The woman was mowing her lawn [Tue 14 Jun 2016] at around noon when her friend came over to deliver bales of hay. On his way out of her driveway, he stopped his truck to look out his window at something in the grass. Smith, wearing flip flops, drove her riding mower over to see what her friend was observing when she saw it was a fox.

The animal then attacked the truck, biting into the tires and even into the body; then it turned and attacked the lawn mower tires and wheel cover, the woman said. Her friend threw a rock at the fox, it retreated and the friend went to get his gun. The fox then came back and charged at the woman's friend, who kicked it and stunned it. The fox ran away again, then came back a 3rd time, when the woman's friend shot and killed it.

The woman eventually talked to someone at the Madison County Department of Health [MCDH], who told her how to dispose of the dead fox properly, which is to either bury it deep enough in the ground where no other animals will dig it up, or, if the animal is small enough, double bag it and put it in the trash. Never touch the dead animal with bare hands and wash your hands thoroughly after handling, according to the MCDH.

The fox that attacked the woman and her friend was not tested by the county health department for rabies. [While the behavior sounds like rabies it would have been appropriate to test the brain. - Mod.TG]

This is the 2nd reported rabies incident in the Cazenovia area within 1 week. During the week of 6 Jun 2016, a fox tested positive for rabies in Erieville [Madison County] and 2 people were potentially exposed. The animal was destroyed and the people were given post-exposure prophylactic treatment, said Aaron Lazzara, assistant director of environmental health at the Madison County Department of Health.

Rabies treatments include 4 vaccinations shots within a 14-day period. "Rabies is endemic in New York state, so it's here," Lazzara said. "If you're careful, [exposure] shouldn't be an issue."

According to MCDH information posted online, in wild animals, rabies is most often seen in raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. People can get rabies if they are exposed to the saliva or nervous tissue of a rabid animal through a bite or scratch.

"Seeing a fox in the middle of the day in your yard is not normal; they don't like to be around people," Lazzara said. He said if a wild animal is acting oddly the best thing to do is to get your family members and your pets inside, call your neighbors to warn them about it and call the department of health.

Once rabies signs are apparent in an animal, the animal usually will die in 3 to 5 days, Lazzara said.

"We always stress that bats are a big issue," Lazzara said. "'Catch the bat' is our motto." Most of the post-rabies exposure treatments that occur in Madison County are due to potential exposure to rabies from bats, he said. This is because bats have such small teeth that people cannot really tell if they have been bitten if they find a bat in their house or bedroom. "Don't let it go; catch it and we can at least then test it to check for rabies," he said.

Family pets have a higher risk of coming into contact with wild animals that may have rabies than humans do, and when rabies from wild animals "spills over" into domestic animals, the risk to people is increased because of their close contact with pets.

According to MCDH, all cats, dogs and ferrets should be vaccinated against rabies starting at 3 months of age and again 1 year later. Pet vaccination is important because vaccinated pets act as a barrier between wild animals and people to keep the rabies virus from spreading.

http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/fox_raccoon_test_positive_for_rabies_in_onondaga_county_health_department_says.html


A fox and raccoon tested positive for rabies in Onondaga County [New York], according to the Onondaga County Health Department.

The fox was found in the town of Clay and the raccoon was found in the city of Syracuse.

As a result of these 2 cases, 3 residents and 1 pet were exposed to rabies; however, there are no human cases of rabies in Onondaga County.

So far in 2016, 6 animals have tested positive for rabies in Onondaga County. The animals include 3 raccoons, 1 bat, 1 skunk, and 1 fox. The tests were confirmed by the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Laboratories.

Onondaga County Health Commissioner Indu Gupta reminds the public to be safe.

To reduce the risk of rabies in animals and humans, the health department offered the following precautions:
- make sure that dogs, cats and pet ferrets have current rabies vaccines. The rabies vaccination is the most effective way of protecting pets and humans from rabies;
- do not feed pets outdoors;
- never try to feed a wild animal;
- do not approach or touch unfamiliar animals;
- avoid any animal with symptoms of rabies;
- block any openings into the home that an animal may get through;
- keep tamper-proof lids on outside garbage cans so animals are not attracted to your property;
- teach children basic rules about protecting themselves from strange and unfamiliar animals.

After a rabid fox attacked a Canal Street resident and several domestic animals last week [week of 16 May 2016], Cattaraugus County [New York] Health Department officials are asking [Olean] area residents to be alert for signs of rabies in other wild or domestic animals. [The article is unclear if domestic animals may include some farm animals, exotic animals, or only pets. - Mod.TG]

The health department issued a press release [Tue 24 May 2016] regarding the 18 May 2016 incident off Route 16 in the town of Olean, just north of the city. The individual is receiving post-exposure rabies vaccine from the health department.

"Laboratory testing by the New York Department of Health confirmed that the animal was infected with the rabies virus," the press release stated.

"We are asking persons living in the neighborhood to be aware of any unusual behavior in animals, both domestic and wild."

According to the state health department, the rabies virus is known to be endemic in this area and is common among bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, opossums, and coyotes. Exposure to the virus can be deadly to mammals, including cats, dogs, and humans.

The release noted that characteristics of a rabid animal include "unusually aggressive or passive behavior, neurological symptoms like partial paralysis or seizures and excessive salivation. The virus is transmitted via the saliva of a rabid animal primarily through an animal bite or scratch, and requires immediate medical care."

Residents who believe they or their pets have had contact with a rabid animal were encouraged to contact the county health department immediately,.

Earlier this week [week of 13 May 2016], the Lawrence Township [Mercer County, New Jersey] Health Department was notified of a fox in the area of Baker Basin Road and Basin Road. The fox was in contact with neighborhood pets and was tested for rabies by the New Jersey State Health Department Laboratory. The results were positive.

Because rabies has been identified in the area, officials are asking residents to make sure their pets' rabies vaccinations are current.

If anyone was in contact with the fox or if a pet was in contact with the fox, it is important to alert local health officials. Contact the Lawrence Township Health Department if you are aware of anyone in contact with the fox over the last 14 days.

A kitten adopted from an animal shelter in Camden County [New Jersey] tested positive for rabies even though it had been vaccinated.

County health officials say a couple adopted the kitten from the Animal Welfare Association in Voorhees [Camden County] on 5 Jun 2016. It had been vaccinated on 28 May 2016.

They took the kitten to a veterinarian when it exhibited aggressive behavior 4 days later. The kitten bit both owners at the vet's.

The kitten was euthanized and tested positive for rabies.

Officials tell The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill (http://on.cpsj.com/25ZTJsD) the owners will receive treatment and officials are trying to determine if any other people or animals at the shelter were exposed to the rabid kitten.

[Although this article is similar to the previous article, there are some important differences. - Mod.TG]

The Animal Welfare Association (AWA) in Voorhees [Camden County, New Jersey] says there is no risk of other animals being infected with rabies after a kitten with the virus was adopted last week [week of 6 Jun 2016].

AWA Executive Director Maya Richmond said [Thu 16 Jun 2016] that only the kitten's 2 litter-mates, who were also adopted, were ever in direct contact with the infected kitten. Those kittens have since been returned to the AWA and euthanized so that they could be tested for rabies, though they'd been showing no signs of the virus.

Rabies can only be transmitted through saliva and via a bite, scratch or contact with an open wound. Recently adopted animals and animals currently at the shelter would not be at risk, Richmond said.

"I would not worry about other animals at AWA because they haven't been exposed (to this kitten)," said AWA Executive Director Maya Richmond.

Because the kitten was not around other animals at the shelter, it is likely that it contracted rabies before reaching the facility, Richmond said.

The county health department announced [Wed 15 Jun 2016] that a kitten adopted from the AWA acted aggressively and exhibited neurological problems starting on 9 Jun 2016. During a veterinarian examination, the cat bit both owners. It was euthanized and tested positive for rabies.

The AWA keeps a log of any bites or scratches that occur while visitors, staff members, or volunteers are in contact with the animals. Richmond said there were no reports of bites or scratches associated with the infected kitten during its time at the AWA.

Because no such reports exist, no one who visited the AWA in recent weeks should be worried about having contracted the virus.

"During that time were you bitten or significantly scratched?" Richmond said. "Most everybody says 'no,' well, then, you're not at risk."

On 28 May 2016, the infected kitten was brought to the shelter and received a set of shots, which did not include a rabies vaccination, contrary to a previous report from the county health department. The kitten was adopted on 5 Jun 2016, according to officials.

Richmond said there is always a risk with young animals because they can be adopted once they're 8 weeks and older, but the rabies vaccination is not administered until 3 to 4 months of age due to heath department regulations.

"This means that young puppies and kittens under the age of 12 to 16 weeks adopted, purchased, or found, are not vaccinated for rabies or fully immunized until one month after receiving the vaccination," reads a statement on the AWA's website regarding the incident.

Anyone who visited the cat section of the Animal Welfare Association (AWA) shelter in Voorhees [Camden County, new Jersey] between 28 May and 5 Jun 2016, and was bitten by a short-hair, brown and white tabby kitten should contact the Camden County Department of Health and Human Services about possible exposure to rabies.

A kitten who has tested positive for rabies was adopted from the shelter by a Cherry Hill couple on [5 Jun 2016].

The kitten was one of 3 kittens rescued from an area around the Dupont Chemours Plant in Deepwater, New Jersey and taken to the AWA Shelter in Voorhees, officials said on [Thu 16 Jun 2016]. The kittens appeared to be healthy and received their core vaccinations on 28 May 2016. The kittens were too young to receive a rabies vaccination.

"Although rabies is a serious illness, it can be prevented by early treatment," Camden County Freeholder Carmen Rodriguez, liaison to the Camden County Health Department, said. "If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal that could have rabies it is important that you seek immediate medical attention."

For more information, contact the Camden County Department of Health and Human Services.

One person is being treated for potential exposure to rabies in Fairfield County [South Carolina].

According to Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), the victim was exposed to the disease after the person was bitten by a fox 6 Jun 2016. The fox tested positive for rabies 7 Jun 2016.

"Rabies is a deadly disease, to reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild," said Sandra Craig with DHEC.

The fox is the 2nd animal to test positive for rabies in Fairfield County this year. To date, there have been 49 confirmed cases of rabies in South Carolina in 2016.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) has confirmed 3 people have been referred to their doctors after potentially being exposed to rabies near the City of Barnwell by a fox that tested positive for the disease.

All 3 people were possibly exposed by the fox on 12 Jun 2016, when the fox appeared on their property acting aggressively, DHEC said.

The people were either bitten and/or scratched by the fox. The fox was submitted to DHEC's lab for testing on 13 Jun 2016 and confirmed to have rabies on 14 Jun 2016.

Additionally, DHEC said a dog was also possibly exposed to rabies by the fox. The dog is currently on its rabies vaccination and is required to undergo a 45-day quarantine.

The fox from Barnwell County is the 1st animal from that county to test positive for rabies this year [2016], according to DHEC.

There have been 51 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year [2016], with 130 confirmed cases of animal rabies in South Carolina in 2015. Just 1 case from 2015 was from Barnwell County.

[Anyone bitten or scratched by animal believed to be rabid should seek immediate medical attention including accessing the need for post exposure prophylaxis with their physician.

All pets, dogs, cats, horse, cattle, goats, and sheep should be vaccinated against rabies.

Municipalities or counties having rabies in the area need to be encouraging the veterinarians to have a rabies drive and get all pets vaccinated. Vaccinated pets are a barrier between you and the disease. - Mod.TG]
