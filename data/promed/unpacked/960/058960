Whooping cough cases in McHenry County, Illinois, are showing no signs
of slowing down after 31 students at 6 different schools have now been
diagnosed with the contagious bacterial infection.

28 of those afflicted with the illness, also known as pertussis, come
from northwest suburban Cary. The majority of confirmed cases, 24, are
at Cary-Grove High School.

Health officials here are dealing with an outbreak of whooping cough.
Douglas County, Kansas, officials have recorded a half-dozen cases of
the illness in Lawrence during the past month. 4 of the cases involved
children who had not been vaccinated for whooping cough, also known as
pertussis.

The bacterial illness is contagious and spreads by coughing or
sneezing in close contact with others. A pertussis outbreak in March
[2011] affected 7 Lawrence children, most of them unvaccinated.

The number of whooping cough (pertussis) cases in Long Island's
Suffolk County has tripled in 2011. There have been 179 reported cases
in 2011 as compared to 2010's 54.

The disease is contagious. It is known for uncontrollable, violent
coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many
coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which
result in a "whooping" sound.

Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be
fatal. The Suffolk County Health Department says that since 2011 is
not over, the number of whooping cough cases is expected to rise
further.

[4] Newest CDC recommendations
Date: Fri 21 Oct 2011
Source: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2011;60: 1424-1426 [edited]

Compared with older children and adults, infants aged less than 12
months have substantially higher rates of pertussis and the largest
burden of pertussis-related deaths. Since 2004, a mean of 3055 infant
pertussis cases with more than 19 deaths has been reported each year
through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (CDC,
unpublished data, 2011). The majority of pertussis cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths occur in infants aged 2 months or
younger, who are too young to be vaccinated; therefore, other
strategies are required for prevention of pertussis in this age
group.

Since 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
has recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and
acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccines to unvaccinated postpartum
mothers and other family members of newborn infants to protect infants
from pertussis, a strategy referred to as cocooning (1). Over the past
5 years, cocooning programs have proven difficult to implement widely
(2,3). Cocooning programs might achieve moderate vaccination coverage
among postpartum mothers but have had limited success in vaccinating
fathers or other family members. On 22 Jun 2011, ACIP made
recommendations for use of Tdap in unvaccinated pregnant women and
updated recommendations on cocooning and special situations. This
report summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and
provides guidance for implementing its recommendations.

ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 through 18
years who have completed the recommended childhood diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids and pertussis/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and
acellular pertussis (DTP/DTaP) vaccination series and for adults aged
19 through 64 years who have not previously received Tdap (1,4). ACIP
also recommends that adults aged 65 years and older receive a single
dose of Tdap if they have or anticipate having close contact with an
infant aged <12 months and previously have not received Tdap (5). 2
Tdap vaccines are available in the United States. Adacel (Sanofi
Pasteur) is licensed for use in persons aged 11 through 64 years.
Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) is licensed for use in persons
aged 10 years or older (6).

The ACIP Pertussis Vaccines Work Group reviewed unpublished Tdap
safety data from pregnancy registries and the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) and published studies on use of Tdap in
pregnant women. The Work Group also considered the epidemiology of
pertussis in infants and provider and program feedback, and then
presented policy options for consideration to ACIP. These updated
recommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women are consistent with
the goal of reducing the burden of pertussis in infants.

Safety of Tdap in Pregnant Women
--------------------------------
In prelicensure evaluations, the safety of administering a booster
dose of Tdap to pregnant women was not studied. Because information on
use of Tdap in pregnant women was lacking, both manufacturers of Tdap
established pregnancy registries to collect information and pregnancy
outcomes from pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap. Data on the safety
of administering Tdap to pregnant women are now available. ACIP
reviewed published and unpublished data from VAERS, Sanofi Pasteur
(Adacel) and GlaxoSmithKline (Boostrix) pregnancy registries, and
small studies (7,8). ACIP concluded that available data from these
studies did not suggest any elevated frequency or unusual patterns of
adverse events in pregnant women who received Tdap and that the few
serious adverse events reported were unlikely to have been caused by
the vaccine. Both tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and tetanus
toxoid vaccines have been used extensively in pregnant women worldwide
to prevent neonatal tetanus. Tetanus- and diphtheria-toxoid containing
vaccines administered during pregnancy have not been shown to be
teratogenic (9,10). From a safety perspective, ACIP concluded that
administration of Tdap after 20 weeks' gestation is preferred to
minimize the risk for any low-frequency adverse event and the
possibility that any spurious association might appear causative.

Transplacental Maternal Antibodies
----------------------------------
For infants, transplacentally transferred maternal antibodies might
provide protection against pertussis in early life and before
beginning the primary DTaP series. Several studies provide evidence
supporting the existence of efficient transplacental transfer of
pertussis antibodies (7,11,12). Cord blood from newborn infants whose
mothers received Tdap during pregnancy or before pregnancy had higher
concentrations of pertussis antibodies when compared with cord blood
from newborn infants of unvaccinated mothers (7,11). The half-life of
transferred maternal pertussis antibodies is approximately 6 weeks
(12). The effectiveness of maternal antipertussis antibodies in
preventing infant pertussis is not yet known, but pertussis-specific
antibodies likely confer protection and modify the severity of
pertussis illness (13,14). In addition, a woman vaccinated with Tdap
during pregnancy likely will be protected at time of delivery, and
therefore less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant. After
receipt of Tdap, boosted pertussis-specific antibody levels peak after
several weeks, followed by a decline over several months (15,16). To
optimize the concentration of maternal antibodies transferred to the
fetus, ACIP concluded that unvaccinated pregnant women should receive
Tdap, preferably in the 3rd or late 2nd (after 20 weeks gestation)
trimester.

Interference with Infant Immune Response to Primary DTaP Vaccination
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Several studies have suggested that maternal pertussis antibodies can
inhibit active pertussis-specific antibody production after
administration of DTaP vaccine to infants of mothers vaccinated with
Tdap during pregnancy, referred to as blunting (12,17). Because
correlates of protection are not fully understood, the clinical
importance of blunting of an infant's immune response is not clear.
Evidence suggests that any blunting would be short-lived because
circulating maternal antibodies decline rapidly (12,18). Circulating
maternal pertussis antibodies might reduce an infant's risk for
pertussis in the 1st few months of life but slightly increase risk for
disease because of a blunted immune response after receipt of primary
DTaP doses. The benefit would be to reduce the risk for disease and
death in infants aged less than 3 months, but the trade-off might be
to increase the occurrence of pertussis in older infants; however,
this group experiences a substantially lower burden of
hospitalizations and mortality (National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System, CDC, unpublished data, 2011).

Currently, 2 clinical trials are being conducted to measure the immune
response of infants receiving DTaP immunization at ages 2, 4, and 6
months whose mothers received Tdap during the 3rd trimester of
pregnancy (19,20). These trials also are designed to evaluate safety
and immunogenicity of Tdap during pregnancy, but are not sufficiently
powered to assess disease endpoints. Analysis of interim data from one
trial (19, unpublished data) measured infant antibody to pertussis
antigens in a blinded fashion for 2 groups: infants whose mothers
received Tdap and infants whose mothers received Td. The 1st group had
elevated antipertussis antibody levels compared with the 2nd at birth
and before dose 1, which might be the result of passive antibody
transfer, but had lower antipertussis antibody levels after dose 3. In
both groups, antipertussis antibody levels were comparable before
doses 2 and 3. Although the 1st group had lower antipertussis antibody
levels after dose 3, the evidence of sufficient immune response to
DTaP doses compared with the 2nd group was reassuring. ACIP concluded
that the interim data are consistent with previously published
literature suggesting a short duration of blunting of the infant
response, and that the potential benefit of protection from maternal
antibodies in newborn infants outweighs the potential risk for
shifting disease burden to later in infancy.

Cocooning
---------
Cocooning is defined as the strategy of vaccinating pregnant women
immediately postpartum and all other close contacts of infants aged
less than 12 months with Tdap to reduce the risk for transmission of
pertussis to infants. Cocooning has been recommended by ACIP since
2005. Cocooning programs have achieved moderate postpartum coverage
among mothers but have had limited success in vaccinating fathers or
other family members (3) (CDC, unpublished data, 2011). Programmatic
challenges make implementation of cocooning programs complex and also
impede program expansion and sustainability (2). The effectiveness of
vaccinating postpartum mothers and close contacts to protect infants
from pertussis is not yet known, but the delay in antibody response
among those vaccinated with Tdap after an infant's birth might result
in insufficient protection to infants during the 1st weeks of life
(21). ACIP concluded that cocooning alone is an insufficient strategy
to prevent pertussis morbidity and mortality in newborn infants.
Regardless, ACIP concluded that cocooning likely provides indirect
protection to infants and firmly supports vaccination with Tdap for
unvaccinated persons who anticipate close contact with an infant.

Decision and Cost Effectiveness Analysis
----------------------------------------
A decision analysis and cost effectiveness model was developed to
assess the impact and cost effectiveness of maternal Tdap vaccination
during pregnancy compared with immediately postpartum. The model
showed that Tdap vaccination during pregnancy would prevent more
infant cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared with the
postpartum dose for 2 reasons: 1) vaccination during pregnancy
benefits the mother and infant by providing earlier protection to the
mother, thereby protecting the infant at birth; and 2) vaccination
during late pregnancy maximizes transfer of maternal antibodies to the
infant, likely providing direct protection to the infant for a period
after birth. Model results were most sensitive to efficacy of maternal
antibodies and risk for disease as a result of blunting; however, a
sensitivity analysis in which infants were assumed to have as little
as 20 percent efficacy of maternal antibodies and a 60 percent
increase in risk for disease as a result of blunting found that
maternal vaccination during pregnancy was more cost effective and
prevented a greater proportion of infant cases and deaths than
postpartum maternal vaccination (22).

Guidance for Use
----------------
Maternal vaccination. ACIP recommends that women's health-care
personnel implement a Tdap vaccination program for pregnant women who
previously have not received Tdap. Health-care personnel should
administer Tdap during pregnancy, preferably during the 3rd or late
2nd trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation). If not administered during
pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.

Cocooning. ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g., parents,
siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care
personnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant
aged less than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to
protect against pertussis if they have not previously received Tdap.
Ideally, these adolescents and adults should receive Tdap at least 2
weeks before beginning close contact with the infant.

Special Situations
------------------
Pregnant women due for tetanus booster. If a tetanus and diphtheria
booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy for a woman who has
previously not received Tdap (i.e., more than 10 years since previous
Td), then Tdap should be administered during pregnancy, preferably
during the 3rd or late 2nd trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation).

Wound management for pregnant women. As part of standard wound
management care to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid-containing
vaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman
if 5 years or more have elapsed since last receiving Td. If a tetanus
booster is indicated for a pregnant woman who previously has not
received Tdap, Tdap should be administered.

Pregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination. To
ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant
women who have never been vaccinated against tetanus should receive 3
vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The
recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 to 12 months. Tdap should
replace 1 dose of Td, preferably during the 3rd or late 2nd trimester
(after 20 weeks' gestation) of pregnancy.

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA
continue to expand in efforts of continue to cocoon susceptible
neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants
who have not been yet adequately immunized. The use of the vaccine in
pregnant women further expands these recommendations.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to
pertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical
"whoop" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be
increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the
cause of the problem but other issues may be at work.

>From the moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED post Pertussis -
USA: (MN) 20100514.1573:

"Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and adults
are generally attributed to waning immunity without considering
potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains. As pointed
out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis - Australia (02):
(SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which show that
outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in the _B.
pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more virulent
(P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly) responsible
for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have emerged
worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in
infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen population.
This is even true for pertussis.
