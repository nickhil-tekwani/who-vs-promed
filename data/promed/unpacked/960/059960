Dengue Fever Prompts Action
----------------------------
PHUKET TOWN: Provincial health officers have been mobilized in the wake of
a steep rise in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases. In an interview with
the Gazette today, Phuket Provincial Health Officer Dr. Boonriang
Chuchaisangrat reported 61 cases of the mosquito-borne virus [disease
during the first five months of the year, including 20 cases in May.
During the first five months of last year, only 23 cases were reported.
During the first five months of the year, the ministry reported 32,662 DHF
cases nationwide, including 2,004 cases in southern Thailand. [They must
mean dengue cases of all types, since DHF cases are usually only a small
fraction of all dengue cases - Mod.JW
Of the 61 local cases, 43 involved children aged 14 and under.
In response, health officers completed inspections of 120 local schools as
part of a proactive campaign to eradicate the breeding grounds of the
mosquito which serves as the carrier of the DHF virus. The provincial
health office has also launched a public awareness effort advising
residents to avoid keeping `standing water' in planters and
other small containers, where the _Aedes_ mosquito lays its eggs, near
their homes.
"DHF is very easy to control if every household will pay attention to
controlling mosquito larvae," Dr Boonriang said.
