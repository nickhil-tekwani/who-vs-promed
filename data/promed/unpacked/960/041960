Authorities in Hong Kong stepped up customs checks at the weekend to stamp
out poultry smuggling, after a truck driver was found infected by the H5N1
bird flu virus across the border in mainland China. More officers were
deployed at Hong Kong's 4 land border checkpoints, and the territory beefed
up examination of suspicious cargoes and baggage at sea and air boundaries.
"We confiscated 3 fresh chickens and 3 fresh ducks by Saturday [17 Jun
2006] night at Lowu," a government spokeswoman said on Sunday. "Five people
tried to bring them in, 4 of them were mainland Chinese and one a Hong Kong
resident."
The new effort, code named "Operation Parrot," began on Saturday [17 Jun
2006]. Lowu is one of the heaviest land border crossings in the world,
handling up to 17 000 people an hour during peak periods.
The spokeswoman did not know whether the 5 people had been charged. It is
an offence to bring any meat or poultry into Hong Kong without an official
certificate, and offenders face a maximum penalty of HK 50 000 (USD 6400)
and 6 months' jail time.
Hong Kong suspended imports of live poultry from mainland China on Friday
[16 Jun 2006] after the truck driver was confirmed to be infected with the
H5N1 virus. The 31-year-old driver lives in Shenzhen, just over the border
from Hong Kong. It is unclear how he came to be infected, although he went
shopping at a wet market where live poultry was sold a few days before he
fell ill. He also ate a chicken which his wife prepared.
China says there has been no outbreak of the disease in poultry in
Shenzhen. Chickens are chiefly responsible for spreading the virus to
people. The H5N1 virus has killed 129 people in 9 countries since late
2003, most of them in Asia including 12 in China, and experts have warned
of a pandemic once the virus is able to spread easily among people.
