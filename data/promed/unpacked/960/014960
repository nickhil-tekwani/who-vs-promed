[HEV is hepatitis E virus, which causes one of the 5 known viral hepatitis]. HEV spreads usually through fecal contamination of drinking water.

At least 4 people lost their lives due to HEV infection in the last few months and thousands have been infected by HEV in a large part of Chittagong city. This water-borne epidemic has challenged the capacity of supplying safe drinking water and maintaining sewerage system there, which is the second most important metropolis of Bangladesh with a population of more than 2.5 million people.

Hundreds of patients are being diagnosed with HEV infection in different parts of Chittagong. According to the office of the civil surgeon, Chittagong, from 1 May till 2 Jul 2018, the total number of patients infected by HEV was 848.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. More than 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in east and south Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age-groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). - Mod.LL
