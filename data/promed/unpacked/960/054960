Star Valley Moose Tests Positive For CWD
----------------------------------------
A 3-year-old female moose has tested positive for Chronic Wasting
Disease (CWD) in western Wyoming. CWD is a fatal neurological disease
of deer, elk, and moose that affects the brain, causing weight loss,
abnormal behavior, and, eventually, death. There is no evidence that
CWD has any human-health implications.

"This finding was a very big surprise, said Wyoming Game and Fish
Department (WGFD) Wildlife Disease Specialist Hank Edwards. "Number
1, because this is the first CWD-positive moose we have ever found in
Wyoming. And number 2, because this moose was in an area that is a
significant distance from any other known CWD areas."

The animal was found approximately 2 miles south of Bedford, Wyoming,
and showed no clinical signs of CWD, which include loss of body
condition, excessive drooling, and drooping ears and head. It was
unable to stand up but was in very good nutritional condition.

Testing at the WGFD laboratory in Laramie determined this animal had
elaeophorosis (arterial worm disease), which accounted for its
inability to stand. According to Edwards, mule deer are the normal
host for elaeophorosis, where it does not cause serious disease.
Elaeophorosis is rarely seen in elk, but can cause significant
disease in moose. Additional testing by the Wyoming State Veterinary
Laboratory confirmed that the moose also tested positive for Chronic
Wasting Disease. Based on laboratory tests and lack of clinical sign,
Edwards said this animal was in the early stages of CWD.

Though CWD has been found in deer and elk in many parts of Wyoming
and other states, it is extremely rare in moose. Only 3 other wild
moose in North America have tested positive for the disease, all of
them in Colorado.

As a result of this finding, the Game and Fish will increase CWD
surveillance activities in this region of Wyoming. According to WGFD
Jackson Region Wildlife Supervisor Tim Fuchs: "We will immediately
begin to gear up our CWD surveillance in the Star Valley. We plan on
enlisting hunters in that area to help us by submitting their animals
for CWD testing. To do this, we are establishing check stations
throughout the region, and through news releases and other media
we'll be letting hunters know we need their help."

WGFD personnel collect and analyze more than 4000 CWD samples
annually throughout the state.

"There are no methods that have been proven effective in stopping the
expansion of CWD, although a number of things have been tried in
other states," said WGFD Director Steve Ferrell. "Recent research in
Wisconsin and Colorado has shown us that large-scale culling of
animals is ineffective in stopping the spread of the disease or
reducing its prevalence. Currently, the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department is monitoring the disease, conducting various research
projects to understand more about CWD, and educating the public on
the presence of the disease and what it means for wildlife and
people. The department is committed to using the tools we do have and
the best available science to manage this disease in a manner that
makes sense for the wildlife and people of Wyoming."

[CWD in moose may not produce the same clinical signs as seen in deer
and elk. The article says the animal was in good body condition. In
ProMED-mail post 20050930.2865 regarding a moose in Colorado with
CWD, there is no mention of the poor body condition seen in elk and deer.

Moose are solitary creatures, not running in herds like deer and elk,
so perhaps they are picking up the prion from environmental
contamination. More evidence is becoming available that when hunters
gut an animal, even if they are subclinical, those guts are sources
of exposure to other animals. There are more and more videos turning
up on the Web of deer and elk eating birds eggs from nests, gut piles
and other sources of proteins. Consequently, it is entirely possible
the moose became exposed in a similar fashion.

There is on going research involving bird droppings as even such
birds as crows and ravens have been known to visit carcasses and gut piles.

A paper published a few years ago demonstrated that prions could pass
through the kidneys and into the urine. This may be another method of
exposure to the moose.

However, this disease may not be a critical life threatening disease
in the moose. It is a very rare occurrence and this is only the 4th
time it has ever been reported. (In addition to the case reported
covered in Chronic wasting disease, moose - USA (CO) 20050930.2865,
there were reports of 2 additional free ranging moose identified with
CWD in Colorado -- see Baeten LA, Powers BE, Jewell JE, Spraker TR,
Miller MW . A Natural Case of Chronic Wasting Disease in a
Free-ranging Moose (Alces alces shirasi). 2007 J Wildlife Dis,
