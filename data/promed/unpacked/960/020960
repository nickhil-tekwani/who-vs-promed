Leptospirosis Outbreak in Kalasin, Thailand
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of leptospirosis has been reported in Thailand's northeastern
province of Kalasin. 10 patients have been found suffering from the
disease so far, according to the Director of Kamalasai Hospital, Dr. Supat
Thartpetch.
"The outbreak of leptospirosis in Kalasin Province is worrying, especially
in Kamalasai and Kongchai Districts, where 10 patients have already been
reported", Dr. Supat said.
"The disease normally spreads during rice harvests in the rainy season
through mud tracks in rice fields. So, people with any leg wounds, even
minor ones, should refrain from walking through the rice fields, or wear
long boots to prevent themselves from the disease", the doctor suggested.
People who have contracted the disease will suffer from a high fever of
around 39-40 degrees Celsius with pale [skin?], red eyes, red urine, and
wearied leg muscles.
"People who have the symptoms should see the doctor immediately", the
doctor warned.
