Recently, a wave of rumors has been disseminated on social media regarding side effects in dogs after vaccination with the Nobivac rabies vaccine, manufactured by the MSD company. The Ministry of Agriculture emphasizes that out of approximately 100 000 dogs vaccinated with the said vaccine, so far a total of about 10 verified reports of side effects resulting from rabies vaccination using the vaccine in question have been received.

Reported side effects characterize any medical product and any vaccine, and include, inter alia, fever and local pain and up to and including allergy and shock symptoms. Notably, no death case has been found.

Upon receiving the reports and in order to maintain the health of animals, the Ministry of Agriculture is acting, in collaboration with the manufacturer, the MSD Company, and the Israeli importer, to conduct an investigation into the cases discovered in Israel. The Ministry of Agriculture continues to monitor the reports and is in contact with the importer and the global manufacturer. In parallel, the veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture maintain contact with the authorized municipal veterinarians and veterinary clinics.

The vaccine in question is registered and included (similarly to 4 other rabies vaccines) in the list of vaccines authorized by the State Veterinary Services in Israel, and has been used in many European countries for many years. This is a vaccine manufactured by the global MSD company, which supplies Israel with many other animal vaccines. The Ministry of Agriculture asks the general public to report any suspicion of side effects in an animal vaccinated against rabies with the named vaccine, directly to the email address: <bioplanPV@bioplan.co.il>.

The type of vaccine can be seen in the animal's vaccination record, or you can contact and check with your veterinarian. The Ministry of Agriculture continues to be at your service for any questions on the subject, through its hotline, open 24/7.

[In tandem with the above press release, the State Veterinary Services distributed by email, on 1 Aug 2022, a circular to all veterinary practitioners which included, inter alia, the following additional information:

"1. Most of the complaints referred to the following side effects: fever, vomiting, itching, pain in the injection site. There have been few reports of serious reactions such as anaphylactic shock which required medical intervention. So far, no confirmed deaths have been reported.

"2. As is well known, side effects may follow the use of any medical product; most of such effects are detailed in the accompanying leaflets. In each case, an examination of the animal is required, addressing the severity of the phenomenon, its frequency, and whether it can be attributed to the vaccine.

"3. As of this date, no information supporting the cessation of the marketing of the named vaccine has surfaced. Follow up is continued.

"4. In accordance with the European legislation, adopted in Israel, side effects must be reported to the manufacturer or importer. Their address appears on the label and/or the product leaflet".

Annual licencing and rabies vaccination of all dogs are compulsory in Israel. Most of the vaccinations are performed by authorised practitioners, who are supervised and report to their respective municipal veterinarians. Until recently, vaccinations were required on an annual basis. This requirement has been undergoing a change, vaccination becoming prescribed every 2nd year following the primary and booster vaccinations. This change followed a protracted debate.

Earlier, media-sourced information was received from ProMED rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi. - Mod.AS
