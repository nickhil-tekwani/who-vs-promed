The numbers of seabirds affected by a sticky substance in the sea off south west England over the past week [8-14 Apr 2013] could be far greater than those harmed by a similar -- or possibly the same -- spill earlier this year [2013].

Wildlife agencies in Devon and Cornwall said numbers of birds killed or rendered helpless could reach "thousands" and that "a whole generation of seabirds" may have been wiped out in a single pollution incident.

Dead and distressed birds have been washing up along beaches in Devon and Cornwall since the middle of last week, covered in a sticky substance that has been confirmed as polyisobutylene, also known as PIB or polyisobutene, an oil additive often used to improve the performance of lubricating oil and in products ranging from adhesives to sealants and chewing gum. Affected species include razorbill, puffin and gannets, but predominantly guillemots.

The Cornwall Wildlife Trust (CWT) said that more than 400 seabirds have already washed ashore on Cornish beaches, from Whitsand Bay to Falmouth. Abby Crosby, marine conservation officer for the trust, which also coordinates the Marine Stranding Network, said: "Over a 24-hour period yesterday [16 Apr 2013], the public reported 130 birds in one stretch small of the south-east coast, plus 140 on just one other beach itself. That's 270 birds in 24 hours in one tiny stretch of coast between Portwrinkle and Seaton. It's tragic, it's horrific."

Richard White, senior marine officer for the Devon Wildlife Trust, said the trust was still trying to get a full picture of the numbers and was asking volunteers to count the dead birds they found.

"The numbers we do know about are quite concerning. We had reports of 50 dead birds along one relatively short stretch of beach near Wembury but we could be looking at thousands along the whole south Devon and Cornwall coast. This seems bigger to us than the January-February [2013] spill in terms of birds coming ashore -- there are very few live birds coming ashore now."

[In the previous report, approximately 300 birds washed up coated with an oily substance. The "wave" pattern is intriguing. It seems there is an intermittent common source, for which it is crucial to identify as soon as possible the origin.

[Look for the source close to cliffs where guillemots roost or offshore where they feed. Is there a sunken tanker leaking its cargo? - Mod.JW
