Recently in a review in Nature (1998; vol 391, p322) there is a comment on
10 diabetic patients who received islet cell transplants from pigs.
It stated that all 10 patients had antibodies to porcine influenza virus, 5
to parvovirus and 5 to other pig viruses (it stated parcovirus but I presume
that was a misprint for parvovirus). One patient had an onging infection
with parvovirus (Tibell, Karolinska Institute Stockholm). Does any one know
if this work has been formally published and if there are any similar series
of patients who have been tested?

I thought these results were very worrying. My interpretation was that 100%
of these patients had been infected with multiple animal viruses and one
(10%) with ongoing infection. If we transplant pig livers or kidneys into
patients, these patients are likely to be very highly immunosuppressed and
these organs are likely to carry more animal micro organisms than islet
cells. It will be interesting to see what the results of the 150 patients
to be tested are. I presume they are looking for a wide range of animal
infective agents and just not
retroviruses.

[I think one has to keep in mind that the intention of those proposing
donor-pigs is that the donated tissues should be from pathogen-free stock,
or at least with known organisms. Obviously with this artificial source one
should be as risk-free as possible. However, one must wonder what the risks
have been when utilising human resources ... sometimes significant if the
literature is anything to go by. - Mod.MHJ
