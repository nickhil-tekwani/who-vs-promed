The Ministry of Health has confirmed that all the suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] cases in Jinja district tested negative.

Speaking to Daily Monitor on [Sat 20 Apr 2019], the ministry's senior public relations officer, Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, confirmed that the results that were tested at Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe were negative.

"The samples of the relatives of the man who died at Entebbe General Hospital after he tested positive to the disease were taken to Entebbe but all have been found negative,'' he said.

Last [Tue 16 Apr 2019], the Jinja District health officer, Dr Dyogo Nantamu, confirmed that 13 people were admitted to Butagaya Health Centre III, in Butagaya Sub-county in Jinja District after they suspected them of having the disease.

Dr Dyogo, said these patients, who had signs of CCHF including general body weakness, bloody diarrhoea, severe pain in limbs and headache, were being treated in an isolated ward to prevent the disease from spreading to other people.

Dr Dyogo said the isolation ward that was created has since been left open for any new suspected cases. On [Mon 22 Apr 2019], the Ministry of Health, confirmed an outbreak of CCHF in Uganda.

According to World Health Organisation, the disease is caused by tick-borne virus. It is transmitted by tick bites and contact with infected animal blood or tissues.
