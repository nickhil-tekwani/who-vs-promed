Senegal, which is located on the north-west coast of central Africa, is an important partner of the US in promoting peace and security. Because dengue is a viral disease and spread by mosquito bites, all travelers to Senegal should prevent mosquito bites by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors, and sleeping in an air-conditioned or well-screened room or under an insecticide-treated bed net, said the CDC. Moreover, half of the world's population living in 128 countries is at risk of dengue.

[2] WHO position paper on dengue vaccine
Date: 10 Oct 2018
Source: Vaccine [edited]
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.09.063


This article presents the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations on the use of dengue vaccine excerpted from the WHO position paper on dengue vaccine -- September 2018, published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record. This position paper replaces the July 2016 WHO position paper concerning the 1st licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. The position paper presents new evidence that became available in November 2017. A retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials, using a new serological assay, classified trial participants according to their dengue serostatus prior to receipt of the 1st vaccine dose. The analysis revealed an excess risk of severe dengue in seronegative vaccine recipients compared with seronegative non-vaccinated individuals, while confirming long-term protection in seropositive individuals. The paper provides revised guidance on dengue vaccination strategies from a population health perspective.

Footnotes to this paper provide a number of core references, including references to grading tables that assess the quality of the scientific evidence, and to the evidence-to-recommendation table. In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, the WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. Recommendations on the use of dengue vaccine CYD-TDV were discussed by SAGE in April 2018; evidence presented at the meeting can be accessed at http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2018/april/presentations_background_docs/en/.

[3] Impact of multiple dengue serotype circulation
Date: 8 Nov 2018
Source: Live Mint [edited]
https://www.livemint.com/Politics/orNeZs2FyvwgLm9hcio5RK/All-4-dengue-strains-can-circulate-together-turn-deadly.html


Dengue can turn deadlier as all of its 4 strains can circulate together, scientists have established. The viruses can also circulate with malaria and chikungunya virus. The disease is caused by the mosquito-borne dengue viruses consisting of 4 serotypes (strains) -- DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3 and DENV 4.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed that DENV 3 is circulating this year [2018] in the national capital, while the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) has recently established in its research, An Epidemiological Study of Dengue and its Coinfections in Delhi, that in previous years, all the 4 strains were circulating together. The research was also published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

As many as 1536 (28 percent) of the 5536 patients tested during the study in the NIMR clinic had confirmed dengue. The peak dengue positivity was seen during September and October, said the study. "Of the 60 samples analysed, 10 (16.7 percent) had concurrent infection with multiple dengue serotypes; one of them had all the 4 serotypes. Co-infection of dengue with malaria and chikungunya was also observed. Infection with more than one serotype was also observed. Dengue and malaria co-infection was also found though malaria transmission is very low in Delhi," said Deepali Savargaonkar, a scientist with NIMR and the author of the study.

"Delhi being hyper-endemic to dengue and other vector-borne diseases, the occurrence of concurrent infections with multiple DENV serotypes has become a frequent finding. There is a need for strong surveillance to monitor trends in dengue distribution, seasonal patterns and circulating serotypes to guide dengue control activities," she said.

There is a significant association of peak in dengue positivity and high larval indices with the post-monsoon period, the scientists have pointed out. Dengue is seen to be common in the age-groups of 11 to 20 and 21 to 30 years, as they are more prone to mosquito bites because of the nature of their daily routine, they said.

"Dengue is prevalent in at least 128 countries. With increased globalization and major travelling, the possibility of co-infection of virus's strains has largely increased. As people travel, they can bring different strains from other places," said Himmat Singh, a scientist with NIMR.

"If a mosquito carrying one strain bites a person carrying a different strain, the mosquito gets the new strain as well and further spreads it. Dengue co-infection with its own strains and malaria and chikungunya can be much more severe than thought," Singh said.

"In areas endemic for dengue, chikungunya and malaria, there is a need to have a higher degree of suspicion of co-infection to ensure prompt treatment, especially for malaria. With frequent outbreaks in Delhi, there is a need to conduct epidemiological and entomological surveillance, which will help in early warning of outbreak and control of dengue," said Savargaonkar.

At least 40 868 cases of dengue have been reported with 83 deaths up to 30 Sep 2018, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme under the ministry of health and family welfare. The highest burden of the disease is in Maharashtra (4667 cases), Odisha (3883) and Kerala (3660). Kerala has recorded the highest number of deaths, 35, followed by Maharashtra (18) and Chhattisgarh (10). There have been 1156 cases this season in Delhi.

[The only current method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to effectively combat the vector mosquitoes. Vector control is implemented using the integrated vector management (IVM) approach, which is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. IVM requires a management approach that improves the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustainability of vector control interventions given the available tools and resources. Proper solid waste disposal and improved water storage practices, including covering containers to prevent access by egg-laying female mosquitoes, are among methods that are encouraged through community-based programmes. - Mod.UBA]
