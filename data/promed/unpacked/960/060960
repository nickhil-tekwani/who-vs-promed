The authorities in eastern Assam's Dibrugarh district have undertaken a drive to vaccinate livestock around the Joypur rainforest after anthrax was confirmed as the cause of the death of 2 female elephants a week ago.

This is the 2nd case of anthrax in [Assam] after 2 Asiatic water buffaloes died in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in October 2019 [see Anthrax - India (09): (AS) Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, buffalo 20191021.6738770]. The sanctuary, 48 km (about 30 mi) east of Guwahati, is often called "Mini Kaziranga" owing to a similar landscape.

Wildlife veterinarians said the 2 elephants -- one sub-adult about 10 years old and the other about 20 years -- died after ingesting anthrax spores that can remain buried underground for 25-30 years. "The carcasses of the elephants were found on the hilly Soraipung range of the Joypur Reserve Forest. They are likely to have ingested the spores while digging the earth for salt," elephant veterinarian Kushal Konwar Sarma said.

Amit Sahai, Assam's Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said the field staff adhered to standard operating procedures to first burn the carcasses and bury the ashes deep inside the earth besides sanitising the affected areas. "While our field workers have been patrolling the rainforest for detecting other animals that could be infected, the veterinary officials have undertaken vaccination of livestock that could be vulnerable," he told The Hindu.

Mr. Sarma said anthrax was an endemic disease in India but was not known to have caused mass animal deaths. "The Assam government makes vaccines to prevent anthrax, and these are administered to livestock when any situation arises," he added.

In October 2019, the livestock around Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary were vaccinated after anthrax was found to be the cause of death of 2 wild buffaloes. Anthrax was also said to be the cause behind the death of 5 rhinos in West Bengal's Jaldapara National Park in February [2020].

Anthrax has not been known to kill humans in Assam, but about 30 people had died in north-central Assam's Udalguri district in the 1990s after consuming meat of cattle that died of anthrax.

Joypur is a 4-canopy rainforest that was initially a part of the Thailand rainforest network before getting isolated when the Indian subcontinent drifted northward. The rainforest houses some rare species of flora and animals such as hoolock gibbon, panther, wild dog, stump-tailed macaque, clouded leopard and flying squirrel besides the elephant.

[As livestock and elephants will share environments -- cattle into the parks to graze even if forbidden and elephants grazing around villages -- it is very wise to initiate a local livestock vaccination. In theory, elephant can be vaccinated using dart guns, but the coverage obtained is not adequate and the cost is high.
