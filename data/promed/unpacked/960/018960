More than 500 cases of measles, including 9 deaths, were recorded in Nizi District of Ituri Region [Orientale province, Democratic Republic of Congo] since last May [2013]. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) announced these figures in a press release on Mon 29 Jul 2013. In order to contain this outbreak in Orientale Province, MSF plans to vaccinate 45 000 children aged 6 months to 10 years in Nizi Health District during August 2013. Among the 500 cases recorded during the last 3 months, more than 350 people were infected in the month of July 2013.

20 children whose cases are complicated are currently being treated in Nizi District hospital. Other patients are being treated at local health centres. According to the MSF report, the health facilities in Nizi have been overwhelmed by the number of patients who have contracted measles virus infection. MSF is providing additional help to contain the outbreak. The head of the MSF emergency team in Bunia city [the administrative centre of Ituri region] said that his organization has deployed teams to strengthen the capacity of local health facilities. These teams will also look for other cases in surrounding villages to ensure early treatment of patients to reduce mortality.

The rapid spread of the outbreak of disease has alarmed local health authorities, who are continuing to seek additional support to contain the epidemic from both central government and other sources.

Public health officials announced Monday [29 Jul 2013] that another Halton resident has been diagnosed with measles, making 6 Halton cases so far this summer [2013]. Most of the cases were confirmed in Burlington, with one diagnosed in Oakville.

Officials warn this new case may have led to exposures in public, retail and health-care settings. "To avoid spreading illness to others, we cannot stress enough the importance of staying home and not exposing other people when you are ill [with measles]," said Dr. Monir Taha, Halton Region Associate Medical Officer of Health. "Measles is contagious from the beginning of the illness until 4 days after the rash 1st appears."

People who attended the following places on the following dates may have been exposed to measles:

- Trafalgar Presbyterian Church, 354 Upper Middle Rd., Oakville, 21 Jul 2013 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
- Sunnyside Grill, 450 Appleby Line, Burlington, 21 Jul 2013, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
- TD Canada Trust, 3471 Wyecroft Rd., Oakville, 22 Jul 2013, 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
- Home Depot, 3300 South Service Rd., Oakville, 23 Jul 2013, 9 a.m. to noon, and 24 Jul 2013, 9 a.m. to noon
- North Burlington Medical Centre Walk-in Clinic, 1960 Appleby Line, Burlington, 24 Jul 2013, 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., and 26 Jul 2013, noon to 5 p.m.
- Tansley Woods Community Centre, 1996 Itabashi Way, Burlington, 27 Jul 2013, 9 a.m. to noon
- Hopedale Presbyterian Church, 156 Third Line, Oakville, 28 Jul 2013, 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Walmart, Appleby Line & Dundas Street, Burlington, 27 Jul 2013, 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.

New measles cases are possible in non-immune people who have been exposed to this most recent case as late as 18 Aug 2013 [sic]. The Regional Health Department is recommending that persons born in 1970 or later who are unsure of their measles vaccination status discuss this with their doctor. Updated information on any new cases or new exposure sites can be found at http://www.halton.ca/measlesupdate. Anyone who believes they may have measles and needs to see a doctor must call ahead to the doctor's office, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. This will allow health care staff to have a mask and an isolation room ready.
