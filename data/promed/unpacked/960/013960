[Since 27 Jul 2012, 8 LSD outbreaks have been reported from the affected area in north-eastern Israel, adjacent to the Lebanese and Syrian borders. The locations of all 8 outbreaks are presented in an interactive map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=12157.

This is the 4th LSD epizootic recorded so far in Israel. All previous 3 epizootics -- in 1989, 2006 and 2007 -- occurred in the vicinity of the Gaza strip in south-west Israel. The very 1st outbreak, in September 1989, involved one village with 17 dairy farms, of which 14 had animals with clinical signs (Ref 1). The disease was eradicated by stamping out; all 17 farms, with 633 cattle (including 64 with clinical LSD) were depopulated. This was followed by the vaccination of all cattle within 10 km around the affected village and around the Gaza strip. It was decided to refrain from the introduction of an exotic live LSD vaccine but to use a sheep-pox vaccine which had been widely and routinely applied in Israel in sheep. The cattle vaccination was preceded by safety and efficacy trial of the vaccine in live cattle. Later, a country-wide serosurvey was performed; based upon its results, the country could regain its freedom of LSD.

The 2nd epizootic (20 Jun - 3 Sep 2006) involved 3 foci/outbreaks. This time, modified stamping out was applied, all 192 cattle with clinical signs culled. The majority of the cattle, not showing clinical signs, were vaccinated with a sheep-pox vaccine and were maintained. This was followed by vaccination of all cattle in the region, using the same vaccine. For the locations of the 3 outbreaks, see map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=1363.

The 3rd epizootic (09 Jun - 14 Nov 2007), involved 7 foci/outbreaks. The same policy (modified stamping out) as in 2006 was applied, destroying all 364 cattle with clinical signs, followed by vaccination of the others with the same vaccine. For the locations of the 7 outbreaks, see map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5568. The potency/efficacy of the vaccine was later questioned and assessed; see Ref 2.

During the current northern epizootic, so far involving 8 outbreaks, 823 animals have been reported to show clinical disease, of which only 4 have been destroyed. The remaining infected animals may be a source for virus dissemination, mainly by biting arthropods.

The veterinary authorities will have to decide soon which vaccine should be applied to protect cattle, particularly dairy cattle, against LSD. The efficacy of the sheep-pox RM-65 live attenuated vaccine, used in Israel for many years, became a matter of concern since the late 90's in view of multiple outbreaks of sheep-pox in apparently vaccinated animals. Efficacy tests, performed in 2002, were inconclusive. Its potency in cattle, vaccinated in 2006/7, was also questioned (ref 2). In 2008, this vaccine was replaced by a sheep-pox RM-65 live attenuated vaccine from another source; this product, contrary to the previous one, underwent safety and efficacy tests in live sheep, performed by the Kimron Veterinary Institute, conditional to its purchase. Subsequently, a dramatic decline of sheep-pox incidence in Israel has been observed. Similar testing procedures in cattle deserve to be undertaken prior to the decision on the vaccine type to be applied against LSD.

On top of the reported and addressed LSD outbreaks within Israeli territory, the virus is, most likely, circulating beyond the adjacent borders, with wider international implications. In the past, consignments of cattle from Sudan and the Horn of Africa found their official and unofficial routes to Middle East countries. The current political unrest in the region adds to such illegal movements, with wider international implications. For example, smuggling of Syrian cattle to Lebanon and to Turkey (respectively) are included in the following media sources http://www.agrifeeds.org/node/75958 and http://tinyurl.com/c7rtzjp.
