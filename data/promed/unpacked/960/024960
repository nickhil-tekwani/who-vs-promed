A 4-year-old boy of Jayapura village in the taluk [smallest administrative unit] was found to be infected with Japanese encephalitis (JE), called brain fever, and is undergoing treatment.

The boy, who was suffering from a high fever, was shifted to JSS hospital in the city. The health department authorities visited the village and collected blood samples of the people who suffered from fever recently.

District Vector-Borne Diseases Control Officer Dr S Chidambara confirmed the case and said there is no need for anxiety. The district has reported a total of 23 brain fever cases this year [2021]. Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis was first found in Kellahalli in the district, according to sources.

[The boy is reported as a confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis (JE). Presumably, the 23 brain fever cases are all JE cases as well, but there is no indication if they are laboratory confirmed. However, this is the season for JE virus transmission in India, and cases have occurred in Assam, Bihar, and Jharkhand states this year (2021). A few sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Karnataka state over the years, but not as frequently as the states in northeastern India. No mention is made in the report above if vaccination against JE is active in Karnataka state. - Mod.TY
