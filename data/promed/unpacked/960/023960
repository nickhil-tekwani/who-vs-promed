Authorities say emergency workers called to a conference center in northern Germany found some 30 people staggering and suffering from cramps, apparently as a result of amphetamine poisoning.

The local government said 15 ambulances and a helicopter were sent to the scene [Fri 4 Sep 2015] in the small town of Handeloh, south of Hamburg, the dpa news agency [Deutsche Presse-Agentur, German Press Agency] reported.

Fire service spokesman Matthias Koehlbrandt told broadcaster NDR [Norddeutscher Rundfunk, Northern German Broadcasting] the group was aged between 25 and 55. NDR reported they were alternative and homeopathic practitioners, and that they were taken to the hospital.

Authorities said their preliminary finding was that the group was poisoned with amphetamines, but Koehlbrandt said they didn't knowingly take the substance.

[Initially it seems almost impossible that alternative and homeopathic practitioners would not know what amphetamines are, or how/when they encountered them. However, if the drugs were in some "magic brownie" formula, such as has happenbed with marijuana, then perhaps it is possible. Perhaps this was a group experiment?

Amphetamines are a class of compounds increasingly abused in many regions of the world.. Synthetic amphetamine compounds commonly are produced in clandestine laboratories and vary in purity and potency. Other potentials for amphetamine abuse include prescription medications often used for attention deficit disorder and various over-the-counter diet pills.

Clinical effects of amphetamine abuse are significant and commonly observed in Emergency Rooms or Emergency Departments. The emergency physician's ability to recognize and treat amphetamine intoxication is very important.[1]

The phenylethylamine structure of amphetamines is similar to catecholaminergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic agonists (biogenic amines), which may explain their actions.

The relative activities that amphetamines have to stimulate the receptors of these biogenic amines are dependent on the chemical substituents on the amphetamine molecule; thus, the clinical presentation is dependent on the type of amphetamine used. For example, methamphetamine lacks much of the peripheral stimulant properties of amphetamine while still offering euphoric and hallucinogenic properties. These actions are similar to those of cocaine; however, while effects of cocaine last for 10-20 minutes, duration of amphetamine action is much longer, lasting as long as 10-12 hours.

The routes of amphetamine administration may be oral (ingestion), inhalation (smoke), or injection (intravenous). Oral use is associated with an approximate 1-hour lag time before onset of symptoms, whereas inhaled and intravenous methods yield effects within a few minutes. Peak plasma concentrations occur in 5 minutes with intravenous use, 30 minutes with nasal or intramuscular use, and 2-3 hours postingestion.

Amphetamines are a group of structurally related compounds that produce central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) stimulation.

Acute overdose of amphetamines produces seizures, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, psychosis, hallucinosis, stroke, and fatality.

- One study at San Francisco General Hospital from 1975-1987 determined that approximately 25 percent of seizures were secondary to amphetamine use. [2]
- In a few patients, amphetamine use produces long-term paranoid schizophrenia; whether this results from unmasking underlying disease is unclear. Severe psychological depression and prolonged sleep follow chronic use and binges.
- Habitual amphetamine use produces toxic psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia. Hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre violent behavior are common. Patients with amphetamine intoxication often are identified by a change of mental status alone or associated with another injury and/or illness.

Central nervous system manifestations are as follows:
- change of mental status, disorientation, and headache;
- dyskinesias [involuntary muscle movements];
- agitation;
- formication [a sensation like insects crawling over the skin];
- symptoms of stroke;
Cardiovascular manifestations are as follows:
- chest pain;
- palpitations;
Gastrointestinal manifestations are as follows:
- dry mouth;
- nausea and vomiting;
- diarrhea;
Skin/cutaneous manifestations are as follows:
- diaphoresis [perspiration];
- erythematous painful rashes, needle marks;
- infected deep ulcerations (ecthyma);
Genitourinary (GU) manifestations include difficult micturition. Ocular manifestations include mydriasis [dilation of the pupil of the eye].
