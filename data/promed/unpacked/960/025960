In Ukraine since the beginning of the year [2017], there have been 76 cases of botulism, 8 of them fatal. This was reported during a briefing by the acting Minister of health Ulyana Suprun.

However, she noted that on as of [4 Jul 2017] in Ukraine there is the availability of an antitoxin against botulism. The Canadian product was transferred via the framework of the UN development program. Ukraine has not had this product since 2014. Funds for the purchase of this drug had not even budgeted. This supply allows for use in the treatment of new cases of infection with botulism.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (2). In Ukraine, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish.
