San Diego health officials on [Tue 13 Feb 2018] announced that ticks found in the region tested positive for [_Francisella tularensis_ the etiologic bacterium causing] tularemia, a potentially dangerous bacterial disease also known as "rabbit fever." The discovery prompted officials to urge the public to protect themselves and their pets from ticks when hiking or walking in grassy, backcountry areas, on trails and in the wild.

Ticks are tiny, 8-legged parasites related to spiders. They crawl out on leaves and vegetation and extend their hooked front legs to latch onto passing animals and people, then bite and feed on blood. Even though tick diseases are rare in San Diego County, they have also been known to carry other diseases including Lyme disease and spotted fever illnesses, officials said in a press release.

Vector Control officials said they have been finding increased numbers of ticks in 2018 around the county, although the ones collected in Sorrento Valley were the only ones that have tested positive for any disease. The County's Vector Control Program monitors the population of vectors -- animals like ticks, fleas, rodents and mosquitoes -- that can transmit diseases to people.

Tularemia can be successfully treated with antimicrobials, but can be dangerous and even fatal. County public health officials said anyone who is bitten by a tick should not panic, but carefully remove it. They said if a person develops a rash or fever within several weeks of being bitten they should see a doctor, tell them about the tick bite, when they were bitten and where they think it happened.

Health officials offered the following tips to help you protect yourself, your family and pets from ticks:
- Wear insect repellent
- Stay on designated pathways
- Avoid grass and brush
- Frequently check your clothing, body and companions for tick
- Leave pets at home or keep them leashed

"Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. This bacterium is found in wild rodents and rabbits. It is spread through tick bites, direct contact with infected living or dead animals, or by drinking water that has been contaminated with the bacteria. In California, the American dog tick and the Pacific Coast tick can transmit tularemia. Tularemia has been reported in many areas of the country. In California, it is most frequently seen in the northern areas of the state. It is very rare in San Diego."

Although more common in Midwestern US states, the history of tularemia actually starts in California where, in Tulare county, the disease was characterized as a plague-like disease in the California ground squirrel by McCoy and Chapin (1) in 1912. Initially called _Bacterium tularensis_, the organism's genus was changed to _Francisella_ for Edward Francis (2) who published in 1919 that "deer fly fever", "rabbit septicemia" and the "plague-like disease of ground squirrels" were all the same disease.
