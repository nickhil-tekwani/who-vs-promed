Avian influenza situation in Cambodia - WHO update 6
-----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced
a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus. The case was a 6-year-old female from Taing Thleung Village,
Mepring Commune, Cheung Prey District, Kampong Cham Province.

She developed symptoms on 7 Aug 2011, was initially treated by local
practitioners with no effect, and was later admitted to Kantha Bopha
Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh on 12 Aug 2011. She died on 14 Aug
2011, 2 days after admission.

There have been reports of poultry die offs in her village, and the
case is reported to have had exposure to sick poultry.

This female is the 18th person in Cambodia to become infected with the
H5N1 virus and the 16th to die from complications of the disease. All
8 cases of H5N1 infection in humans in Cambodia this year [2011] have
been fatal.

The National and local Rapid Response Teams (RRT) are conducting an
outbreak investigation and response following the national protocol.
Health education messages are ongoing in the community. To date, none
of the human contacts have tested positive for A(H5N1).
