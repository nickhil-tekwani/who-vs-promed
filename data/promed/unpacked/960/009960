In Los Angeles County California, we have a case of _Salmonella_ C,
serotype Hadar, where the patient states she ate raw Swiss cheese . She
ordered the product through a 1-800 number . Even though the label says it
is manufactured in Southern California, we believe the product is made in
Wisconsin. If anyone has heard of any other cases related to this product
which is sold in 6 oz packages stating "Natural Swiss Cheese slices, aged
over 60 days, made from unpasterurized milk, no coloring or preservative
added, etc. please contact me.
