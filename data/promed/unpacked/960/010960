Panama disease tropical race 4 (TR4) has been detected on a 6th commercial banana farm in Queensland. TR4 was first detected in the area in 2015 and had been detected on 5 farms since then.

Biosecurity Queensland (BQ) has advised that samples from suspect plants discovered during routine surveillance returned positive results in molecular diagnostics (PCR). Additional testing will be completed to provide further confidence in the results.

As a soil-borne disease, limiting the spread of Panama disease is challenging. The new detection reinforces the need for growers to adopt and maintain robust biosecurity measures to continue to slow the spread of TR4.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostems; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades; consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (cultivars within the _Musa_ AAA group, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4 (TR4), as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED posts 20210105.8075029, 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

TR4 has now been reported in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and recently also the Americas (ProMED posts 20190820.6630576). TR4 is of great concern worldwide; development of TR4-resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

In Australia, race 1 and temperate race 4 are present in parts of the country (ProMED posts 20081212.3908, 20071024.3451, 19991014.1829). TR4 was reported for the 1st time in 1997 in the Northern Territory. When a new TR4 outbreak occurred there in 2012 (ProMED post 20120817.1248624), it was concluded that quarantine restrictions had no effect and they were lifted. This increased the risk posed by TR4 to the eastern growing areas, but a source for the initial outbreak in Queensland has so far not been clarified.
