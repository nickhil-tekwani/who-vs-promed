The statement from an official of the Government of India states:
"Kindly refer [to] the ProMED-mail forwarded by you regarding anthrax
in animals in Tamil Nadu, in which reference was made that Mr.
Santosh Babu, Collector of Krishnagiri District [stated] that the
disease was confirmed by conducting [an] autopsy.
The matter was examined, and the Animal Husbandry Department has
[stated] that [the] cows and calves [that] died in the area were
never autopsied and [that] the diagnosis was based on the clinical
symptoms and the blood smear taken from the blood that oozed out of
the natural orifices.
Collector Karimganj also brought out a press release that [stated
that] the postmortem was never conducted and the dead animals were
given deep burial."

[The lesson to be drawn from this is that journalists should be given
printed news releases that they can safely plagiarize, because if
they are only briefed verbally, misunderstandings can occur. Taken
altogether, it would seem that the veterinary authorities might have
arrived before the carcasses had been butchered and were able to
oversee their burial.
Diagnosing anthrax by necropsy is fraught with problems, even though
some claim that the raspberry jam appearance of the enlarged spleen
is pathognemonic, as well the generalized hemorrhagic edema of the
carcass and viscera. This may be so, but the resulting gross
environmental contamination, the opportunity for massive sporulation,
and the significant risk to those examining the carcass make it
inadvisable. It is something a veterinarian should never do twice in
his or her life, preferably not even once. For many decades, a
stained blood smear was an adequate 1st screening if one suspected
anthrax. As few vets these days have stains and a microscope with
them in the field -- assuming that their microscopic skills are still
adequate -- it reinforces the current urgent need for cheap, robust,
reliable carcass-side test kits to be available in those parts of the
world where this disease is enzootic.
If you go to the literature, there are more pathology papers based on
human autopsies than on necropsied animals with this disease.
Possibly, this is because veterinarians see more of this disease than
physicians. And certainly, there are no papers on animal autopsies. - Mod.MHJ]
