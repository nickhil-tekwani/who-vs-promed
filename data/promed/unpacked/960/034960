[If this dengue infection was, indeed, locally acquired, it indicates that there is at least one other case from which the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito acquired the virus. That case may have been local or imported from elsewhere. - Mod.TY]

Caribbean
---
French Caribbean. 10 Mar 2020. WHO reports:
- French Guiana
From January 2019 through 17 Feb 2020, a total of 487 confirmed cases of dengue, with no severe cases or deaths, were reported (figure 1). The most affected communes were Kourou, on the coastline, with 225 confirmed cases, and Maripasoula, in the south eastern part of French Guiana with 55 confirmed cases. Except for 2017 and 2018, dengue cases have been reported every year, with the most recent largest outbreak reported in 2013, resulting in 13 240 suspected cases including 6 deaths. Laboratory tests identified DENV-1 and DENV -2 as the predominant serotypes circulating in 2019 and 2020 (as at 17 Feb 2020). So far in 2020, DENV-2 has accounted for 63% of reported cases.

- Guadeloupe
From 14 Oct 2019 through 16 Feb 2020, a total of 5840 cases of dengue, with no severe cases or deaths, were reported. Of these, more than 1200 were confirmed by the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 43% (n=2540) of the total number of cases have been reported since the beginning of January 2020 (figure 2). From 19 Jan through 16 Feb 2020, clinically diagnosed cases were reported in 14 of the 24 communes with a sentinel general practitioner (out of a total of 32 communes that make up the archipelago). Most of the cases were reported in the following communes: Basse-Terre, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Petit-Canal, Petit-Bourg, Pointe-Noire, and Saint-François, and the isle of Marie-Galante (eastern and central part of the main island). The most recent largest outbreak reported in Guadeloupe was in 2013, with 12 706 suspected cases including 8 deaths.
Between 2005 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-4 (2005), DENV-2 (2006 and 2007) and DENV-1 (2008 and 2010). In 2019, laboratory tests identified DENV-2 as the predominant dengue serotype, which is currently circulating and has been reported in all of the affected areas.

- Saint Martin
From 12 Jan through 16 Feb 2020, a total of 530 suspected cases of dengue, including one severe and fatal case, were reported. Results of laboratory tests indicate that serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-3 are currently circulating, with predominance of DENV-1. From 2002 through 2005, DENV-3 was the only serotype in circulation. Between 2006 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-2 (2006, 2009) and DENV-1 (2007, 2008, and 2010) with co-circulation of DENV-3 and DENV-4. In 2013 and 2014, DENV-4 was the predominant serotype.

- Saint Barthélemy
From December 2019 through 15 Feb 2020, a total of 100 suspected cases of dengue, including 20 cases confirmed by NS1 antigen test and/or RT-PCR, were reported (figure 4). Laboratory tests have identified DENV-1 and DENV-2 as the circulating serotypes. The last outbreak reported in Saint-Barthélemy was from 2013 to 2014 with 970 suspected cases and one death reported. The outbreak was due to DENV-4 which was the predominant circulating serotype; with co-circulation of DENV-2. DENV-1 was identified during the 2009/2010 outbreak.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Developing a dengue vaccine remains challenging. After all, it is a vaccine for 4 genetically succinct [sic; should read "distinct". - Mod.SH] dengue virus serotypes (DENV) known to interact immunologically with potential for disease enhancement (that is, increased risk of severe dengue with a different serotype). Immune correlates to predict protection versus disease enhancement are still lacking, and plaque reduction neutralisation assays do not reliably differentiate between serotype-specific versus heterotypic antibodies. All 3 leading dengue vaccine candidates are live attenuated vaccines, with the main difference between them being the type of backbone and the extent of chimerisation. The long-term follow-up of the phase 3 trial of the 1st licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia, Sanofi-Pasteur, Lyon, France), brought to light that not only efficacy but also safety were dependent on serostatus. Efficacy for Dengvaxia was around 80% in vaccinees who were seropositive, but only minimal in vaccinees who were seronegative, with individuals who were seronegative having a higher risk of hospitalisation and severe dengue in the 3rd year after vaccination. Therefore, Dengvaxia's utility is limited to individuals who are seropositive. Lessons from the 1st dengue vaccine have therefore shaped how 2nd-generation dengue vaccines should be evaluated. Vaccine trial designs should account for the known period of cross-protection between serotypes, and be extended to the period when enhanced disease could potentially occur, which means that trial design must include active surveillance of trial participants, ideally up to 4-5 years. Furthermore, vaccine evaluation should include a-priori analysis plans for stratification by serostatus and also serotype.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
An unmet clinical need remains for an effective tetravalent dengue vaccine suitable for all age groups, regardless of serostatus. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of 3 different dose schedules of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) over a 48-month period in children living in dengue-endemic countries.

Methods
We did a large, phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 3 sites in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and the Philippines. Healthy participants aged 2-17 years were randomly assigned 1:2:5:1 using an interactive web response system with stratification by age to receive either a 2-dose primary series (days 1 and 91), one primary dose (day 1), one primary dose plus booster (days 1 and 365), or placebo. Participants and relevant study personnel were masked to the random assignment until completion of the study at month 48. To maintain masking, TAK-003 recipients were administered placebo doses when appropriate. The primary objective was assessment of neutralising geometric mean titres for each serotype to month 48 assessed in the per-protocol immunogenicity subset. Secondary safety endpoints included proportions of participants with serious adverse events and symptomatic virologically confirmed dengue. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02302066.

Findings
Between 5 Dec 2014, and 13 Feb 2015, 1800 children were randomly assigned to the following groups: 2-dose primary series (n=201), one primary dose (n=398), one primary dose plus 1-year booster (n=1002), and placebo (n=199). Of them, 1479 (82%) participants completed the 48-month study. Immunogenicity endpoints were assessed in 562 participants enrolled in the immunogenicity subset, of whom 509 were included in the per-protocol subset. At month 48, antibody titres remained elevated in all TAK-003 groups compared with placebo, irrespective of baseline serostatus. At month 48, geometric mean titres were 378 (95% CI 226-632) in 2-dose, 421 (285-622) in one-dose, 719 (538-960) in one-dose plus 1-year booster, and 100 (50-201) in placebo recipients against DENV 1; 1052 (732-1511), 1319 (970-1794), 1200 (927-1553), and 208 (99-437) against DENV 2; 183 (113-298), 201 (135-298), 288 (211-392), and 71 (37-139) against DENV 3; and 152 (97-239), 164 (114-236), 219 (165-290), and 46 (26-82) against DENV 4; and tetravalent seropositivity rate was 89% (79-96), 86% (80-92), 97% (93-99), and 60% (47-72), respectively. Virologically confirmed dengue was recorded in 37 (2%) TAK-003 and 13 (7%) placebo participants, with a relative risk of 0.35 (0.19-0.65). No vaccine-related serious adverse events or severe dengue virus disease were reported.

Interpretation
TAK-003 elicited antibody responses against all 4 serotypes, which persisted to 48 months post-vaccination, regardless of baseline serostatus. No important safety risks were identified. We observed a long-term reduction in risk of symptomatic dengue virus disease in vaccinees. Results from this study provide a long-term safety database and support assessment of the vaccine in the ongoing phase 3 efficacy study.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
A substantial unmet need remains for safe and effective vaccines against dengue virus disease, particularly for individuals who are dengue-naive and those younger than 9 years. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) in healthy children aged 4-16 years.

Methods
We present data up to 18 months post-vaccination from an ongoing phase 3, randomised, double-blind trial of TAK-003 in endemic regions of Asia and Latin America (26 medical and research centres across Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand). Healthy children aged 4-16 years were randomly assigned 2:1 (stratified by age and region) to receive 2 doses of TAK-003 or 2 doses of placebo, 3 months apart. Investigators, participants and their parents or guardians, and sponsor representatives advising on trial conduct were masked to trial group assignments. Participants presenting with febrile illness were tested for virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) by serotype-specific RT-PCR. In timeframes beginning 30 days post-2nd dose, the primary endpoint (overall vaccine efficacy) was assessed in the 1st 11 months, and the secondary endpoints (efficacy) by baseline serostatus, serotype, hospitalised dengue, and severe dengue) in the 1st 17 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02747927 [http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02747927].

Findings
20 099 participants were randomly assigned and vaccinated between 7 Sep 2016, and 18 Aug 2017; 19 021 (94.6%) were included in the per protocol analysis, and 20 071 (99.9%) in the safety set. The primary endpoint was achieved with an overall vaccine efficacy of 80.2% (95% CI 73.3 to 85.3; 61 cases of VCD in the TAK-003 group vs 149 cases of VCD in the placebo group). In the secondary endpoint assessment timeframe, an overall vaccine efficacy of 73.3% (95% CI 66.5 to 78.8) was observed. Analysis of secondary endpoints showed efficacies of 76.1% (95% CI 68.5 to 81.9) in individuals who were seropositive at baseline, 66.2% (49.1 to 77.5) in individuals who were seronegative at baseline, 90.4% (82.6 to 94.7) against hospitalised dengue, and 85.9% (31.9 to 97.1) against dengue haemorrhagic fever. Efficacy varied by individual serotypes (DENV 1, 69.8% [95% CI 54.8 to 79.9]; DENV 2, 95.1% [89.9 to 97.6]; DENV 3, 48.9% [27.2 to 64.1]; DENV 4, 51.0% [-69.4 to 85.8]). Cumulative rates of serious adverse events were similar in TAK-003 (4.0%) and placebo (4.8%) recipients and were consistent with expected medical disorders in the study population. Infection was the most frequent reason leading to serious adverse events. 20 participants (less than 0.1% of the safety set) were withdrawn from the trial due to 21 adverse events by the end of part 2; 14 of these participants received TAK-003 and 6 received placebo.

Interpretation
TAK-003 was well tolerated and efficacious against symptomatic dengue in children regardless of serostatus before immunisation. Vaccine efficacy varied by serotype, warranting continued follow-up to assess longer-term vaccine performance.
