As many as 46 people have died of encephalitis in a week [approx. 1-7 Sep 2014], and 7 in the past 24 hours [6-7 Sep 2014]. BRD Medical College statistics reveal that 991 encephalitis cases have been reported since January this year [2014], among which 291 have died and 184 are undergoing treatment in the encephalitis ward of the medical college. The mortality rate this year is the highest in 3 years. At present, the rate is 29.4 per cent. In the year 2011, only 18 per cent of encephalitis patients died; in 2012, the mortality rate was 20.9 per cent; whereas in 2013, it was 29.3 per cent. The increase in the last 3 years raises question on the claims made by the government.

The government is not following Holiya village model formula where the mortality rate came to zero. The chief campaigner of Encephalitis Eradication Movement (EEM) said: "In order to eradicate encephalitis, we have been demanding implementation of 10-point programme of NEEP in the country but till 2009. To show effectiveness of programme, we adopted a village of Kushinagar district [Uttar Pradesh state] which was badly hit by encephalitis with 5 deaths and 4 handicapped encephalitis victims and no one vaccinated till 2009. From 1 Jan 2010, we adopted Holiya village and implemented 10-point programme of NEEP, with a resolution that we'll make the village encephalitis free by 31 Dec 2010."

"Every year, more than 500 people die of encephalitis, and I'm sure this year [2014] will not be an exception. The government is spending so much money on vaccination program of JE [Japanese encephalitis] which is only 4 per cent left and not focusing on prevention of enteroviral encephalitis," he said.

The Holiya village formula is based on 100 per cent prevention programme, where pigs were kept out of the residential area and drinking water and hand washing water was disinfected by keeping it in plastic bottles under the sun for 6 hours, proper sanitation arrangements, use of mosquito net and arrangement of vehicles for taking the patients to hospital. Early vaccination programme is also the part of the Holiya village formula.

[No data are presented in the above report on the proposition of the 991 encephalitis cases in the area due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections or from other causes. The Holiya village EEM mentioned encephalitis cases due to enteroviruses in contaminated water. Previous reports from that area also associated encephalitis cases with contaminated water. However, revisiting the comments made by Dr T Jacob John, he mentioned that cases in this area early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. In a 24 Jun 2014 comment (ProMED-mail archive no. 20140625.2563561) concerning the Reye-like syndrome, he stated that "the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 per cent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day." In another comment, he noted on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140804.2656983), "I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis." He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season. The above report provides no information about the JEV vaccination status of the population in the affected areas, nor the number of cases laboratory confirmed as JEV infections.
