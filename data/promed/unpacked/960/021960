Researchers Publish Details of Multiresistant HIV Patient
---------------------------------------------------------
Researchers have published clinical and sequencing details of a
unique variant of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a patient who
is resistant to several classes of antiretroviral drugs and who
rapidly developed AIDS, after media reports of a possible new
"super-strain" of the virus [See ProMED-mail references below and
Lancet 2005;365:1031-8].
The patient, a man in his 40s from New York, was given a diagnosis of
HIV-1 infection in December 2004 after he had exhibited fever,
pharyngitis, weakness, and fatigue the previous month. Earlier he had
tested negative for HIV-1 antibodies on several occasions between
September 2000 and May 2003.
His illness progressed to AIDS within 20 months -- and perhaps as
little as 4 months -- of infection. The case was first publicised at
a press conference in New York in February 2005 because of the
possible public health implications of a rapidly progressing strain
of HIV with multiple drug resistance, and then discussed at the 12th
Retroviral Conference in Boston (see: BMJ 2005;330:498, 5 Mar).
Detailed analysis of the virus showed that it was resistant to 3 of
the 4 major classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. Viruses usually become less
virulent when they acquire drug resistance. However, the replication
capacity of the patient's HIV-1 was 136 percent in comparison with a
median of 100 percent derived from a large number of wild-type
viruses. This indicated that, despite its multidrug resistance, the
virus replicated as well as most wild-type, drug-susceptible viruses.
Rapid progression to AIDS after acute HIV-1 infection has been
described previously, as has the transmission of multidrug-resistant
viruses. However, Martin Markowitz, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center at Rockefeller University, New York, and one of the
authors of the case report, said: "The unique feature in this case is
the convergence of 2 uncommon factors: the transmission of a
multidrug resistant HIV-1 variant and the extremely rapid clinical
course to AIDS." He said that the case was in the top 0.5 percent in
terms of rapidity of disease if 12 months was assumed as the duration
of his infection.
Viral sequence analysis indicated that the patient's virus was
subtype B, and the relative homogeneity of the viral population was
consistent with early HIV-1 infection. Phylogenetic analysis of a
nucleotide sequence from the viral pol gene and from 30 newly
infected individuals and 5 reference HIV-1 strains showed that the
viral sequence of the new case was unique. No match was found in the
center's sequence database.
"Because of its unique features, this pol sequence is now being
compared with those in the database at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory and in various commercial laboratories with the hope of
finding a closely related HIV-1 that might provide an epidemiological
link to this case," the report said. "The rapid clinical course of
the patient's illness could be explained by the properties of his
unique HIV-1 variant," Dr Makowitz said, adding that genetic studies
on the case were still under way.
Treatment options for the patient are limited: enfuvirtide and
efavirenz are the only 2 antiretroviral drugs that can provide full
activity against his virus. He has been started on a multidrug
regimen, including enfuvirtide and efavirenz. Tracing of his sexual
contacts has also begun.
An accompanying editorial warned: "This case serves as a reminder
that HIV remains a frighteningly versatile foe, one that can mutate
to escape immune attack or to acquire drug resistance with surprising
speed. One lesson to be drawn from this case, therefore, is that
despite all the advances that have been made in understanding this
virus and all the progress that has been made in developing new
drugs, prevention remains the most effective strategy to combat HIV,
especially prevention efforts that target high-risk groups, such as
men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, and sex workers
and their clients."

[Despite the progress in characterization of the virus isolated from
the rapid onset/multidrug-resistant patient in New York City, the
epidemiologic significance of this virus is still uncertain.
Phylogenetic analyses have indicated that it is a unique virus, but
the lack of isolates from the patient's contacts does not allow any
conclusion to be drawn about the potential of this virus to promote
rapid progression to AIDS. A definitive outcome has yet to be
achieved. - Mod.CP]
