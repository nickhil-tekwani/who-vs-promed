An Egyptian woman has died after coming into contact with birds infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The 19-year-old woman died in hospital in the region of Assiut in the south of the country. It was the 2nd death in Egypt this year [2014] out of a total of 7 confirmed cases, said Egyptian health officials.

It comes after several cases of birds infected with a different type of the virus were discovered in commercial farms in England, Germany, and the Netherlands. [H5N8 avian influenza virus in Germany and the Netherlands, and probably in England]. There have been 667 human cases of H5N1 worldwide since 2003, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Egypt's health ministry said 2 other people were infected, according to Reuters news agency. One of them was a 3-year-old child who was recovering well in hospital and the other was a 30-year-old woman, the news agency added. Health ministry official Amr Kandil said the 1st death from H5N1 in Egypt this year [2014] had happened in June.

H5N1 was first seen in a human patient in Hong Kong in 1993 but has since spread worldwide. It has a death rate of about 60 percent in humans.

[The current outbreaks of H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus infection affecting commercial poultry flocks in Germany and the Netherlands, (and now probably England) have been characterised as a strain of H5N8 avian influenza virus, probably originating in the Far East and transmitted by migratory birds.

The H5N1 virus responsible for current illness and death in Egypt, on the other hand, has been associated with sporadic human illness and deaths over a wide area particularly where domestic fowl are reared at home.

According to the WHO (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140124CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf), Egypt ranks 2nd (after Indonesia) among the 15 countries where H5N1 avian influenza virus has been responsible for human cases (and deaths from) of avian H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP
