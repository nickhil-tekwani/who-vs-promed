Some Observations On Vector Biology
-----------------------------------
In my opinion _Aedes japonicus_ was present in New York State for many
years before the West Nile Virus outbreak in New York State. In Dutchess
County New York, we collected pupae of _Aedes japonicus_ quite early in the
season in year 2000. The pupae and fourth instar larvae were very common
after the middle of April, when we started our larval surveillance. _Aedes
japonicus_ was breeding in tarpaulins that were used to cover swimming
pools, in tires, and other similar breeding habitats [i.e. containers.
Early in the season, _Aedes triseriatus_ was also present in the same
habitats. In the middle of May _Culex restuans_ also started to exploit the
same habitats. In Jun [2000, _Culex pipiens_, _Culex restuans_ and _Aedes
japonicus_ were breeding together in the tires. _Aedes japonicus_ also
breeds with both the above _Culex_ species in storm drains with standing
water. Grass clippings, leaves and in certain areas hay was providing an
excellent medium that acted not only as a good ovipositional attractant but
also a as a good nutrient source for the developing larvae. The ratio of
_Aedes japonicus_ to _Culex_ species was lower in storm drains located in
urban areas compared to suburban and rural areas. This may be related to
the abundance of alternative container breeding habitats available for
_Aedes japonicus_ in the urban areas compared to the rural and suburban
localities. Our surveillance showed that storm drains with clean standing
water were devoid of mosquito larvae. _Aedes japonicus_ is present in all
municipalities of Dutchess County.
The enhanced mosquito surveillance that resulted due to the West Nile Virus
outbreak is the reason that scientists and/or mosquito control agencies are
reporting its presence in various new areas. In Dutches County, no _Aedes
japonicus_ was collected from water feeding troughs for horses whereas, in
New Jersey, most of the _Aedes japonicus_ collected was breeding in
automatic horse feeding troughs. This may be due to the differences in the
construction of the water feeding troughs, because in Dutchess County most
of the farms that we checked lacked automatic water feeding troughs.
In New Jersey, the role that _Aedes albopictus_ might play in the spread of
West Nile Virus should not be ignored. This species needs a close watch too.
