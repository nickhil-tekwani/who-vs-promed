In the past 2 months, nearly 130 [people] were killed by the dangerous
disease leptospirosis in south Gujarat. They are admitted to the civil
hospital at Surat, and most of them were in special wards in very
serious condition. They are affected by this disease because most of
them are farmers, and they have to work in sugarcane and paddy
fields.

Doctors say this is a bacterial infection that is spread through dirty
water, and it can be spread even by rat urine. [The bacteria] enter
into the body through wounds or cuts. The symptoms for this virus are
similar to those of dengue and flu. Physician at the Civil Hospital Dr
Kamalesh said these bacteria will mainly affect the lungs, kidney and
liver; the main symptoms for this disease are jaundice, fever and
redness in eyes.

>From 415 villages, around 750 cases have been affected, and the
government has sent a special team to the villages to bring medicines
for this disease.

[The numbers of deaths and cases of leptospirosis in Gujarat have
increased since the last ProMED-mail post (Leptospirosis, fatal -
India: (GJ) 20110829.2647). For a discussion of leptospirosis, please
see ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - India: (KA,KL) 20110709.2079.

Gujarat has an agricultural economy; the total crop area amounts to
more than one-half of the total land area
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat#Agriculture).

Leptospirosis is also known as canecutter's disease or sugar cane
fever, because of the spread of the disease by canefield rats, which
would likely be facilitated in flooded cane fields during the monsoon
season. The rainy summer monsoon season begins in Gujarat in late June
and lasts until the end of September, with flooding every year
(http://www.mapsofindia.com/surat/flood.html).
