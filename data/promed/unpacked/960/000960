[This is the 2nd case of anthrax in the East-Kazakhstan region in
2005. In July an anthrax case was registered in a resident of the
Ajagozsky district of the East-Kazakhstan region, which is the
largest industrial, power, transport, and cultural region of the
Republic of Kazakhstan. It is located in the northeast, at the source
of the Irtysh river, and includes the Kazakhstan part of Altay. On
the north it borders the Altay region of Russia; in the east and
southeast, China. The population is 1 455 400. The administrative
centre is Ust-Kamenogorsk, with 294 500 inhabitants. - Russian

[Unfortunately, in spite of the hard work to control this disease,
there is a constant drumbeat of cases. - Mod.MHJ]
