The positive identification of Ovine Johnes Disease (OJD) in a Cashmere
goat in Western Australia (WA) is thought to have originated from a
University research station.
A link has been made to the University of Western Australia's (UWA)
Agricultural Research Station at Allendale, where the buck was born in
August 1995.
Dr John Milton, from the UWA's Faculty of Agriculture, says Allendale has
been under quarantine for the past 2 months.
"Allendale Farm, the UWA animal science facilities, are currently in
quarantine and are co-operating with the agriculture department in full
co-operation to investigate where the origin of the disease was and how
much it may possibility have been spread," he said.
Allendale is 1 of 6 properties under quarantine. Authorities have decided
to eradicate OJD by destocking and then be able to say WA's area freedom
status from the disease remains in place

[Ovine Johnes Disease is a misnomer. Johnes Disease can be found in bovine
and ovines and apparently in caprines as well. However, the proper name is
Johnes Disease. - Mod.TG

The Australian Beef Association (ABA) has called on the Federal Government
to set up a Royal Commission to investigate the handling of Johnes Disease.
Association chairman, John Carter, says sheep and cattle producers have
suffered because of the mismanagement of the wasting disease. He's also
accused the Department of Agriculture staff in Victoria and New South Wales
of persecuting producers whose stock have tested positive.
