After the death of a 6-year-old girl in Hamburg, new EHEC cases are reported from Germany. Earlier this week, 2 children, a brother (11 years old) and sister (3 years old), were found to be positive. The boy went to a school next to the school of the diseased girl. The school is closed for 2 days because of disinfection.

Today, 29 Feb 2012, lab tests confirmed 2 more cases in Hamburg: 2 elderly women (aged 68 and 88).

This is not a renewed outbreak of the strain which circulated last year [2011] (O104:H4). It is another strain: O157 according to Artze Zeitung, probably _E. coli_ O157:H7.

[It is not stated that all the strains had the same genotype, i.e., were related to the same outbreak. It is clear that the organism seems unrelated to the huge O104:H4 outbreak centered in Germany in 2011. We await more information regarding the potential vehicle or vehicles for these cases and whether the clusters are related. - Mod.LL]
