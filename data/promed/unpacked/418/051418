ref: Chen GL, Coates EE, Plummer SH, et al. Effect of a chikungunya virus-like particle vaccine on safety and tolerability outcomes: a randomized clinical trial. JAMA. 2020; 323(14): 1369‐1377. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2477
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: What is the safety and tolerability of a chikungunya virus-like particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP) in a chikungunya endemic area?
Findings: In this randomized clinical trial that included 400 healthy adults in 6 Caribbean sites, CHIKV VLP compared with placebo did not result in a significantly increased risk of clinically important adverse events.
Meaning: In this phase 2 trial, a chikungunya virus-like particle vaccine appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, supporting a phase 3 trial.

Abstract
--------
Importance
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne _Alphavirus_ prevalent worldwide. There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapies.

Objective
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational CHIKV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine in endemic regions.

Design, setting, and participants
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 clinical trial to assess the vaccine VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP (CHIKV VLP). The trial was conducted at 6 outpatient clinical research sites located in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Puerto Rico. A total of 400 healthy adults aged 18 through 60 years were enrolled after meeting eligibility criteria. The 1st study enrollment occurred on 18 Nov 2015; the final study visit, 6 Mar 2018.

Interventions
Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 2 intramuscular injections 28 days apart (20 mcg, n = 201) or placebo (n = 199) and were followed up for 72 weeks.

Main outcomes and measures
The primary outcome was the safety (laboratory parameters, adverse events, and CHIKV infection) and tolerability (local and systemic reactogenicity) of the vaccine, and the secondary outcome was immune response by neutralization assay 4 weeks after 2nd vaccination.

Results
Of the 400 randomized participants (mean age, 35 years; 199 [50%] women), 393 (98%) completed the primary safety analysis. All injections were well tolerated. Of the 16 serious adverse events unrelated to the study drugs, 4 (25%) occurred among 4 patients in the vaccine group and 12 (75%) occurred among 11 patients in the placebo group. Of the 16 mild to moderate unsolicited adverse events that were potentially related to the drug, 12 (75%) occurred among 8 patients in the vaccine group and 4 (25%) occurred among 3 patients in the placebo group. All potentially related adverse events resolved without clinical sequelae. At baseline, there was no significant difference between the effective concentration (EC50) -- which is the dilution of sera that inhibits 50% infection in viral neutralization assay -- geometric mean titers (GMTs) of neutralizing antibodies of the vaccine group (46; 95% CI, 34-63) and the placebo group (43; 95% CI, 32-57). During 8 weeks following the 1st administration, the EC50 GMT in the vaccine group was 2005 (95% CI, 1680-2392) vs 43 (95% CI, 32-58; P less than .001) in the placebo group. Durability of the immune response was demonstrated through 72 weeks after vaccination.

Conclusions and relevance
Among healthy adults in a chikungunya endemic population, a virus-like particle vaccine compared with placebo demonstrated safety and tolerability. Phase 3 trials are needed to assess clinical efficacy.

[Outbreaks of chikungunya virus disease have been severe in many countries, most recently in the tropical Americas. Infection can lead to debilitating arthritis that can last for months or years.

The results of this phase 2 trial indicated that the vaccine candidate was well tolerated. Also important was the development of neutralizing antibodies at weeks 8 and 72. One hopes that the vaccine will enter into phase 3 clinical trials. - Mod.TY]
