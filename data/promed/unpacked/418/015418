A local school nurse contacted the health department about an unusual number of children out with pneumonia. That is enough for the Health Department to start investigating. The Central Virginia Health District says they have 15 cases identified and are investigating what is causing the outbreak.

This time of year, influenza can cause pneumonia, but epidemiologist Haley Evans says these cases aren't linked to the flu. "There are multiple causes of pneumonia -- bacterial or viral pneumonia -- but we have not been able to narrow it down," said Evans.

She says anyone who is having shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or anyone with a high fever should seek medical attention immediately. The Department of Health is working with Campbell County schools and community to investigate. The health department sent testing kits to select medical offices to collect samples. Those samples will be sent to the health department to be tested at the state lab.

Evans says it's hard to say how to avoid this type of pneumonia because they don't know what's causing it yet, but she suggests frequent hand washing, good nutrition, and plenty of rest; kids and adults need to stay home when sick with fever and sneeze or cough into an elbow rather than hand.

[The news report above fails to provide sufficient information to order to speculate on the possible causes of the pneumonia outbreak, except that it is occurring in the U.S. state of Virginia in the fall season in schoolchildren, although their ages are not specified. The microbial etiologies of pneumonia in childhood are numerous and vary to some extent by the age of the children involved, the season of the year, and the geographic location. The newswire reports that it is not influenza but fails to say how this conclusion was reached.

Causes of pneumonia during the summer-fall months in schoolchildren include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738272/), adenoviruses (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/5/619.short), and enteroviruses (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6038a1.htm); pneumonia due to most other bacteria and viruses occurs during the rest of the year.

Further information on the clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
