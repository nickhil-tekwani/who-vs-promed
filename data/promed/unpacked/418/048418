The ongoing measles outbreak in Romania has infected 3446 people by 10 March this year [2017], killing 17 children, according to data from the National Institute of Public Health, cited by local Agerpres.

Up to 5 of the 17 children killed by this disease were from Arad county, 4 were from Timis county, 6 were from Dolj and Caras Severin counties, 1 from Satu Mare county, and 1 from Bucharest. Measles cases were registered in 37 of Romania's 41 counties.

In Dolj county, 175 cases of measles have been registered since the outbreak started in June 2016. Moreover, the disease has killed 3 un-vaccinated children there. However, on the good side, the number of measles cases is on a downward trend, according to doctor Stefan Popescu, spokesman for the Public Health Department (DSP) Dolj.

Meanwhile, more than 530 cases of measles were confirmed in Timis county, with 4 children being killed by the disease since the outbreak started. In Brasov, there were 43 confirmed cases from 1 January 2016 to 17 February 2017, and no death.

Measles cases were also reported in counties such as Satu Mare, Alba, Suceava, Sibiu, Hunedoara, and Vaslui. The local authorities are currently conducting a vaccination campaign for children aged between 9 months and 9 years.

The measles outbreak in Romania is mainly the result of the anti-vaccination campaign that has drawn a lot of supporters among Romanian parents in recent years. Those who oppose vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella claim that the vaccine has serious side effects, and can even cause autism.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a total-body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and runny nose. According to information posted on the World Health Organization's website, the virus is highly contagious, spreading by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.

Nova Scotia Health officials are trying to track down people who may have been exposed to the measles virus from [Fri 10 Mar - Wed 15 Mar 2017].

A travel-related case of the virus has been identified and may be related to the locations and times [listed in the report at the URL above], the Nova Scotia health authority said in a news release [Mon 21 Mar 2017]

Symptoms of the measles include:
Fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, a red blotchy rash on the face, which spreads down the body sleepiness irritability (feeling cranky or in a bad mood) small white spots may also show up inside the mouth and throat.

Those who want to see a health-care provider such as a family doctor should call ahead. Special precautions must be taken to protect other patients from being exposed.

"Measles is a viral illness and most people fully recover within 2 -3 weeks," the health authority said. "However, measles can have serious complications, which are more likely in infants, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems."

Public Health has been directly notifying family members and friends who have had close contact with the travel-related case.

This case is not linked to the outbreak that affected 7 people in the province last month [February 2017].

The health authority noted that Nova Scotia residents born after 1970 are eligible to receive 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine at no cost through the publicly funded immunization program.

Nebraska and county health experts say a person with the measles exposed others to the disease in Douglas and Sarpy counties over a three-day period in mid-March [2017].

According to an alert by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, the measles case involved a passenger aboard a Delta Airlines flight from Minneapolis to Omaha on [Sun 12 Mar 2017].

The alert says all of those exposed to the person have been notified. The exposures took place in locations [that can be found in the full report at the URL above].

"If people visited one of the locations and comes down with a fever and a rash, they should see a health care provider," said Dr Tom Safranek, State Epidemiologist for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

Health care providers are advised to report any rash or fever illnesses with exposures to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

Incubation period time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually around 14 days.

Measles starts with fever, sore throat, cough, runny nose and red eyes. A full-body rash follows those symptoms, which can take 2 weeks to develop. Measles is highly contagious and spreads through sneezing and coughing. The CDC urges you to make sure you and your children get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Health authorities have urged the public to be on alert for measles symptoms after 2 children and a young woman contracted the highly infectious disease and spent time in western Sydney.

The 2 children, a boy and a girl, and woman in her 20's had not been vaccinated against the measles, and were infectious while visiting several public places in Auburn and Chester Hill between 16 - 23 March, NSW [New South Wales] Health advised on [Fri 24 Mar 2017].

See full report at URL above to identify locations visited.

It is likely the 2 children and woman contracted the disease from another recently reported case, but this has not been confirmed, NSW Health said.

The most recent case in Sydney involved an infectious person who travelled from Bangkok to Sydney on [Thu 2 Mar 2017].

"Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease," Dr Shopna Bag, Manager of Communicable Diseases at Western Sydney Public Health Unit.

Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.

Dr Bag said people with measles symptoms should seek medical advice as soon as possible, stay home from work or school, and limit other activities to avoid exposing other vulnerable people, such as infants, to the infection.

"Please call ahead to your doctor or emergency department so that arrangements can be made to keep you away from others to minimize the risk of spreading the infection," she said.

Over the past 5 years, NSW Health said the number of people bringing measles into the state from outside the country had varied between 2 and 28 cases a year. The total number of reported cases of measles in NSW has ranged between 9 and 174.

"Due to high immunization rates and effective public health action the disease has been eliminated from Australia with limited onward spread from cases occurring in connection with importations," Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of communicable diseases for NSW Health said earlier this month [March 2017].

The disease is no longer seasonal in Australia, NSW Health said.

Dr Bag said the latest cases yet again reinforced the importance of getting vaccinated to protect against the disease. "Those people who have not received 2 doses of measles vaccine are at particular risk of contracting the disease and should be alert to symptoms."

NSW Health said anyone born during or since 1966 should have 2 doses of vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. For young children, the vaccine is recommended at 12 months and 18 months of age.

http://lenews.ch/2017/03/24/young-man-dies-of-measles-in-switzerland/


"This is a tragic but fortunately rare case in Switzerland" Daniel Koch, of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) told the Tages-Anzeiger this morning, regarding the death of a young man in January [2017]. This is the 1st measles death in Switzerland since 2009 when a 12-year-old girl died in Geneva.

The FOPH did not want to go into the details, but said that the patient also had leukaemia. He eventually died of lung failure and his immune system had been seriously weakened by the treatment he was receiving, which meant the measles vaccination he received was less effective.

"We don't know where he caught the illness" said Daniel Koch, alluding to the importance of eradicating the disease in Switzerland.

In 2016, 70 cases were recorded. In 2015, the number was 36, and in 2014, it was even lower at 22. Several Swiss cantons have seen the disease spread said the FOPH at the beginning of February [2017]. Cases have been reported in Ticino, Graubunden, Fribourg, Solothurn, St. Gallen and Zurich. Several cases were reported over the school holidays. The risk of spread increases when people are mobile.

Despite rising rates of measles, rates of vaccination are increasing in Switzerland. Data from 8 cantons show that in 2014 on average 93 percent of 2-year-olds had received the measles vaccine, and 83 percent had received 2 doses.

Daniel Koch told the Tages-Anzeiger that the number of vaccinated young adults rose from 10 percent to 87 percent between 2012 and 2015, something he is very pleased about.

[6] Vaccine exemption policy
Date: Tue 21 Mar 2017
Source: Eureka Alert [edited]
https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/uoca-scl032117.php


States with weaker non-medical exemption policies for vaccinations can reduce the likelihood of a measles outbreak 140 -- 190 percent by strengthening them, a new study from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus shows.

Researchers said the magnitude of those outbreaks can also be cut in half by strengthening exemption policies for children.

"In the year 2000 measles was no longer being transmitted in the U.S.," said the study's lead author Melanie Whittington, PhD, a health services researcher. "Compare that to 2015 when we had over 150 cases in the 1st 3 months. Suddenly measles is an issue again despite having an effective vaccine."

Whittington and her colleagues, including the study's senior author Jonathan Campbell, PhD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the CU Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, wanted to find out why.

Using mathematical models, they simulated the magnitude, likelihood and cost of a measles outbreak under different non-medical vaccine exemption policies.

Every state has such policies. Those with "easy" exemption policies typically only require a parent signature on a standardized form. States with "medium" exemption policies require parents to obtain a form from a health department and/or attend an educational session on vaccinations, or write a statement of objection. Finally, states with "difficult" exemption policies require parents to get a standardized form or statement of objection notarized.

The researchers, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Immunization Study, found easier non-medical vaccine exemption policies to be associated with a greater risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

The state they modeled was Colorado, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates for measles. Only 87.4 percent of children between the ages of 19--35 months are covered. And 5 percent of kindergartners report an exemption.

"We modeled an environment where the population had low vaccination coverage and then simulated measles outbreaks under different exemption policies," said Whittington. "We found that a state like Colorado is 140 -- 190 percent more likely to experience an outbreak with an easy exemption policy than if it had a medium or difficult non-medical exemption policy. The outbreak size can also be reduced nearly by half with stronger policies."

While the researchers focused on measles, strengthening exemption policies could benefit other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as mumps.

"There is a tradeoff here," said Campbell, who specializes in pharmaceutical outcomes research. "It's a trade between freedom and risk. Are we willing to give up a small piece of freedom that nudges us toward vaccination in order to halve the risk of a detrimental outbreak of a preventable disease? I think Colorado should be willing to make that trade."

The researchers urged the strengthening of non-medical exemption policies as a way to increase vaccination coverage.

"We are not saying you can't have non-medical exemptions," Campbell and Whittington said. "But if we strengthen them, we can improve health and reduce the economic impact of a potential outbreak."

[Public health focuses on the wellbeing of the population and consequently may come into conflict with the interests of each individual. With vaccine preventable diseases, this conflict of interest has become all too common. Individuals may need to sacrifice a little freedom of choice to meet the needs of the greater good. The approach to decrease the size of outbreaks of measles suggested in this report, i.e., by making request for an exemption more labor-intensive, could be successful unless parents are adamantly opposed to the practice of vaccination. In that case, education is the best path to effect a change so parents understand the consequences of refusal to vaccinate. - Mod.LK]
