Last week [week of 11 Oct 2012], the state Department of Agriculture confirmed the 1st case of CWD in Pennsylvania in a captive deer on a deer farm in Adams County. The disease is fatal in deer, elk, and moose, but there is no evidence that CWD can be transmitted to humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.

"While CWD has not been found in wild deer, we will continue to be vigilant and initiate steps included in the Commonwealth's CWD Response Plan, which has been updated annually since its development in 2005, and calls for the agency to hold a public meeting," said Carl G Roe, Game Commission executive director. "We will identify a disease management area (DMA), and specify the monitoring efforts we will put in place within the DMA to determine if CWD has spread from the captive deer populations into surrounding wild deer populations.

"We are hopeful that this disease has been identified early enough and that we can take steps to contain the disease to these specific deer farms. However, we are at the beginning of a process that will last at least 5 years."

The Game Commission is developing a DMA map and executive order delineating the where and what monitoring efforts will be undertaken for this hunting season. Both will be released as soon as they are finalized.

On 11 Oct 2012 the Department of Agriculture announced that the positive sample was taken from a captive-born and raised white-tailed deer from New Chester Rd., New Oxford, and tested as part of Pennsylvania's intensive CWD monitoring efforts. The sample tissue was tested at the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory in Harrisburg and verified at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

In addition to the Adams County location, the Department of Agriculture has quarantined 2 farms directly associated with the positive deer; they are on Jacks Hollow Rd, Williamsport, Lycoming County, and on Pickett Rd, Dover, York County. The quarantine prevents movement of animals on and off the premises.

Roe noted that, since 1998, the Game Commission has gathered and submitted more than 38 000 samples from wild deer and elk for CWD testing, and all results have been negative.

[Interesting assessment. The commission is treating this occurrence as a contagious/infectious disease. This disease seems to be transmitted by a twisted protein particle known as a prion. But it does not function as a normal contagious/infectious disease such as a viral or bacterial disease. The statement: "We are hopeful that this disease has been identified early enough and that we can take steps to contain the disease to these specific deer farms" provides the insight that it appears they are treating it as an infectious diseases. It will be interesting to see their plan.
