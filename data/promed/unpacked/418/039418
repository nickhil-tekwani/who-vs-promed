BABOONS, SAFETY IN XENOTRANSPLANTATION: REQUEST FOR INFO
********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Sat, 21 Feb 1998 17:49:34 +0300
From: Giuseppe Botta <giuseppe@ns1.agu.edu.bh>

We are planning to evaluate baboons for possible xenotransplantations. I
would like to have suggestions about which pathogens transmissible to
humans can be present and which can be looked for. I am referring mostly to
retrovirus, herpesviruses and hepatitis viruses. [Also,] what about yellow
fever and Ebola? Are tests available?
Can someone help me to retrieve CDC guidelines?
