Authorities in a rural area of Honduras have vaccinated about 2,000 horses
since 7 August. The major concern is that the equine encephalitis outbreak
will spread to humans. Thus far, 25 horses have died [of the disease.
According to official reports, the disease does not appear to have spread
to humans. Residents of the region say otherwise.
The high human and equid mortality rate mentioned in the article suggests
they suspect Venezuelan equine encephalitis.

[This sounds like Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Coupled with the
report of VEE in Colombia, there is a possibility we are seeing the
beginning of a regional pandemic. However, without knowing the specific
VEE virus type, subtype, and variety causing the Colombian and Honduran
outbreaks (if it is VEE) and whether they are being caused by the same
virus, it is impossible to say. - Mods.JW/CHC
