Nepal in historic introduction of the injectable Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IPV will help secure a world free of all polio disease

In a landmark step to accelerate the global eradication of polio and help prevent a resurgence of the disease, Nepal is today introducing the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) into its routine immunization programme. Nepal has the distinction of being the 1st country in South Asia region to launch IPV as part of the global roll-out of the vaccine.

Until now, oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been the primary tool in the global polio eradication effort, reducing incidence of the disease by more than 99 percent worldwide thanks to its unique ability to stop person-to-person spread of the virus. Nepal, along with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste, was declared polio free last March [2014]. Endemic polio has been successfully eliminated from all but 3 countries worldwide [Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan - Mod.MPP].

Nepal has made tremendous progress in improving the health and survival of children in the last 25 years. The under-5 mortality rate has significantly reduced from 147 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 54 per 1000 in 2011. Also, the coverage of immunization against polio has doubled to 90 percent in 2011 from 44 percent in 1984. Thanks to the tireless efforts of community members and the Female Community Health Volunteers together with the Government and its partners WHO, UNICEF, Rotary and GAVI, Nepal has been able to achieve near universal immunization coverage.

Despite this progress, experts caution that polio-free countries remain at risk of re-infection until the disease has been eradicated everywhere. New evidence now demonstrates that adding one dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age to OPV is even more effective than OPV alone at stopping the virus and protecting children. IPV and OPV evoke different immune responses and when used together, maximize immunity to polio virus.

IPV is being introduced in Nepal in order to quickly maximize childhood immunity to polio and maintain the country's polio-free status. IPV has been proven an extremely safe and effective vaccine and has been used successfully in many developed countries for several decades. It is important to note that IPV is recommended in addition to the oral vaccine and does not replace the oral vaccine.

IPV is administered to children at 14 weeks of age by intramuscular injection by a trained health worker at established health facilities or immunization sessions. The Ministry of Health and Population has successfully conducted training for all heath workers in all 75 districts on successful IPV administration.

The universal introduction of IPV is part of the global plan to eradicate polio and secure the gains through stronger immunization systems, so that children, no matter where they are born, will never again suffer from this debilitating, preventable disease.

[This is very good news, as Nepal is starting the incorporation of IPV into the routine vaccination schedule, making it the 1st country in South Asia to do so. It should be noted that the IPV is being used as a booster following administration of OPV; and not replacing OPV. This is an exciting step forward towards implementation of the planned "end-game" for polio eradication with the introduction of IPV as the 1st step.

Nepal interrupted endemic transmission of WPV in 2000 and was WPV free through the end of 2004. Between 2005 and 2008 there were 20 cases reported, related to cross-border transmission. There were 0 cases reported in 2009, and 6 cases reported in 2010, related to 2 separate importations from Bihar state, India (one in February 2010, when a single case was confirmed in Mahottari District, the other a multi-case outbreak in Rautahat District -- both districts located on the border with India). The date of onset of the last confirmed case of WPV in Nepal is 30 Aug 2010. (see http://www.irinnews.org/report/92094/nepal-who-declares-country-polio-free-again, and Poliomyelitis - worldwide (25): importation related 20101104.3994).

[2] Belgium, WPV environmental spill - press release
Date: Fri 12 Sep 2014
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/belgium-live-polio-virus-solution-accidentally-released-into-local-water-59622/


On Tuesday, 2 Sep 2014, following a human error, 45 litres of concentrated live polio virus solution were released into the environment by the pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in Rixensart city [Walloon Brabant province], Belgium. The water from the treatment plant in question is not discharged to the supply network for drinking water, according to a press release last Friday [5 Sep 2014] (computer translated). [The original press release is available in French at https://www.wiv-isp.be/news/Pages/Liquidecontamin%C3%A9rejet%C3%A9parlesiteGSKdeRixensart.aspx. - Mod.MPP]

Belgian health authorities were directly involved at the request of the Minister of Public Health, and all necessary measures were taken as soon as they were notified of the situation. The Scientific Institute of Public Health and the Supreme Council of Health have conducted a risk analysis and confirm that there is no public health risk for the population.

The risk assessment concludes that from the junction of river Lasne with the river Dyle the dilution of the virus in the river water brings the risk to negligible. As a precaution, a booster dose of polio vaccine was recommended to persons who have been in contact with the water of river Lasne from [2 Sep 2014] until the date when the precautionary measures will be lifted.

In addition, samples of mud and water from the treatment plant of Rosieres, Lasne and Dyle were taken Saturday [6 Sep 2014] to allow time to evaluate the persistence of the virus. The testing of these samples are negative: no presence of polio virus was detected, according to the Federal Public Service (FPS) Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment in Belgium (computer translated).

Accidental release of 45 litres of concentrated live polio virus solution into the environment -- Belgium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opening date: [10 Sep 2014]
Latest update: [11 Sep 2014]

Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
On [2 Sep 2014], following a human error, 45 litres of concentrated live polio virus solution were released into the environment by the pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in Rixensart city, Belgium. The estimated viral rejection of live virus Saukett (Salk) serotype 3 was of 10 to the 13th, cell culture infectious dose 50 percent (CCID 50). The liquid was conducted directly to a water-treatment plant (Rosieres) and released after treatment in river Lasne, affluent of river Dyle, which is affluent of the Escaut/Scheldt river.

After being informed by GSK, the High Council of Public Health (HCPH) conducted a risk assessment that concluded that the risk of infection for the population exposed to the contaminated water is extremely low due to the high level of dilution and the high vaccination coverage (95 percent) in Belgium. The risk was estimated higher for the personnel of the water-treatment plant so they received medical assistance/examination and polio vaccination. In addition, their risk assessment concludes that from the junction of river Lasne with the river Dyle the dilution of the virus in the river water brings the risk to negligible. As a precaution, a booster dose of polio vaccine was recommended to persons who have been in contact with the water of river Lasne from [2 Sep 2014] until the date when the precautionary measures will be lifted.

Measures taken by the local health authorities include the molecular (PCR) testing of environmental samples from river water and sludge, informing the population through a press release on [5 Sep 2014] and activation of a call centre at the Ministry of Health for the general public, notification of the general practitioners and relevant local health authorities through a letter sent by HCPH with recommendations. Relevant corrective measures are to be taken by GSK under the control of public authorities.

On [8 Sep 2014], the Federal Public Service (FPS) Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment in Belgium confirmed that samples of mud and water taken from the Rosieres treatment plant, river Lasne and river Dyle, all tested negative for the presence of polio virus.

ECDC assessment
---------------
The accidental release in the environment of large amounts of live polio virus represents a risk to public health in case susceptible populations are exposed to contaminated waters or mud. The contamination of the rivers depends upon the effectiveness of the treatment in the Rosiere treatment plan to prevent viruses from being released. The Lasne and Dyle rivers are joining the Escaut/Scheldt river, which flows in the southwestern part of the Netherlands where various orthodox protestant communities present a lower polio vaccination coverage, before reaching the North Sea.

[The ECDC assessment highlights the analysis of the situation. Given the high vaccination coverages reported in Belgium (95 percent), combined with the dilutional effects of the rivers, will markedly reduce the actual risk to the population, keeping in mind that unvaccinated individuals should avoid contact with the water from the affected rivers.

The real potential threat is the course of the river, going through parts of the Netherlands where there are religious groups that refuse vaccination based on religious beliefs. Since 1971, there have been 3 large polio outbreaks in the Netherlands -- one in 1971, 1978 and 1992-1993. The latter 2 (1978 and 1992-1993) were among the conservative religious group that refused vaccinations. So exposure of people from this group to the WPV in the rivers can potentially result in cases of WPV in this group of susceptibles (see Conyn-van Spaendonck MAE, de Melker HE, Abbink F, Elzinga-Gholizadea N, Kimman TG, Ton van Loon T. Immunity to Poliomyelitis in the Netherlands Am. J. Epidemiol. (2001) 153 (3): 207-214, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/153/3/207.full.pdf+html). Unfortunately, survival of the WPV in the environment in colder climates may be as long as several months for temperatures between 0-8 C. Hopefully this discussion will remain as theoretical and there will not be resultant cases of WPV disease among the unvaccinated segments of the population along the river.

A map showing the route of the Escaut/Scheldt river can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheldt. Its trajectory from France, through Belgium, and into the Netherlands before emptying in the North Sea can be seen on this map. - Mod.MPP]

Data in WHO as of 10 Sep 2013 for 2013 data and 9 Sep 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- More than 650 000 individuals (more than 370 000 below 5 years) have been vaccinated from [21 May to 4 Sep 2014] in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan. Most of those reached are internally displaced persons from North Waziristan. In Nigeria, 97 percent of surveyed Local Government Areas achieved over 80 percent coverage during the August [2014] polio immunization round, according to preliminary findings from the most recent Lot Quality Assurance Sampling. Protecting west Africa: Even as polio programme staff across west Africa support efforts to control the Ebola outbreak affecting the region, preparations are going ahead for large scale multi-country vaccination campaigns in those countries not affected by Ebola, in mid-September [2014].

- A new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported in Somalia. Planning for an increased focus on reaching pastoral communities has begun, using innovative techniques such as satellite imagery for micro-planning.

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2014 remains 8. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [17 Jun 2014], from Khost province (linked to virus circulating in adjacent North Waziristan, Pakistan).
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week.
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) are being held [10-12 Sep 2014], in Helmand Province, and [21-23 Sep 2014] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). The next National Immunization Day (NID) is [19-21 Oct 2014].
- Polio vaccination activities resumed in August [2014] in parts of Helmand Province in the Southern Region of Afghanistan for the 1st time in 5 months. Since then, 2 campaigns have been done. The upcoming [21-23 Sep 2014] activity will cover the entire province using bivalent OPV.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. Nigeria's total case count for 2014 is now 6. The most recent case, which had onset of paralysis in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano on [24 Jul 2014], was the 2nd to be reported in the LGA this year [2014].
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 19. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2014], also in Kano.
- The next subnational immunization days (SNIDs) are planned for [20-23 Sep 2014] using bivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- 21 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Of these, 17 are from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) (2 from North Waziristan, 4 from South Waziristan and 11 from Khyber agency) and 4 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (1 from Tank (the 1st case from this district for 2014), 2 from Bannu, and 1 from Lakki Marwat). This brings the total number of polio cases in 2014 to 138 compared to 28 in 2013 by this date. The most recent onset of paralysis was on [24 Aug 2014] in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- The high number of WPV1 cases reported this week are due to a backlog in the laboratory, and represents a period of onset from [20 Jul to 24 Aug 2014].
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The latest case was in FR Bannu, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), with onset of paralysis on [27 May 2014]. The country has reported 18 cases of cVDPV2 in 2014.
- Immunization activities are continuing with particular focus on known high-risk areas, in particular the newly opened areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At exit points, 182 permanent vaccination points are being used to reach internally displaced persons.

Central Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. In 2014, 10 cases have been reported in central Africa: 5 in Cameroon and 5 in Equatorial Guinea.
- The outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR).
- Upcoming sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) on [12-14 Sep 2014] in the Central African Republic will be held using bivalent OPV. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Cameroon, using bivalent OPV, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, using trivalent OPV, on [18-21 Sep 2014]. On [19-21 Sep 2014], there will be NIDs in Congo and Equatorial Guinea, both using bivalent OPV, and SNIDs in Chad, using trivalent OPV. Angola is planning National Child Health Days, using trivalent OPV, on [22 Sep-5 Oct 2014], and in there will be NIDs in Gabon, using bivalent OPV, on [22-26 Sep 2014].

Horn of Africa
- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported in the past week in Somalia, the 1st case to be found in the Hobyo district of Mudug province. Onset of paralysis was on [11 Aug 2014]. This brings the total number of cases that have been reported in the Horn of Africa to date in 2014 to 6: one in Ethiopia (date of onset of paralysis on [14 Jan 2014]) and 5 in Somalia.
- Activities are being initiated to address the spread of WPV-1 in Somalia, with an increased focus on accessing pastoral communities, using satellite imagery for micro-planning.
- An outbreak response assessment will be carried out from [23 Sep 2014] by a team of interagency international experts.
- Immunization campaigns are planned in Yemen using trivalent OPV and in Ethiopia starting [13 Sep 2014] and Somalia starting [27 Sep 2014] using bivalent OPV.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) is not being detected in environmental samples in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent months; the most recent positive sample was collected in southern Israel on [30 Mar 2014]. Environmental samples collected since April [2014] have been negative.

Middle East
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. 3 cases of WPV1 have been reported in the Middle East in 2014 -- 2 in Iraq and 1 in Syria. The most recent case reported from Iraq occurred in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, with onset of paralysis on [7 Apr 2014]. Syria's most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014].
- Immunization campaigns are planned for [14-18 Sep 2014] in Iraq using bivalent OPV. Activities are planned in Lebanon in September [2014] with dates to be confirmed. National campaigns are planned in Syria, using bivalent OPV, and Jordan and Iraq, using trivalent OPV, on [19-23 Oct 2014], and subnational activities in Turkey [13-19 Oct 2014] using bivalent OPV. Dates are still to be confirmed for October [2014] campaigns in Egypt, Lebanon, and the West Bank and Gaza.
- On [6-7 Sep 2014], WHO and UNICEF carried out a review of Phase II of the outbreak response in the Middle East. Necessary tactical adjustments will be made according to the outcome of this review.

West Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in West Africa in 2014. The most recent WPV1 case in the region occurred in Tahoua province, Niger, with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived polio virus (cVDPV) were reported this week. The only case of cVDPV reported this year [2014] was reported in Niger on [11 Jul 2013].
- Even as polio programme staff across West Africa support efforts to control the Ebola outbreak affecting the region, preparations are going ahead for large scale multi-country vaccination campaigns in those countries not affected by Ebola, in mid-September [2014].
- A trivalent OPV campaign is planned for the entire region, in Mali on [19-22 Sep 2014] and in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo on [20-23 Sep 2014].
