Bat bite sparks health warning
------------------------------
A Muswellbrook woman is being treated for [Australian] bat lyssavirus
infection after she was attacked by a bat in the courtyard of her
Brooke Street home last week [11 Mar 2009]. The woman will undergo 5
injections over a 28 day period, the standard treatment for a patient
who has been scratched or bitten by a bat. All the time she has been
thinking of her friends in Singleton who are more likely to come into
contact with the flying foxes that could carry the disease.

She said it was around midnight on 11 Mar 2009 when she heard the
bark of a dog she was caring for. When she went to check why JD the
Chihuahua was making such a fuss, she was shocked to see him barking
and jumping at a bat on the ground. "I was worried something would
happen to JD and was screaming at him to get away from it," she said.
Mrs. Jones then turned and went to head back up the steps of her
patio when she felt another bat land on her head. Amid her screams
and frantic attempts to get the bat out of her hair, the original bat
that had been wrestling with the dog, managed to fly onto her back.
Mrs. Jones said it seemed like 5 minutes before she could get the
bats off her body. She ran inside and phoned a friend and sought
medical attention for the scratches she had received. "I had a big
scratch where a claw ripped open my skin on my arm and a puncture
mark on my head where one of the bats bit me."

She is angry for what she has been through but is now on a campaign
to make sure people know of the health risks associated with flying
foxes. "I think people need to know that they can carry this deadly
virus and if they are bitten or scratched by a bat, they should head
straight to their doctor," Mrs. Jones said. She has since had the
fruit removed from the 30 foot date palm that was the catalyst for
her bat visits and certainly doesn't intend venturing outdoors at
midnight again.

The virus species _Australian bat lyssavirus_ was identified during
1996 in 2 species of bats in Australia. The 2 species are the Black
Flying Fox (_Pteropus alecto_) and the Little red Flying Fox
(_Pteropus scapulatus_). In November 1996, a woman in Queensland
developed encephalitis, probably due to the virus, after being bitten
and scratched by bats.

The genus _Lyssavirus_ falls within the family _Rhabdoviridae_. There
were 6 genotypes [species] recognised within the genus. These include
the classic rabies virus, Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus, Duvenhage
virus and the 2 European bat lyssaviruses. These viruses had not
previously been reported to occur in Australia. The newly identified
7th lyssavirus is closely related to, but is distinct from, classic
rabies virus. In laboratory animals, rabies vaccine and rabies
immunoglobulin are protective against this new lyssavirus.

Non-rabies lyssaviruses usually do not spread among terrestrial
animals and human infections are rare. The Australian bat lyssavirus
is currently known to infect fruit bats (flying foxes) and humans.
Insectivorous bats are known to carry other lyssaviruses overseas and
therefore cannot be discounted as a potenital risk, at this stage.

Rabies virus and other lyssaviruses are usually transmitted to humans
via bites or scratches which provide direct access of the virus in
saliva to exposed tissue and nerve endings. This means that most
people would not be exposed to Lyssavirus through casual contact with
bats. As the Australian bat lyssavirus is closely related to classic
rabies virus, infection may be prevented by rabies vaccine and rabies
immunoglobulin.

It is not clear from the text of the above press report whether it
has been established that the bats involved were carriers of
Australian bat lyssavirus. - Mod.CP]
