Cold weather hits livestock in coastal areas
--------------------------------------------
The recent cold wave has badly affected the livestock-holders in Sindh,
mostly in coastal areas where majority of the families are fully dependant
on camels and livestock. The information gathered by The News through
herdsmen and veterinary officials from different areas reveal that the
animals are infected with a number of diseases as a result of cold weather,
which has caused death to the young of these animals.

A camel herder from Shah Bunder, Thatta said that at least 36 camels have
died in 15 days in the area due to cold weather. He said that the community
people in Shah Bunder have more than 800 camels and they traditionally keep
camels in hundreds as it is the source of income for them. But they fear
more loss as the animals are hit by harsh weather and diseases. He claims
to have approached the concerned government officials and veterinary
practitioners, but they could not visit the area to examine the livestock
and animals.

Dr Mohan Lal, veterinary doctor practicing in Korangi Cattle Farm, Karachi,
said that the animals might be infected with a common seasonal disease
called pleuropneumonia, which afflicts the lungs of cattle, camels, and
other animals. He said that it depends on the conditions. Mostly it does
not cause immediate death of the animals. But sometimes, it hits the entire
herd. About the impacts of the recent cold wave, he said, it may intensify
the disease, which could affect small animals instantly.

Dr Mubatrak Jatoi, veterinary official in Hyderabad said that the animals
are dying due to the effect of climate change and asked the herdsmen to
take their animals to nearby veterinary practitioners immediately to avoid
any further loss of animals.

[The information above, coming mainly from the coastal areas of Sindh,
relates to a disease condition in camels which seems to be much milder and
probably seasonal; a much more serious but similarly undiagnosed disease
syndrome has been reported since the end of November 2010 from the arid
areas of Cholistan, Punjab, in eastern Pakistan (see ProMED-mail
20110105.0051 and 20110106.0073).

We are informed that an officially delegated veterinary team has visited
the affected Punjab districts (Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, and Rahim Yar
Khan) between 6-9 Jan 2011, conducted "semi-structured interviews" (a
'participatory veterinary surveillance' tool) and collected samples for
further laboratory investigations, including swabs from nasal and ocular
discharge.

The main clinical signs were said to comprise fever, anorexia, ocular
discharge, bilateral blood tinged, sticky, mucopurulent nasal discharge
progressively occluding the nasal passage, and labored breathing. Abortions
were a clearly significant feature, occurring in the last trimester of
pregnancy, as well as occasional premature births. Noteworthy, abortions
have not been mentioned in earlier published information of the syndrome.
Earlier (December 2010) visits and laboratory examinations, produced a
bacteriological finding (_Pasteurella multocida_).

The significance _P. multocida_ as a possible primary causative agent of
the camel syndrome in Cholistan has yet to be established. Other possible
agents have been mentioned, including PPR (peste des petits ruminants)
virus (previously recorded in Sudan; see Dr Taylor's observation in
ProMED-mail 20110106.0073). The possible role of PPR (prevalent in
Pakistani small ruminants) in the camel disease, deserves to be examined;
the nasal and ocular swabs, sampled by the team, may make such examinations
feasible. Results are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
