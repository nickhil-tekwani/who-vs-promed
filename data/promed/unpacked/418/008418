In 2 years, the occurrence of pertussis in Piaui State increased from 3 in 2012 to 176 in 2014. In 2014, there have been 2 deaths, 1 of which was in Teresina and the other in Esperantina, where there were a total of 3 babies with pertussis and 1 died. According to the director of health surveillance of the Municipal Foundation of Health (FMS), Amariles Borba, pertussis is on the rise due to low efficacy of immunization of the vaccine.

The Ministry of Health has been attempting to deploy the vaccine for the entire population, but "there were difficulties in production to meet the demand of the Brazilian market," says the director. Another problem, according to Amariles, is poor adherence to the vaccination schedule.

The only preventive vaccination was the pentavalent against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, _Haemophilus influenza_ and hepatitis B. It is intended for babies of 2, 4 and 6 months, but 70 per cent of the cases affect newborns in the 1st 3 months. For this reason, the Ministry of Health has chosen to distribute the vaccine in the public health network, which was previously done on the private network and has urged vaccination of mothers late in pregnancy.

[This is the 4th state in Brazil about which ProMED-mail has posted reports of increases in pertussis in 2014. On ProMED-PORT, reports of outbreaks in 2 additional states have been posted.

Piaui (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piau%C3%AD) has the shortest coastline of any of the non-landlocked Brazilian states at 66 km (41 miles), and the capital, Teresina, is the only state capital in the north east to be located inland. The reason for this is, unlike the rest of the area, Piaui was 1st colonized inland and slowly expanded towards the ocean, rather than the other way around. The location of Piaui in the South American country of Brazil can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brazil_State_Piaui.svg. - Mod.LL
