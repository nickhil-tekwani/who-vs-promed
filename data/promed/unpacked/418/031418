Port Moresby: Hundreds of rural Fly River Delta villagers in Western
Province have been found to be infected by yaws, a curable disease which
was thought to have been eradicated in PNG in the 1950s. And a medical team
is now in the area assessing the alarming re-emergence of the disease in
the area.
The Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) has sent in medical supplies and assisted
government health officers treat 342 patients two weeks ago. Many people
are suffering from full-blown and advanced yaws. No deaths have been
reported. Men, women and children are affected. Many children were infected
through their mothers at birth. Some villagers have become blind, according
to reports from the area. OTML and provincial health officers first found
traces of the dreaded disease in June this year during a health survey.
Yaws is caused by a microscopic organism called _Treponema pallidum_
subspecies _pertenue_. It causes big ulcers on skin and affects bones and
joints in advanced chronic stages. The sexually transmitted disease
syphilis is caused by _Treponema pallidum_, which is a cousin of the
yaws-causing bacteria. Both are treatable by penicillin. Yaws thrives in
humid, tropical rural areas. It is passed on from cuts to other cuts or
from use of utensils.
