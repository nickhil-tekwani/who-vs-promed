Reports of animal rabies -- mostly infecting foxes -- continued to
increase, from an average of 8 cases a year from 2003-2005 to 18
cases in 2006 to 45 cases in 2007. All but one of the rabies cases
last year [2007] occurred in coastal regions of northern and
southwestern Alaska. Infected animals included 24 red foxes, 17
arctic wolves, 3 dogs and one wolf.

Rabies cases involving Alaska wildlife generally cycle up and down,
depending on the rise and fall of wildlife populations, the report
noted. The disease is always present in northern and western Alaska.
Most of the rest of Alaska has never had a confirmed case of rabies.

[The report of rabies in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) is particularly
interesting, because this species has extended its range well into
Alaska in areas where it was not present before, where arctic foxes occur (see
<http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/pubs/notebook/furbear/redfox.php>).
It will be interesting to see whether this range extension influences
the distribution, frequency and epizootiology of rabies in the state.
