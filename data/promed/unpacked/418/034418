The death toll in the yellow fever outbreak in the Savannah Region has risen to 14. The casualties comprise one male adult and 13 children.

Some 19 others are still on admission at the West Gonja Hospital from 2 districts in the Region. The affected districts, which include West and North Gonja Municipal and Districts, respectively, also recorded 65 cases.

In an interview with JoyNews, the Savannah Regional Director of Ghana Health Services, Dr. Chrysantus Kuubio said there is no need for any panic situation from the public as the situation is currently under control. He added, "We have so far suspected 65 cases and 14 deaths, and 7 of these deaths have been recorded in West Gonja Municipal and the other 7 too from the North Gonja District."

"And the initial communication has been 8 deaths, but surveillance is such that we visit these communities where we have these reported cases and also check to see if there are deaths that have not been reported at the facility," Dr. Kuubio stated. Larabanga, Logto, Canteen, Kamakura, Sori no. 1 and no. 5 are among the affected communities.

Dr. Chrysantus Kuubio continued, "But the essence is to visit these communities and identify the cases early so that we can start the intervention. Most of the initial deaths we had is as a delay in reporting to the facility and that's why we are now key in search for the cases and also to start with the intervention," he said.

According to the Regional Director, "All those affected communities, mitigation vaccination exercise is ongoing, and the case search is also ongoing." He said the directorate has detailed enough medical teams to the various vaccination centres in the 2 affected districts and communities including 16 others in West Gonja Municipal.

"We don't want the situation where we are concentrating the vaccines at places that are not affected. So, we are getting centres in each of these affected communities and those who haven't who received the vaccines and give them to them.

"There's no cause for alarm because the concern was that once they are on admission here, and their caretakers are also here, that's why we are targeting here (hospital) to get them vaccinated and also send our teams to each of those communities and those that are not reached, we will send additional teams there," the medical doctor insisted.

At the West Gonja Hospital, the Medical Director, Dr. Jonathan Wadeyir Absig, confirmed to JoyNews concerning the 14 casualties and those still in critical condition and 10 recoveries. "Since the inception of these presumptive yellow fever cases, we have admitted 29. So far, 10 of them have been discharged and 19 still on admission and we still have 3 children who are in critical condition."

He noted that many of the patients were reporting late at the facility from the beginning that "they came here (hospital) with severe cases, but since we started with the education and going into the communities, they (patients) have started responding early.

"And that's even why you can even see some discharges..., the other cases we had, we had mitigations from the inception of the outbreak," Dr. Jonathan Absig insisted. "Now that the cases are coming in early, you don't see typical jaundice that yellow fever is known for. They come in with just high temperature then vomiting, and some of them who are a bit grown, complain of general body pains but of course, once the disease progresses, it gets to a point that they start urinating and blood oozing from the nose and a point too, you see that their eyes are yellow in color (jaundice)."

He also stated that clinical teams are on the ground with the support from the Regional Health Directorate and national level with the hospital doing its best with the brief training staff received from the central committee team.

[A 30 Oct 2021 report indicated that there were 8 suspected yellow fever (YF) deaths in Ghana (see Yellow fever - Africa (11): Ghana (SA) susp 20211101.8699385). In the opening sentence of the above report there is no indication if the 14 YF deaths are confirmed or suspected cases. It is reassuring to learn that the Ghana Regional Health Services are responding promptly by intensifying surveillance, initiating YF vaccination efforts in the affected areas and carrying out a public education campaign. This proactive effort is essential to keep the outbreak from getting out of hand, which can happen with yellow fever. - Mod.TY
