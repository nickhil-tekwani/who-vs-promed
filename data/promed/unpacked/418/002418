A disease dating to the late 1700s and carried by otherwise healthy sheep is responsible for the deaths of 2 bison at the Irvine Park Zoo [Chippewa County], a veterinarian said Friday [27 Sep 2013].

DNA of the disease, malignant catarrhal fever or MCF, was found in a sample taken from a bull bison that died last Saturday [21 Sep 2013], said Dr Wayne Griffin of the Chippewa Valley Veterinary Clinic.

Griffin has been in practice for 33 years. "This is the 1st confirmed case of MCF I've seen," he said at the press conference at the park with Dick Hebert, director of the Chippewa Falls Parks and Recreation Department.

Hebert said a 3rd bison that was thought to be sick is doing fine, and will continue to be watched. "We're hoping that animal will be OK," he said.

The disease cannot be transferred to humans, but animals with multi-chambered stomachs [ruminants] are vulnerable, and include cattle, bison, and whitetail deer.

The zoo's 6 sheep, that are otherwise healthy, will be shipped out of the zoo as soon as possible, Hebert said.

The sheep shared an area with the buffalo, separated by a fence. Griffin said it's [on] that fence [where] the sheep could have left nasal secretions or saliva that transmitted the disease to 2 of the parks' 9 bison.

Hebert said hard work put in by the zoo's staff, Dr Joel Mayberry and Dr Griffin of the veterinary clinic was responsible for tracking down what killed a male and female bison 20 and 21 Sep [2013].

"Today, there is no treatment or cure for MCF and no vaccine," the USDA said in an article "Battling bison's mysterious MCF disease." That article says MCF's cause is a virus of the] group of herpesvirus. The virus itself does not live long, but once transmitted to bison it can cause mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea and a high fever.

The Bison Producers of Alberta (Canada) said the disease is transmitted in Africa by wildebeest and by sheep in North America.

"All sheep should be presumed to be carriers of the OHV-2 virus. . . Generally lambs are born virus-free, but by 5 to 6 months, almost all of the lambs are carriers. This implies the lambs are infected through contact with the adult members of the flock," the Bison Producers of Alberta wrote about malignant catarrhal fever. The disease has an incubation period (time between exposure and clinical disease) of 7 to 25 weeks."

The organization adds: "Stress appears to play a significant role in the development of the disease. Stressed bison appear more likely to be affected. Clinical signs are usually of short duration, between 1-7 days, and the outcome is always fatal."

Hebert said the 6 Barbados sheep were brought to the park in May [2013].

Griffin said the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory should be given credit for running a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction test for MCF. "This is not a test that's run on a routine basis," he said.

Hebert said if the zoo decides to bring back sheep, those animals will not be put in an area with a shared fence line with bison or elk. Currently, the park has no [vulnerable] whitetail deer.

[Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a generalized, often fatal disease caused by a [number of] herpesviruses that infect a variety of ruminants. The clinical course of the disease in individual animals is very varied and it may be peracute, acute, chronic, or mild. In the acute form of the disease, the clinical signs are usually severe inflammation of the mucosae of the respiratory and alimentary tracts and conjunctivae, as well as eyes and skin. The lesions are accompanied by mucopurulent discharge.

MCF is caused by several herpesvirus strains: alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 of wildebeests, ovine herpesvirus 2 of domestic sheep, and caprine herpesvirus 2 and MCFV-WTD virus of goats. None of these viruses causes clinical disease in their natural hosts.
