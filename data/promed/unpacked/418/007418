An environmental emergency has been declared in towns in 2 Brazilian states
after a chemicals reservoir burst and contaminated 2 rivers.
The spillage occurred at a wood pulping factory at Cataguazes in Minas
Gerais state, and much of the toxic waste is running into neighboring Rio
de Janeiro state.
About 1.5 billion liters (396 million gallons) of caustic soda flowed into
the Paraiba do Sul and Pomba rivers, according to the Rio de Janeiro State
government website -- although other reports have estimated the spill
at 20 million liters (5.28 million gallons).
People living near the rivers have been warned not to drink or bathe in
river water, amid reports that 100 animals on the river banks have already
died, along with hundreds of fish. One Brazilian newspaper warned the
environment could take 10 years to recover.
The spillage occurred over the weekend and by Tuesday authorities were
scrambling resources to deal with the problem. Oil workers from the federal
oil company, Petrobras, were called in to help contain the spill, Ellen
Alves of the Minas Gerais state environmental authority said. She said
local governments have been drilling wells and sending water trucks into
the affected areas.
The spill was also affecting water supplies to the north of Rio de Janeiro
state.
On Tuesday, the company responsible was fined an immediate 50 million Reals
(US $15 million) while a technical report assessing the applicable fine was
prepared.
There are fears of a further spill, another Brazilian paper reported. The
Folha de Sao Paulo said the same company owned another chemicals reservoir
built to the same dimensions, also containing caustic soda.
It quoted Mauro Costa, president of the state water utility company Copasa,
as warning heavy rainfall could prompt another collapse.
Environment Minister Marina da Silva -- herself previously an Amazon Forest
rubber-tapper and champion of environmental causes -- warned that Brazil's
new government would not tolerate lax environmental standards. "This is a
crime that can in no way go unpunished," she said.

[High concentrations of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) will have an odor
and may produce a burning sensation in the nose, mouth, and throat if
swallowed, and on the skin. If the concentrations are that high, the people
would be able to smell it and should not drink or bathe in it.
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (also lye, caustic soda, white caustic, soda lye) is
derived from the electrolysis of sea water as a co-product of chlorine. It
is a strong, caustic substance and causes severe corrosive damage to eyes,
skin, and mucous membranes, as well as the mouth, throat, esophagus, and
stomach. Injury can be immediate. Blindness is reported in animals exposed
to as little as 2 percent dilution for just one minute. Skin is typically
damaged by exposure to 0.12 percent dilutions for a period of one hour. -
