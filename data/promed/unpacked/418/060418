From: "Dr. John J. Andrews" <jandrews@cvm.uiuc.edu>

The question was posed as follows:
"What is the capability of the zoo's or other local veterinarian to test for
anthrax or other biological agents?"
Nearly all veterinarians, including zoo veterinarians, rely on reference
laboratories for diagnostic assistance in these cases. The clinical signs,
lesions and laboratory diagnosis of anthrax is taught in the veterinary
curriculum of all the US colleges of Veterinary Medicine. There is a
well-developed system of publically funded (state and federal) veterinary
diagnostic laboratories throughout the US ready to deal with this and other
outbreaks of animal disease. It would be a usual response by veterinary
practitioners to request assistance from one of these reference laboratories
in the case of suspicious or unusual animal death losses.
There are two AAVLD (American Association of Veterinarian Labortory
Diagnosticians) accredited, full service veterinary diagnostic laboratories
in the state of Texas that are very capable of making and confirming the
diagnosis of anthrax and have done so numerous times over the years since
anthrax still occurs as a "natural" disease in cattle and other species in
the US.
The Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory operates a laboratory
both at College Station and in Amarillo, Texas.

[There seems to be some confusion regarding this table top exercise. I have
heard from several people that attended. It seems that not everyone was
aware that the question above was asked. Regardless, the answer above is
correct. - Mod.TG
