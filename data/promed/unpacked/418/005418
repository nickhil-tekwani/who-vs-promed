Highlights
- In the reporting Week 12 (18-24 Mar 2019) 15 new confirmed cases were reported from 6 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Plateau (2), Bauchi (3), Taraba (2) and Ebonyi (1) with 5 new deaths in Edo (2), Ondo (2) and Bauchi (1) states.
- From 1 Jan - 24 Mar 2019, a total of 1924 suspected cases have been reported from 21 states. Of these, 510 were confirmed positive, 15 probable and 1511 negative (not a case).
- Since the onset of the 2019 outbreak, there have been 117 deaths in confirmed cases. Case fatality ratio in confirmed cases is 22.9%.
- 21 States (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Plateau, Taraba, FCT, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Kwara, Benue, Rivers, Kogi, Enugu, Imo, Delta, Oyo, Kebbi and Cross River) have recorded at least one confirmed case across 74 Local Government Areas: Figure 1.
- In the reporting week 12, no new health care worker was affected. A total of 16 health care workers have been infected since the onset of the outbreak in 7 States - Edo (7), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (2), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) with 2 deaths in Enugu and Edo States.
- 32 patients are currently being managed at various treatment centres across the country: Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) treatment Centre (13), Federal Medical Centre Owo (9), Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (3), Bauchi (2), Plateau (3) and Taraba (2).
- A total of 6320 contacts have been identified from 20 States. Of these 1567 (24.8%) are currently being followed up, 4690 (74.2%) have completed 21 days follow up, while 8 (0.1%) were lost to follow up. 110 (1.7%) symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 55 (1.0%) have tested positive.
- Multi sectoral one health national rapid response teams (NCDC, NFELTP, Federal Ministry of Agricultural and Federal Ministry of Environment) deployed to Taraba and Bauchi states.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Centre(EOC) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

[The 15 new confirmed and 1924 suspected cases (down from 52 confirmed and up from 1801 suspected cases in the previous report) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing, as Nigeria is now well within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 - 11 over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 117 confirmed deaths, up from 114 in the previous reporting period. Fortunately, no new healthcare worker was infected during this reporting period, and the total infected healthcare workers is 16. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states, and the number of affected LGAs has increased from 73 in the previous reporting period ago to 74 at week 12.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY

Summary
During 2018, an unusual increase in Lassa fever cases occurred in Nigeria, raising concern among national and international public health agencies. We analyzed 220 Lassa virus genomes from infected patients, including 129 from the 2017-2018 transmission season, to understand the viral populations underpinning the increase. A total of 14 initial genomes from 2018 samples were generated at Redeemer's University in Nigeria, and the findings were shared with the Nigerian Center for Disease Control in real time. We found that the increase in cases was not attributable to a particular Lassa virus strain or sustained by human-to-human transmission. Instead, the data were consistent with ongoing cross-species transmission from local rodent populations. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed extensive viral diversity that was structured according to geography, with major rivers appearing to act as barriers to migration of the rodent reservoir.

[These findings support epidemiological observations that the vast majority of these cases during this outbreak were the result of Lassa fever virus transmission as spill-over from rodent reservoir hosts and not person to person transmission, except for the small number of cases within health care facilities. Most cases were widely separated in space and time. - Mod.TY]
