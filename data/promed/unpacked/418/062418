Seven people, including a 3-year-old, have died on Tanzania's Pemba island [Zanzibar] after eating poisonous turtle meat. 3 others are still in hospital.

The meat is a common delicacy among those living on Tanzania's islands and coastal areas but the authorities have now banned the consumption of turtles in the area. In rare cases, turtle meat can be toxic because of a type of food poisoning known as chelonitoxism.

Its exact cause is not known but it is thought to be linked to poisonous algae which the turtles eat, according to the Turtle Foundation charity.

At least 5 families on Pemba, which is part of the semi-autonomous Zanzibar islands, ate the turtle meat last Thursday, [25 Nov 2021], local police commander Juma Said Hamis told the BBC. The effects were first felt the next day and the 3-year-old was the first to die. 2 others died that night and then 4 more on Sunday, [28 Nov 2021]. A further 38 people were admitted to hospital, but most were discharged and the 3 who remain are said to be in a stable condition.

The poisoning can have the worst impact on children and older people, though healthier adults can also succumb, the Turtle Foundation says.

In March 2021 in Madagascar, 19 people, including 9 children, died after eating turtle meat, the AFP news agency reported at the time.

Cases have also been reported in Indonesia, Micronesia, and India's Indian Ocean islands.

[Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve (http://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0101&L=CTURTLE&P=R14884) by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands (edited):

"28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon, western province, Solomon Islands, suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, needles and pins, and general weakness after eating turtle meat (which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of Tue 16 Jan 2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the symptoms.

"Six people (all children between 3 months and 11 years old) out of the 28 people died [within 5 days]. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught, was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and the meat was unusually soft."

"From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified. As turtles feed on seagrass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were deduced to be the source of the toxin."

Abstract
--------
"In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning attack rate was 48% with a lethality of 7.7%. Such [an] accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures."

"Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the flesh of certain marine turtles (green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin, which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea; a burning sensation of the lips, tongue, and mouth; difficulty in swallowing; tightness in the chest; skin rash; enlargement of the liver; or even coma and death."
