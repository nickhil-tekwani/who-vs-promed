been cases in Goa since the 1st week of the year (2011). Sporadic
cases of chikungunya virus infection have been occurring in various
parts of India this year (2011). The report above is of an apparent
ongoing, small mixed dengue-chikungunya outbreak in the capital of Goa
state. Both viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes aegypti_ vector
mosquito.
