Re: The Reporting of Norwalk-like Virus Outbreaks in New Zealand
-------------------------------------------------
The following 2 papers (1,2) show that Norwalk-like viruses (NLV) are not
new to New Zealand. In the hotel outbreak reported in ProMED-mail [see:
Norwalk-like virus, hotel - New Zealand 20021025.5637], only a detailed
epidemiological investigation could confirm the importation of the virus as
NLV appear to be common in New Zealand. It is common knowledge that illness
due to NLV is highly underreported in many countries.

References:

viruses' associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in New Zealand. J Med
Virol 2001 May;64(1):58-66. "Outbreaks of gastroenteritis are a major
public health problem in New Zealand. The introduction of molecular
detection methods has now shown that the 'Norwalk-like viruses' (NLVs) are
the major cause of food and waterborne non-bacterial gastroenteritis". "The
majority of NLV strains occurring in New Zealand since August 1995 are
similar to those occurring overseas".

Hope this information will be of some interest to readers.

[My impression (i.e., unsubstantiated speculation) is that Norwalk-like
virus illness occurs continuously in the population and on account of its
abrupt onset and rapid resolution only becomes recognized as an outbreak
where there is a regulated reporting system, such as in hospitals, schools,
hotels, cruise ships, organised activities, etc. - Mod.CP]
