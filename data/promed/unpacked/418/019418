Iraq: brief emergency report on hemorrhagic fever
------------------------------------------------------------------
The MoH [has issued an order] to prevent movement of cattle coming
from Ninawa [Ninevah] governorate to Dohuk [Dahuk governorate] and
has imposed strict [controls] at entry points to prevent cattle
smuggling and the transport of meat and dairy produce from Mosul
because of the spread of [infection] in that city. The MoH earlier
announced that lab tests on 2 [fatal] cases and 4 suspected cases
[indicated that the outbreak was the result of infection by [a]
hemorrhagic fever [virus], and that the spread of [infection] was a
consequence of consumption of [contaminated] meat sold by street
traders. The MoH has instituted an awareness campaign in this regard.

[Veterinary officials] in Dohuk within the next few days will
implement a campaign in the area [around] Ninawa to sterilize animals
and cattle by showering anti intrusions [that is, carry out tick
disinfestation measures?] and vaccinating cattle. Also, there will be
mobile teams from MoH to ensure compliance. They have asked people to
cooperate with them in the face of this contagion and to follow
health instructions to prevent this disease from spreading.

Symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever include fever, tiredness,
inappetence, sickness, sweating, flushing, and in severe cases might
include internal or external bleeding. Children may possibly have
spasms or go into a coma ending in death.

This pandemic disease previously [occurred] in Erbil and Dohuk in the
years 1994-1996 killing one person who was working as a veteran
assistant in Erbil; there were other infected cases.

[Previously (see ProMED-mail archived report: Undiagnosed hemorrhagic
fever - Iraq: (NI), RFI 20100505.1464) it was inferred that the viral
hemorrhagic fever responsible for the deaths and infections in Ninawa
governorate was Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. The identity
of the agent responsible for this outbreak of disease and the
consequent controls of livestock movements remains to be confirmed.
Further information from the region, verifying the identity of the
etiologic agent would be welcomed.

of the adjacent provinces of Dohuk and Ninawa (Nineveh; formerly
Mosul province), can be accessed at
