The following information has been extracted from the Gideon Database by
Professor Steven Berger with reference to the ProMED-mail post describing
the current outbreak of hepatitis A in Neuquen, Argentina.
The database records that 55.0 percent of the Argentinean population are
seropositive for hepatitis A (1996 to 1997); 95 percent of blood
donors; 18.8 percent of children below the age of 13 years and 45.5
percent over 14 years in the Buenos Aires region. These reported disease
rates are relatively high, especially when compared with those of other
countries in the Americas region. The database also contains a figure
(<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/hep1.-Arg.jpg>) showing rates per 100 000
for Argentina (1988-2004), Mexico (1985-2005) and the USA (1947-2005).
During the period 1988 to 2004 the rate fluctuated from approximately 33 to
133 for Argentina, from 20 to 30 for Mexico, and from 2 to 15 for the USA.
