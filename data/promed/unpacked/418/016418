WHO Confirms Ebola Outbreak in Congo, Nine Dead
-----------------------------------------------
Ebola haemorrhagic fever has returned to the Republic of Congo, killing 9
people since the end of April [2005], the World Health Organisation (WHO)
said on Wednesday [18 May 2005] after tests confirmed the presence of the
virus. "The results (of laboratory tests) came in yesterday ... It is
indeed a case of Ebola," said Adamou Yada, WHO's representative in Congo,
which has faced serious outbreaks of the disease in the past. Nearly 150
people died in 2003.
"Since the beginning (of the outbreak), we have registered 11 cases,
including 9 deaths," Yada said in the capital Brazzaville. The latest
outbreak is in the forested Cuvette-Ouest region, near the border with
Gabon, where the 2003 outbreak struck.
There is no known cure for Ebola, which is passed on by infected body
fluids and kills between 50 and 90 percent of victims, depending on the
strain. In a statement on its Web site, WHO said of the 11 cases, one had
been confirmed as Ebola by laboratory tests and 10 were epidemiologically
linked. A total of 81 contacts were being monitored in the towns of Etoumbi
and Mbomo, north of the capital Brazzaville, it said. Officials from
Congo's Health Ministry, WHO and Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland are in
the field, following up contacts and raising awareness about the disease,
WHO said.
Ebola damages blood vessels and can cause bleeding, diarrhoea and shock.
Its worst outbreak, in 1995, killed more than 250 people in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
Scientists think past outbreaks in Cuvette-Ouest were caused by the
consumption of infected monkey meat. Bushmeat is a staple among forest
communities in West and Central Africa and a delicacy in many cities.

[The Republic of Congo, the location of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever
outbreak lies to the north of Angola, the site of the current Marburg
haemorrhagic fever out break. The Republic of Congo shares borders with
Gabon, Cameroon and the Central African Republic to the north, and the much
larger Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) to the south and
east. Angola and the Republic of Congo have no common border. Ebola virus
and Marburg virus are associated with similar life-threatening haemorrhagic
fevers and are classified in the same virus family, the family
_Filoviridae_. They are, however, genetically and serologically distinct
viruses. The natural reservoir of these viruses is still unknown. - Mod.CP]
