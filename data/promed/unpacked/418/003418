[Re: Encephalitis - Bangladesh, RFI]
Encephalitis cases have already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year, totalling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as Japanese encephalitis [virus infections]. FluTrackers is maintaining a thread with details here: http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=197496.

[The moderator statement in ProMED-mail post 20130401.1613261 concerning the season of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission this year (2013) is incorrect, since there are cases in nearby India already in 2013. That makes the diagnosis of the encephalitis cases in Bangladesh more urgent, as a JE virus vaccination campaign may be needed if these cases turn out to be due to that virus.

ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for providing this additional information. - Mod.TY]

[The final diagnosis in Bangladesh was Nipah encephalitis -- see new post today, 2 Apr 2013. - Mod.JW
