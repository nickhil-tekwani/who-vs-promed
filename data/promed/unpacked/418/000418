WILDLIFE STUDIES - FRENCH GUIANA: RFI
=====================================
Date: Fri, 25 Apr 1997 07:27:22 -0430
From: Jean Christophe Vie <vie.j@kourou.cirad.fr>
In the course of a wildlife rescue in French Guiana numerous samples have
been taken from various mammals and snake. Among them, 1,933 serum samples
(33 mammal species) and 2,446 blood smears (36 mammal species). Serum
samples are preserved at -80C and available for serological investigations.
A first screening of blood smears is almost completed. Hepatozoon, babesia,
plasmodia, trypanosomes and microfilariasis have been observed in a large
percentage of individuals and species. We are looking for the help of
specialists and those interested in species identification. For more
information, please contact Jean-Christophe Vie at <vie.j@kourou.cirad.fr>.

[I am certain that the Pasteur Institute, Cayenne, would be interested in
these specimens and would either have knowledgeable individuals available or
be able to point Jean-Christophe in the right direction. If anyone else is
interested in assisting, please contact him directly. Sounds like a good
opportunity for an arbovirus (or hantavirus/arenavirus) serosurvey in French
Guiana, a fascinating place. -- Mod CHC]
