A 3 year old Bernalillo County boy has died of bubonic plague, marking the
1st fatal case of the disease in New Mexico in 2007. The state Health
Department made the announcement on 7 Jun 2007.
The city of Albuquerque's Environmental Health Department and the state
Health Department are conducting an investigation at the boy's home in the
East Mountain area to determine if there is any risk to [other] people.
The boy was the 3rd plague case in New Mexico in 2007. The 1st, in late
April 2007, was a man from San Juan County who recovered, and the 2nd was a
woman from Torrance County who is still hospitalized.

[As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/diagnosis.htm>:
"Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_
escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague)
causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may
well have been what was called the "Black Death" in the Middle Ages. The
bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia
(secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague
meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the
secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol)
from person to person.
"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and
very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a
"bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen
gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history
of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person
usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.
"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the
bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they
spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal
condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the
pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person
may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may
expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic
therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in
7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal."
