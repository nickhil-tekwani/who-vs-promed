Cattle tick outbreak near Kempsey
---------------------------------
After the detection of cattle ticks during a routine inspection, 3
beef cattle properties on the NSW [New South Wales] Mid North Coast
are in quarantine.

It's been 4 years since cattle ticks have been found this far south.
Industry and Investment NSW's chief veterinary officer Ian Roth says
the ticks were traced back to the Kempsey district. "They were found
in one animal at the Casino abattoirs, it was just a routine check,
and that led to a property, and then further looking around that
property found the other 2 properties, and then normal policy applies
in that we have to eradicate them."

Another beef property near Casino on the state's North Coast is still
in quarantine after 3 cattle died from what was suspected to be tick
fever last week [week of 1 Mar 2011]. However, samples have now
confirmed the cause to be benign theileriosis.

[Theileriosis results from infection with obligate intracellular
protozoa in the genus _Theileria_. The 2 most important species are
_T. parva_, which causes East Coast fever, Corridor disease, and
Zimbabwean theileriosis, and _T. annulata_, which causes tropical
theileriosis (Mediterranean theileriosis). A number of other
_Theileria_ species can infect ruminants; many of them cause mild or
asymptomatic infections.

Both _T. parva_ and_ T. annulata_ are spread by ticks. The most
important vector for _T. parva_ is _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_. _R.
zembeziensis_ in southern Africa and _R. duttoni_ in Angola can also
spread East Coast fever. _T annulata_ is transmitted by ticks in the
genus _Hyalomma_.

_Theileria_ sporozoites are transmitted to susceptible animals in the
saliva of the feeding tick. Ordinarily, _T. parva_ and _T. annulata_
only mature and enter the saliva after the tick attaches to a host;
usually, a tick must be attached for 48 to 72 hours before it becomes
infective. However, if environmental temperatures are high, infective
sporozoites can develop in ticks on the ground and may enter the host
within hours of attachment. Transovarial transmission does not occur
with either _T. parva_ or _T. annulata_. Inside the host, _Theileria_
sporozoites undergo a complex life cycle involving the replication of
schizonts in leukocytes and piroplasms in erythrocytes. Cattle that
recover from _Theileria_ infections usually become carriers.

The incubation period for theileriosis is 10 to 25 days.

The typical clinical signs of East Coast fever are swelling of the
draining lymph node followed by generalized lymphadenopathy, fever,
anorexia, and a rapid loss of condition. Other symptoms can include
lacrimation, nasal discharge, corneal opacity, an increased
respiratory rate, and diarrhea. Death is common in fully susceptible
cattle, but more rare in cattle in endemic areas. Terminally, animals
often develop pulmonary edema, severe dyspnea, and a frothy nasal
discharge. Cattle with East Coast may also develop a fatal condition
called "turning sickness." In this form of the disease, infected cells
block capillaries in the central nervous system and cause neurologic
signs. Some animals recover from East Coast fever and become
asymptomatic carriers; others may have poor productivity and stunted
growth.

Tropical theileriosis resembles East Coast fever, but jaundice and
anemia may also occur. Common clinical signs in tropical theileriosis
include fever, enlarged lymph nodes, pale mucous membranes, a rapid
loss of condition, and sometimes hemoglobinuria.

Morbidity and mortality vary with the host's susceptibility and the
strain of the parasite. The mortality rate from East Coast fever can
be up to 100 per cent in cattle from non endemic areas. However, in
indigenous zebu cattle in endemic areas, mortality is usually low even
with a morbidity of approximately 100 per cent. The mortality rate for
tropical theileriosis can also vary from 3 per cent to nearly 90 per
cent, depending on the strain of parasite and the susceptibility of
the animals. Theileriosis can be treated with drugs, and vaccines are
available for both East Coast fever and tropical theileriosis.
Recovery from one strain of _T. annulata_ confers cross protection
against other strains. Cross protection does not occur with _T.
parva_.

The differential diagnosis includes heartwater, trypanosomiasis,
babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and malignant catarrhal fever. The parasites
must also be differentiated from other species of _Theileria_.

This particular outbreak in Australia is a little out of where we
typically think of theileria infestations occurring, and the article
does not give us enough information to understand the type of tick
carrying the disease. Therefore, it is difficult to define the disease
accurately. More information on this outbreak would be greatly
appreciated.
