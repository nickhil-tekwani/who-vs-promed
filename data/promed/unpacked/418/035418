Cambodia on Thu [2 Jun 2016] confirmed the 3rd case of measles so far this year [2016] after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared in March last year [2015] that the South East Asian country was measles-free.

The new case was detected in a 1 year old infant who was admitted to the National Pediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh last month [May 2016], said a joint statement released by the Cambodian Ministry of Health and WHO. "The suspected case was confirmed as measles by the National Institute of Public Health, and, subsequently, it was confirmed by the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory in (China's) Hong Kong on 21 May 2016," the statement said. "So far this year [2016], 3 cases of measles were found in Cambodia after the 1st 2 cases were confirmed in January [2016]," it continued.

After receiving the laboratory results, the Ministry of Health has sent a team of health experts to look further into the new case in order to prepare for any urgent response, the statement added. "For this new case of measles, we have immediately launched an inspection and will take all necessary measures, including vaccination, to stop the transmission of the virus," Health Minister Mam Bunheng said.

A measles outbreak is sweeping through Aweil North County in the proposed Lol State, Medair said in a press release last week. "We heard of communities that were burying children every day who had died of measles and other preventable diseases," said Alicia Morcombe, the Health Manager for Medair. Medair said that food insecurity, drug shortages and long distances to walk to local health clinics are exacerbating the outbreak.

A recent World Food Programme report said that 5.3 million people in South Sudan face severe food shortages, and Northern Bahr El Ghazal is at a high risk. Malnutrition severely compromises children's defense against infectious diseases such as measles, which can push them over the edge with life-threatening complications, Medair said.

The Swiss relief agency says it has taken quick action to help contain the outbreak. "In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and County Health Department, and with support from local partners including Premi√®re Urgence Internationale, Doctors Without Borders [Medecins sans Frontieres] and the World Health Organization (WHO), we were able to launch the measles campaign in less than a week," says Alicia Morcombe, Medair's health manager. "Just last week, more than 40 locally-recruited vaccination teams travelled village to village, all the way to the most remote communities, and vaccinated more than 48 000 children."

[Preventing and treating malnutrition in young children is as important as vaccination against measles. Malnutrition leads to a compromised immune response and consequently, greater susceptibility to disease. It also exacerbates the disease once contracted. Since measles is so highly contagious and may lead to long term consequences such as deafness, poor growth and more, this presents a major challenge to public health and the wellbeing of children. - Mod.LK]

A rare diagnosis of measles has been made for an adult male in Collier County, the local office of the Florida Department of Health said. It's the 1st confirmed case in the area since 1997, a health department official said. Authorities are working to limit potential exposure to the public.

"We are actively investigating this," said Terri Harder with the Florida Dept of Health in Collier County. "We are reaching out, and we are identifying people who are potential close contacts and contacting them to ensure that they are vaccinated or that they are receiving care from their physician."

The disease is spread through the air when someone who's infected breathes, coughs or sneezes. "Measles is a very serious disease. The best way to protect yourself and others against measles is to get vaccinated," said state surgeon general and secretary of health Dr Celeste Philip. "This case serves as a reminder for all residents to check their immunization records or contact their primary care provider's office to make sure they are up to date on the measles vaccine as well as all recommended vaccines."

The disease is very rare in the US and other countries with widespread vaccination coverage. Sporadic cases of measles still exist because visitors from other countries or US citizens traveling abroad become infected while traveling. It's unclear how the unidentified Collier county man contracted the disease.

The Arizona Department of Health Services has confirmed a new case of measles, bringing the total to 14 cases. The newest case is a resident who lives in Maricopa County and has ties to the private detention facility in Eloy. 13 of the confirmed cases have been in Pinal County, with one case reported in Maricopa County.

Health experts say that 9 out of 10 people who aren't vaccinated will become infected with measles. The virus can linger in the air for 2 hours after an infected person leaves the room. It's especially dangerous for the young, elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.
