Since 23 Aug 2007, a 3 to 4 fold increase of acute watery diarrhea
cases were being reported from one of the teaching hospitals of
Sulaymaniyah province in Northern Iraq. Laboratory tests performed on
stool specimens confirmed _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1 biotype
Inaba as the causative pathogen for these reported acute watery diarrhea cases.
So far between 23 Aug 2007 and 2 Sep 2007, the cumulative number of
cases of acute watery diarrhea reported from 4 out of 11 districts of
Sulaymaniyah province stands at 2930 including 9 deaths with an
overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.30 percent. Of these reported
cases, _Vibrio cholerae_ has been laboratory confirmed in 187 stool samples.
_Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1 biotype Inaba was isolated from a
stool specimen for the 1st time ever on 19 Aug 2007 from Kirkuk
province of Northern Iraq where stool specimens are routinely
collected and tested for detecting enteric pathogens as part of
routine surveillance for diarrheal diseases, which is in place in all
hospitals of the province. Despite the fact that no discernible
increase in the caseload of acute diarrhea has been observed between
2 comparable periods of 2007 and 2006, a total of 2968 cases of acute
diarrheal syndrome including one death (CFR = 0.033 percent) were
reported from Kirkuk province between 29 Jul 2007 and 26 Aug 2007. Of
these reported cases, _Vibrio cholerae_ has been isolated from stool
specimens of 101 cases.
As of 1 Sep 2007, the outbreak, since reported on 23 Aug 2007, has
spread to 4 out of 11 districts in the province [for map, see URL of
full report below - Mod.LL] exposing over 1 502 000 people at great
public health risk. No surveillance system for diarrheal diseases
existed in the province before the outbreak started on 23 Aug 2007.
Only recently with support from the WHO Office of Iraq, the
provincial health authority has started collecting surveillance data
on cases reported to the health centers and hospitals. Therefore, due
to inadequacy of reporting and other limitations of the surveillance
system, the cumulative number of cases of cholera reported so far
from the province may be grossly underreported and may not represent
the true burden of the disease.
The available report suggests that the outbreak initially started in
Sulaymaniyah district and then spread to other 3 districts (Rania,
Halabja, and Chamchamal). Apart from these 4 districts, no laboratory
confirmed case of _Vibrio cholerae_ has, so far, been reported from
any of the remaining 6 districts of the province. It is unclear at
this stage what has been the source of infection for this current
wave of cholera in the province.
The daily progression of cases as shown in Figure 1 [see URL for full
report - Mod.LL] does not reflect any particular cyclical trend. The
several spikes that are shown in the epi curve may be due to
incomplete reporting as well as inadequacy of reporting. As the
surveillance system improves and better quality data are available
form the field, better understanding on the trends as well as on the
progression of the outbreak over time would be possible. Recent
information received from the field suggests that the number of
severe cases with symptoms and signs of cholera/acute watery diarrhea
reporting to health centers and hospitals might have been dropping as
compared to the previous week, but cumulative numbers are, probably,
increasing since the surveillance coverage is expanding with more and
more health centers reporting on a daily basis and due to increased
public awareness, more and more cases with mild symptoms and signs
synonymous with symptoms of cholera are reporting to health centers.
Nevertheless, given the data that are available, it clearly shows
that the transmission is still continuing and likely to spread to
other adjoining districts and the risk of exposure would prevail
unless the control measures can specifically target areas, which
remain within the epicenter of this current outbreak.
As the information flow improves over the next couple of days, public
health risk assessment of the current situation could possibly be
done through a more comprehensive analysis of the current
epidemiological situation.

[As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which
is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.
There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B, Inaba A and C) and
Hikojima antigens A, B, and C). The latter serotype is relatively rare.

[2] Cholera - Iraq (northern)

The World Health Organization said on Tue 4 Sep 2007, thousands of
people had fallen ill with cholera in northern Iraq, but the cause of
the outbreak had not been identified. "The source of infection is
very unclear so far," said Claire Lise Chaignat, head of the United
Nations agency's global task force on cholera control.
Health officials in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region said last
week [27 Aug-2 Sep 2007] that a Sulaymaniyah water treatment plant
had tested positive for the bacterium that caused cholera, and that
its filters would be cleaned. Polluted well water was also cited as a
possible infection source. In Kirkuk, cracked water pipes allowing
contamination by sewage were blamed for the outbreak.
According to the WHO website, sudden large outbreaks of cholera are
usually caused by a contaminated water supply. The diarrheal disease,
which also causes severe vomiting, is rarely transmitted by direct
person-to-person contact.
Chaignat said it appeared that the number of cases in Sulaymaniyah
may have been decreasing over the past week, but stressed it was
possible that cholera would continue to spread. She said health
workers in the region "so far" have had the resources they need to
confront the outbreak. Most cholera cases are treated with oral
rehydration salts, though some patients require intravenous fluids or
antibiotics.

and Jordan

established border watches related to cholera. As can be seen, only
the Turkish border, however, is anywhere close to the currently
affected areas in the north of the country. - Mod.LL]

[3] Cholera - India (Orissa)

The death toll from an outbreak of cholera in eastern India rose to
169 with thousands of people being treated for the disease, officials
said Tue 4 Sep 2007. Government administrators in 4 affected
districts, 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of impoverished
Orissa state's capital Bhubaneswar, supplied the toll, disputed by
opposition parties and aid workers.
The health control room in Bhubaneswar set up to monitor the outbreak
of the disease said more than 5000 people were being treated for
cholera and dysentery, according to a government spokesman. But
representatives of ActionAid in Orissa challenged the figures put out
by the government, saying the death toll was closer to 250, while
state opposition parties put it at almost 500.
"Local sources have told ActionAid that nearly 250 people have died,"
ActionAid worker, Bratindi Jena, said. She accused the authorities of
keeping the toll artificially low. "If the government reveals the
true figure, they would have to offer compensation (of 10 000 rupees
or USD 240) to many more families," the ActionAid statement quoted
Jena as saying.
