Hantavirus case is Year's First in Colorado
-------------------------------------------
A 64-year-old Gunnison County man has been diagnosed with the
state's first confirmed case of hantavirus infection this year. [Presumed
to be a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by Sin Nombre
virus infection. - Mod.CP]. State health officials said on Mon 3 Jun
2002 that an investigation was under way to determine how he became
ill. The man was hospitalized in Gunnison on 28 May 2002 and
transferred to a Grand Junction hospital, where he is recovering.
Last year, there were no hantavirus cases [i.e., cases of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome] in Colorado. In 2000, 8 cases were confirmed,
and 3 of the victims died. One of 4 victims died in 1999.
Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] kills 30 percent of people infected
[by Sin Nombre virus], said John Pape, an epidemiologist with the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Hantaviruses
are transmitted when people inhale mist or dust contaminated by deer
mouse feces, urine, or saliva. Victims usually experience flu-like
symptoms and can require hospitalization and ventilation within 24
hours. The disease was once thought to be most prevalent in the Four
Corners area of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, but [fatal]
cases have been reported throughout North [& South] America.

[It is assumed that this report concerns a case of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS). The hantavirus responsible for HPS in the Four
Corners area of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah is the virus
species known as _Sin Nombre virus_. Other hantaviruses (i.e.,
members of the genus _Hantavirus_) may be the etiologic agents of
HPS in other parts of North America and South America. The reservoir
host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse _Peromyscus
maniculatus_. Other hantavirus are associated with different reservoir
hosts. - Mod.CP]
