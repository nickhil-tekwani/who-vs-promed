TSE in sheep and goats: current situation
-----------------------------------------
The Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FAVV/AFSCA) carries
out annual tests for the detection of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs) on a representative number of samples from sheep
and goats older than 18 months.
About 3750 samples are derived from animals slaughtered for human
consumption in the abattoirs, and about 450 from carcasses in incinerators.
In addition to these rapid tests, an epidemiological-clinical surveillance
is operative on the farms, animal markets, and upon arrival at the
abattoirs, to detect suspected clinical symptoms. Such animals are regarded
as suspected of TSE and consequently tested.
During 2002, 2 positive cases have been diagnosed by means of the rapid
test; the second is a Blue du Maine ewe born on 31 Jan 1997 in England.
Since her arrival in Belgium, in September 1997, the animal was held in a
farm in Wortegem-Petegem in the province East-Flanders. This animal will be
included in the European research programme related to genetic resistance
against this disease.
The involved flock included 120 small ruminants: 110 ewes, 7 lambs, and 3
rams. They have all been transferred to the incinerator, where they were
killed and then burnt. All sheep older than 12 months have been sampled and
will be tested.
Since 1992, 28 TSE cases in small ruminants have been detected in Belgium.
Until now, TSE cases in sheep were regarded as scrapie, a disease which is
not transmissible to humans.

[The description of the case as "TSE" in small ruminants is a reflection of
the recent concern that BSE has, at least, theoretically, the potential of
infecting sheep. Earlier this year the EU launched an animal health scheme
for sampling and testing of sheep and goats in the member states. According
to a recent EU communication, 550 000 small ruminants are to be tested
during 2003.
The Belgian FAVV maintains a web-site
<http://www.favv.fgov.be/indexNL.htm>
where each new case of BSE is published immediately upon detection,
including details on the history of the affected animal, the farm of
origin, contact animals, etc. The last case this year - No 28 - was
published on 22 Oct 2002. During 2001, 46 BSE cases were reported in
Belgium. - Mod.AS]
