Hunters Warned to Avoid Atlantic Brant
-------------------------------------------
The New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife is recommending that hunters
do not shoot, handle or consume Atlantic brant until further notice.
About 450 dead Atlantic brant have been collected from the Brigantine Unit
of Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Atlantic County, according to
Refuge Manager Steve Atzert of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Tests are
underway to determine the cause of the die-off.
The Atlantic brant hunting season resumes in the coastal zones, where most
Atlantic brant are found, on Thursday, 23 Nov 2000, and runs through 9 Jan
2001. The season was open previously 4-14 Nov 2000.
"We urge hunters to stay clear of Atlantic brant, especially those behaving
abnormally," said State Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Shinn.
"As soon as we know the cause of these deaths, we will revise our
recommendations accordingly."
The principal site of the brant die-off at the refuge has been the
impoundments. These have been closed to the public, and all carcasses have
been picked up and burned on site to limit the potential spread of disease
organisms. Hunters, anglers, and the general public are asked to report the
location of any sick or dead waterfowl to Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge
at 609-652-1665.
The cause of the die-off is still unknown, though pathologists have ruled
out chemical and pesticide contamination, according to Dr. Kimberli Miller,
a veterinarian with the U.S.Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health
Center in Madison, WI.
Preliminary tests for some bacteria were negative, though additional tests
for bacteria and viruses are underway. The diagnostic effort is being
conducted jointly by the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife's Office of
Wildlife Health and Forensics; the National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, Wisconsin; the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Division of
Animal Health; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Veterinary Services.
Atlantic brant is a small, brown, black and white maritime goose breeding
in the Canadian arctic which winters along the Atlantic coast. On average,
75 percent of the Atlantic brant population winters in New Jersey.
In January 2000, 157 156 Atlantic brant were counted in the Atlantic
Flyway. Of these, 120 225 were in New Jersey, mainly in the coastal salt
marshes and estuaries. In the 1999-2000 hunting season, close to 1600 brant
hunters harvested approximately 6600 brant. Other species harvested this
time of year include ducks, Canada geese and snow geese, none of which
appear to be involved in the die-off.
