To date, a total of 91 persons have been identified with acute
hepatitis A, 60 percent under the age of 20 and equally distributed
between gender. The increase in hepatitis A illness commenced in
October 2010, with maximum incidence having occurred in late January
2011. Since September 2011, continued incident cases at a rate of
about one per week have persisted. Most but not all cases are linked
to a cultural grouping on Vancouver island with large social
gatherings and extended family involvement. Control efforts have
included immunization of some 10 000 persons to date. More details are
posted at: http://www.viha.ca/mho/disease/hepA.htm.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Hasselback's prompt response to the
Request for Information. Clearly, the outbreak on Vancouver island is
mediated by person-to-person transmission, and infection is not food
or water borne as suggested in the moderator's comment. Anyone wishing
further information should contact Dr. Hasselback directly. - Mod.CP]
