The Gorakhpur district administration euthanised 3 horses on [Thu 13 Jun 2019] after a report by Hisar-based National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE) confirmed that they tested positive for Glanders disease. The 3 animals were euthanised to prevent the spread of the disease.

The administration was sending blood samples of 10 equines every month, which includes horses, ponies, mules and donkeys, to the Hisar laboratory for tests as part of routine checkup.

The samples of the 3 horses that were euthanised were sent along those samples of other animals in April [2019].

"The NRCE sent its report last month [May 2019], saying that 3 animals tested positive for Glanders disease. The 3 horses belong to Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Campierganj in Gorakhpur. A team of doctors went to Kumar's residence to make arrangements for safe disposal, because the bacteria can infest both animals and humans," said chief veterinary officer of Gorakhpur, Dr. D K Sharma.

After deliberations with Kumar for around 2 days, he agreed to hand over the animals for euthanisation.

[Gorakhpur is a city along the banks of the Rapti river in the north-eastern part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, near the Nepal border; map at https://tinyurl.com/y22d3qn4.

Glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic in India. According to the OIE records, the annual numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide in India in 2017 (the most recent available full annual report) was 106, of which 89 were in Uttar Pradesh. For the months January to June 2018, a total of 32 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from India, including 119 cases, of which 61 died and 58 had to be killed. Of these, 13 outbreaks were located in Uttar Pradesh (59 cases, of which 42 died and 17 had to be killed).

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form, known as "farcy", also occurs. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95% within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. In fact, fatal cases, which were known to be common, have become rather uncommon.

In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available.

Reportedly, the veterinary authorities in Uttar Pradesh practice a glanders "routine check-up" policy which includes "sending to the lab blood samples of 10 equines (horses, ponies, mules, donkeys) every month". It would be interesting to obtain an explanation of the "routine check-up" policy (which holdings are "checked-up", why 10 samples, which tests).

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. - Mod.AS
