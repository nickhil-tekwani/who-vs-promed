Bootleg alcohol has killed 24 people and left 37 seriously ill - many in
comas - in Estonia. Police in the town of Parnu have arrested 4 people and
uncovered a suspected illicit bottling operation.
The Estonian President, Lennar Meri, has called the mass poisoning, which
he blamed on illicit "vodka," a national disgrace. But illicit alcohol
consumption is widespread in the former Soviet republic.
Sufferers with symptoms of methyl alcohol poisoning flooded into hospitals
in Parnu - about 130 km from the capital Tallinn - on Sunday evening.
Methyl alcohol, or methanol, is used for industrial purposes and can cause
blindness and death if consumed.
The most serious cases were airlifted to hospital in Tallinn and Estonia's
second city, Tartu.
An official in Parnu said victims of bad alcohol were usually dropouts, but
in this case ordinary families were involved, with some of the victims
being parents.
They are thought to have bought the alcohol on Saturday in refilled plastic
bottles from an illicit alcohol distributor in the seaside town. Police
raided the suspected site of the bottling operation, arresting 4 people and
confiscating 72 litres of illicit alcohol.
President Lennart Meri accused officials of negligence towards bootleg
alcohol, which, according to Reuters news agency, is estimated to account
for 38 percent of alcohol consumed in Estonia.
The trade brings very high profits, just as the drug business does, and it
cannot be eradicated while there is a demand.
According to an Estonian newspaper, the last recorded case occurred in
1999, when one person died from methyl alcohol poisoning. While home-made
vodka stills are common in Russia, in Estonia most illicit alcohol is
believed to be produced industrially.
Estonia's police chief, Harry Tuul, says there is little his force can do
to control the black-market trade.

[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination
rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates it is generally small and
consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol
toxicity than other animals.
Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints,
paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a
40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual.
Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak levels
occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.
Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life.
Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion.
Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the
absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent
period is 12-24 hours.
Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion,
which are common in mild-to-moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and
convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema.
Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.
Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 percent of severe cases. Methanol
is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain,
not unlike large doses of ethanol.
Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may
be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these
patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too
late for this type of treatment to be helpful.
Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may
be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the
treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. - Mod.TG
