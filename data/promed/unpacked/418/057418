According to a report of the Ministry of Health, 346 cases of cholera with
14 deaths (5%) had been reported up to 27 September. The cases have mainly
been reported in five quarters of Maputo city (Chamanculo, Mafalala, Polana
Cani√ßo, Maxaquene and Zona Verde), all with very poor sanitary conditions
and problems with safe water. Up to now no other province of the country
has notified cases and Maputo city is the only area affected in the country.
Control activities through the Ministry of Health include mass media
messages, community based activities, house-to-house visits and treatment
of cases. The Ministry also coordinates activities with the institutions
responsible for sanitation and water supply and is recommending further
government action to improve sanitation in the
affected quarters. WHO has financially supported the education campaigns
and other community activities while UNICEF has provided 80 cholera kits
with 320 more kits expected to arrive soon. The National Cholera Commission
is meeting weekly and includes representatives of both WHO and UNICEF.
