Poultry Imports from EU Banned Over Bird Flu
--------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia has slapped a temporary ban on the import of chicken products
from the European Union after the discovery of suspected cases of bird flu
in Europe, a newspaper reported yesterday.

The Al-Watan daily said the Commerce Ministry has sent its decision to the
Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry and quality control
laboratories instructing them to prevent the entry of any European chicken
products.

Saudi Arabia imports some 120 000 tons of chicken products annually from
the EU valued at 133 million USD.

Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a viral disease that is highly
contagious to chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other birds but not dangerous
for humans.

Europe extends export ban
--------------------------
The ban upon transportation and export of Dutch live poultry and hatching
eggs due to fowl-plague [the old term for Highly pathogenic avian
influenza, HPAI] has been temporarily extended for another week.

Veterinary experts of the EU made this decision on Thursday [13 Mar
2003]. These measures go into effect Thursday night at midnight.

Earlier this week it seemed that such measures might be avoided. The Dutch
authorities carry out screening on fowl plague on about 1400 poultry farms.
Negative results might have enabled the "green light" [for resumption of
imports from] northern and southern portions of the Netherlands.

However, the screening is not yet finished. "It has been decided, in
cooperation with the Dutch authorities, to extend the measures for the time
being," said the spokesperson of Byrne, EU commissioner for EU Commissioner
for Health and Consumer Protection.

[The export of poultry from the Netherlands was prohibited by the Dutch
authorities as of 1 Mar 2003. Consequently, export of live poultry and
hatching eggs was banned by EU's Commission Decision 2003/153/EC of 3 Mar
2003, relating to EU member countries and to "third countries". The decision
has been repeatedly extended since that time. The EU ban did not include
poultry meat, since "there is no evidence that poultry for slaughter has been
affected".

Several other countries imposed more severe import bans, covering table
eggs as well. The Saudi ban, reportedly affecting entry of any European
chicken products, may cause significant losses to European exports from the
poultry industry.- Mod.AS]
