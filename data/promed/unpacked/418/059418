Up to 20 girls from a Kowloon Tong primary school have fallen sick during
the past four days. The students showed mild symptoms, including diarrhoea,
stomach pains and
vomiting, after eating Spanish beef lunch boxes at school on Friday.
The Department of Health is still investigating the sources of the alleged
contamination. The department described the hygiene conditions and food
processing of the supplier as "satisfactory." Health authorities yesterday
took food and water samples from the supplier for tests. Results will be
available in several days.
A Department of Health spokesman said the same supplier also supplied lunch
boxes to other schools, but no other reports of food poisoning had been
received.
