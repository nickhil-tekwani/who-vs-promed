A river otter tested positive for rabies after biting 2 people near the 2200 block of North Sandpiper Road in Sandbridge, according to the city [Virginia Beach, Virginia]. The Department of Public Health [DPH] responded after the bites were reported Wednesday [29 Jul 2015]. According to Environmental Health Manager Dan Horne, the 2 victims went to an emergency room and are receiving a series of 4 shots over 14 days. Animal Control caught the otter and sent its head to Richmond, where it tested positive for rabies.

It's crucial to act swiftly if bitten by an animal that might have rabies, Horne said. Left untreated, rabies is 100 percent fatal. "When you have a situation like this, it takes priority over any other thing we do," Horne said. "We have to drop everything that we're doing."

It's not clear how the otter was exposed to rabies. Also, it might have spread the disease to other animals before it bit the humans.

Authorities encourage people to take precautionary measures, including making sure pets are vaccinated and reporting any attacks or bites from a wild animal. People also shouldn't keep garbage near the house, or keep wild animals as pets. If people are bitten, Horne said, they should clean the wound with soap and water and contact a doctor and Animal Control immediately.

He said the department has seen only 3 otters with rabies since 1999. Three people have contracted rabies in Virginia since 1998. Anyone who is concerned about a possibly rabid animal should call the Virginia Beach Department of Public Health at 518-2700 between 8:15 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the week. Outside those hours, call 911.

[To find Virginia Beach, Virginia, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/VA/Virginia_Beach.html. There is a map embedded in this article showing where Sandbridge is; or go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbridge,_Virginia_Beach,_Virginia. It is described as being known for its somewhat remote location and receives a smaller volume of visitors than the main Virginia Beach resort strip located a few miles to its north. Sandbridge consists primarily of single family homes; there are also 4 condominium buildings. Many of the residential properties are available for rent on daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The ratio of year-round residents to renters is said to be about 1:5. Through the mid-1990s several homes were lost to the Atlantic, but sand replenishment efforts have been successful in restoring the beach. At one time it was not uncommon to see a Banker horse which had roamed too far north. The horses were known to cause problems eating vegetation from yards, and occasionally were struck by vehicles. More fences were built south of the Virginia/North Carolina border to help curb this problem in recent years.

The North American river otter (_Lontra canadensis_), also known as the northern river otter or the common otter, is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to the North American continent found in and along its waterways and coasts. An adult river otter can weigh between 5.0 and 14 kg (11.0 and 30.9 lb). The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur. The river otter is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of 1 to 6 young. Like most predators, it preys upon the most readily accessible species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as frogs), turtles, and crayfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals and occasionally birds have been reported as well. Logically it would have gotten infected by being bitten by a rabid raccoon (236 cases in 2014), skunk (162), or fox (45). One rabid otter was diagnosed in Clarke County, Virginia, in 2014.

Otters have a fierce set of teeth, so I think we can presume that the 2 victims went first to get sewn up, and the emergency folk recognised the rabies risk, initiated vaccination, and informed DPH. - Mod.MHJ
