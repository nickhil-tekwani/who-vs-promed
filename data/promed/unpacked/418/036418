South Korea confirms fresh bird flu case in poultry
---------------------------------------------------
South Korea's Farm Ministry reported on Saturday [19 Apr 2008] a new
outbreak of bird flu at a chicken farm in the southwest, taking the
total confirmed cases to 16 in poultry in just over 2 weeks.

A ministry official said test results were confirmed positive for the
H5N1 strain of the virus at a farm in Jeongeup, North Jeolla
province, an area which saw an outbreak earlier this month [April
2008].

It was one of 3 new suspected cases authorities said on Friday [18
Apr 2008] [they] were investigating, as the worst outbreak in 4 years
spread despite massive culling.

No human deaths from the disease have been reported so far from the country.

Yonhap News said South Korea has culled 3.7 million chickens and
ducks out of nearly 4.8 million planned, the largest since the
country killed 5.3 million between late 2003 and early 2004.

Quarantine workers and soldiers are working to complete culling in
the hardest-hit North Jeolla province this weekend [19-20 Apr 2008],
the Farm Ministry official said.

South Korea had 7 bird flu outbreaks between November 2006 and March
last year [2007].
