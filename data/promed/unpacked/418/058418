He said more than 10 people were admitted in the hospital and 2 had died while others were treated and discharged, adding that the hospital gets between 2 and 3 patients daily and that the ailment was tested and confirmed by medical experts to be cholera.

The Ministry of Health and Social Services says the number of cholera deaths in the Kunene Region has risen to 15. Although the ministry insists it has the situation under control, 7 people have reportedly died at health facilities, while 8 others were reported from the community, one of which was a pregnant woman.

The acting director of the Kunene Regional Office, Joyce Mashaamba, said the number of suspected cholera patients who received treatment at health facilities since the disease broke out now stands at 453. He said only 5 more patients were admitted at the Opuwo District Hospital.

"The field workers in the region continue to provide health education, distribution of water purification kits and oral dehydration solutions, surveillance of the disease, referral of community members to health facilities, etc.," he said. Mashaamba also said the Ministry has been receiving clean drinking water at health facilities from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Agriculture. "Even though these efforts are appreciated, most health facilities remain without water just like in most parts of the region," he said.
