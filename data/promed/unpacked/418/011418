Pepper dies before harvest
--------------------------
The farmers in Dak Nong Province will have to bear huge losses as thousands of pepper trees suddenly died just before they were harvested. Farmers have to destroy most of the trees because of disease.

A farmer [said] he noticed the disease 2 months ago as the leaves turned yellow and fell down. Later, he noticed that the roots were rotten before the tree died one month later. "2 to 3 trees die each day. We tried to save them but it spreads really fast." [Other farmers] said a group of trees often die at the same time [and that they were] unable to react as the trees died within a few days.

The provincial Plant Protection Department suspected that the trees might be killed by the quick wilt and slow wilt diseases. There is nothing they can do. Pepper [is] a major source of incomes for local households.

[Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora capsici_. It is considered one of the most serious threats to this crop and a yield decline of 75 per cent has been reported in some instances. It affects leaves and vines, but once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies within a month. The pathogen is spread by splashing rain and mechanical means. It has a very wide host range and therefore a large pathogen reservoir making it difficult to control. Disease management includes fungicides, biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars, and cultural practices.

Slow wilt (also called slow decline, yellows) is caused by nematodes. Symptoms include leaf yellowing and shedding, root degeneration, blackening of branches, and eventual death of the vine. Disease management of nematodes is difficult and includes nematicides, use of resistant host varieties and crop rotation with non-host species.

_Piper_ species are vines and have to be grown on vertical support. Wooden poles are often used for this purpose, but in some areas, commercial tree crops are planted to give a double crop. It is not clear which option is the case in the story above. The use of the term 'pepper trees' in the report may refer to the commercial vines dying on the support poles. However, if live trees are being used, those trees may themselves also be affected by the same pathogens that cause the pepper wilts.
