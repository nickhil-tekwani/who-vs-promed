Farmers in Nakuru County are facing a poor harvest after a fungal disease attacked their maize crop. Their maize has been destroyed by head smut caused by the fungus _Sphacelotheca reiliana_. One farmer said he noticed the disease 2 weeks ago. "The ears and tassels have been destroyed."

A majority of the farmers grow maize. The area was hit by a prolonged dry spell between December [2018] and May this year [2019]. They accused seed producers of selling them substandard seeds, which are prone to fungal attacks. The farmers called on the Ministry of Agriculture and the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (Kephis) to intervene.

[The] County Executive Committee for Agriculture said [they] were carrying out tests on some maize samples. "A team of experts has visited the farms. We are taking this matter seriously since we want our county to be food secure," [they] said.

[Head smut caused by _Sporisorium reilianum_ (previously _Sphacelotheca reiliana_) can affect both maize and sorghum. In maize, it infects the young seedling systemically, then grows through the plant without inducing symptoms, until it eventually reaches reproductive tissues (ears and/or tassels) replacing them with masses of black spores. Distortion is common, and leafy structures may replace the plant's flowering components (phyllody).

The fungus survives in the soil and can also be seed borne. Cool weather, dry seedbed conditions and nitrogen deficiency favour this disease. Disease management may include cultural techniques (such as crop rotation), the use of disease-free seed and resistant varieties.
