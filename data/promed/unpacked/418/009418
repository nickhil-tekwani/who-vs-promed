Sprouts may carry salmonella
--------------------------------
A local sprout producer has issued a recall of its alfalfa sprouts that may
be contaminated with salmonella.
Harmony Farms issued the recall yesterday after 9 people in Oregon and
southwest Washington were sickened by bacteria in the sprouts. The products
are distributed to stores, restaurants, schools, and institutions in
Washington,
Oregon, Alaska, and Idaho, the company said.
The products being recalled are 5-ounce plastic clamshell containers
labeled "Fresh Alfalfa Sprouts," "Gourmet Salad Sprouts," and "Fresh
Alfalfa & Oregon Onion Sprouts," as well as alfalfa-sprout packages
weighing 1, 2, 3, and 5 pounds.
Anyone with these products can return them to where they bought them.

[In addition to being contaminated with salmonellae or other enteric
microorganisms, the fact that this food is not cooked prior to ingestion
makes it a particularly good transmitter of infection. - Mod. LL]
