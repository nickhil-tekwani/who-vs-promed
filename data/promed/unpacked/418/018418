Tick-borne disease claims 4 lives in 2 days
-------------------------------------------
Despite the warnings of officials and measures taken to prevent the
spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is
transmitted by tick bites and can be fatal, the disease continues to
claim lives -- killing 4 people in Turkey in the last 2 days.

A 53-year-old woman who was transferred to the Izmir Ataturk Research
Hospital from her home town of Canakkale with a suspected case of
CCHF died on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008].

Meanwhile a mother of 2 and a farmer in a village in Ayvacik
district, was bitten by a tick 3 weeks ago. She reportedly tried to
pull the tick off her skin on her own and soon started having
terrible abdomen aches. She turned to the Ayvacik State Hospital and
was then transferred to Izmir 2 days ago for more treatment. She also
died on Tuesday.

Another woman receiving treatment for CCHF in Sivas also died. The
woman, 84, was taken to Cumhuriyet University's School of Medicine
Hospital 4 days ago after being bitten by a tick. Her condition
rapidly deteriorated due to her advanced age and she died yesterday
despite the best efforts of doctors.

Another tick-related CCHF case that ended in tragedy happened, this
time in Ankara. A 15-year-old shepherd picked a tick off his dog and
squashed the tick while grazing his sheep in Corum's Sungurlu
district. He did not wash his hands after killing the tick and had a
fever 2 days later, when he was sent to Sungurlu State Hospital. He
was sent to the Ankara Numune Hospital on Monday after being
diagnosed with CCHF and died on Wednesday evening [18 Jun 2008].

Dr. Fikret Purtul, the health director of Corum, a town in Central
Anatolia which has seen most of the CCHF cases in recent years, noted
that awareness campaigns carried out in rural and urban areas about
CCHF have been effective.

"School directors were trained in Corum and fliers have been
distributed. Teams of medical professionals have traveled to villages
to raise awareness about CCHF. We have also distributed anti-tick
repellants, an initiative funded by the Health Ministry, to
villagers. Locals have been advised to visit a hospital if they have
been bitten by a tick. Patients that have contacted hospitals will be
monitored. Once their lab and test results have been reviewed,
treatment will be tailored to them. When necessary, patients will be
transferred to better-equipped hospitals," he added.

Diyarbakir Health Director Namik Kemal Kubat said 10 people are being
quarantined after 4 of them, including a doctor and a janitor, tested
positive for CCHF. Six of them are suspected of carrying the virus.

Assistant Professor Mahmut KoC, the head physician of Ankara Numune
Hospital, said the condition of 3 doctors and a health care worker
who were treated for CCHF was fairly good and that they would be
discharged by Friday. KoC recalled that the 3 doctors and the health
care worker had contracted the disease while treating a bleeding CCHF patient.

Tick bites cases expected to increase in summer
-----------------------------------------------
While ticks have become a nightmare in the country, killing more than
26 people in the last 6 months, experts warn that the number of
people infected by ticks may yet increase with rising temperatures in
the coming summer months. The climate conditions affect the spread of
disease, which is activated in hot weather. Population of ticks
carrying the virus multiply faster than usual depending on climate
conditions and high temperatures, Esragul Akinci of the Ankara Numune
Hospital told the Turkish Daily News.

In the last month alone, 7 people in the country have died from
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, or CCHF, which is transmitted by
tick bites, while hundreds of people have rushed to hospitals after
finding ticks on their skin.

The disease killed 27 people last year [2007]. Among the recent
victims of the disease are 3 doctors from the same hospital who
caught the disease while treating a CCHF patient.

There is no an effective vaccine against the disease, so doctors warn
people to take all possible precaution to protect themselves from
tick bites. The earlier the tick is removed from the skin, the more
effective result is obtained from treatment, said Akinci.

CCHF mainly poses a threat to animals and people living in rural
areas. It is normally transmitted through the bites of infected ticks
or from direct contact with infected blood and tissue from livestock.
The disease has mostly struck farm and slaughterhouse workers in
rural areas of the central Anatolian and Black Sea regions. Experts
recommend that those working in agriculture and with livestock
examine their bodies every day to detect any possible ticks on their
skins. People are encouraged to wear protective clothing when in open
areas, including picnic areas, or while working in the fields. Tick
repellent spray, which can be applied to both the skin and clothing,
is another option suggested by experts.

The Health Ministry has also issued warnings about the danger of
ticks, saying in case of a bite the skin should be covered with the
proper medicine, the tick should be carefully removed with tweezers
and iodine should be applied to the bite. Ticks should never be
killed by hand, according to Health Ministry officials. People bitten
by a tick should be kept under medical observation for 10 days and go
to the nearest hospital if they have symptoms such as fever,
headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. In advanced cases, the
disease is accompanied by a nosebleed and gum bleeding.

Another expert speaking with the daily Cumhuriyet newspaper,
Professor Levent Doianc, said it is believed the disease has existed
in the country for a while, but that improvements in diagnostic
capacity and the disruption of the natural equilibrium have increased
the number of cases, particularly since 2002. Around 1800 cases were
observed in Turkey in the summer months in the last 5 or 6 years. The
figure is likely to increase given the number of people who show only
mild symptoms of the disease and thus do not apply to health
institutions or are improperly diagnosed, according to Doianc. He
said most cases in Turkey are observed between the period of June and
September, with the disease affecting mostly the 3 major river basins
of Kizilirmak, Yesil rmak and Coruh, as well as the provinces of
Samsun, Ordu, Amasya, Corum, Tokat, Yozgat, Erzincan and Trabzon.

The Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, said it does not find applying
insecticide to the areas where ticks spread practical or useful.
Applying insecticide from air to the areas where the ticks and other
harmful insects are widely seen is not useful as it will harm the
natural equilibrium, said Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker, speaking
at a conference in Ankara yesterday [19 Jun 2008]. He said the
ministry applied insecticide to areas in 36 provinces where ticks are
widespread and that using the same method in forested areas is not
applicable. The most effective solution, however, is having personal
education on the issue. When you look at the cases so far which have
resulted in death, you will notice that they either failed to apply
the health institutions or applied a wrong treatment. People have to
learn ways to protect themselves against ticks, he said. Experts also
warn that applying insecticide from the air may kill the birds that
destroy ticks, undermining efforts to fight the insects.

Meanwhile, speaking to journalists yesterday, Health Minister Recep
Akda said a specific type of tick causes the disease and that this
breed of the insect survives best in steppe climates and in arid
lands where thickets are common. Farmers and those who deal with
livestock in rural areas constitute the high-risk group, while there
was no such a risk for those living in urban areas, he added. [The
ticks transmitting CCHF are species of the genus _Hyalomma_; see

[Ticks are not insects. They are arachnids classified in the
superfamily _Ixodoidea_ that, along with other mites, constitute the
_Acarina_. Ticks are ectoparasites, living by hematophagy on the
blood of mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles and amphibians.
