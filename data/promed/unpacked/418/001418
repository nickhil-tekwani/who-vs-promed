The West Nile virus season in San Diego County [California] has started
earlier than ever, vector control officials said on Tuesday [11 Mar 2008].
Since January [2008], they said, the virus has been found in 6 birds in
Escondido, Poway, Fallbrook, Santee, Bay Ho, and Ramona. Evidence of viral
infection in birds usually doesn't show up until summer or fall.

"While there have been no (human) deaths from West Nile virus in San Diego
County, 14 of the 15 locally acquired human cases last year [2007] were in
people over the age of 50," said Gary Erbeck, director of the county's
Department of Environmental Health. "People over 50 and individuals with
compromised immune systems are at risk of developing more serious symptoms."

Mosquitoes feed on infected animals, such as birds and horses, and then
pass on the virus when they bite people. These insects usually die off in
winter, but a wet winter and warm spring may have helped them survive in
recent months.

[The report of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission this early is worrisome
news indeed, and may be an indicator of a long WNV season to come this year
(2008), at least in California. The report does not say which bird species
were involved, nor if there is any evidence for vector mosquito activity in
the county.
