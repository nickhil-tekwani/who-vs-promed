The Kandahar Public Health Department has registered a new polio or polio incident in the Maiwand district.

A provincial official told Radio Free Statement in Kandahar that a 14-month-old girl had a poliomyelitis virus in the Karizak district of Maiwand district.

In this way, the number of polio infections in Afghanistan in the year 2018 has reached 17. According to figures provided by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, 9 of them are Kandahar, 2 from Helmand, 1 from Uruzgan, 2 from Nangarhar and 3 from Kunar.

Earlier, Kandahar Health Department officials said to Radio Liberty that they have discovered signs of a polio virus in all areas of the province.

According to the officials, Kandahar is among the provinces that witnessed the most polio events last year [2017], compared with any other region in the world.

[In last week's global update (see Poliomyelitis update (51): global (Pakistan, Nigeria) 20181025.6112787), there was a report of a WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) isolated from an environmental sample in Kandahar collected on 25 Sep 2018. The pattern we've seen seems to be identification of the virus in environmental samples in an area, and within a few weeks a case is identified in the general area... most likely good active surveillance response to identification of the circulating virus. We await official confirmation (perhaps in tomorrow's global update), with more information on date of onset (and presumably official confirmation this case is associated with a WPV1).

Kandahar province borders with Pakistan to its east and Helmand province to its west (Helmand is where the previous case of polio in Afghanistan was confirmed.(https://www.mapsofworld.com/afghanistan/afghanistan-political-map.html).

Southern Highlands has reported the country's 19th polio case since June [2018] and 3 cases are pending confirmation. The provincial health authority's emergency operation centre in Mendi confirmed the case through the Health Department on [Fri 26 Oct 2018]. One child has died.

Disease surveillance officer with the emergency operation centre Ken Siki said the victim was a 1-year-old male from Yaria village in the Lower Mendi LLG of Imbonggu who had a paralysed leg. He said the child missed out on polio emergency vaccination when tests were conducted after he was admitted to for treatment and samples were sent to Port Moresby. "We did our best to make sure all the children were vaccinated in the 2 rounds but this total negligence by parents has resulting in the child being affected," Siki said.

"The reported case from Southern Highlands now brings the total to 19 the number of polio victims in the country while 3 more suspected cases are still pending confirmation." He said there needed to be more awareness done in the 3rd round of vaccination to make sure those who had missed out in the 1st and 2nd rounds were vaccinated. It is now the duty of parents and guardians to ensure their children are vaccinated.

[Presumably this most recent confirmed case was associated with a cVDPV1 (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 1) and this will be reflected when the official report of this case is available. Unfortunately not all of the target population is reached during these vaccination campaigns, resulting in residual susceptible population.

A total of 3 environmental samples drawn from the sewers of Rawalpindi have tested positive for the polio virus in a survey conducted by a 3rd party.

In light of the positive samples, the government has decided to launch a 5-day anti-polio campaign in the district from the 2nd week of November [2018].

The emergence of the positive environmental samples was disclosed by Rawalpindi Additional Deputy Commissioner Saima Younas on [Tue 30 Oct 2018] during a meeting to review preparations for the upcoming immunization drive in the city. Younas said that there was a need to revisit their anti-polio strategy on a scientific basis and to work harder than ever before in the upcoming campaign to ensure the virus is eliminated.

[Rawalpindi is the "sister city" to Islamabad (see map at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/pakistan-administrative-map.htm for good visualization of the locations of the 2 cities). The WPV1 (presumably) is still circulating in both Pakistan and Afghanistan where there continue to be pockets of susceptibles "permitting" this circulation.

It's curious that the media report mentions the environmental sampling was conducted by a 3rd party. It clearly is believed as vaccination activities will be implemented within 2 weeks of this announcement.

[4] Niger, cVDPV2 - WHO

From July through September 2018, 6 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 case in Jigawa and Katsina States, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [16 Sep 2018]. This outbreak has also affected Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Borno states in Nigeria, with 17 cases reported since April 2018.

Nigeria has also reported a separate cVDPV2 outbreak in Sokoto State that dates back to January 2018. Nigeria is one of only 3 countries in the world classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan.

As part of the polio outbreak response in the Lake Chad Basin countries (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria) the last monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) round was implemented in Niger in January 2017.

Public health response
----------------------
The outbreak response plan is being finalized to include the outbreak zone most at risk and the exact scale and extent of the response is being determined.

- 2 mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns will reach 3.2 million children under 5 years of age in 4 provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi and Zinder). The 1st round took place from [24 through 27 Oct 2018] and the 2nd is scheduled for [7 through 11 Nov 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.
- WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health are working together to finalize the deployment of the human resources needed at national and provincial levels.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The emergence of cVDPV2 in Niger is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re-emergence. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.

As this outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria, the risk of further international spread associated with this virus remains high.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. For travellers to Niger, IPV is recommended as it is effective against cVDPV2, whereas the type 2 component is no longer included in OPV.

All countries should report any polio case using the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Countries affected by polio transmission should comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director General following advice from the IHR Emergency Committee concerning ongoing events and context involving transmission and international spread of poliovirus. These recommendations include that affected countries declare a national public health emergency, and encourage departing travellers to be vaccinated.

[The above report provides a nice summary of the situation in Niger, and the clear association of this outbreak with the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 in neighboring Nigeria. Zinder province in Niger shares a border with Jigawa Nigeria (see https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/niger-administrative-map.htm and https://nigerianfinder.com/map-of-nigeria-states/) so cross border traffic is probably frequent and fluid, explaining the expansion of the ongoing outbreak in Jigawa Nigeria and the spillover to Zinder Niger.

A key takeaway message from the above report is in the Risk Assessment: "The emergence of cVDPV2 in Niger is a reminder that until polio is eradicated, polio-free countries will remain at risk of polio re-infection or re-emergence". As mentioned previously, there is a past precedence of poliovirus (WPV) spread from Nigeria to multiple countries in Africa and elsewhere during a period of time when vaccination activities were at a virtual standstill in the northern states of the country.
