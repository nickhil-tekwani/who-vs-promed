Bluetongue -- 2 Jul 2008
------------------------
A new case of bluetongue [BT] serotype 8 has been confirmed in the
department of Aveyron (in Huparlac) [see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/0/Huparlac.html>].
The location of this case involves an extension of the restriction
zone to the departments of Aveyron and Cantal.

To date, 6017 cases of BT disease are listed in France for 2008 (of
which 6 are cases of BTV serotype 1). A total of 13 cases of BTV-8 of
2008 have been derived from viral circulation in 2008.

Note on bluetongue in France
----------------------------
I would like to draw to your attention [to the fact] that the
Bluetongue French National Reference Laboratory (AFSSA-Alfort) has
not isolated any strain of bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) in the
department of Correze in France (see ProMED-mail Bluetongue - Europe
(33): France (south-east), new cases suspected 20080628.1993).

A Ct-value (real time RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction]) of 32 was obtained from one bovine sampled in June 2008 in
this department and the isolation of the BTV is still in progress.
Therefore, no outbreak of bluetongue has been confirmed in Correze.
[The Ct-value is a quantitative measurement of the number of copies of
the target found in any sample. -Mod.AS]

However, in 2008, BTV-8 has only been isolated (after passages on
embryonated eggs and cell cultures) from 4 samples. In March 2008,
BTV-8 was isolated from one bovine sample coming from the department
of Dordogne.

In June 2008, it was isolated from 2 bovine samples from Sarthe and
Saone-et-Loire departments and from one ovine sample from Pas-de
Calais department.

[We are grateful for this firsthand, authoritative information
addressing the 2008 BTV-8 situation in France. According to AFSSA
(France's Food Safety Agency, established 1998), BTV-8 has been
isolated during 2008 in 4 departments:
1. in March, a bovine (local? imported? age?!) in Dordogne;
2. in June, in 3 different departments: a bovine in Sarthe; a bovine
in Saone-et-Loire; an ovine in Pas-de Calais.

AFSSA has been working on bluetongue since 2001 to assess the risks
linked to this animal disease and to help its funding ministries
determine the management measures to adopt. Through its risk
assessment, reference, monitoring, research, and veterinary medicinal
product activities, the Agency has built up expertise in bluetongue
and conducted a series of studies meeting diagnosis, epidemiological
surveillance, vaccinology, and clinical needs.

French readers may consider visiting AFSSA's bluetongue page at
<http://www.afssa.fr/PND201.htm>.

The crucial questions at present are
1. How many new cases, indicative of virus circulation, have been
identified during 2008? (AFSSA's data are not identical to the data
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture in item 1 above, indicating
13 outbreaks in 2008 due to "circulating virus");
2. Has the 2008 vector season commenced already (as might be
indicated in the information on the case in Aveyron)?

And on a different European BTV issue:
In view of the spread of BTV-1 in northern Spain and southeast
France, European countries may consider including this serotype in
their surveillance system. - Mod.AS]
