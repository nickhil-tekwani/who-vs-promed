The Government of Castilla-La Mancha is following active protocol [after] an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was detected this weekend in Ciudad de Manzanares. So far, 7 cases have been diagnosed; 2 have been dismissed and 5 others await results.

As reported in a press release by the regional government from the Directorate General of Public Health, cooling towers in the town as well as other facilities were determined to be at risk. These towers have slowed their activity due to the sampling and obtaining of results through the weekend.

It has also been reported, both by the Virgin of Altagracia Emergency Hospital as well as the emergency services of Primary Care Manzanares, La Solana and Membrilla, that a diagnosis of [Legionnnaires' disease] has been considered when admitting patients affected by pneumonia or severe respiratory infection. In this manner, they have diagnosed 7 cases, 2 have been ruled out and there are 5 others pending results.

[The Directorate General of Public Health] has pointed out that the main sources of _Legionella_ infection are refrigeration systems and air conditioning units of large buildings such as offices, hospitals, hotels and shopping centers.

The incubation period of [Legionnaires' disease], that is the period from the infection to the onset of symptoms, is between 2-10 days, and initially the patient may feel tired and weak.

The most common symptoms of [Legionnaires' disease] include fever, gastrointestinal disorders, cough, headache and muscle fatigue, and difficulty breathing.

Although anyone can become infected with the _Legionella_ bacteria, there are certain risk factors that increase the chances of contracting the disease and further complicate the difficult prognosis and treatment, such as smoking, being older, and having breathing problems.
