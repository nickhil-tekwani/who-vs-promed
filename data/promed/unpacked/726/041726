Michigan State agriculture regulators said routine herd testing discovered cases of bovine tuberculosis at 2 private cervid farms.

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced early Friday [4 Feb 2022] bovine TB was found at regulated cervid facilities in Alcona and Sanilac counties. It's the first time since 2009 the bacterial disease was found at such an agricultural facility.

Cervid species include deer, elk, moose, and other hoofed ruminant animals. Michigan is home to breeding facilities for such species, as well as enclosed, high-fence hunting ranches.

Alcona County is within the state's core bovine TB zone, where the disease is annually found in the wild, free-ranging white-tailed deer herd. The disease primarily affects cattle but can spread to all mammals, even humans.

Herds at the 2 facilities have not yet been destroyed; the 2 sites remain under quarantine and state agriculture regulators are consulting with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on response plans for both herds, said Chelsea Lewis-Parisio, MDARD deputy public information officer.

State authorities did not identify the farms, nor whether the infected animals were deer or other species, because the Michigan Animal Industry Act prevents them from releasing details possibly leading to the identification of specific farms.

These are the 5th and 6th farmed cervid facilities in Michigan where authorities found bovine TB cases. The last case was 13 years ago.

State Veterinarian Nora Wineland said routine testing allows regulators to detect the disease early and limit its spread. She said the probe in these cases continues.

"A key part of the current investigation will be whole-genome sequencing, which involves a comprehensive analysis of DNA from the bovine TB bacteria and will help determine the source of the infection."

The whole-genome sequencing is expected to take up to 3 months to complete.

Meanwhile, the state Department of Natural Resources each year encourages deer hunters to participate in its bovine TB check program.

Last year [2021], DNR officials set up drop boxes across the northeast Lower Peninsula -- the heart of the bovine TB zone -- where hunters could submit deer heads for testing. [If heads are being submitted for TB testing, they could likely test for CWD at the same time. - Mod.TG]

["Description of Bovine Tuberculosis:
Bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) is a disease found in mammals caused by the bacteria _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). In North America, bovine TB is most commonly found in domestic cattle and captive and wild cervids (white-tailed deer, elk, etc.) and less commonly in other mammals such as raccoon, opossums, coyotes, and wild boars.

"Bovine TB has been greatly reduced in the cattle industry since the National Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis eradication program began in 1917. Currently, most states are accredited as "Bovine Tuberculosis-Free" by the United States Department of Agriculture; however, sporadic outbreaks do still occur throughout the United States.

"Cattle, captive cervids, and wild white-tailed deer are considered reservoir hosts for bovine TB. A reservoir host is a species in which bovine TB can persist and be transmitted among individuals within a species or be transmitted to another species. Wild white-tailed deer may pose the greatest threat to the establishment of bovine TB on the landscape because they move freely across the landscape and may contact multiple domestic cattle herds.

"Is bovine TB transmissible to humans?
Yes, bovine TB is transmissible to humans but bovine TB accounts for less than 2% of tuberculosis cases in the United States. Most cases of bovine TB in humans are caused by consuming unpasteurized dairy products and the likelihood of contracting bovine TB from a wild deer is minuscule. There has been only 1 confirmed case of transmission of bovine TB to a human from an infected white-tailed deer. In that case, bovine TB was thought to be transmitted via bodily fluids from the infected deer contacting an open wound on the person during the field dressing process.

"What other states have had bovine TB in wild deer?
Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota have had outbreaks of bovine TB in wild white-tailed deer. Currently, bovine TB occurs in less than 2% of deer in the Bovine TB Management Zone in Michigan and has not been detected since 2009 in a wild deer in Minnesota. There are certainly lessons to be learned from both states and those lessons are being incorporated in the management of bovine TB in Indiana.

"Why is bovine TB an important issue in wild deer?
Human health is the main concern; given bovine TB is transmissible to humans. Additionally, bovine TB is not a naturally occurring disease in white-tailed deer. Deer can also be a reservoir for bovine TB potentially transmitting bovine TB to uninfected deer and also to uninfected cattle through direct contact or through shared feeding. Because deer are free-ranging they have the potential to contact multiple cattle herds and transmit bovine TB across the landscape. If bovine TB is maintained in the wild deer herd the state may be at risk of losing a particular status such as the "Bovine Tuberculosis-Free" accreditation from the USDA, which has negative economic impacts for the cattle industry.

"How can deer contract and transmit bovine TB?
An animal infected with bovine TB can shed the _M. bovis_ bacteria through repertory secretions, feces, urine, or unpasteurized milk. Under the right environmental conditions, the bacteria can remain viable in the environment for months. The disease is spread when an uninfected animal comes into direct contact with secretions of an infected animal or indirectly through an _M. bovis_ contaminated source in the environment (e.g. feed pile). Deer can contract bovine TB through direct contact with an infected animal, either another deer or cattle or through sharing feeding with an infected animal at wildlife supplemental feeding piles or areas where cattle are fed or cattle feed is stored. Deer can transmit bovine TB in the same ways as contracting the disease. Indirect contact, by means of shared feeding, is believed to be the primary pathway between deer and cattle.

"What management steps have other states taken to reduce or eliminate bovine TB in wild deer?
Both Michigan and Minnesota have followed the same general approach to eradicating bovine TB. Their approach consisted of (1) reducing deer density in the bovine TB management zone, (2) eliminating baiting and supplemental feeding of wildlife, and (3) continual monitoring for bovine TB in wild deer.

"What management steps are being taken in Indiana to eliminate bovine TB in wild deer?
The Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and Indiana Board of Animal Health (BOAH) are considering similar steps as in Michigan and Minnesota to eliminate bovine TB in wild deer in Indiana. [edited paragraph]

"Why is reducing deer density important to eliminate bovine TB?
Reducing deer density is important to eliminate bovine TB because the disease is density-dependent and spreads more efficiently in areas with high deer densities. In densely populated areas, deer come into contact with other wild deer, captive cervids, and cattle herds more frequently, thus potentially spreading bovine TB to uninfected animals. The purpose of deer reductions is to reduce the risk of transmission by reducing population density, removing diseased deer, and to estimate the percentage of the population with bovine TB.

"Why is banning supplemental feed important to stop the spread of bovine TB?
One of the primary routes in which bovine TB can be spread is through shared feeding. This is because supplemental feeding artificially concentrates deer in a very small area increasing contact among deer and other wildlife species. Additionally, _M. bovis_ can survive for months on a supplemental feed pile. Thus, banning supplemental feeding is a critical step to limit the contact of infected and uninfected animals.

"Are there any treatments for bovine TB in wild deer?
To date, there are no effective treatments for bovine TB in wild white-tailed deer. This is why practices such as deer density reduction, a ban on supplemental feeding, and continued surveillance are vital in combating bovine TB in wild deer.

"How do I know if a deer I kill has bovine TB?
The clinical signs of bovine TB recognizable to hunters would be small to large white, tan, or yellow lesions on the lungs, rib cage, or in the chest cavity. However, in Michigan only 64% of deer exhibited lesions and only 42% would have been recognizable to hunters. If you harvest a deer in the bovine TB management or surveillance zone, you should submit it for sampling. [edited paragraph]

"Can I eat venison from deer harvested in the Bovine TB Management or Surveillance Zone?
Venison from deer harvested within the Bovine TB Management and Surveillance Zone should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill _M. bovis_ and other bacteria. Bovine TB is rarely present on muscle tissue (meat) and the most likely way bovine TB would be on meat would be through contamination from secretions within the body cavity.

"What steps can I take to reduce the risk of contracting bovine TB?
Bovine TB may be transmitted through bodily secretions of an infected deer contacting an exposed wound on a person during the field dressing process. If lesions consistent with bovine TB are found inside a harvested deer you should contact the appropriate agency such as the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and submit the deer for testing. It's important to mention that the likelihood of contracting bovine TB from wild deer is very rare, but there are some steps you can take to further minimize the risk:
* Always wear gloves when field dressing, skinning, and processing a deer because bovine TB may be present in fluids from the internal body cavity.
* Make sure to clean knives used for field dressing thoroughly prior to using them to skin or process a deer, or use different knives for each step.
* Thoroughly wash your hands after field dressing, skinning, and processing deer.
* Cook all venison to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit [74 degrees Celcius]."
