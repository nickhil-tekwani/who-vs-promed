Goat cull halted after Q fever test problems
--------------------------------------------
The slaughter of hundreds of goats on an intensive goat farm in
Limburg was halted following a court order on Friday [5 Feb 2010]
because test results for Q fever were inconclusive. It is the 1st time
a court has stopped the cull procedure, which covers all pregnant
goats on farms where Q fever has been found.

The farm owner applied for an injunction to head off the cull after
tests for the disease came up with conflicting results. He wants vets
to take new samples and have them tested in different laboratories to
find out if his herd really is carrying Q fever.

The judge will explain his ruling on Monday, news agency ANP reported.

LTO: Different view on the value of bulk milk testing results
-------------------------------------------------------------
LTO Netherlands [the Dutch Federation of Agriculture and Horticulture,
an entrepreneurial and employers' organisation] wishes the declaration
of a farm as Q fever infected, based upon a single positive test, to
be cancelled.

The milk tanks of goat and sheep dairy farms are sampled and tested
every 2 weeks. It occurs that plants are found repeatedly negative,
but following a single positive test they are culled. According LTO
Netherlands, there have been more cases similar to the one in Belfeld.
In those cases, a single positive test led to culling. In the current
case, the court denied the killing of the animals.

According to the spokesman of Minister Gerda Verburg [Agriculture],
LTO is also aware that 2 milk samplings undergo 3 tests. In the
Belfeld case, the owner requested an additional test of the goats'
milk; according to the Ministry, this complementary test did not
produce unequivocal results. This was the background to Friday's court
decision to suspend the culling, requesting additional investigation.
The plant is still officially declared infected.

Toon van Hoof, the holder of the animal health portfolio in LTO,
believes that experts should come forward with a proposal addressing
the variation in the results of the so-called bulk milk tests.

[The application of PCR for the identification of _Coxiella burnetii_
infection in milk from dairy animals was initially published in the
early 90's, addressing cow's milk. Later, it was applied in testing of
bulk milk samples and in other species.

According to a 2005 paper (Ref 1), 316 bulk tank milk samples from
dairy herds in the United States were PCR-tested during a 3-year
period (from January 2001 to December 2003) by using trans-PCR.
Positive results were confirmed by nested PCR and DNA sequencing. The
overall prevalence of _C. burnetii_ in the tested samples was 94.3
percent with little variation (93.2 to 94.7 percent) from year to
year. Samples from New York State did not show significant variation
from other states, which indicated, according to the authors, that _C.
burnetii_ infection in the dairy herds was persistent or steady, with
little temporal or regional variations, suggesting that _C. burnetii_
infections in dairy herds "are common throughout the United States."

Throughout the recent decade, PCR was applied in the detection of _C.
burnetii_ in milk of small ruminants (sheep and goats) in several
countries, including bulk milk samples (see Ref 2). Its application in
the Netherlands, within a "test and slaughter" policy, is -- to the
best knowledge of this moderator -- unique.

According to the Dutch daily De Telegraaf, the dairy goat operation in
Belfeld includes 2700 animals; the newspaper does not disclose how
many of them are pregnant, to be culled in line with the current policy.
