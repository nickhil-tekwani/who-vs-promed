Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 18 Nov 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from Kuwait.

The 1st patient is a 47 year old man who became ill on [30 Oct 2013] and was hospitalised on [7 Nov 2013]. He is in a critical condition. The 2nd patient is a 52 year old man with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on [7 Nov 2013] and was hospitalised on [10 Nov 2013]. He is in a critical condition.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 157 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 66 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an emergency committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the director-general on the status of the current situation. The emergency committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[2] Spain: 2 cases, suspected, ex Saudi Arabia

WHO confirms Kuwait's MERS cases; Spain cites new case
------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) today confirmed the 1st 2 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases in Kuwait, while a media report said Spain now has its 2nd probable case in a woman who participated in the recent Hajj in Saudi Arabia.

Kuwait's cases were reported by the media last week [week of 11 Nov 2013]. The 1st patient is a 47 year old man who became ill [30 Oct 2013], was hospitalized [7 Nov 2013], and is in a critical condition, WHO said. News reports had said the man has diabetes and high blood pressure, but WHO did not mention those details.

The agency said the 2nd patient, also in critical condition, is a 52 year old man who got sick on [7 Nov 2013] and was hospitalized [10 Nov 2013]. A media report last week said the man had performed the Hajj. The WHO statement was silent on that point, but WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl indicated via Twitter today [18 Nov 2013] that one of the men has a history of travel to Saudi Arabia.

[Saudi Arabia], site of the majority of MERS cases, attracted more than 1.3 million foreign visitors in mid-October [2013] for the Hajj pilgrimage.

With the 2 Kuwait cases, the WHO's MERS-CoV tally has reached 157 cases with 66 deaths. Kuwait is the 6th country on or near the Arabian Peninsula with confirmed cases, joining Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. Cases in several European countries and Tunisia have all been linked directly or indirectly to one of those 6 nations.

Another likely case in Spain
----------------------------
Meanwhile, Spanish officials said a woman who traveled to Saudi Arabia with Spain's 1st probable MERS case-patient is believed to have the virus, the Canadian Press reported today [18 Nov 2013]. Officials said the 2 women shared sleeping quarters.

Spain's health ministry said there was not enough evidence to determine if one of the women caught the disease from the other or if both caught it from a common source, the story said.

The ministry said both women have recovered and have been released from hospitals. Also, authorities said that so far the 2 women's contacts, including airline passengers and contacts in Spain, have all tested negative for the virus.

Both women tested positive for the virus, but their cases are classified as probable because the WHO case definition requires additional testing, according to the story.

Hartl commented via Twitter today that the 1st case in Spain, reported by Spanish authorities on [6 Nov 2013], still "has not been confirmed to WHO standards." Spanish officials said the case involved a 61 year old woman.

[According to the WHO statement above, there are now 157 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally including 66 deaths. These include 2 new cases from Kuwait, representing the 1st cases reported from this country, one of whom had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia. If the 2 probable cases from Spain are confirmed it will raise the global tally to 159 cases.

This moderator can't help but wonder if there are individuals that have travelled to the Middle East and have returned to their home countries where there may be limited resources to permit active follow-up and testing. One also wonders if the request that individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities refrain from attending the Hajj this year [2013] was observed by all.
