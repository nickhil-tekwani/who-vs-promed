Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Brazil
----------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 11 Jun 2021
Confirmed: 3 Sep 2021
Ended on: 3 Sep 2021
Reported: 3 Sep 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 4 Apr 2019
Causal agent: prion (atypical BSE type H)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Campo Azul, Minas Gerais
Started: 11 Jun 2021
Ended: 3 Sep 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 746 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 10-year-old cow, from a beef cattle breeding farm, subjected to emergency stamping out.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The Brazilian Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) Surveillance System detected a case of atypical BSE, type H. The sample was taken from a 10-year-old beef cow destined for emergency slaughter in a slaughterhouse. After detection of the presence of prion antigens at the National Agricultural Defense Laboratory of the state of Pernambuco (LFDA/PE), the samples were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for BSE at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Lethbridge, Alberta. The results of the confirmatory test were obtained on [3 Sep 2021]. This is the 4th case of atypical BSE identified during 23 years of surveillance in Brazil. The last case was detected in 2019. This case and the case reported in the State of Mato Grosso are isolated events, detected close to each other. The specified risk materials were duly removed and destroyed. The meat and other products of this animal will not enter the food chain and do not represent a risk to ruminant populations. The investigation has been completed.

Control measures applied in domestic: quarantine; traceability; screening; selective killing and disposal; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animals products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), National Centre for Animal Disease (NCAD), Lethbridge Laboratory OIE Reference Laboratory
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Antigen detection Western blot (Ag Western blot) / 3 Sep 2021 / positive

The OIE recognizes Brazil as a country having negligible risk status for BSE (see https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/05/a-r17-2021-bse.pdf). Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country, and therefore, this latest detection will not change the negligible risk status of Brazil.

The following has been extracted from "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) OIE Portal" at https://www.oie.int/en/disease/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy/#ui-id-1.

Classical versus atypical BSE:

"There is a distinction to be made between these 2 forms or strains:

"Classical BSE occurs through the consumption of contaminated feed (see section 'transmission and spread'). Whilst classical BSE was identified as a significant threat in the 90s, its occurrence has markedly decreased over the past years, as a result of the successful implementation of effective control measures and is now estimated to be extremely low (close to 0 cases).

"Atypical BSE refers to naturally and sporadically occurring forms, which are believed to occur in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and which have only been identified in older cattle when conducting intensive surveillance.

"In the early 2000s, atypical prions causing atypical BSE were identified as the result of enhanced surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The number of cases of atypical BSE is negligible.

"Indeed, whilst to date there is no evidence that atypical BSE is transmissible, recycling of the atypical BSE agent has not been ruled out, and therefore measures to manage exposure risk in the feed chain continue to be recommended as a precautionary measure". - Mod.CRD
