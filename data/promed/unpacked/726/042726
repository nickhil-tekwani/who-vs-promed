Authorities in Seville, Spain, have realized having bats in the city's
massive gothic cathedral is not a good thing. A bat with rabies
dropped down on a tourist guide and bit her.
A team of bat experts began investigating the cathedral's bat
population a month after the bat attack.
The bat, which died after biting, carried a mild [sic strain of rabies.
The victim was vaccinated, the state agency reported.

The virus referred to here is likely to be European bat Lyssavirus 1
or 2.
Rabies is the prototype virus of the Lyssavirus genus of the order
Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae. Lyssaviruses are
serologically distinct from other Rhabdoviruses. Previously known
simply as the rabies and rabies-related virus group, the Genus
Lyssavirus is presently composed of genotype 1, classical rabies
virus, and six other genotypes that are closely related antigenically
and genetically, and cause a clinical disease indistinguishable from
rabies. [And rabies vaccine is protective against them - Mod.JW.
Genotype 1 includes the majority of field viruses of global
distribution in terrestrial mammals and in insectivorous and
hematophagous bats of the western hemisphere, as well as the
laboratory and vaccine strains.
Distribution of the non-rabies lyssaviruses is restricted to the Old
World. They include:
- genotype 2, Lagos bat virus, isolated from African bats;
- genotype 3, Mokola virus isolated from African rodents;
- genotype 4, Duvenhage virus, isolated from African bats;
- genotypes 5 and 6 = European bat lyssaviruses 1 and 2, isolated
from European bats; and
- genotype 7, Australian bat lyssavirus, isolated from Australian
fruit and insectivorous bats.
The European bat Lyssaviruses 1 and 2, the Australian bat
Lysssavirus, and the less closely related Lagos bat virus and
Duvenhage virus of Africa broaden the distribution of rabies-
related encephalitis associated with bats. Current information on
their prevalence, vectors and distribution is based on limited
surveillance to date. These viruses are capable of producing
rabies-like encephalitis in humans or other mammals and may
eventually prove to be of greater epidemiologic importance as we
learn more about their natural history.
I would be very reluctant to characterize these viruses as "mild
strains of rabies": the European bat lyssaviruses have been
implicated in the death of a Swiss biologist (with several reported
bat bites in which the bats were not tested for rabies) in 1985, and
2 human cases in the former Soviet Union. The Australian bat
Lyssavirus has been recognized as the causative agent in 2
human deaths in Australia since it was first identified in 1996.
