When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread worldwide, many governments were forced to enact costly and restrictive measures to prevent the disease from spreading. At the start of the pandemic, there was very little information about which activities could increase the change of increasing transmission, so many countries opted for very wide-ranging measures. These included mandatory face masks, the closing of public spaces, and even full lockdowns/stay-at-home orders.

Lockdowns were crippling to many businesses. With many gyms, training facilities, and other public exercise locations closed, scientists saw a reduction in exercise levels and more individuals living a sedentary lifestyle. In a study published in BMC Public Health, researchers from the University of Oslo oversaw a trial in Norway in which several fitness centers were allowed to open.

The researchers examined 5 fitness centers in Oslo, opened specifically to examine the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission among randomized participants. All other fitness centers in the country remained closed. Any fitness center member between 18 and 65 was eligible for participation, so long as they were not at increased risk of severe disease. Eligible individuals were assigned to either the fitness center or the control group.

The researchers enforced several measures designed to reduce transmission in all fitness centers. A 1 metre distance was required between all individuals, rising to 2 metres for intensive exercise. No body contact was allowed, disinfectant was provided at all work stations, the user cleaned all equipment after exercise, and the facilities were regularly cleaned by staff. Lids on rubbish bins were removed, individuals with COVID-19 symptoms were prevented from attending, and staff ensured no overcrowding occurred. All participants were mailed a test kit with two swabs and a tube with media for transport.

Swabs were analyzed using a commercially available RT-PCR test. Participants were also asked to provide a blood spot card 30 days after the end of the study, which was then analyzed using a multiplex flow cytometric assay known as microsphere affinity proteomics (MAP), looking for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.

Following randomization, removal of ineligible individuals, and several removals of consent, 3764 participants were enrolled, with roughly half assigned to train in the facilities or the control group. At the 2-week RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, only one patient assigned to training in the fitness centers received a positive test - and this individual had not used the fitness center until they arrived for the test.

Contact tracing revealed a likely primary infection at the individual's workplace. No individuals in the control group were infected. As many as 83.4% of those mailed antibody testing kits returned the kits to the researchers. Eleven individuals assigned to the fitness centers displayed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared to 27 individuals in the control group. No employees who tested for SARS-CoV-2, either using the antibody or RNA kit, received a positive result.

The researchers identified several potential issues with their data. Generally, more women were in the training facilities than in the control group, and the control group was on average older than the training group. Being male and older are both risk factors for COVID-19, which could have potentially disrupted the results. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that the results are strong enough, with enough statistical power, that this should not have affected the outcome.

The researchers highlight that their trial shows no increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fitness centers with strict enforcements of disease control measures. However, they warn that these measures were strictly enforced in the trial and that less stringent measures might lead to different results. They also highlight that the trial does not test what would happen if the centers opened during the pandemic with no hygienic measures or social distancing.

The Norwegian government reopened all such facilities on [15 Jun 2020], as long as the facilities enforced similar restrictions to those seen in this study. While many countries have now ended quarantine and lockdown procedures, variants continue to emerge, and this information could prove useful in helping to determine if it is necessary to close fitness centers in the future.

["Ultimately, how risky your gym or fitness center or studio is when it comes to COVID-19 transmission depends on several factors, including safety measures, vaccination and infection rates in your area. To help assess how risky the facility you plan to exercise in is, consider these questions:

- "How many cases of COVID-19 are being reported in your area? Are you in the middle of an outbreak? Lower case numbers mean you're less likely to come in contact with someone carrying the virus. Gonsenhauser says gyms and indoor workout facilities may be more risky when there are more than 100 cases per 100 000 individuals in a community.

- "What safety protocols are in place? According to the CDC guidelines, gyms and fitness centers should adjust positioning of equipment (like treadmills and weight training gear) to allow users to maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet. You might see "do not use" signs, unplugged machines, or even physical barriers between workout stations to adhere to social distancing. The CDC has also encouraged gyms to install hand-washing and hand sanitizer stations throughout their facilities and limit the number of people in the gym at one time. But keep in mind that gyms and fitness centers defer to state and local guidance. In California, for example, the state fully reopened on 15 Jun 2021, lifting all restrictions on social distancing and capacity limits in all public spaces, including gyms, per a June 2021 statement from the Governor's office.

- "Is your gym well ventilated? Risk also depends on the design of your gym or fitness studio, Gonsenhauser adds. Generally, the airier the gym, the better, he says. Open windows and outdoor gym spaces can help reduce the risk of transmission because there's more ventilation, adds Steven E Mayer, MD, a sports medicine physician at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Illinois.

- "Is there an outdoor option? Anyone at the gym should choose outdoor spaces, such as outdoor tracks and fields, when possible, Dr Mayer says. Gyms have taken note of this and have adapted swiftly. "There's been a lot more utilization of outdoor opportunities when that's made sense," says Paul McEntire, chief operating officer of the YMCA, which has over 2500 gyms across the country. He says YMCA centers moved spin classes outdoors into parking lots, while other facilities moved yoga and Pilates classes onto rooftop spaces, where possible.

- "What are your personal risk factors? When deciding how risky your gym is, your individual health matters, too. If you have underlying health conditions, your risk of becoming infected with or getting more severe COVID-19 may be higher, Gonsenhauser says. If you're not vaccinated, your risk of getting sick and infecting others is higher."

[2] Masks
Date: Sat 20 Nov 2021
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/health/covid-mask-mandate.html


Amid the turmoil of the last 2 years some of the fiercest political debates in America have been waged over a nearly weightless piece of fabric: the face mask. American officials were slow to embrace face masks as a strategy for slowing the spread of the coronavirus. When they finally did, masks became a potent symbol of the pandemic -- a common-sense public health measure turned political flashpoint and a visible reminder that life was anything but normal.

Now, with the summer's delta surge [over] and the vaccination of school-age children under way, many Americans are wondering when the masks might finally come off.

"The best science does support mask-wearing as a valid strategy to reduce COVID-19," said Dr Stephen Luby, an infectious disease expert and epidemiologist at Stanford University. "The issue is: Well, how long do we do this, and in how many contexts?" He added, "Do we all wear masks the rest of our lives?"

Some public officials are already mapping out an endgame. On [Tue 16 Nov 2021], Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington DC, announced that indoor mask requirements would be loosened. The next day [Wed 17 Nov 2021], Florida lawmakers passed a bill banning school mask mandates, which some districts had already abandoned. Eric Adams, New York City's mayor-elect, "wants to drop the mask mandate in schools when health officials determine it's safe," his spokesman said in an email.

That time has not yet come, experts said. "Cases are starting to rise again, and we have not yet conquered this virus," said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "We may be tired of COVID and COVID restrictions and public health measures, but this virus is certainly not done with us yet."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that even fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor spaces where community transmission of the virus is "substantial or high". Currently, roughly 85% of US counties meet that threshold, which is defined as at least 50 new cases weekly per 100 000 residents.

It will be safer to ease mask requirements early next year [2022], scientists said, after more children have been fully vaccinated and the holiday travel season has passed. And voluntary mask-wearing will continue to be helpful in certain circumstances, as well as in future cold and flu seasons, they noted. "I don't think we're going to want to put all our masks away," Dr Luby said.

Several lines of evidence support the effectiveness of face masks as a public health intervention. Laboratory studies have shown that even basic cloth masks can block more than 50% of small aerosols; surgical masks and N95 respirators are even better. And real-world research suggests that statewide and schoolwide mask mandates curb the spread of the virus.

A randomized trial, conducted by Dr Luby and colleagues in 600 villages in Bangladesh, demonstrated that a mask-wearing intervention, including the distribution of free masks and a multipronged messaging campaign, led to substantial increases in mask-wearing and declines in COVID cases. (The study has not yet been published in a scientific journal.)

All of these studies have limitations, but together they, and many similar analyses, add up to a clear conclusion. "There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that masks help slow transmission," said Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne viruses at Virginia Tech. Face masks are not without drawbacks. "They impede communication," Dr Marr said. "They can be uncomfortable." Some people with disabilities may not be able to wear masks, and there is still debate over how to weigh the benefits and downsides of masking young children, who are much less likely than adults to become seriously ill from the virus. (CDC says that children under 2 should not wear masks, while the World Health Organization recommends against requiring masks for children under 6.)

But given that most people tolerate masks well and that mask-wearing is far less disruptive than other mitigation measures like lockdowns, face masks are a key tool in managing the pandemic, experts said. "I think mask-wearing is, in many ways, one of the interventions that you probably want to relax last," said Richard Stutt, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Cambridge. "Mask-wearing is very, very low cost in comparison to most other interventions."

But mask mandates were never intended to last forever, and this fall, as cases dropped and vaccine eligibility expanded, some public officials began considering how to end them. This month [November 2021], the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced its criteria, including specific vaccination and transmission benchmarks, for lifting some of its indoor masking requirements. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey recently said he hoped to lift the state's school mask mandate "sooner than later" and floated the idea of eliminating the requirement in phases, beginning with high schools, whose teenage students have been eligible for vaccination for months.

But loosening mask requirements now would be premature, experts said, especially as we head into the winter, when people spend more time indoors, holiday travel brings far-flung people together and respiratory viruses circulate easily. "Now is not the time that I would reduce mask mandates," Dr Luby said.

Dr Marr recommended not lifting school mask mandates until after the winter holidays had passed and more school-age children had had the chance to get both of their shots. If community transmission levels are low or moderate a few weeks after school resumes in [January 2021], then, "Yeah, let's get rid of the masks," she said. Seema Lakdawala, a respiratory virus expert at the University of Pittsburgh, imagined a similar timeline: "Maybe in [February 2021], we can say goodbye to masks."

Other experts were reluctant to provide a date. Dr Rimoin said she would like to see a more sustained reduction in cases and deaths before easing mask requirements. "We're still seeing 1000 people dying a day from this virus," she said. "It's not just a matter of comfort and ease -- I mean, this is a matter of life or death for many people. Easing mask restrictions will need to be a local decision, scientists stressed, based on a complex set of factors including local transmission and vaccination rates, and the vulnerability of the population in question. "If a region or particular community is having an outbreak, then I think it would make a lot of sense for people within that community to be wearing masks even if, nationally, things are fairly under control," Dr Stutt said.

And mask-wearing is not all-or-nothing. Even after mandates are lifted, it will make sense for some people -- older adults or those who are immunocompromised, for instance -- to wear masks in certain circumstances and settings. And people should be prepared to put masks back on in the event of future surges, scientists said.

[3] ICUs [intensive care units]
Date: Fri 19 Nov 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/11/full-icus-amid-covid-surges-could-lead-thousands-extra-deaths


A modeling study today in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report estimates that 12 000 excess people die 2 weeks after US hospitals reach 75% adult intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy amid COVID-19 pandemic surges, a figure that rises to 80 000 when ICUs are full--which is the case now in many hospitals in multiple US states.

Researchers from the US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency COVID Task Force evaluated the relationship between overwhelmed hospitals and excess deaths from 4 Jul 2020 -- 10 Jul 2021. The end of the study period included the emergence and eventual dominance of the more transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided data on excess all-cause deaths, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided hospitalization data. Excess deaths were estimated as the difference between observed and expected deaths over specific periods.

Over the study period, excess deaths rose as ICU bed occupancy increased 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surges. A model based on data on all-cause excess deaths predicted that 75% ICU bed occupancy was tied to another 12 000 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 8623 to 17 294) 2 weeks later, with more deaths at 4 and 6 weeks.

When all ICU beds nationwide are full, 80 000 excess deaths can be expected (95% CI, 53 576 -- 132 765).

The study authors noted that emergency department crowding, high ICU occupancy, and ambulance diversion were reported to lead to poor patient outcomes (for example, medical errors, low quality of care, treatment delays, increased deaths) even before the pandemic. "During 2020, the impact of these effects, which included potentially avoidable excess deaths, fell more heavily on working-aged adults from marginalized communities who experience poor access to health care outside pandemic conditions," they wrote. "Racial and ethnic subgroups experienced disproportionately higher percentage increases in deaths, with the most pronounced effect among the Hispanic/Latino communities who represent an estimated 21% of the essential critical infrastructure workforce."

The researchers noted that, as of [25 Oct 2021], HHS data showed that ICU occupancy capacity in US adult ICUs nationwide has exceeded 75% for at least 12 weeks. "This means that the United States continues to experience the high and sustained levels of hospital strain that, according to the model's results, are associated with significant subsequent increases in excess deaths," they said.

The findings, they said, indicate the importance of preventing COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. "State, local, tribal, and territorial leaders could evaluate ways to reduce strain on public health and health care infrastructures, including implementing interventions to reduce overall disease prevalence such as vaccination and other prevention strategies, as well as ways to expand or enhance capacity during times of high disease prevalence."

While COVID-19-driven ICU bed occupancy is not a direct cause of excess deaths, the researchers said it indicates "broader issues that can contribute to excess deaths, such as curtailed services, stressed operations, and public reluctance to seek services." They call for research assessing the cascading effects of pandemic-related healthcare system dysfunction.

Discussion
"These findings suggest that ICU bed use is an important indicator, but not the sole contributing factor, of stress to health care and public health sectors, with excess deaths emerging in the weeks after a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. The results of this study support a larger body of evidence from previous CISA analyses of the potential consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on CISA Provide Medical Care National Critical Functions, and the cascading effects on the essential critical infrastructure workforce (7). Even before COVID-19's emergence, emergency department crowding, ICU capacity, and ambulance diversion were reported to have adverse outcomes, such as increased medical errors and reduced quality of care (8) as well as delays in treatment, medication error, longer patient stays, poorer outcomes, and increased mortality (9). During 2020, the impact of these effects, which included potentially avoidable excess deaths, fell more heavily on working-aged adults from marginalized communities who experience poor access to health care outside pandemic conditions (10). For example, racial and ethnic subgroups experienced disproportionately higher percentage increases in deaths, with the most pronounced effect among the Hispanic/Latino communities who represent an estimated 21% of the essential critical infrastructure workforce."
