An outbreak of salmonella infection in Denmark has now affected 40 people with 24 of them needing hospital treatment since November 2020. People were infected with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium between mid-November 2020 and mid-April 2021, according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Patients live all over the country and include 23 women and 17 men, aged 2 to 92 years old. Three people positive for the salmonella strain linked to the outbreak died within 30 days of the sample being taken, but it is unknown if they died of or with the infection. All 3 had underlying diseases, but salmonella infection is considered to be a contributing cause of death.

The source of infection was traced to a brand of herbal supplements sold by Orkla Care called HUSK Psyllium in capsules. The HUSK Psyllium seeds from the implicated batch came from India. The company has recalled the entire range of HUSK products. The product was mentioned during patient interviews, and testing by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration found _Salmonella_ in products that 2 patients had at home. Orkla Care also found one salmonella positive during self-controls, but supplements were discarded before being sold.

Orkla Care said it was evaluating whether to continue working with the Indian firm but said it had supplied HUSK for 40 years and also provided other companies in Europe with Psyllium seed husks. Products were sent to Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Bulgaria, according to a RASFF notice. German and Polish authorities have also publicized national recalls. In Poland, this includes the Colon brand dietary supplement as it contains Psyllium seed husks.

[More cases have been linked to the herbal supplement and the product has yielded the same organism; the "so-called" smoking gun has therefore been found. The mechanism of contamination is not yet clear. - Mod.LL
