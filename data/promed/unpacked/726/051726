Tests continuing on contaminated wheat
--------------------------------------
While tests continue on contaminated wheat flour previously included in
monthly food rations for millions of Iraqis, doctors fear it may already
have been consumed with possible detrimental effects on health. The Iraqi
government suspended the import of the wheat from Australia on 18 Apr 2005,
after traces of iron dust were found. There is still no confirmation as to
how the particles entered the wheat.
"We have to study the situation carefully, as we are talking about a very
delicate issue, and we don't want to accuse anyone without full
confirmation, and our laboratories are working hard for a very precise
result," Minister of Trade (MoT), Abdel Basset, told IRIN in Baghdad.
"Australia has been the biggest trader in wheat with Iraq for decades and
we have to respect that," he added.
Flour supplies have been removed temporarily from the monthly food ration,
included in the Public Distribution System (PDS) by the MoT, on which most
of the country is still dependent.
"Iraqis depend on bread for all daily meals, and a concentration of the
iron dust could have accumulated in the bread. Some of the contaminated
wheat has already been sent to the south and we are concerned," chemical
engineer at the MoT quality control laboratory, Ahmed Salahdine, said.
There were enough particles of iron to cause health problems, he explained.
Dr Hussein al-Shakarchi at the al-Fayha general hospital in Baghdad told
IRIN that they had received cases where symptoms may be linked to iron
intoxication, but more detailed laboratory tests were being conducted.
"Nearly 20 patients have been reported with the same symptoms of
intoxication and 2 cases were confirmed to be caused by iron intoxication,"
he said.
But the iron particles in the wheat may have entered the grain in Iraq. The
wheat is processed in country at milling facilities where it is turned into
flour. 6 shipments totaling one million metric tonnes of Australian wheat
remain stranded in vessels off the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr,
awaiting clearance from the Iraqi government. A spokesman for the AWB,
Peter Mc Bride, told IRIN from the Australian capital, Canberra, that the
wheat was tested before it left Australia and again after it arrived off
the shores of Umm Qasr some 2 weeks earlier. He rejected the Iraqi claim
that the wheat was contaminated. "Australia has been the dominant supplier
of wheat to Iraq for the last 2 decades and iron dust was never found in
it. We are very accurate in our laboratory analysis and we are sure that
our cargo was safe for consumption and our ships can be considered
brand-new," he said.
Mc Bride added that they were in constant communication with the MoT in
Iraq and believed a solution would be reached soon. In the meantime, Iraqi
authorities have allocated US $75 million to buy enough supplies to meet
the shortage caused by the suspension of the Australian wheat. "We hope we
can resolve this soon and Iraqis can have their rations of flour [this
month] without being worried about consuming it," Basset added.

[Iron toxicity is usually manifest by GI disturbances, including diarrhea,
and hematemesis; blood loss or fluid loss may dehydrate the patient. Mild
poisoning occurs at 20 mg iron /kg body weight and lethal toxicites are
reached at 60 mg/kg body weight.
Iron toxicity initially presents as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
within 1-2 hours after the ingestion of doses of 10 to 20 mg/kg of the
equivalent of elemental iron. If the toxicity is profound, subsequent
systemic effects include hypotension and shock as well as hepatotoxicity.
Children are more susceptible than adults.
Specific management can include limiting iron absorption by using activated
charcoal and/or by administering compounds that complex with iron in the
gut (phosphates or bicarbonates) to produce insoluble salts. Gastric
evacuation and cleansing of the colon may help reduce additional iron
absorption. Iron intoxication may be treated with intravenous deferoxamine.
It would be helpful to know the clinical symptoms of the patients mentioned
in this article. The Australians seemed to have shipped wheat, which was
milled to flour and then distributed. It is interesting that the article
focuses primarily on the processed flour. When the investigation is
complete, a problem may be discovered in the milling. - Mod.TG]
