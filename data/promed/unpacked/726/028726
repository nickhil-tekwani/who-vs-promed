WHO team to assess measures against Ebola
----------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD: A World Health Organization mission arrived on Mon [24 Nov 2014] to assess arrangements made by the government to keep Ebola virus out of the country. During its stay for a week, the mission will visit Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi airports and other entry points. It will assess arrangements to deal with an affected person arriving in the country... According to WHO Country Head Michel Torres, 5 members of the team arrived on Monday and 3 are expected on Tue [25 Nov 2014]. He said his team would assess patient and hospital safety and steps taken at airports and other entry points to stop the virus from entering the country.

Mr Torres said he had been informed that the government had taken steps, but his team would analyse whether standard operating procedures were being followed.

[3] UK: no guarantee of repatriation if volunteers get Ebola
Date: 25 Nov 2014

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11253561/Government-accused-of-failing-to-provide-emergency-care-for-British-ebola-volunteers.html


The UK government is planning to despatch up to 1500 NHS volunteers to the west African nation over coming months, as part of a GBP125 million aid programme that a force of 800 British troops began rolling out last month [October 2014].

But officials have refused to guarantee that any medic who catches the virus will be flown back to Britain for treatment, insisting that most cases can be dealt by a British army clinic that has been set up in the capital, Freetown.

The ruling has caused disquiet among some medics, who point out that the British army facility is not equipped with either kidney dialysis machines or artificial lungs [ventilators], both of which could be necessary for treatment of anyone with advanced Ebola symptoms.
They say the government should instead offer automatic repatriation for any medical worker as soon as they test positive for Ebola. At present, the Government says it will repatriate only on a "case by case" basis, which the medics suspect is a get-out clause to avoid public panic about Ebola coming to the UK.... - more
