After Malkangiri, Japanese encephalitis (JE) has appeared in Mayurbhanj district, with reports of a child being affected by the disease.

According to sources, a boy of 8 years of Kuamara village under Gopabandhunagar in Mayurbhanj district has been affected by the viral disease and is undergoing treatment in a hospital. The blood sample of Deepak was sent to Sishu Bhavan in Cuttack for tests. When the blood sample report came out positive [for JE virus infection], he was admitted to a hospital for treatment.

Taking prompt action, the health department has sent a team of doctors to the JE affected village for collection of blood samples and sensitising the villagers about the disease.

[The JE virus transmission season is beginning in north eastern India. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis in other states in north eastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology. This case, however, is a confirmed JE case.

Pigs may serve as amplifying hosts, but the reservoir species are avians, including ardeid birds (such as herons and egrets), which can be the species responsible for maintenance and movement of the virus in the area. Repeated insecticide spraying can reduce population of culex mosquitoes, but vaccination of individuals is likely to be the most effective way to prevent JE cases. The Malkangiri district administration had a vaccination program for children in the age group of 1-15 against Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus until 24 Dec 2016 [See Japanese encephalitis & other - India (38): (OR) 20161218.4706272]. Since the JE virus transmission season is just starting now, this would be an ideal time to continue vaccination campaigns in endemic areas where cases occur annually.
