The New Mexico Department of Health's Scientific Laboratory confirmed
plague in a rabbit from Santa Fe this week. The rabbit was found dead
on a private residence about 1/2 mile north of the Santa Fe National
Cemetery. This is the 1st indication of plague activity in Santa Fe
County this year [2009]. The Department has also investigated a case
of plague in a dog near Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County in February
2009.

In New Mexico, there was one human case of plague in 2008 in an Eddy
County man who got the disease from hunting rabbits. There were 5
human plague cases with one fatality in 2007.
