Trichinellosis, jackal meat, France from Algeria
--------------------------------------------------
The recent outbreak reported in ProMED-mail -- involving 25
inhabitants of the Novosibirsk region infected through the
consumption of badger meat [Trichinellosis, badger, human - Russia
(Novosibirsk) 20050204.0388] -- emphasizes the risk related to the
consumption of small carnivores.
Badger meat has already been involved in outbreaks in Korea and
Russia [Sohn WM, Kim HM, Chung DI, Yee ST. The 1st human case of
Trichinella spiralis infection in Korea. Korean J Parasitol.
2000;38:111-5; Suzdaltsev AA, Verkhovtsev VN, Spiridonov AM, Vekhova
EV, Serbina VA,Alexeyev OA. Trichinosis outbreak after ingestion of
barbecued badger. Int J Infect Dis. 1999 3:216]. Outbreaks related to
dog meat consumption have also been reported in ProMED-mail
[Trichinellosis - Russia (Tulskaya) 20040327.0845; Trichinellosis,
dog meat - Kazakhstan; Trichinosis, human - Slovakia 19980501.0856]
and are quite frequent in China (Cui J, Wang ZQ. Outbreaks of human
trichinellosis caused by consumption of dog meat in China. Parasite.
2001;8(2 Suppl):S74-7) and Thailand [Dissamarn R, Indrakamhang P.
Trichinosis in Thailand during 1962-1983. Int J Zoonoses. 1985
Dec;12(4):257-66]. Human cases have been reported in Italy after the
consumption of sausages made from fox meat [Pozio E, Rossi P, A!
mati M. Epidemiology of trichinosis in Italy: correlation between the
wild cycle and man Ann Parasitol Hum Comp. 1987;62:456-61].
We report here a single case acquired in Algeria (Batna region), by a
Muslim worker. Shortly after returning to France, in November 2004,
the patient developed the typical clinical and biological signs of
the disease. At first, he claimed to have eaten only mutton -- a most
unusual host for _Trichinella_ -- but the subsequent inquiry revealed
that he had eaten barbecued leg of jackal (_Canis aureus_), which he
captured while wandering in the countryside.
The muscular biopsy of the patient was positive, and 2 physicians in
the south of France efficiently treated him with albendazole.
Trichinellosis is rather infrequent in Muslim countries such as
Algeria, as pork is forbidden, but the parasite circulates in
wildlife (wild boars and jackals).
In France, we were able to identify at least 5 outbreaks involving
around 40 cases (all of them being expatriates) since 1945 after the
consumption of wild boar meat. This recent Algerian case is the 1st
due to jackal meat consumption in North Africa, but similar cases
could be misdiagnosed, as Islamic law seems to tolerate the
consumption of such small carnivores. Pork is the common worldwide
source of human trichinellosis, but the odd habits of some consumers
sometimes put them at risk as well.

[ProMED thanks Dr Jean Dupouy-Camet for this case report. We have
previously reported an outbreak from a Muslim country in which meat
was falsely labelled (Trichinellosis - Turkey 20040119.0215), and in
this case the consumers were apparently unaware of the risk of
_Trichinella_. The above posting illustrates the importance of
obtaining a thorough history when symptoms do not match perceived
risk factors in the patient. - Mod.EP]
