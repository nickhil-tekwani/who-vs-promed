_Xylella fastidiosa_ bacteria detected in olive
-----------------------------------------------
For the 1st time in Argentina and with few precedents in the world, the presence of the bacterium _Xylella fastidiosa_ was detected in Arauco olives, in La Rioja and Cordoba regions. Of the 50 plants analyzed, nearly 50 percent were found to contain the bacteria.

_Xylella fastidiosa_ was first detected in 1890 on grapevine in America. In Argentina between 1935 and 1940, it was found in plums and killed 500 000 trees. Subsequently, it was declared a plague of national importance. It was detected again in the 1990s in almond in the regions of Catamarca and La Rioja, and in citrus in the Northeast.

Regarding the bacteria in olive, there have been some cases in California and in 2013 in Italy [see ProMED-mail post 20131101.2033095].

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of citrus, lucerne dwarf, as well as leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander and other woody ornamentals. In olive and almond, it causes branch dieback and leaf scorch. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these can serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. The pathotype affecting oleander and almond, but not grapevine, has been reported to also affect olives. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed-borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vector insects and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). In Italy, final confirmation of Xf apparently still awaits results of ongoing infectivity tests, but it seems likely that a current outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern, especially outside of the Americas.
