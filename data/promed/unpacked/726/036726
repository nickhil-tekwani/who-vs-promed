The population in general knows that the use of condoms prevents sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs), but in many cases knowledge of a disease does
not go beyond the name by which it is known. According to results of a
survey, which researcher Lucilene Nobre of the Biological Sciences at the
State University of Ceara (Uece-Limoeiro) conducted among 101 young people
from 2 of the largest state public middle schools in the municipality of
Limoeiro do Norte [Ceara state], young people who live in rural areas and
have little education constitute the group most affected by sexually
transmitted viruses and bacteria.

"Many people use condoms thinking they are just preventing pregnancy or
HIV," commented Nobre on the lack of knowledge about syphilis in the
municipality where, only last year [2009], 8 babies were confirmed born
with the disease, transmitted by the mother via the placenta. From 845 live
births in 2008, 6 had the disease [that is, 7.1 in 1000 live births]. The
number is at least 6 times higher than acceptable by the Ministry of Health
(1 case of congenital syphilis per 1000 live births) and 4 times the number
[with confirmed congenital syphilis] in 2008 [? 2007]. And in January and
February this year [2010], 2 more cases of congenital syphilis were
confirmed in the municipality. The situation is similar in other
municipalities, with the same -- or greater -- vulnerability.

Data from Limoeiro do Norte have been collected since 2008 because it is
one of the 16 municipalities of the state considered of priority in the
Control Program for STD/AIDS. Concern about HIV rates, which are considered
high, extends to other sexually transmitted diseases.

In all of Brazil there were 2633 confirmed cases of congenital disease
(passed [from mother] to the baby [while] still in the womb) [? in 2009],
compared with 192 the previous year [? 2008]. In Ceara, in 2009, 217 cases
of congenital syphilis were confirmed, compared with 13 in 2008. In
Limoeiro do Norte there were 8 cases in 2009, 6 cases in 2008, and 2 new
cases of congenital syphilis have already been confirmed in the 1st months
of this year [2010]. It is estimated that in Brazil there are 937 000 cases
of syphilis and 630 000 people infected with HIV.

According to Nobre's survey, at least 32 per cent of the students have no
information on syphilis and 67.9 per cent have never discussed with a
doctor any doubts they may have about sexual relations. Of those who knew
about the disease, a little over half knew about the main form of
transmission of the bacteria that causes the infection. The subject was
also not addressed by health care workers in 73 per cent of those who said
they receive home visits by health professionals.

In 2008, a total of 39 cases of syphilis (congenital and in pregnant women)
were confirmed in Limoeiro do Norte; of these, 89.9 per cent were women.
The survey showed that most of those infected live in rural areas, are aged
between 14 and 27 years, and have only basic education.

According to Glaucia Moura, coordinator of the Unit of Epidemiological
Surveillance of the Municipal Health Secretariat of Limoeiro do Norte,
cases have become evident because there is more information and people "are
starting to worry and to look for a diagnosis." Due to the lack of dialogue
at home with parents, either because they are not educated or are timid
about discussing "taboo" subjects, especially sex, young people are being
informed at school, through the media, or by educational campaigns
conducted in the municipalities. Since 2009, Limoeiro do Norte has
conducted the campaign "Know More" to disseminate information about
symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases through
lectures and cultural activities --including a popular play that has been
shown in several regions of the country and was made into a movie in Ceara.
The largest audiences for these activities are young, sexually active people.

[Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete _Treponema
pallidum_. Transmission from mother to fetus during maternal spirochetal
bloodstream infection can occur through the placenta. Transmission may also
occur during delivery if maternal genital lesions are present. Late
abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death may result from congenital
infection in untreated pregnancies. Among survivors, manifestations that
develop in the 1st 2 years of life are called "early" and are similar to
adult secondary syphilis; manifestations that develop after age 2 years are
called "late" and include tooth abnormalities (Hutchinson teeth), bone
changes (sabre shins), "Clutton's joints" (bilateral painless swelling of
the knee joints), neurological involvement, blindness, and deafness.

Control of congenital syphilis is achieved by antenatal screening and
treatment of mothers who are infected. The recommended screening for
syphilis consists of nontreponemal tests, either the Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory test (VDRL) or the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. If
results are positive, these should be confirmed by a fluorescent treponemal
antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test or a _T. pallidum_ particle agglutination
(MHA-TP) test (Screening for Syphilis Infection in Pregnancy: US Preventive
Services Task Force Reaffirmation Recommendation Statement. Anonymous. Ann
Intern Med 2009; 150: 705-9 <http://www.annals.org/content/150/10/705.full>
and 710-6 <http://www.annals.org/content/150/10/710.full>). Screening
should be performed at the 1st prenatal visit in all pregnant women, as
well as in the 3rd trimester and at delivery for women at high risk. Groups
at high risk include uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers,
illicit drug users, women diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, and
those living in communities with high syphilis morbidity
(<http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/syphilis/syphpgsum.htm>).

For the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral benzathine penicillin G.
Because evidence is limited regarding the efficacy or safety of alternative
antibiotics in pregnancy, women who report penicillin allergies should be
evaluated and desensitized to penicillin if necessary.

Ceara is one of the 27 states of Brazil, located in the north eastern part
of the country on the Atlantic coast
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CearÃ¡#Demographics>). Limoeiro do Norte is
an inland town about 200 km (125 mi) south of Fortaleza, the capital of the
state. For comparison, Limoeiro do Norte, with 8 cases of congenital
syphilis and a population of 56 000 in 2009
[<http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoeiro_do_Norte>] has a rate of congenital
syphilis that is about 10 times and the state of Ceara, with 217 cases and
a population of 8.5 million in 2009
(<http://www.ibge.gov.br/estadosat/perfil.php?sigla=ce>), has a rate of
congenital syphilis that is about twice that of Brazil as a whole, with
2633 cases and a population of almost 200 million
(<https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html>).
