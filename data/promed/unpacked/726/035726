Prevention is best cure for Taiwan virus, experts advise
Taiwanese experts said on Friday that a virus threatening children's lives
was slowing, but urged parents to take steps to protect their children from
the contagion, for which no vaccine has been found. "The decline is
encouraging but we are still only cautiously optimistic," said Umesh
Parashar, a specialist from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control who has
joined local virologists trying to counter the baffling enterovirus.
Officials say the virus has killed 50 young Taiwanese children and
hospitalized 253. They estimate conservatively that it has infected some
50,000-60,000, though some experts say the actual number may be several
times that.
Parashar said the frequency of reports of deaths was slowing and the ratio
of serious complications and deaths to infections remained low, adding that
personal hygiene and other preventive steps were effective for avoiding
infection. "The risk of getting the disease is reasonably low," he said.
Some experts predict the virus will be brought under control by the end of
July, but others say [that more time is needed.
Anxiety over the airborne virus has prompted some schools to start summer
breaks early and cancel summer activities. Some local and expatriate
parents have moved their children out of Taiwan, though most are believed
merely to have moved up their holidays rather than actually evacuate the
island.
