[A few days ago, there was a report of thousands of black-necked grebes dead due to HPAI H5N8 in Shaanxi, another Chinese province bordering with Ningxia Hui on the east (see Avian influenza (86): China (SX) wild bird, HPAI H5N8, OIE, archive no. 20210621.8464004). Black-necked grebes (_Podiceps nigricolis_) are aquatic birds that breed in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America, and the southwest and western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes to moult. For a picture go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-necked_grebe#/media/File:Black-necked_Grebe_Schwarzhalstaucher.jpg. - Mod.PMB
