WHO Recommends Replacement of One of 3 Components of Influenza Vaccine
---------------------------------------------------
A new strain of influenza virus has emerged in California. The World
Health Organisation (WHO) is predicting that it will be the dominant
influenza virus strain next fall and winter. The new strain is called
A/California. Health officials in Santa Clara County discovered it
late in 2004.
Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that
the California influenza virus already represents 20 percent of
influenza cases nationally this year. A WHO flu expert says the
California strain has popped up in Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia,
Africa and Pacific islands. This rapid spread has led WHO to
recommend that the California strain replace the A/Fujian virus,
which is one of 3 main components in this year's influenza vaccine.
US officials are expected to follow suit.
Researchers are working to develop a prototype vaccine by March 2005
so manufacturers can start growing it in chicken eggs -- the 1st step
in producing next year's influenza vaccine.

[The composition of the influenza vaccine for the 2004/05 season
(Northern Hemisphere winter) was announced by the World Health
Organization in Geneva on Fri 13 Feb 2004. The current vaccine
comprises:
(1) an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus;
(2) an A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus;
(3) a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus.
WHO is suggesting that the A/California strain replace the H3N2
component of the vaccine; i.e. the A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) virus. -
