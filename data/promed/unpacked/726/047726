Veterinarians and wildlife managers are warning of an outbreak of distemper among young dogs and raccoons in inland Southern California. In nearly all cases, the animals become severely ill and do not survive despite aggressive treatment, the Southern California News Group reported.

An animal hospital in Murrieta has treated 15-20 dogs with canine distemper this year [2021], said veterinarian Dr. Sarah Hoggan. In a typical year the facility sees just one or 2 cases. "I personally have not seen this kind of an outbreak in my experience," Hoggan said.

Meanwhile, the Rancho Cucamonga Animal Services Department has seen 6 raccoons with canine distemper in the past 2 months. Veronica Fincher, director of animal services, said she's not alarmed by the increase among wild animals, but she's keeping a close eye on the virus to make sure it doesn't spread to household cats and dogs.

Officials urge residents to buy puppies only from reputable sources.

The virus is not transferable to humans.

Canine distemper can spread to domestic dogs and cats from wild animals including raccoons, skunks, coyotes, and rabbits. Pets can contract the disease from a food or water bowl left outside.

The virus attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Symptoms start with fever, nasal discharge, and lethargy and lead to neurologic irregularities such as tremors, followed by convulsions and seizures.

["Canine distemper is a contagious and serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of puppies and dogs. The virus can also be found in wildlife such as foxes, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, mink, and ferrets and has been reported in lions, tigers, leopards, and other wild cats as well as seals.

"Puppies and dogs most often become infected through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) to the virus from an infected dog or wild animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water bowls and equipment. Infected dogs can shed the virus for months, and mother dogs can pass the virus through the placenta to their puppies.

"Because canine distemper also impacts wildlife populations, contact between wild animals and domestic dogs can facilitate the spread of the virus. Canine distemper outbreaks in local raccoon populations can signal increased risk for pet dogs in the area.

"All dogs are at risk, but puppies younger than 4 months old and dogs that have not been vaccinated against canine distemper are at increased risk of acquiring the disease.

"Initially, infected dogs will develop watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes. They then develop fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the nervous system, infected dogs develop circling behavior, head tilt, muscle twitches, convulsions with jaw chewing movements and salivation ("chewing gum fits"), seizures, and partial or complete paralysis. The virus may also cause the footpads to thicken and harden, leading to its nickname "hard pad disease."

"In wildlife, infection with canine distemper closely resembles rabies.

"Distemper is often fatal, and dogs surviving usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage.

"Veterinarians diagnose canine distemper through clinical appearance and laboratory testing. There is no cure for canine distemper infection. Treatment typically consists of supportive care and efforts to prevent secondary infections, control vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic symptoms, and combat dehydration through administration of fluids. Dogs infected with canine distemper [must] be separated from other dogs to minimize the risk of further infection.

"Vaccination is crucial in preventing canine distemper:
- A series of vaccinations is administered to puppies to increase the likelihood of building immunity when the immune system has not yet fully matured.
- Avoid gaps in the immunization schedule and make sure distemper vaccinations are up to date.
- Avoid contact with infected animals and wildlife.
- Use caution when socializing puppies or unvaccinated dogs at parks, puppy classes, obedience classes, doggy day care, and other places where dogs can congregate.
- Pet ferrets should be vaccinated against canine distemper using a USDA-approved ferret vaccine."
