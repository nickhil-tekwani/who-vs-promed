Indonesia Reports 1st Avian Flu Cases Since June (Update1)
----------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu killed 2 men on Indonesia's Java island in July [2008], the
health ministry said, in its 1st reports of cases in almost 3 months.
Both fatalities occurred in Tangerang city in Banten province,
according to the Ministry of Health. No cases of the H5N1 strain of
avian influenza were reported in August [2008], the ministry in
Jakarta said in a statement on its Web site today [9 Sep 2008].

Prior to these, Indonesia's most recent avian flu cases were reported
by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 19 Jun 2008, when the
Geneva-based agency recorded 135 infections, including 110
fatalities. Indonesia accounts for more than a third of the global
cases of H5N1, the strain world health officials say may mutate into
a contagious form capable of touching off a pandemic. Indonesia's
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said on 6 Jun 2008 that the
government would delay reporting new avian flu-deaths by 6 months.
She didn't give a reason for the decision. Calls and a text message
to a spokeswoman at the Indonesian health ministry seeking comment
weren't immediately returned.

The H5N1 flu strain is known to have infected 385 people in 15
countries since 2003, according to the WHO. [The full WHO table can
be accessed at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_06_19/en/index.html>.
- Mod.CP] Almost 2 of every 3 cases were fatal. Most infections were
caused by contact with infected poultry, such as children playing
with them or adults butchering them or plucking feathers, according
to the WHO.

Indonesia's most recent avian flu case occurred in a 20-year-old man
who died on 31 Jul 2008, according to today's statement. The health
ministry said in a statement yesterday [8 Sep 2008] that a
38-year-old truck driver from Banten province became ill on 4 Jul
2008, was hospitalized in Tangerang 5 days later and died the next
day. Tests confirmed on 11 Jul 2008 that he had the H5N1 strain of
avian influenza. Test results from samples taken from poultry in the
man's neighborhood are pending, the ministry said.

Laboratory tests conducted by the Indonesian health ministry's
research center and the Eijkman Institute have found no evidence of
human-to-human transmission in samples from 5 provinces, the ministry
said in yesterday's statement. A total of 12 Indonesian provinces
have recorded human H5N1 infections, though cases haven't been
reported in at least 10 months in 7 of them, the ministry said.

Indonesia's bird flu death toll rises to 112
--------------------------------------------
The worst-hit country by the deadly bird flu disease, on Tuesday [9
Sep 2008] reported another death, taking the toll to 112, the Health
Ministry said. According to the ministry, a 38-year-old cargo truck
driver from Tangerang in Banten Province, near Jakarta, developed
bird flu symptoms of fever, coughing and respiratory problems on 4
Jul 2008 but was not hospitalised until 4 days later. He died 10 Jul
2008. The ministry said chickens and ducks around the man's house are
being tested.

Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari has said the number of bird flu
cases surfacing in Indonesia is on the decline, according to the Indo
Pos newspaper, based in the East Java provincial capital of Surabaya.
"The number of bird flu cases tends to decrease because the patients
infected by the virus have received appropriate and quick medical
treatment," she was quoted as saying Monday [8 Sep 2008].

Avian influenza has infected at least 385 people in 15 countries
since its reemergence in December 2003, with at least 243 of them
having died, according to the World Health Organisation figures
released in mid-June [2008]. Indonesia leads the table with 110
deaths, not including the last 2 cases announced on 3 Aug 2008 and
Tuesday [9 Sep 2008], followed by Viet Nam with 52 deaths, Egypt with
22 and China with 20.

The other affected countries are Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Djibouti, Iraq, Laos, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey.

of 19 Jun 2008; see:
<http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=467858&sid=WOR>. Since that
date according to the Indonesia ministry of health there have been 2
additional fatal cases, a 20-year-old man who died on 31 Jul 2008 and
the case reported above also in the city of Tangerang. The delay in
reporting these cases is unexplained.
