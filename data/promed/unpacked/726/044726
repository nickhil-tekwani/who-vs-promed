SARS: Diagnostic Test Update as of 29 Apr 2003
----------------------------------------------
At present, no validated specific diagnostic test exists for
detection of SARS coronavirus or antibodies. A summary on use of
existing laboratory tests and their characteristics can be found at
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/diagnostictests/en/>.
Diagnostic samples should be suitable for viral culture, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), antigen detection, immuno-staining, and/or
serological antibody assays. For research purposes, to enhance
understanding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) disease
process, WHO recommends that clinicians collect and store sequential
samples from patients with SARS for testing when diagnostic tests
become readily available. This is particularly important for the
first case(s) recognized in countries that have not previously
reported SARS. Data on clinical and contact history should be
correlated with laboratory findings to better understand the shedding
pattern of the virus and the period of transmissibility.
Summary of sampling possibilities:
---------------------------------
For practical reasons, and based on evidence provided by WHO
laboratory network, upper respiratory specimens are most suitable for
virus detection (isolation and RNA detection). Sampling from multiple
sites will increase detection rate.

SARS: Laboratory Diagnostic Test Update as of 29 Apr 2003
-----------------------------------------------
Researchers in several countries are working towards developing fast
and accurate laboratory diagnostic tests for the SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). However, until standardized reagents for detection of
virus and antibodies are available and methods have been adequately
field-tested, SARS diagnosis remains based on the clinical and
epidemiological findings: acute febrile illness with respiratory
symptoms not attributed to another cause and a history of exposure to
a suspect or probable case of SARS or their respiratory secretions
and other bodily fluids.
Those requirements are reflected in the current WHO case definitions
for suspect or probable SARS
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>). However, in
several countries (Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United
States of America) samples from suspected and probable SARS cases are
being tested for SARS-CoV.
Laboratory test result criteria for confirming or rejecting the
diagnosis of SARS remain to be defined.
1. Molecular tests (PCR)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect genetic material of the
SARS-CoV in various specimens (blood, stool, respiratory secretions
or body tissues [see: Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) diagnostic tests at
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/sampling/en/>]). Primers, which are the
key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available by WHO
network laboratories on the WHO web site. A ready-to-use PCR test kit
containing primers and positive and negative controls has been
developed. Testing of the kit by network members is expected to
quickly yield the data needed to assess the tests performance, in
comparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories
and in correlation with clinical and epidemiological data.
Principally, existing PCR tests are very specific but lack
sensitivity. This means that negative tests cannot rule out the
presence of the SARS virus in patients. Furthermore, contamination of
samples in laboratories in the absence of laboratory quality control
can lead to false positive results.
Positive PCR results, with the necessary quality control procedures
in place are very specific and mean that there is genetic material
(RNA) of the SARS-CoV in the sample. This does not mean that there is
live virus present, or that it is present in a quantity large enough
to infect another person. (see: Recommendations for laboratories
testing for SARS-coronavirus at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/coronarecommendations/en/>)
Negative PCR results do not exclude SARS. SARS-CoV PCR can be
negative for the following reasons:
- The patient is not infected with the SARS coronavirus; the illness
is due to another infectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or a
non-infectious cause.
- The test results are incorrect ("false-negative"). Current tests
need to be further developed to improve sensitivity.
- Specimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its
genetic material was present. The virus and its genetic material may
be present for a brief period only, depending on the type of specimen
tested.
2. Antibody tests
These tests detect antibodies produced in response to the SARS
coronavirus infection. Different types of antibodies (IgM and IgG)
appear and change in level during the course of infection. They can
be undetectable at the early stage of infection. IgG usually remains
detectable after resolution of the illness.
The following test formats are being developed, but are not
commercially available yet:
- ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay): a test detecting a
mixture of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients
yields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of
illness.
- IFA (Immunofluorescence Assay): a test detecting IgM antibodies in
serum of SARS patients yields positive results after about day 10 of
illness. This test format is also used to test for IgG. This is a
reliable test requiring the use of fixed SARS virus on an
immunofluorescence microscope.
Positive antibody test results indicate a previous infection with
SARS-CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a 4-fold rise
in antibody titre from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent
infection.
Negative antibody test results: No detection of antibody after 21
days from onset of illness seems to indicate that no infection with
SARS-CoV took place.
3. Cell culture
Virus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool)
from SARS patients can also be detected by inoculating cell cultures
and growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as
the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture is a very demanding
test, but currently (with the exception of animal trials) is intended
only to show the existence of a live virus.
Positive cell culture results indicate the presence of live SARS-CoV
in the sample tested.
Negative cell culture results do not exclude SARS (see negative PCR
test result).

Recommendations for Laboratories Testing by PCR for Presence of SARS
Coronavirus RNA; As of 29 Apr 2003
-------------------------------------------------
WHO encourages each country to designate a reference laboratory for
investigation and/or referral of specimens from possible SARS
patients. National reference laboratories are welcome to send
specimens and isolates to the members of the WHO multicentre
collaborative network (<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/testing/en/>)
after appropriate contact and shipment arrangements have been made.
Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt quality
control procedures and/or identify a partner laboratory in their
country or among the WHO collaborating research laboratories
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/testing/en/>) to cross-check their
positive findings.
Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict
criteria for confirmation of positive results, especially in
low-prevalence areas, where the positive predictive value might be
lower:
- The PCR procedure should include appropriate controls in each run,
which should yield the expected results. They should include:
1 negative control for the extraction procedure, 1 water control for
the PCR run, 1 positive control for extraction and PCR run, and the
patient sample spiked with a weak positive control to detect PCR
inhibitory substances (inhibition control)
- If a positive PCR result has been obtained, it should be confirmed
by: repeating the PCR starting from the original sample, OR having
the same sample tested in a second laboratory.
Amplifying a second genome region will increase test specificity.
A test kit with positive and negative control has been made available
through the WHO collaborative multicentre research project
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/project/en/>) on SARS diagnosis.
