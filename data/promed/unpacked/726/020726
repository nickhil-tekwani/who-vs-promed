DHHS Identifies EEE Positive Bird in Dover [New Hampshire]
Division of Public Health Services
Contact Information: Public Information Office
603-271-6526
The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) today
announced a positive test for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a blue
jay found in Dover. This brings to 5 the number of birds to test positive
for EEE in the State so far in 2006. Forty mosquito pools and a horse have
also tested positive for the disease. During September 2006, DHHS declared
a EEE threat in Dover, providing the city with additional resources and
financial assistance in mosquito control activities under a new State law.
"While much of the state has already seen a killing frost, removing the
danger of EEE, parts of Southern New Hampshire still have not seen freezing
temperatures," said John Stephen, DHHS Commissioner. "This positive test in
a bird in Dover is a reminder that we cannot ignore that there is still a
risk, though it is small. The public should continue to remember to focus
on prevention. We're thrilled that we haven't seen any human cases so far
this year, and I'd hate to see that change."
DHHS has a toll-free Hotline for EEE/West Nile virus at 1-866-273-6453.
Anyone with questions can call from 8 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday,
for information about these viruses. Considerable resources about EEE and
West Nile virus, including fact sheets, are available on the DHHS website
(<http://www.dhhs.nh.gov>).
"While the cooler temperatures have most people wearing long sleeves and
pants, we still want to repeat their importance," added Stephen, "Also,
please try to remove standing water and wear insect repellant when outside.
I never thought I would be so happy to see freezing temperatures, but they
can't come fast enough across the whole state."

[While we seem to have our attention diverted to Avian influenza, it is
good news to realize that surveillance for other diseases is still
occurring. It is also sad news to realize EEE is still around at a time of
year when it seems late for the mosquito. It is also a reminder that if
birds are being found, horses are not far behind. - Mod.TG]
[EEE virus is endemic along the East and Gulf Coasts of the USA. The virus
occasionally spills over from its endemic mosquito-bird maintenance cycle
into equine and human populations. The occurrence of the virus in a blue
jay and an equine EEE case in a more populated part of southern New
Hampshire is a cause of concern. Precautions to avoid mosquito bites and
vector control measures are a prudent response to the current indications
that the virus is actively being transmitted in this area and is likely to
remain active until the first killing frosts occur. Horse owners should
have their animals vaccinated routinely in the EEE virus endemic area. Mod. TY]
