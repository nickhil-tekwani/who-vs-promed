Horsemeat in the EU food chain
------------------------------
The EFSA is aware of the contamination of beef products with horsemeat in the EU food chain. The source is currently being investigated by risk managers across Europe, who have requested extensive testing to be carried out.

In the EU food safety system, the EFSA's role is to provide scientific advice to risk managers regarding food and feed safety. The contamination of beef products with horsemeat raises issues of false labelling, food quality and traceability in the EU food chain. While there is no evidence to date of a food safety concern, EFSA stands ready to provide scientific assistance to the European Commission and/or Member States should this be required.

In the European food safety system, risk assessment is done separately from risk management. The European Commission, European Parliament and EU Member States are the key risk managers in the EU system. They are responsible for determining European policies and making decisions to manage risks associated with the food chain such as this case of entry of horsemeat into the food chain.

Re: Horsemeat - Europe: control, food safety
-------------------------------------------
Compounds are approved for use in food producing animals when their use can be justified as safe for the health of consumers when these drugs are administered to the animals according to good veterinary practice. The regulator controls the use of the various drug molecules in food producing animals to ensure that their Minimal Residue Level (MRL) has not been exceeded indicating that the product can be regarded as safe. Non-compliance with the MRL is a violation and causes sanctions. If no MRL has been set, any detectable concentration of a molecule in the products is a violation because safety has not been established. Therefore, drug approval for the treatment of sporting or companion horses, not intended for slaughter for human consumption, is completely different than for horses regarded as "food producing animals."

There are specific compounds that are totally banned from veterinary use in food producing animals, regardless of the species, such as chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenylbutazone etc., because they are not considered safe at any level. If any of those compounds is used in a horse, it can no longer be considered a food producing animal from the regulatory point of view. When horse meat is used illegally, illegal residues are a legitimate concern.

For detection of some banned drugs (e.g., chloramphenicol, malachite green, nitrofurans), laboratories are required to apply a "Minimum Required Performance Level (MRPL)" but it has nothing to do with a regulatory safety evaluation. However, for many banned compounds and the majority of compounds with no MRL, no MRPL's have been established. Any concentration detected below MRPL is a violation just the same. Laboratories generally monitor phenylbutazone at 5 ppb utilizing LOQ [limit of quantitation] of 2.5 ppb utilizing LC/MS/MS techniques, but it is not based on safety evaluation and any detected concentration is a violation.

[We are grateful to Prof Sobak for his clarifying commentary.

Laboratory test results for phenylbutazone in horse tissue samples from the involved European countries, such as Ireland, UK, France and others, are anticipated to become available, probably in the web-sites of the relevant national food-safety agencies. - Mod.AS]
