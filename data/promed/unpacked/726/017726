From: Craig Hauke <Craig_Hauke@nps.gov>

I was interested in the problem with scabies in chimps. We have a similar
problem with desert bighorn sheep at Canyonlands National Park in Utah.
The disease is probably not routinely fatal but occasionally debilitating
in some animals. A number of our sheep carry infestations in the ears and
neck. This is an exotic mite and has been identified as a factor in
previous die-offs in our area. I have considered the use of oral
ivermectin but I am at a loss as to how to administer it in controlled
doses to wild sheep. I am not even sure of what dose we would use. Any
advice on this would be appreciated.
