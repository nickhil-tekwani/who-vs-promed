According to an Emergency Ministry spokeswoman about 20 people were taken to
hospital in southern Kazakhstan on Friday with the diagnosis of brucellosis.
The outbreak affecting 3 districts of the Kzyl-Orda region was caused by
contaminated beef, [according to Galina Yeroshenkova.
Sick cattle have been found in many parts of the region, and experts believe
the outbreak was triggered by negligence of sanitary regulations. Many
people do not jab [vaccinate? their cattle for lack of money.
The region has earmarked 15 000 dollars to take measures against brucellosis
and barbs (sic). The money is expected to be spent on vaccination. However,
lack of money hampers a successful struggle against these diseases.

[Does anyone know what they mean by "barbs"?
Humans are infected with brucellosis by animals through direct contact or
indirectly by ingesting animal products. The organism affecting cattle is
generally _Brucella abortus_ and is acquired by handling of fetuses and
afterbirths, or by contact with vaginal secretions, feces or carcasses of
infected organisms. The organism enters through skin abrasions as well as
through mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva. There are cases of home
cooks contracting the disease through abrasions on the hand when preparing
ground beef products. The organism is found in the lymphatic system of the
animal and in the case of ground meat, the lymphatics are ground into that
product.
Cases have occurred as a result of inhaling _Brucella_ in aerosol form in
abattoirs and laboratories.
The disease in man is known by a variety of names: undulant fever, Malta
fever, Gibraltar fever, and Mediterranean fever.
The incubation period is from 1 to 3 weeks, but sometimes it can be several
months. The disease is septicemic with sudden or insidious onset and is
accompanied by continued, intermittent, or irregular fever. Acute
brucellosis produces those signs familiar in any febrile disease: chills,
profuse sweating and high temperatures. These are accompanied by constant
weakness, and exercise produces pronounced fatigue. The disease has a
marked effect on the nervous system, evidenced by irritation, nervousness,
and depression. Many patients have enlarged peripheral lymph nodes or
splenomegaly [enlarged spleen and often hepatomegaly [enlarged liver but
rarely jaundice. Serious complications may occur, such as encephalitis,
meningitis, peripheral neuritis, spondylitis, suppurative arthritis and
vegetative endocarditis.
