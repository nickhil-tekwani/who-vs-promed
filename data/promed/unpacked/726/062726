A Mexican gray wolf pup at Binder Park Zoo has died from eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV or EEE). The pup died the 1st weekend in September [2019]. The zoo announced Tuesday [2 Sep 2019] it had received test results confirming the disease as the cause of death.

Test results are pending on a 2nd wolf pup that died the following day, but that pup had been previously diagnosed with a congenital liver abnormality, which may have played a role in its death.

Eastern equine encephalitis infection in canines is rare, though there have been a few cases previously reported in domestic dog puppies, Dr. Kim Thompson, staff veterinarian at Binder Park, said in a statement.

"This is a very rare and isolated case," said Leslie Walsh, a spokeswoman for the zoo.

All species at the zoo considered susceptible to eastern equine encephalitis infection are vaccinated on a yearly basis, Walsh said. The wolf pups were not vaccinated, though, because canines are not considered susceptible to the infection.

The Mexican gray wolf is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf, with only 131 counted in the wild in 2018.

Zoo officials said they are saddened by the sudden loss of the 2 pups, as they were important to the future of the Mexican wolf.

Eastern equine encephalitis is carried by certain types of mosquitoes in Michigan and is potentially fatal for humans and horses.

One human infection has been confirmed in Calhoun County. A Battle Creek family has said they believe their father, 79-year-old [SZ], has the disease, but health officials have not said whether his is the confirmed case.

The zoo learned the disease was the cause of death in the wolf pup on Thursday [19 Sep 2019], making it the 1st case confirmed in Calhoun County.

Because zoo veterinarians perform a complete necropsy and additional disease testing to determine cause of death, they are often among the 1st to detect new diseases in an area, Walsh said. "A zoo veterinarian was the 1st to detect West Nile virus" in the US, she said.

People are advised to wear insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk. Areas with standing water, such as swamps and bogs, are considered high risk.

The zoo is working with local agencies to identify potential areas to spray for adult mosquitoes. The zoo will also provide visitors with access to 5 courtesy "bug-spray stations" to help visitors stay safe. Zoo officials have also posted guidelines from the health department, and the park recently changed to its off-season hours, which means the zoo will be closed before dusk.

Eastern equine encephalitis has infected 8 Michigan residents with 3 fatalities. The virus has also infected animals, including 12 horses and 9 deer.

[EEE infection is reported rarely in dogs (canines), and cases most commonly occur in puppies. Although early signs typically consist of fever and gastrointestinal upset, severe neurologic signs usually develop 1-2 days later. Prior to the neurological signs developing, one would have to rule out parvovirus infection. Once neurological signs appear, then rabies might be high on the differential list. While gross anatomic lesions are rare in infected dogs, humans, primates, and horses, histopathology can include neuronal necrosis, hemorrhage, vasculitis, edema, and encephalitis.

EEE virus has been identified as the cause of death in young domestic dogs. It was responsible for the deaths of 3 puppies in Michigan and New York and in 12 dogs of less than 6 months of age in Georgia. However, no mention is made about presence of and titers of viremias in these dogs, so one does not know if they were able to provide infectious blood meals fo mosquitoes while still alive that would facilitate ongoing transmission of the virus. - Mod.
