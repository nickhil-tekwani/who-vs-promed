Postal Service tests facility for anthrax
-----------------------------------------
WASHINGTON DC: The US Postal Service began testing for anthrax at one of
its Washington facilities after the Federal Reserve said its own testing of
mail had indicated the potential presence of the bacteria, a postal
official said Tuesday. Tom Day, vice president for engineering at the
Postal Service, emphasized that the tests were being performed "out of an
abundance of caution" and said there is no evidence of anthrax
contamination or any health risk to postal workers or the public.
Results of the tests are expected early on Wednesday, he said. It is not
clear whether the possible anthrax might have come from a letter or any
other piece of mail, Day said, though the sample was "generally gathered"
from the mail processed at a government-only mail facility in the District
of Columbia. "This is a facility that has the specific purpose of sorting
the mail destined for the 202 through 205 ZIP code range -- the federal
government here in the District," he said.
The suspect mail did not enter the Federal Reserve system, Day said. He
also said that all suspect government mail is irradiated. "There's
absolutely nothing that indicates we have a contamination problem here,"
Day said.
Officials decided to announce the tests because technicians performing them
will enter the building wearing hazardous material suits, and officials
feared that sight could fuel a panic. Day said false positives in
preliminary tests are common, and that the Federal Reserve has recorded
false positives on previous anthrax tests. "We believe that in the end,
we're going to have an event that's really going to become a nonevent," Day
said. "But when you get a lab result that gives you a preliminary positive,
you got to take that seriously."
While testing is under way Tuesday evening, postal employees will stay out
of the V Street postal-processing facility. Day said a laboratory in North
Carolina performed the test that gave a preliminary positive result on the
Federal Reserve mail, and that the test did not indicate the type or number
of spores that might be present.
Testing of 30 to 50 samples from the V Street facility will be conducted at
the postal office's laboratory at its Brentwood facility. One test will
involve a polymerase chain reaction, which allows scientists to identify a
bacteria or virus from its DNA. Getting results is a matter of hours. A
second anthrax test will involve collecting wet swabs from sites within the
V Street facility where the Federal Reserve mail is handled and sending
them to a laboratory, a process that takes days.
Two employees from the Brentwood facility in Northeast Washington died from
the inhalation form of anthrax in fall 2001 after that facility processed
at least one anthrax-laced letter sent to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Several anthrax-tainted letters were sent to the offices of Democratic US
senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont; to TV
network news offices in New York; and to a tabloid newspaper's newsroom in
Florida. Letters might have been sent other places, as well. Five people,
including the two postal employees, died after inhaling anthrax spores.
