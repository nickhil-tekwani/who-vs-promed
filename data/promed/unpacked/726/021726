Malaria in Great Exuma, Bahamas: anti-malarial recommendations for
travelers removed
-------------------------------------------------------
As of 13 Dec 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has removed recommendations for malaria preventive medication
(prophylaxis) for travel to Great Exuma, Bahamas. No new malaria
cases in travelers have been reported from the area. Travelers are
advised to follow standard CDC health recommendations for travel to
the Bahamas, including protection against mosquito and other insect
bites, but no longer need to take an antimalarial drug when visiting
these islands.

In August 2007, CDC received official reports of 2 confirmed malaria
cases in Great Exuma, Bahamas [see ProMED-mail 20070823.2771]. This
is an area where malaria transmission does not normally occur and for
which antimalarial drugs are not usually recommended. An outbreak of
malaria had previously occurred on Great Exuma in the late spring and
summer of 2006. That outbreak ended in September 2006. The Ministry
of Health in the Bahamas is continuing surveillance and control
measures in the area.

Because this is the 2nd malaria outbreak in 2 years in the Bahamas,
travelers to this region should always check the CDC website before
their trip in case future similar outbreaks occur. See the CDC
Travelers Health website for additional health recommendations for
travel to the Bahamas.
