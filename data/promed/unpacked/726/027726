Foot and mouth disease in South Africa: virus type SAT 2 in the FMD
controlled area
--------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease in South Africa was last reported to the OIE 15 Aug
2003. This information was received on (and dated) 1 Jul 2004 from Dr Emily
Mmamakgaba Mogajane, assistant director general, National Regulatory
Services, National Department of Agriculture, Pretoria:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 26-27 Jun 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location and No. of outbreaks: the eastern edge of the Buffer Zone of the
foot and mouth disease (FMD) Controlled Area*, next to Letaba Ranch in the
Limpopo Province (in the north eastern part of the country) 2 diptank areas
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / ... / 12 / ... / ... / ...
Diagnosis: during a routine surveillance programme, veterinary officials
detected 12 head of cattle with lesions which resembled FMD. The causal
agent -- FMD virus serotype SAT 2 -- was diagnosed at the Exotic Diseases
Division, Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute.
Epidemiology: current evidence from surveillance activities suggests that
the cases are confined to these 2 diptank areas.
Control measures: the FMD Controlled Area* is under constant surveillance
with twice-yearly vaccination of all cattle in the Buffer Zone and strict
movement control of all cloven-hoofed animals. The national and provincial
Departments of Agriculture have intensified the usual control measures in
the area and no cloven-hoofed animals or their products may leave the
Buffer Zone. The authorities expect that the situation can be brought under
control rapidly without undue effects on the agricultural industry as a whole.
The detection of positive cases in the Buffer Zone does not affect the
status of the OIE-recognised disease-free zone of South Africa, and thus
does not affect the existing export status of the country.
* Additional information on the controlled area: the Kruger National Park
(KNP) and the surrounding areas, as well as the northern borders of the
country are a declared FMD controlled area in terms of the Animal Diseases
Act <http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/Fmd/fmd.htm>.
- The KNP -- a national game reserve -- is the FMD Infected Zone.
- The Buffer Zone comprises the area bordering the western and southern
boundaries of the KNP -- about 350 km long and 10 to 20 km wide. All cattle
(70 000 head) in the Buffer Zone are vaccinated every 6 months and
inspected (by Veterinary Services) for FMD every week.

[Occasionally, last August for instance, FMD escapes from animals in the
Kruger National Park to the controlled area. This does not compromise the
FMD free zone as happened in KwaZulu-Natal in 2000 (pigs) and again in
Mpumalanga (cattle) 2001. - Mod.PC]
