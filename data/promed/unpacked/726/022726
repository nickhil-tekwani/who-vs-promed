http://www.straitstimes.com/news/asia/east-asia/story/hong-kong-cull-15000-chickens-after-h7n9-virus-found-20141231


A 68-year-old woman was hospitalised last Thu [25 Dec 2014] after returning to Hong Kong from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen [Guangdong] almost 2 weeks earlier, although it has not been confirmed where or how she contracted the virus. 10 people had previously been diagnosed with H7N9 in Hong Kong, including 3 who died. All had contracted the virus in mainland China, according to Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection [CHP].

The announcement came days after a woman was diagnosed with the virus, prompting the city to raise its alert level for avian influenza. In response to the new case - the city's first since early 2014 -- Hong Kong announced it was raising its response level in hospitals to "serious" from "alert", with extra precautions implemented from [Sun 28 Dec 2014].

The outbreak, which first emerged on the mainland in February 2013, has reignited fears that a bird flu virus could mutate to become easily transmissible between people, threatening to trigger a pandemic.

Hong Kong authorities said Wed [31 Dec 2014] they will cull 15 000 chickens after the deadly H7N9 virus was discovered in poultry imported from mainland China.

"The department will take measures to destroy a total of 15 000 live chickens at the Cheung Sha Wan market [New Kowloon, Hong Kong] starting this morning [31 Dec 2014]," the city's health minister Ko Wing-man told reporters at a press conference early [Wed 31 Dec 2014].
The facility will then be closed for 21 days for "comprehensive disinfection", Ko said. Imports from the mainland have also been suspended, he said.

The virus was discovered through a "rapid testing" system, introduced to check birds for the disease, in a sample of 120 chickens imported from the nearby Chinese city of Huizhou [Guangdong province], Ko said. The tests were done after a larger batch of chickens from the same area tested positive for the H7 strain of the virus. "The rapid testing showed... that this batch of chicken carries the H7N9 virus," Ko said.

Hong Kong slaughtered 20 000 chickens in January [2014] after the virus was found in poultry imported from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. A 4-month ban on live poultry imports from mainland China was then imposed to guard against the disease.

Hong Kong is particularly alert to the spread of viruses after an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] swept through the city in 2003, killing 299 people and infecting around 1800. There have been 469 cases of H7N9 in mainland China since 2013, according to Hong Kong's CHP.

http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1672918/hong-kong-could-ban-live-poultry-sales-amid-h7n9-bird-flu-scare-says


Live poultry sales could be banned in the city if industry workers failed to consider the public interest amid a bird flu scare, Secretary for Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man said.

His remarks come as wholesalers argue with the government over delivery arrangements for local live poultry, following the culling of
19 000 birds at Cheung Sha Wan wholesale market and a 3-week embargo on imported birds after samples from a farm in Huizhou, Guangdong tested positive for the deadly H7N9 strain of the virus.

9 local poultry wholesalers are threatening to cease trading until imports resume unless the government rethinks an arrangement under which all local chickens are gathered for inspection at Ta Kwu Ling [New Territories, Hong Kong] while the Cheung Sha Wan market is closed under the ban.

Ko said this morning [2 Jan 2014] that the government is unable to arrange another site to replace the new checkpoint, which is too small to allow traders to offload chickens from trucks for distribution to different vehicles bound for wet markets across the city.

"The city relies on the strict measures in the live poultry supply chain to prevent the public from the threat of bird flu," Ko said. "If the industry workers do not put aside [their self interest], I believe in the long term it is up to the public to decide whether to end the live poultry supply."

The government has employed consultants to study whether live poultry supplies should be stopped, Ko said. He stressed it is important that birds are moved directly from farm to retailer without mixing with other chickens, so the government can trace the supply chain. Ko urged wholesalers to alter their current logistics or use smaller delivery trucks to solve the problem.

But a live poultry wholesalers association said the government should allow them to offload live chickens and move them to different trucks for delivery to retailers. They threaten to stage a protest on [Sun 4 Jan 2014] if the government fails to respond to their demand.

In January last year [2014], 20 000 birds were culled and all live chicken sales banned for 3 weeks after a sample from a Guangdong supplier tested positive for bird flu. Both mainland and local sales were halted as Cheung Sha Wan wholesale market was closed for disinfection. The government paid more than HKD 10 million [about USD 1.3 million] in compensation to affected breeders and wholesalers.

Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said at the time that the affair raised questions over whether live poultry sales could continue in the city.
But local industry workers complained that the government had damaged their business and demanded a second site to allow the sale of local chickens. Responding to their demand, the government opened a new checkpoint on old farmland at Ta Kwu Ling a few months ago. Ko said it could be used to process chickens from local farms while the block on mainland imports remained.

[After detecting infection in a single sample (out of 120 or 1200 sampled?) the authorities have opted, as a precautionary preventive measure, to apply the stamping-out policy to all birds which were kept in the market and could have been exposed to the zoonotic LPAI H7N9 virus, namely chickens, chukars (a domesticated partridge species; see picture at http://tinyurl.com/n3v2s3c), and pigeons.

The veterinary authorities of Hong Kong (SAR-PRC) maintain already for several years a commendable, systematic prevention and control policy addressing the possible introduction of avian influenza and other zoonotic disease agents from the mainland. The policy includes periodical "free days" enabling disinfection of the market premises and facilities, as well as requirements for pre-export testing of the poultry consignments being conditional for permitting their transport from the mainland, and testing of representative samples upon arrival.

Could the recent discovery of LPAI H7N9 been viewed by them as a potential deficiency in the mainland's testing regime?

The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain responsible for human infections in China has been reported from Eastern China since March 2013, circulating mostly on live poultry markets. This virus strain is of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9), which means the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent (=subclinical). The birds are, in fact, the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied in apparently healthy animals, or -- as seen multiple times -- following human infection, humans playing the unfortunate role of virus sentinels.

According to Chinese sources, between 22 and 27 Dec 2014, human H7N9 cases were reported in Xinijiang (7 new cases), in Hong Kong (ex Guangdong, one case), in Zhejiang (4 cases, 2 deaths), and in Jiangsu (1 case, who died).

China's last report to the OIE on H7N9 detected in (tested) poultry, dates back to 9 Jul 2014 (see, with map of all "outbreaks", most of them discovered on live animal markets, not on farms, at http://tinyurl.com/kdu3zxo).
