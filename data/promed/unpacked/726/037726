In the recent post [PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza - Asia (27): Indonesia, zoo
birds], avian influenza virus was reported in Ragunan Zoo, Jakarta,
Indonesia. Of 27 samples from various birds, including pygmy chickens and
eagles, 19 tested positive. Management measures included closing of the zoo
to the public for one month, sterilization of the area, and killing
infected birds, unless they belonged to a protected species.
This report and the identity of the virus involved remain to be confirmed.
Another management option for the protection of captive collections of
endangered bird species is preventive vaccination. This option was used in
Dutch zoos during an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
(H7N7) in poultry in the Netherlands in 2003. When the area of the outbreak
threatened to encroach on Dutch zoos, the Dutch Federation of Zoos
requested permission from the European Commission for preventive
vaccination of zoo birds to avoid pre-emptive culling of valuable and
sometimes endangered bird species in their collections.
The European Commission granted permission (for details, see European
Commission directive,
<http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_105/l_10520030426en00340036.pdf>)
providing that the zoos fulfilled strict conditions. These conditions
included collection of blood before and after vaccination, registration of
all vaccinated birds, and a specific standstill of vaccinated animals and
products of vaccinated animals.
Birds in 10 zoos from the Netherlands were vaccinated with an
inactivated,adjuvanted H7N1 virus vaccine previously used in poultry. The
difference in the neuraminidase (N1 in the vaccine strain instead of N7 in
the field strain) made it possible to distinguish vaccinated birds from
infected birds. Of 211 birds in 13 orders tested, 81.5 per cent developed a
titre of 40 or higher, which is considered protective in chickens. The
results of this study (see abstract below) suggest that vaccination with a
heterologous strain is a useful tool for the protection of birds in zoos
against highly pathogenic H7 virus infection, and is a suitable alternative
or additional measure for confinement and pre-emptive culling when
implemented together with virological monitoring and strict bio-security
measures at zoos.
We are aware that the 2003 outbreak of H7N7 virus in the Netherlands
differs in certain aspects from the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 virus in Asia.
Despite these differences, we strongly feel that preventive vaccination of
bird collections in zoos by use of a high-quality, adjuvanted H5 virus
vaccine should be considered as part of the protective management strategy
against H5N1 virus infection. Definitely, when collections of endangered
bird species are involved, this option should not be neglected.

Abstract:
In 2003 an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N7)
struck poultry in the Netherlands. A European Commission directive
(Commission Decision 2003/291/EC of 25 April 2003) made vaccination of
valuable species in zoo collections possible under strict conditions. We
determined pre- and post-vaccination antibody titres in 211 birds by
haemagglutination inhibition test as a measure of vaccine efficacy. After
booster vaccination, 81.5 per cent of vaccinated birds developed a titre of
40, while overall geometric mean titre (GMT) was 190 (95 per cent
confidence interval: 144 to 251). Birds of the orders Anseriformes,
Galliformes and Phoenicopteriformes showed higher GMT and larger
percentages developed titres 40 than those of the other orders. Antibody
response decreased with increasing mean body weight in birds 1.5 kg body
weight. In the vicinity of the outbreak, H7N7 was detected by RT-PCR in
wild species (mallards and mute swans) kept in captivity together with
infected poultry, illustrating the potential threat of transmission from
poultry into other avian species, and the importance of protecting valuable
avian species by means of vaccination.

[Thanks very much to Joost Philippa, Thijs Kuiken, and Albert Osterhaus for
providing unique information on the importance of vaccination as one
control strategy for the current Jakarta Ragunan Zoo dilemma. It is
extremely helpful to garner the experience of someone who has used
vaccination as a preventive measure in a zoo setting, especially since they
were systematic enough about their observations to yield a publication. We
are including the abstract of the associated study to be published in
Vaccine and the author's contact information because this information may
be highly valuable to those involved in the current outbreak.
Our Dutch colleagues make one point that should be emphasized -- the
situation in Jakarta is different from the Netherlands in some significant
respects. Foremost is the propensity of this H5N1 to cause human deaths and
that Jakarta itself has been declared an "extraordinary case region".
Nevertheless, the vaccination strategy detailed above does appear to have
several advantages when combined with strict biosecurity. First, it can
differentiate between vaccinated birds and H5N1-infected birds. Secondly,
if the protection levels are adequate in the captive birds, zoo keepers and
other personnel would have enhanced protection against being infected.
Finally, vaccination as one tool in a comprehensive strategy might allow
for the preservation of very rare or endangered species until H5N1 can be
controlled and possibly eliminated from Jakarta. - Mod.PC]
