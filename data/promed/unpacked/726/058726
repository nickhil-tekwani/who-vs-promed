Penang is conducting checks on goat milk suppliers and has culled 98
of the animals after a 7-year-old boy became the 1st person to be
infected with brucellosis [see comment].

Brucellosis is caused by the _Brucella_ bacterium and is a disease
mainly found in cattle, swine, goats and sheep.

The boy fell sick after drinking raw goat's milk. He was admitted to
a private hospital after coming down with fever on 24 Apr 2010, said
state exco member Phee Boon Poh.

He was transferred to the Penang Hospital several days later after
failing to respond to the antibiotics given.

Also called Bang's disease, or undulant fever, brucellosis is a
highly contagious disease caused by ingestion of unsterilised milk or
meat from infected animals, or close contact with their secretions.

It causes flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and swollen glands, and can
result in complications like bone and joint lesions, encephalitis,
meningitis and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Phee said that following the incident, the state Veterinary Services
Department began conducting checks on milk suppliers.

"We hope suppliers from Kulim, Kuala Ketil and Lunas will heed the
department's advice to prevent the spread of the disease," he said.

Phee said the department had so far tested 3243 serum samples of
goats from 11 farms in the state. "98 of the goats were culled after
the test results came in positive," he said. He said the owners of
the culled goats were paid compensation of RM 5.60 [USD 1.65] per
kilo.

Phee advised the public to boil milk before drinking. He also urged
those selling mutton, including for the coming fasting month, to
ensure the meat was free from the disease.

"An awareness campaign will be held on 27 Jul 2010 by the various
government departments and the municipal councils," he said.

[Penang is an island in the Strait of Malacca off the northwestern
coast of West (Peninsular) Malaysia, part of the state of Pulau
Pinang. According to the Malaysian annual reports to the OIE, human
brucellosis has been recorded in Malaysia during 2009, though no
quantitative data are available and no details on the bacteria
species involved (in humans) given. As to the disease situation in
animals, it was reported that both _Brucella abortus_ and _B.
melitensis_ infections have been confirmed but no clinical disease
recorded. _B. melitensis_ was, reportedly, present during 2009 in the
following 14 states: Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri,
Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Pulau Pinang, Sabah, Sarawak,
Selangor, Terengganu. _B. suis_ seems to be absent.

The current event, involving goats, is likely to be caused by _B.
melitensis_. Was the decision of the authorities to apply "test and
slaughter" policy related to the disease regarded as a new
introduction to this island, or is a similar policy applied
throughout Malaysia?

Wider surveillance activities in small ruminants and in bovines in
Penang deserve to be considered; details of the brucella species
identified are expected. - Mod.AS]
