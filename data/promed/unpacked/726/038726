[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is one of the most important infectious diseases of cattle in Africa. Naive herds can experience losses up to 80 per cent, and many cattle that survive remain chronic carriers. These carriers may suffer from recurrent low-grade fever, loss of condition, and respiratory signs upon exercise. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_bovine_pleuropneumonia.pdf.

According to information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, 159 of 178 OIE Members have provided information related to CBPP (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries).

Of the 159 OIE members who reported, the disease is indicated as "never occurred" in 90, "absent" in 45, "suspected" in 2 (Kenya and Rwanda), "infection present (with no clinical disease) in 3 (Malaysia, Somalia and Tanzania), "restricted to certain zone" in one (Gabon), and "demonstrated clinical disease" in 18 (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote D'Ivore, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Uganda, Congo (Dem. Rep. of the), Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Sudan and Zambia).

CBPP is one of the diseases for which the OIE has official recognition status; see commentary in ProMED-mail archive number 20130906.1926591.

In 2012, one outbreak of CBPP was reported in Senegal in the Tambacounda region. That event was resolved on 28 Dec 2012. See OIE's archive http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=12596 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13907.

The Kolda region, where the current outbreak is located, borders the Tambacounda region. The location map of regions of Senegal can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Regions_of_Senegal.svg.

Some photos showing gross lesions of CBPP can be seen at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/clinical-signs-photos.php?name=contagious-bovine-pleuropneumonia.

Since humans are not known to be susceptible to CBPP, there is no public health risk http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CBPP-EN.pdf. - Mod.CRD
