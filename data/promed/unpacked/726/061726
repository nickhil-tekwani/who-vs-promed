As of 18 Jan 2011, an outbreak of measles in Unity State [Al Wahda]
has affected 95 people, killing 4 of them according to health
officials. The 4 killed were from Mayom county, which had 79 further
cases affected. Four cases each have been reported in Leer, Mayiandit
and Rubkotna counties.

The director general of the state Ministry of Health, Dr Manong Thot
Teny, said that the spread of the disease had been caused by returnee
children from north Sudan who had not been vaccinated before they
arrived in the state.

Teny said that they had invited the government of South Sudan earlier
to witness the health situation of returnees. Officials say they are
carrying out an awareness and vaccination campaign to address the
issue. In the past 2 months of 2010, over 55 000 people returned to
south Sudan ahead of the region's recently completed independence
referendum.

Teny said that the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) need to
consider the health status of returnees. "We in Unity State have
invited their partnership, especially the World Health Organization,
UNICEF and other international organizations, to extend their
assistance in the entire 10 states of South Sudan, Unity State in
particular." Unity State has seen a high number of returnees, and more
are expected, with results from the referendum vote expected in early
February 2011.

Earlier this month [January 2011], the US envoy to Sudan, Scott
Gration, promised to build educational and health services facilities
by making partnerships with both State and Regional government in
order to establish infrastructure in this underdeveloped region.

[The World Health Organisation map of immunization coverage with
measles-containing vaccines in infants shows that in 2006,
immunization coverage in Sudan lagged behind that in most other
regions of the world. This map can be accessed at:
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/big_measles_map_coverage.jpg>).

Unity State will become part of the new independent country of South
Sudan in February 2011, depending on the outcome of the current
referendum in southern Sudan. Implementation of comprehensive measles
vaccination will be among the immediate tasks of the new administration.
