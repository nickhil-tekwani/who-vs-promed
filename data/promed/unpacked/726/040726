Authorities warned hikers and campers that two squirrels carrying bubonic
plague had been found in a Southern California wilderness area. Moise
Mizrahi, a spokesman for the San Diego County Department of Environmental
Health, said crews are posting signs and handing out fliers after routine
tests on squirrels at William Heise County Park in southeastern California
determined that they were infected.
