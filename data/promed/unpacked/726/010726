Over 1000 persons were affected following the outbreak of chikungunya [virus infection] in 3 blocks of Jalpaiguri district in past 2 months, official sources said.

An estimated 400-450 fell ill in past few days alone in the Madarihat, Kalchini and Dhupguri blocks of the district, the sources said.

The symptoms confirmed chikungunya outbreak which is caused [virus transmitted] by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes due to the habit of labourers of tea garden to keep stored water for drinking as stagnant water gives birth to the larvae.

A medical team went to the area.

The ailing persons had been taken to local health centre, hospitals.

Though unconfirmed reports said 8 deaths had been reported in the area in May-June, the health department did not confirm any death as caused by any mosquito-borne disease.

[This report provides no information about the basis for the chikungunya virus diagnosis, or how it was differentiated from dengue virus infections. Chikungunya virus infections are seldom, if ever, fatal. Chikungunya virus is endemic in many parts of India, and sporadic cases occur there frequently. The last reported outbreak in West Bengal state was in 2008 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080102.0013). This alphavirus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes.
