A recently discovered virus in a Russian bat that is similar to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, is likely capable of infecting humans and, if it were to spill over, is resistant to current vaccines.

A team led by researchers in Washington State University's Paul G Allen School for Global Health found spike proteins from the bat virus, named Khosta-2, can infect human cells and is resistant to both the monoclonal antibodies and serum from individuals vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2. Both Khosta-2 and SARS- CoV-2 belong to the same sub-category of coronaviruses known as sarbecoviruses.

"Our research further demonstrates that sarbecoviruses circulating in wildlife outside of Asia - even in places like western Russia where the Khosta-2 virus was found -- also pose a threat to global health and ongoing vaccine campaigns against SARS-CoV-2," said Michael Letko, WSU virologist and corresponding author of the study published in the journal PLoS Pathogens [see reference below].

Letko said the discovery of Khosta-2 highlights the need to develop universal vaccines to protect against sarbecoviruses in general, rather than just against known variants of SARS-CoV-2.

While hundreds of sarbecoviruses have been discovered in recent years, predominantly in bats in Asia, the majority are not capable of infecting human cells. The Khosta-1 and Khosta-2 viruses were discovered in Russian bats in late 2020, and it initially appeared they were not a threat to humans.

"Genetically, these weird Russian viruses looked like some of the others that had been discovered elsewhere around the world, but because they did not look like SARS-CoV-2, no one thought they were really anything to get too excited about," Letko said. "But when we looked at them more, we were really surprised to find they could infect human cells. That changes a little bit of our understanding of these viruses, where they come from, and what regions are concerning."

Letko teamed with a pair of WSU faculty members, 1st author viral ecologist Stephanie Seifert and viral immunologist Bonnie Gunn, to study the 2 newly discovered viruses. They determined Khosta-1 posed low risk to humans, but Khosta-2 demonstrated some troubling traits.

The team found that like SARS-CoV-2, Khosta-2 can use its spike protein to infect cells by attaching to a receptor protein, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found throughout human cells. They next set out to determine if current vaccines protect against the new virus.

Using serum derived from human populations vaccinated for COVID-19, the team saw that Khosta-2 was not neutralized by current vaccines. They also tested serum from people who were infected with the omicron variant, but the antibodies, too, were ineffective.

Fortunately, Letko said the new virus is lacking some of the genes believed to be involved in pathogenesis in humans. There is a risk, however, of Khosta-2 recombining with a 2nd virus-like SARS-CoV-2.

"When you see SARS-2 has this ability to spill back from humans and into wildlife, and then there are other viruses like Khosta-2 waiting in those animals with these properties we really don't want them to have, it sets up this scenario where you keep rolling the dice until they combine to make a potentially riskier virus," Letko said.

In addition to Letko, Seifert, and Gunn, co-authors of this study include Shuangyi Bai and Stephen Fawcett of WSU as well as Elizabeth Norton, Kevin Zwezdaryk, and James Robinson of Tulane University.

"_Rhinolophus_ species (horseshoe bats) were found to carry a diverse group of SARS-like coronaviruses (Sarbecoronavirus) and, thus, are thought to be the natural reservoirs of this group of viruses. The genome of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% and 59 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV RaTG13, respectively. The Russian bat species in which Khosta-2 was isolated is a lesser horseshoe bat, _R. hipposideros_, captured near the Black Sea. This bat species is widely distributed in Europe and Northern Africa. Sarbecoronaviruses with affinity to the human ACE2 receptor are a major concern as they constitute a hazard for a new emerging infectious disease. - Mod.PMB
