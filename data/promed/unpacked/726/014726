1st Report on the occurrence of _Grapevine leafroll-associated
viruses 5_ and _9_ in Tunisian grapevines
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A previous study has shown that _Grapevine leafroll-associated
viruses_ (GLRaV) -1, -2, and -3 are present in Tunisian grapevines,
and GLRaV-3 is the predominant virus associated with leafroll
disease. A survey was conducted in table grapes to identify other
viruses associated with this disease.

Samples of dormant canes were collected and screened by ELISA [Enzyme
Linked Immunosorbent Assay] specific to GLRaV-5. Serological analysis
revealed that nearly 47 percent of the samples were infected with
GLRaV-5. To confirm GLRaV-5 identification and identify other
leafroll viruses, vines with severe leafroll symptoms were collected
and total RNA extracts were obtained from 6 samples and tested by
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] for
GLRaV-5 and GLRaV-9. Results showed that 1 of 6 and 5 of 6 of the
samples were infected with GLRaV-5 and GLRaV-9, respectively. The
RT-PCR obtained sequences showed 99.1 percent nucleotide identity and
94.8 percent amino acid similarity with an isolate of GLRaV-5, and
97.6 percent nucleotide identity and 94.8 percent amino acid
similarity with an isolate of GLRaV-9.

The occurrence of GLRaV-9 has previously been reported in California
and Australia. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report on the
occurrence of GLRaV-5 and -9 in Tunisian grapevines. The widespread
occurrence of GLRaV-5 and -9 is probably due either to the presence
of their putative vectors, _Planococcus ficus_ (Signoret) and
_Planococcus citri_ (Risso), or by propagation using infected local
source material. Further studies are in progress to verify the
implication of indigenous mealybugs in the spread of these viruses.

Bois noir phytoplasma infected plants found in Ontario, Canada
---------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the changing status of grapevine phytoplasmas in France, in
2006 the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) implemented grapevine
phytoplasma surveys in support of stronger import restrictions to
Canada. In 2007, the survey in Ontario revealed 2 imported grapevine
plants infected with the phytoplasma causing bois noir (black wood)
disease. The plants originated from an area of France where the
disease is known to be endemic. They had been imported prior to
implementation of mandatory hot water treatment for imports.

The known bois noir insect vector _Hyalesthes obsoletus_ has still
not been recorded in North America and grapevine is considered by
European researchers to be a dead-end host for the phytoplasma.

The infected plants in Ontario were removed in November 2007 and
surveys around the site of the removed plants found no other infected
or symptomatic plants. To confirm that the eradication has been
successful, follow-up surveys will be carried out during successive
growing seasons.

[Leafroll viruses
------------------
Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in
grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9
different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to
different genera within the family _Closteroviridae_ have been
reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and
interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced
fruit size, sugar content, and yield. GLRaV 3 is transmitted by a
mealy bug, and similar vectors are suspected to be involved in the
spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are spread by
grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their
long-lived host over time by human activities.

Symptoms of viral leaf roll disease vary on different grape varieties
resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms
at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular
threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular
diagnostic methods for _Closteroviridae_ have been developed and can
be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

Bois noir
---------
Bois noir (BN) is caused by a phytoplasma belonging to the stolbur
taxonomic group (16SrXII-A, type member_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
solani). BN and similar diseases have been reported from countries in
Europe and the Mediterranean region and are also suspected to occur
in Chile and South Africa. BN was reported for the first time in
Canada in 2006 in British Columbia (see ProMED post
no. 20061209.3473). Symptoms include reduced growth, leaf yellowing
or discolouration, downward rolling of leaves, and reduced quality
and quantity of fruit. Symptoms are not uniform, and may appear on
some or all shoots of infected vines. The BN phytoplasma is spread by
grafting and the planthopper vector _Hyalesthes obsoletus_. The
vector feeds only occasionally on grapevine and actually prefers
herbaceous weeds which are important pathogen reservoirs. BN
incidence has been shown to be closely linked to vector numbers in
Europe, and the vector has not been detected in Canada. Nevertheless,
for eradication to succeed it will be vital to prevent local spread
by grafting from undetected pathogen sources as well as future
undetected introductions.

Stolbur phytoplasmas have been reported from Europe and parts of Asia
and Africa affecting a range of important crops including tomato,
potato, capsicum, eggplant and strawberry. Recently, maize has been
reported as one of very few monocot hosts of the group (see ProMED
post no. 20070607.1844).
