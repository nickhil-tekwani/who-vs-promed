Health officials in Placer County say a Tahoe-area resident died after contracting [a] hantavirus.

According to a statement from county health officials, rodents at the home where the resident lived and worked were the likely source, health officials said.

They said the public is not at risk from the source tied to the resident's death.

"We are very sorry to announce that [a] hantavirus was involved in this tragic death of one of our community members," said Placer County Health Officer Rob Oldham said in a press release. "This unfortunate loss reminds us that hantaviruses are very dangerous. But the silver lining is that hantavirus infections are quite rare and can be prevented. It appears that the source associated with this fatal infection has been cleaned."

Placer County includes Lake Tahoe's northwest shore from about Homewood to the Nevada border near Crystal Bay.

Rodents can carry hantaviruses and spread them via their urine, droppings and saliva.

The health officials' press release also included a list of activities that increase risk of contraction and another list of tips to minimize risk.

Some activities that increase the risk of exposure to hantaviruses in California include:
- Opening and cleaning a previously unused building, especially in rural settings.
- House cleaning, if there is a rodent infestation, especially by sweeping or dry mopping. (Signs of infestation may include droppings, gnaw marks, nests, noises and more.)
- Construction, utility and pest control workers can be exposed when they work in crawl spaces, under houses or in vacant buildings.
- Campers and hikers can be exposed when they use infested trail shelters or camp in rodent habitat.

To minimize the risk of hantavirus infection, follow these simple measures:
- Avoid contact with all wild rodents, their droppings and nesting materials.
- Before entering an enclosed area that may be infested with rodents, allow it to air out for at least 30 minutes.
- Do not dry sweep or vacuum areas that rodents have potentially contaminated.
- Surfaces that rodents may have contaminated with urine or droppings should be made wet with a 10 percent bleach solution or a commercial disinfectant following label directions before mopping up.
- Promptly dispose of all cleaning materials when done, and thoroughly wash hands and clothes.
- Examine the outside of all buildings and seal any holes or other areas that would let rodents get inside.
- Store all food items securely in rodent-proof containers.

[Although not stated explicitly that this patient developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the fact that she died of the infection suggests that she has this illness. There is no mention of the circumstances under which she might have acquired her infection, nor the laboratory tests used to make the diagnosis.

The hantavirus involved in this California case above and other cases that occur sporadically in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions mentioned above and those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at the URL above and at: http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
