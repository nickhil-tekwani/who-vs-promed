Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Canada: update
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[Subsequent to my correction of misstatements in my Moderator's comment
concerning the fatal case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in British
Columbia (see references below), Dr Mike Drebot has provided the following
additional information on hantaviruses in Canada. - Mod.CP]
Currently, we have documented 62 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases
in Canada. All but one of these cases were identified in the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. The other case was
identified in the province of Quebec, the only patient ever identified east
of Manitoba (despite the fact that we have found infected deer mice from
British Columbia to Newfoundland). All cases appear to have been associated
with Sin Nombre virus. The other hantavirus we have in Canada is Prospect
Hill virus; but to my knowledge, there is no evidence to indicate that it is
a human pathogen. Of interest, we have also documented an imported case from
Argentina (involving a Saskatchewan resident who was visiting a site within
the Buenos Aires district). Blood clots from this individual were PCR
positive for an Andes-like virus.
