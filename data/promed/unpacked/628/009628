Gombe state government on Thu 27 May 2021 confirmed that 7 persons, including a 2-year-old boy, have died from the outbreak of cholera in Akko local government area of the state.

The state Commissioner for health, Dr. Habu Dahiru, who confirmed this to journalists at the Heal Emergency Operation Centre, said the 2-year-old boy died in Kalajanga village of Akko local government area.

Dahiru said that, so far, 32 cases have been treated and discharged, while 6 are currently on admission. He added that a Rapid Response Team was deployed immediately; cases were confirmed in the laboratory, and a free treatment center for cases was established at BOGO Model Primary Health Centre.

"The onset of the rainy season at times heralds the period for cholera outbreaks attributable to drinking contaminated water. Cholera is characterized by severe diarrhea and vomiting and can be rapidly fatal if prompt and urgent actions are not taken toward the management of cases and effective infection prevention control. It is easily spread in the community if control measures are sub-optimal," said Dahiru.

According to him, with the threshold of confirmed cases reached, "I hereby declare an outbreak of cholera in Garko ward of Akko local government area." The commissioner announced that he has activated a multi-sectoral Incident Management System (IMS) for a prompt and coordinated response to the outbreak.

"You may recall that a similar mechanism was used for the success recorded by the state in controlling a similar outbreak in Liji Community in March this year [2021]," he said.

Dahiru reminded the public that cholera can be prevented by the use of clean water, consumption of hygienically prepared meals, particularly of uncooked food, adding that personal hygiene and environmental sanitation are also proven preventive measures.
