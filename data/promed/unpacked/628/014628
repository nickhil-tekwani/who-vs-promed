Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever: Treatment Protocols, Request for Information
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I wish to know from any of those clinicians working with Ebola patients in
Gulu, Mbarara, or Masindi, whether any of the following treatments have
been helpful in the management of their Ebola hemorrhagic fever cases.
Firstly, was Novalgin used in the treatment of any patient? What was your
experience with the use of this drug?
Secondly, has tetracycline been used and, if so, what was your experience?
I also wish to learn from anybody else whether there is an effective
screening tool for those exposed to this virus, such as the detection of
IgM antibodies during the incubation period.

[Dr. Chesang is working in the Kenyan province with the longest border with
Uganda. Knowledge of the experience of clinicians and others working with
Ebola victims in Uganda would clearly be advantageous to Dr. Chesang and
others in surrounding countries. ProMED-mail can be a route for the rapid
dissemination of such information. - Mod.CP
