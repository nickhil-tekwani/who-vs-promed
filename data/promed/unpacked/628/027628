[1] UK CJD surveillance as of Mon 2 Jul 2012
Date: Mon 2 Jul 2012
Source: UK National CJD Surveillance Unit, monthly statistics [edited]
http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm


The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 2 Jul 2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patient remains alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and none so far in 2012.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2012
---------------------------------------------------
During 2012 so far [as of 2 Jul 2012], there have been 50 referrals, 32 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, none of GSS [Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease], 2 cases of familial CJD, no cases of vCJD, and no cases of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2937 referrals, 1339 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 96 cases of familial CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 45 cases of GSS.

[The absence of new cases during the 1st half of 2012 is encouraging and suggests that the outbreak may be terminating. A ProMED-mail HealthMap for the UK can be found at http://healthmap.org/r/1lNY. - Mod.CP]

Prion diseases are also referred to as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). They occur in humans and animals, primarily affecting the central nervous system. They can be sporadic (spontaneous), familial (genetic/inherited), or acquired (transmitted by infection). The hallmark of these diseases is the presence of microscopic vacuolization of the brain tissue, called spongiform degeneration (meaning that the tissue deteriorates, developing a spongy texture), and an abnormal protein, called scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), prion, or abnormal prion protein. The PrPSc, unlike other known infectious diseases, is believed to result from a change in the conformation or shape of a normal protein called cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is present in large amounts in the brain as well as in other tissues. Since the abnormal prion protein cannot be broken down through the body's normal process, it aggregates mostly in the brain causing degeneration and disease. The abnormal prion protein is often infectious and, under certain conditions, can transmit the disease. Currently, there are no cures for prion diseases. The average worldwide occurrence of prion diseases is approximately one case per million people per year. (for details, see Caughey B. British Medical Bulletin 2003; 66: 109)

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the commonest of the human prion diseases. There are 3 types of CJD: 1) sporadic, also called spontaneous, for which the cause is not known; 2) familial, also called genetic or inherited, which is due to a defect in the prion protein gene; and 3) acquired, which is transmitted by infection due to exposure to the infectious prion from contaminated meat or from transplant of contaminated tissues or use of contaminated instruments during surgical procedures.

[The figures suggest that as a consequence of improvements in diagnosis, the annual numbers of cases of prion disease have now reached a plateau without detection of any human cases of vCJD, a reassuring situation.

[3] Prion transmission by blood transfusion

Highly efficient prion transmission by blood transfusion
By: Andreoletti O, Litaise C, Simmons H, Corbiere F, Lugan S, et al.

Abstract
--------
It is now clearly established that the transfusion of blood from variant CJD (v-CJD) infected individuals can transmit the disease. Since the number of asymptomatic infected donors remains unresolved, inter-individual v-CJD transmission through blood and blood derived products is a major public health concern. Current risk assessments for transmission of v-CJD by blood and blood derived products by transfusion rely on infectious titers measured in rodent models of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) using intra-cerebral (IC) inoculation of blood components. To address the biological relevance of this approach, we compared the efficiency of TSE transmission by blood and blood components when administrated either through transfusion in sheep or by intra-cerebral inoculation (IC) in transgenic mice (tg338) over-expressing ovine PrP. Transfusion of 200 microlitre of blood from asymptomatic infected donor sheep transmitted prion disease with 100 per cent efficiency, thereby displaying greater virulence than the transfusion of 200 mL of normal blood spiked with brain homogenate material containing 103ID50 as measured by intracerebral inoculation of tg338 mice (ID50 IC in tg338). This was consistent with a whole blood titer greater than 103.6 ID50 IC in tg338 per mL. However, when the same blood samples were assayed by IC inoculation into tg338, the infectious titers were less than 32 ID per mL. Whereas the transfusion of crude plasma to sheep transmitted the disease with limited efficacy, white blood cells (WBC) displayed a similar ability to whole blood to infect recipients. Strikingly, fixation of WBC with paraformaldehyde did not affect the infectivity titer as measured in tg338 but dramatically impaired disease transmission by transfusion in sheep. These results demonstrate that TSE transmission by blood transfusion can be highly efficient and that this efficiency is more dependent on the viability of transfused cells than the level of infectivity measured by IC inoculation.

Author summary
--------------
In the UK, several v-CJD cases have been identified in patients that received blood or blood-derived products prepared from incubating asymptomatic donors. Since there is no screening test to identify infected donors, procedural risk reduction measures remain the only protection against v-CJD transfusion risk. These measures rely, in part, on the assumptions that (i) the level of infectivity in blood is low and (ii) the risk of blood borne transmission is directly correlated with the infectious titer of blood and blood products. Using a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) animal model, we have provided evidence that despite a very low infectious titer in blood as measured by inoculation into brain, the transfusion of 0.2 mL of blood from asymptomatic infected donors is sufficient to transmit the disease with a 100 per cent efficacy. We further demonstrated that this high efficiency of disease transmission is crucially dependant on the viability of the transfused white blood cells rather than on their infectious titer. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of TSE diseases and require revision of some of the key assumptions of the v-CJD blood borne risk assessments.
