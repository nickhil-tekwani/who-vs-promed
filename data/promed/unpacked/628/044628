Officials with Island Health are reporting a sharp increase in _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) disease on Vancouver Island in the last 2 months. This outbreak is affecting people experiencing homelessness, unstable housing, or supportive housing and those using substances including drugs that are inhaled.

Hib has infected at least 8 people on the island and led to at least one death. Prior to this year [2022], rates of Hib have been extremely low for the past decade (between 0-1 cases per year) due to excellent control through the universal childhood vaccination program.

Chief medical health officer for Island Health Dr. RÃ©ka Gustafson said, "We expect to see one or no such infections in Island Health in a calendar year. We tend to see less than 3 in the entire province in a calendar year, so 8 in less than a calendar year and, more importantly, 6 in the last few weeks is really a significant change."

Hib disease can take many forms, including meningitis, bacteremia, periorbital or other cellulitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pericarditis, epiglottitis, or pneumonia. Onset of symptoms is usually abrupt and may include fever, headache, lethargy, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and irritability. Progressive stupor or coma is common with meningitis. Case fatality can be as high as 5% for meningitis presentations and neurologic sequelae, including deafness in 15-20% of survivors. Coinfection or preceding infection with other respiratory pathogens can also occur.

Individuals may transfer the organism to close contacts though droplet spread by coughing and sneezing. Sharing of droplet- or saliva-containing items including food, drink, and equipment for substance use is also a risk for transmission. Unimmunized and under-immunized people are most susceptible to Hib disease. Given decreased circulation of Hib since the introduction of vaccine, natural immunity in the adult population has likely reduced, and many adults will not have received Hib vaccination as children. Hib vaccine was introduced in BC in 1986 and has been part of the childhood immunization schedule since that time. The vaccine is very effective in preventing disease as well as reducing community transmission.

[The ages of those affected are not reported nor is the manifestations in those patients. In the prevaccination times, Hib was not common at all in adults. This small cluster may be related to cases in individuals old enough not to be vaccinated as a child and a possible current drop in childhood Hib vaccinations.

When I was a medical student rotating through pediatrics at the Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, in the early 1970s prior to the introduction of type b _H. influenzae_ vaccines, a day did not go by without an admission for invasive Hib disease.

_Haemophilus influenzae_ is a small Gram negative coccobacillus with several antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharide subtypes (a-f). There are also unencapsulated, nontypable strains. _H. influenzae_ colonizes the nasopharynx and spreads from person to person by respiratory droplets. _H. influenzae_ type b (Hib) strains are the most pathogenic due to their propensity to cause invasive disease, especially meningitis and bacteremia, although other encapsulated strains also can cause invasive disease. Hib virulence factors include a unique polysaccharide capsule (polyribosylribitol phosphate, or PRP) as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the biological activity of which, although chemically different from the LPS of the Enterobacterales, appears to be similar to that of other Gram negative LPS.

The prevalence of Hib invasive disease (for example, meningitis, bacteremia, metastatic foci of infection) peaks in infants aged 6 months to 3 years, which corresponds to the period when blood has been found to lack bactericidal antibody against Hib, whereas the blood of neonates (with transplacentally acquired antibody), older children, and adults is bactericidal for Hib. This activity is due to antibody against the type b capsular polysaccharide.

Hib infections have declined dramatically since Hib capsular polysaccharide conjugated to protein antigens vaccines became available. Prior to the widespread and routine immunization of children against type b organisms, Hib was the commonest cause of pediatric bacterial meningitis in the USA. In the pre-Hib vaccine era, about 20 000 instances of invasive Hib disease occurred annually. Since use of Hib conjugate vaccines began, the number of cases of invasive Hib disease has decreased by more than 99%.

This decline has been attributed to the conjugate vaccine's effect on preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib, which decreases spread of Hib in the community and thus creates a barrier around unimmunized children because of the effect of herd immunity. With increasing trends related to anti-vaccination movements, more cases may be seen. - Mod.LL
