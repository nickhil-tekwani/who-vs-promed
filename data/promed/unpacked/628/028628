Authorities in the the central Polish town of Wloclawek are investigating an outbreak of gas gangrene at 1 of the local hospitals, which has already killed at least 1 person.

A 75 year old woman was taken to hospital on Saturday, 18 Apr 2015, suffering from an orthopedic issue. The doctors made a diagnosis but the woman refused treatment which could have saved her life. She changed her mind a few hours later, but by then it was too late. A 2nd patient, an 87 year old woman, has also died infected with gas gangrene, but hospital authorities have not confirmed that the bacteria were the reason for her death. Yet another patient, a 50 year old man has been diagnosed with the bacterium. His condition is stable.

Sanitary officers are investigating the source of the outbreak, and no more patients are being accepted at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology at the Provincial Hospital in Wloclawek.

Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection which produces gas in gangrene-infected tissues. Amputation is usually the only effective treatment.

[It is not clear if the cases were hospital-acquired infection or not. A nosocomial cluster of _Clostridium perfringes_-associated myonecrosis would be quite unusual and might imply a health care-associated source such as gauze or other wound dressing contaminated with bacterial spores or inadequate debridement of traumatic wounds that might occur after a catastrophic natural disaster such as an earthquake.

The following is from a previous post on clostridial myonecrosis by my colleague Mod.ML:

"Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive, frequently fatal, necrotizing infection of muscle that is usually caused by _Clostridium perfringens_, and thus is also called clostridial myonecrosis. Gas gangrene usually involves traumatic civilian and war wounds, but can also involve surgical wounds, particularly after colon or biliary surgery. Clostridial uterine myonecrosis can complicate a septic abortion.

"Rarely, outbreaks of gas gangrene have been reported among injecting illicit drug users, usually of heroin (see
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/gangrene-bacterium-blamed-for-drug-deaths-715317.html) or methamphetamine; gas gangrene has also been reported following injections of medications, such as epinephrine, that can cause tissue ischemia.

"Clostridia are commonly present in soil and in the normal colon, and frequently contaminate open, traumatic wounds, although rarely produce gas gangrene. (Gas gangrene develops in less than 1-2 percent of these wounds.) Devitalized tissue, ischemia, foreign bodies in the wound, and concurrent wound infection with other microorganisms facilitate growth of clostridia and their elaboration of toxins.

"Rapid diagnosis is facilitated by characteristic clinical findings, identification of typical 'box-car'-shaped Gram positive bacilli in aspirates from the infected muscle or bullae, and muscle involvement and gas in the muscle on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the wound. Treatment includes prompt and extensive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and removal of foreign bodies from the wound, accompanied by appropriate antibiotic therapy.

"Person-to-person transmission is said to be rare and outbreaks, other than among injecting drug users, are very unusual. Consequently,
hospitalized patients are usually not isolated."
