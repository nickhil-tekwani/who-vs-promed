Suspected Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Cases Under Investigation
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) were
notified this morning of the death of a 4-year old boy of suspected hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The boy fell ill on Sun 31 Dec 2000. His
condition deteriorated in the early hours of Wed 3 Jan 2001 at home and
subsequently he died on the way to hospital. Postmortem investigations are
in progress.
Preliminary investigations revealed that 3 Singaporean families comprising
6 adults and 7 children, including the deceased, had recently travelled
together. Six of the 7 children became ill several days after returning to
Singapore. The 4-year old who died and 2 others had symptoms suggestive of
HFMD. As a precautionary measure, all the children who travelled together
have been placed under observation at the KK Women's and Children's
Hospital. All are in stable condition.
Pre-school centers are being reminded to observe proper hygiene and
sanitation in their premises and isolate any child who is unwell. Parents
are reminded not to send any child who is unwell to school but to seek
medical attention and let the child rest at home.

[Last October, an outbreak of HFMD led to a closure of all childcare
centers, wading pools and play areas in public places for between 2 weeks
and a month to break the transmission of the disease. Last year the disease
was said to have caused the death of 4 children and infected 2000 others.
Currently, the number of HFMD cases in Singapore is at a very low level.
Over the last 8 weeks, there was an average of 50 cases a week. In the last
2 weeks of December 2000, there were 45 and 29 cases respectively. - Mod.CP
