With regards to the comment in the above report that: "The Kakskerta
discovery also prompted interest in neighbouring Sweden. No bat rabies
had been observed there, but when researchers set out to look for it,
the rabies antibodies were duly discovered," we thought we might add
some information about the surveillance for bat rabies in Sweden.

Since 1998, a passive surveillance program has been in place where
dead bats have been examined for the presence of rabies virus (by the
fluorescent antibody test -- FAT). In addition, in 2008 an active
surveillance program was introduced for the 1st time in Sweden. Blood
samples for serology and oral swabs for PCR are taken from bats caught
in nets. Further information about rabies surveillance in Sweden can
be found at:

[The following is the relevant text (pp 64/65) from "Surveillance of
zoonotic and other animal disease agents in Sweden 2009."

"Rabies Surveillance 2009 - Animals

Since 1998, a passive surveillance program has been in place where
dead bats have been examined for the presence of rabies virus. Annual
information about the survey has been sent to different interested
parties with an appeal to send in bats and with instructions on how to
handle the dead bats to reduce the risk of rabies infection.

In addition, in 2008, an active surveillance program was performed for
the 1st time in Sweden. The program was run as a cooperation project
with The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and The
Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. During 2009, 3 dogs and 3
cats were examined for rabies due to clinical suspicion. The
diagnostic method used was based on the detection of antigens in brain
tissue by use of a fluorescent antibody test (FAT).

Passive surveillance: 72 dead or wounded and euthanized bats were sent
to the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) for rabies examination. The
contributors were mostly private persons. The diagnostic method used
was FAT. 32 bats were in no condition to be examined for rabies,
mostly due to missing brain. The bats were sent to The Swedish Museum
of Natural History, Stockholm, to determine the species.

Active surveillance: 77 Daubenton's bats (_Myotis daubentonii_) and 47
Northern bats (_Eptesicus nilssonii_) were caught in the Counties of
Skane and Uppsala respectively by using mist nets. Blood samples and
oral swabs were taken and the species and age were determined. After
sampling, the bats were released.

For serology, the FAVN-method with EBLV-1 [European bat lyssavirus 1]
virus was used. The swabs were analysed by real-time PCR for the
detection of EBLV by The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease
Control.

Results - Animal

8 Daubenton's bats (_Myotis daubentonii_) caught in Skane were
serologically positive for EBLV, but no virus was detected by PCR. All
other animals tested were negative for rabies.

Results - Humans

No human cases were reported during the year [2009].

Discussion

During the last decades, 2 persons have been hospitalized for rabies
in Sweden. In 1974, a Swedish man fell ill after having been infected
in India, and in 2000 a woman fell ill after visiting Thailand. Both
patients had most probably been infected by rabid dogs. Since Sweden
has been free of classical rabies, the risk of acquiring the disease
from Swedish animals is negligible. There has been an increasing
problem with illegal importation of pets since 2004, mostly dogs.
Illegally imported dogs are probably the greatest threat to the
rabies-free status of Sweden, even though the risk of introducing
rabies is rather low.

During 2009, both Northern Bats and Daubenton's bats have been
especially investigated for EBLV, and the results suggest that EBLV is
present in Sweden. There are 18 different species of bats in Sweden,
all insectivorous, belonging to the family _Vespertilionidae_.
Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_), associated with EBLV-2
infections, is common and may be found from the south up to the county
of Angermanland in the north. 6 other _Myotis_ species may also be
found in Sweden. The Serotine Bat (_Eptesicus serotinus_), associated
with findings of EBLV-1 in Europe, is found in certain habitats in the
south of Sweden. The Northern Bat (_Eptesicus nilsonii_), which is
related to the Serotin Bat, is the most common in Sweden and may be
found all over the country."

The text is illustrated by a map showing the distribution of bats
tested for rabies in passive surveillance.
