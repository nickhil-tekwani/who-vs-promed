The Los Santos regional health director, Ayvar Hernandez, confirmed the 1st hantavirus [infection] case in Los Santos [province] so far in 2022.

The case is a 38-year-old woman from the Las Palmitas neighborhood in the Las Tablas district, who was admitted to the hospital on Sun 27 Feb [2022] after experiencing 2 days of respiratory symptoms. Currently, she is in stable condition.

According to Hernandez, during 2021, all the hantavirus cases that were registered in Los Santos were in Tonosi.

This past 11 Feb [2022], the Ministry of Health (MINSA) reported the 1st death in Herrera province [from a hantavirus infection]. This was also a 58-year-old woman from the El Pajaro neighborhood, El Jazmin community in Pese district.

MNSA stated that they have intensified surveillance in nearby communities.

Hantavirus contagion and symptoms
---------------------------------------
Hantavirus [produces] a serious, acute disease that is caused by [a] hantavirus. The human hantavirus infection usually occurs in rural areas such as fields and farms where rodents that harbor the virus are found, but also it is possible to have transmission in urban areas.

[People] acquire the virus by inhalation of excremental [particles], urine, and saliva from infected rodents.

Infected people can experience headache, nausea, dizziness, chills and fever, and muscle pain, according to data provided on the website of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

MINSA issued a call to maintain the cleanliness of one's house and to eliminate the elements that could attract nearby rodents, thus avoiding infections and deaths caused by this disease.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.

Hantavirus infections in Panama's central provinces, including Herrera and Los Santos, are common, and cases occur there every year.

Although the above and the previous report do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these 2 cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above, or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done, confirms the ProMED conclusion that Choclo virus was involved.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection.

The report above does not provide a complete listing of the household measures that should be taken to prevent human exposure. A previous report stated that preventive measures recommended include the following:

- store grain in sacks and closed plastic containers, place them on pallets, and keep them separated from the walls;
- place firewood, lumber, or any other useful materials distant from the house, in an arid, dry area and on pallets;
- drain residual water from patios and keep them clean;
- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils in covered containers, to avoid their contact with rodents;
- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time;
- spray the floor with water [a 10% bleach solution is better] to avoid raising dust that may contain virus-contaminated excrement from infected rodents. - Mod.TY
