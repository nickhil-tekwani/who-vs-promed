I'd agree with Arthur that FAT is an excellent test but is not infallible.
The experience in dozens of Latin American and Southeastern Asia labs taught
me that several factors influence its sensitivity. Among them I'd mention:
a) Waiting for the development of symptoms in the biting animal
b) Preservation of brain samples
c) Proper sampling of the nervous tissue (Ammon's horn, cerebral cortex and
cerebellum)
d) Proper adjustment of conjugate working dilution to the microscope in use
(Larghi et all. Rev Inst Med Trop (S. Paolo) 28: 2-5, 1986).

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF RABIES
False negative FATs are in our experience due to the following reasons:
1) not enough samples were taken [from different parts of the brain;
2) poor quality conjugate (we found that the new monoclonal products are not
as sensitive as the old polyclonal ones); and
3) poor technique.
We reviewed our experience with 8987 tests (Tepsumethanon et al Clin Infect
Dis 1997; 25: 1459-61) and found that the FAT was much more sensitive
overall
than the MIT, since the MIT may give false negative results in decayed
materials.
We now obtain two samples from each brain stem and one from the hippocampus
and have had no false negative cases in the past 2 years.
