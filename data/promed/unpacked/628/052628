Leprosy cases double
----------------------------
The number of recorded leprosy cases in Portugal doubled last year
[2006] in relation to the previous year [2005], official figures by
the National Health Department (DGS) have revealed. The DGS explained
upon revealing the latest figures on the disease, that the increase
is largely due to increased immigration by people from countries
where leprosy is still endemic.
According to the DGS the number of confirmed cases of what is also
known as Hansen's disease, rose from 7 cases in 2005 to 16 last year
[2006], which is also equal to the total number of cases between 2002
and 2005. The chief of the Dermatology Unit at Lisbon's Curry Cabral
Hospital explained that increases in the disease have to do with
immigration, especially from Brazil and Africa. If left untreated,
there can be progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves,
limbs and eyes.
However, leprosy bacilli resistant to dapsone gradually appeared and
became widespread, and it was not until the introduction of
multi-drug therapy (MDT) in the early 1980s that the disease could be
diagnosed and treated successfully within the community.
It is estimated that more than 5 million people worldwide are
infected and is common in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Pacific Islands.
The 12 countries most affected by leprosy are Brazil, India,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Madagascar, Nepal, Niger, Bangladesh, the
Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Comunnicated by:
ProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Internal migration to isolated safe havens in the war-torn province
of Katanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may have
contributed to the increased prevalence of leprosy in that region
(see ProMED-mail Leprosy - Democratic Republic of the Congo
(Katanga) 20070726.2402). Similarly, the increase in leprosy cases
in Portugal is being attributed to international migration of those
seeking economic opportunities from regions of poverty where leprosy
is endemic, to developed regions such as Portugal.
Since the introduction of multidrug therapy in the early 1980s, a
complete cure became possible within 6 to 12 months. As a
consequence, the number of those with leprosy has plummeted from 10
million globally in 1985 to slightly more than 400 000 in 2004
(<http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020341>).
Countries from Portugal's colonial past where Portuguese is now
spoken, such as Brazil, Angola and Mozambique, are among the
countries that continue to have the greatest number of leprosy cases
and are the source of much of Portugal's immigrant population (see:
