Death of suspected 7th French case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 55 year old Frenchman believed to be suffering from the human form of BSE
died on Thu 1 Jul 2004 in a hospital outside Paris, city officials said. If
confirmed, the death would bring to 7 the number of French victims of
variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or (vCJD)
in ProMED-mail], an incurable brain-wasting illness.
4 men and 2 women aged 20 to 37 have so far succumbed to the disease in
France, according to health officials. More than 140 people are known to
have died in Britain from vCJD, a spongy deterioration of the brain causing
personality change, loss of body function and eventually death. Fears for
the safety of British beef emerged in 1986 when "mad cow" disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was first discovered in a cow on a
farm in West Sussex.

[Confirmed cases of vCJD have been identified in the United Kingdom (146),
France (6), Italy (1), and Ireland (1). This suspected 7th case in France,
and a 2nd suspected case reported recently in Italy brings the total of
confirmed and suspected cases in Europe to 156. 3 other cases of vCJD have
been confirmed in addition to these European cases; one each in Canada, the
Hong Kong SAR and the USA, bringing the total of suspected and confirmed
cases worldwide to 159. The 3 non-European patients, however, had long
periods of residence in the UK. Suspected cases have been reported from the
Czech Republic, Guadeloupe, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, South Africa, but
none has been confirmed so far. - Mod.CP]
