Public Health Dispatch: Outbreak of Poliomyelitis - Cape Verde, 2000
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The following report appears in MMWR 1 Dec 2000, 49 (47) 1070
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr//preview/mmwrhtml/mm4947a5.htm>. During 16 Aug to
17 Oct 2000, 33 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), including 7 (21%)
deaths, were reported in Cape Verde, an archipelago of 10 islands west of
Senegal and Mauritania. Preliminary laboratory results identified wild type
1 poliovirus among 8 cases. The first patient was a child aged 2 years from
the capital city of Praia; paralysis onset occurred 16 Aug 2000. The child
had received one dose of the recommended 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine
(OPV). A total of 22 cases was reported from the island of Santiago, 7 from
Sal, 3 from San Vincente, and one from Maio. The ages of the AFP patients
ranged from 3 months to 38 years; 11 (33%) were aged less than 5 years, 15
(46%) were 5-14 years, and 7 (21%) were more than 15 years. No deaths were
reported among patients aged less than 5 years. A total of 3 deaths (case
fatality rate [CFR: 20%) occurred among the patients aged 5-14 years and 4
deaths occurred among patients aged more than 15 years (CFR: 57%). Of 33
cases with known vaccination status, 13 (39%) were fully vaccinated.
The estimated population of Cape Verde in 2000 was 437 500 (World Health
Organization [WHO, unpublished data, 2000). Reported routine vaccination
coverage with 3 doses of OPV has been less than 80% every year since 1995.
The country has not conducted mass vaccination campaigns against
poliomyelitis and has not established AFP surveillance. In response to the
outbreak, a mass vaccination campaign was initiated on 16 Oct 2000 with the
goal of vaccinating every child aged 0-59 months with 2 OPV doses.
Investigations by the Cape Verde Ministry of Health and WHO are under way
to determine the circumstances associated with the outbreak, whether the
outbreak has spread to other territories such as the neighboring countries
of West Africa, and whether additional interventions will be required to
control the outbreak, including a mass campaign targeting persons aged 5-14
years.
Travelers to Cape Verde and West Africa who are not vaccinated adequately
must be considered at risk for polio. Recommendations for children in the
United States include a 4-dose vaccination series with inactivated
poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at ages 2, 4, and 6-18 months, and 4-6 years.
Unvaccinated adults should receive 3 doses of IPV, the first 2 doses at 4-8
week intervals and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. If 3 doses
cannot be administered within the recommended intervals before protection
is needed, alternative schedules are proposed. For incompletely vaccinated
persons, additional IPV doses are recommended to complete a series. Booster
IPV doses should be considered for persons who have completed a primary
series of poliovirus vaccination and who may be traveling to areas where
poliomyelitis is endemic.
