This year's [2013] 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been confirmed in Van Buren County, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD). A state veterinarian confirmed the case in a 12-year-old mare on Thursday [15 Aug 2013]. That mare experienced stumbling, depression and blindness as her brain swelled, causing her to die.

The horse had not been vaccinated against EEE, which the state recommends. EEE causes swelling of the brain. It's rare and spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Most people infected have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures or coma. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms.

EEE is rare in humans. The last known [human] cases in Michigan were in 2010, with 2 in Kalamazoo County and one in Barry County. All 3 people survived. There was only one case of EEE in Michigan last year [2012]. That was in a puppy in Van Buren County.

Southwest Michigan -- including Barry, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties -- typically has a higher concentration of EEE than the rest of the state, according to the MDARD.

Maryland officials said Friday [16 Aug 2013] that a case of eastern equine encephalitis has been confirmed in a horse in Worcester County and urged horse owners to consult with their veterinarians about vaccinations.

The horse, which had not been vaccinated, tested positive for the virus, which, like West Nile virus, is spread by mosquitoes. The disease can cause a swelling of the brain. Although it is rare in humans, it can occur when an infected mosquito bites a person. The last confirmed human case in Maryland was in 1989. The last confirmed case in a horse in the state was in 2009 in Wicomico County.

Although EEE occurs in humans less frequently than West Nile virus, it can be more serious. Typical symptoms of EEE in humans include fever, headache, mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain and sometimes seizure and coma. Symptoms usually occur 4 to 10 days after exposure to a mosquito carrying the virus. There is neither a specific treatment nor a vaccine available for use in humans infected with EEE virus.

In horses, EEE is a serious disease that can be fatal; however, well-vaccinated horses are generally safe from the disease. Infected horses show a range of clinical signs that often progress over 2-3 days, including depression, altered mental status, circling, problems with balance, weakness, aimless wandering, impaired vision, walking abnormalities, head pressing, paralysis, convulsions and death. Horses that survive serious disease often have permanent nervous system deficits.

The Maryland agriculture department is working with Worcester County officials and will conduct air spraying over 6000 acres in the Whaleyville area. The spraying begins Friday [23 Aug 2013?] at 5 p.m.

[The repeated recommendation for horse owners is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. Eastern equine encephalitis vaccine has been combined into a single vaccine with West Nile virus and, generally, for western equine encephalitis. This single vaccine is very protective for horses. Immunity to EEE decreases over time, and the vaccine is recommended to be given every 4 months to help protect horses.
