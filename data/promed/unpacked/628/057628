From: "Heikki Henttonen" <heikki.henttonen@metla.fi>

We thought some comments on the hantavirus epidemic in Bashkiria would be
suitable for ProMED-mail. Due to the character of the note, we have not
included references, but if necessary, they could be [made available.
This comment should be regarded as a joint effort by Heikki Henttonen
(undersigned), Antti Vaheri, Olli Vapalahti, Alexander Plyusnin (Helsinki)
and Ã…ke Lundkvist (Stockholm).
We have heard from Russian colleagues that rodent populations are very high
on the western side of the southern Ural mountains, not only in Bashkiria
but also in adjoining areas, e.g. around Samara (former Kujbyshev),
southwest of Bashkirian autonomous republic. As a result, the present HFRS
epidemic seems to beat the earlier records in the southeastern parts of
European Russia. Classically, HFRS in Bashkiria has been Puumala infection
(carrier species is the bank vole, _Clethrionomys glareolus_), and recent
personal communication from Bashkiria suggests the same. However, the high
mortality reported in ProMED-mail, if true, is not typical of
Puumala-caused HFRS, nephropathia epidemica (NE) and might therefore point
to other hantavirus(es). Unfortunately, it could also reflect the
diminishing resources in health care. On the other hand, it should be
remembered that a lot of mild cases may not be reported which could give a
misleadingly high mortality rate. Other sources very recently reported to
us 0.5 % mortality rate among hospitalized cases for this Bashkirian
epidemic, and taking into consideration the probable unreported mild cases,
we would then be within rather normal Puumala realm. In Finland, the
mortality caused by Puumala is 0.1% in the 1000 cases diagnosed annually.
Furthermore, 5% of the diagnosed cases have to undergo dialysis.
Among other possibilities could be Dobrava virus. We know now that
Dobrava, originally isolated from two yellow-necked field mice (_Apodemus
flavicollis_) in the Balkans, also occurs in the striped field mouse (_A.
agrarius_) in the Balkans, Estonia and Russia. In fact, _A. agrarius_
might be the main host of Dobrava in (eastern) Europe. There was a large
epidemic around Tula area (somewhat south of Moscow) in Russia in 1991-92,
the cause of which was Dobrava and the carrier was _A. agrarius_. _A.
flavicollis_ and _A. sylvaticus_ did not apparently play a major role in
the outbreak. Remarkably, there was no mortality during this Russian
epidemic. Originally, Dobrava in the Balkans was related to rather high
human mortality, 2-5%.
Remember that the same rodent species, A. agrarius, hosts Hantaan virus in
the Far East, and that Hantaan has not been isolated from rodents in
Europe. The earlier records of Hantaan-caused HFRS in Europe have been
shown to be due to [lack of specificity of antibodies in the acute phase
of HFRS. Puumala or Dobrava have been diagnosed in later serum samples.
There are studies reporting antibodies to Hantaan virus in rodents in some
parts of Europe, but probably it is a question of Dobrava (or Seoul) virus.
The fascinating possibility is that Dobrava virus occurs in all _Apodemus_
species, the ranges of which together cover most of Europe.
The Moderator [CHC mentioned Tula virus, carried by _Microtus arvalis_ and
_M. rossiaemeriodionalis_ (sibling species), as a possible cause of the
epidemic in Bashkiria. However, so far there is not a single documented
case of HFRS caused by Tula virus in Europe! There is one documented human
infection being seropositive to Tula from the Czech Republic, but this case
was found in random sampling among blood donors, and no history of HFRS
could be found. Even in areas endemic for Tula virus, HFRS is caused by
Puumala and/or Dobrava. It seems that hantaviruses connected with
_Microtus_ voles are nonpathogenic (even though experience has taught that
nothing about hantaviruses is certain for too long).
Summarizing, we have to wait for the studies of local Russian scientists
before we know with certainty which of the hantaviruses is on the scene
this time, even though Puumala is the probable one. HFRS in Bashkiria has
been studied for years and the rodent fauna is well known.
A new virus causing a large epidemic does not sound [like a probable
explanation.

I do not know if Tkachenko answered you or not. But I would like to tell
you that this number of cases in Bashkiria is not unusual and have been
registered regularly, at intervals of about 3 years. This epidemiological
cycle is associated with the number of infected bank voles in the
population and usually is associated with early beginning of [the breeding
season in bank vole populations, and (not so tightly) with [the peak of
[the bank vole's number. All Bashkirian HFRS cases [have been caused by
PUU virus (prototype strain C.g1820). There are no documentated cases of
HFRS caused by Tula virus on the territory of the former USSR.

[We appreciate the efforts gone to by Drs. Henttonen, Vaheri, Vapalahti,
Plyusnin, and Lundkvist {message 1} and Dr. Irina Gavrilovskaya {message
2}. I have sent a message to Evgenyi Tkachenko, Moscow, asking for
information regarding the particular hantavirus causing the Bashkirian
epidemic. I originally tossed out the possibility that Tula virus might be
the etiologic agent because of the reported high mortality rate, which I
thought unusual for Puumala virus (the etiologic agent of a milder form of
HFRS, called Nephropathia Epidemica). When we receive the data from
Tkachenko, I will stand corrected. - Mod.CHC
