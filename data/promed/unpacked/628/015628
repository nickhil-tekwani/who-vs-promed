Mucormycosis - Australia ex tsunami areas 20050131.0338
-----------------------------------------------
I have read the Promed posting above and note the following errors. I have
not been able to access the article it was taken from as yet. I feel
uncomfortable with the errors, but perhaps this is the price of speaking to
the media. However, it is more important, I think, that the message for
being aware of the infection is disseminated. For what it is worth, I make
the following points:
Pamela Kocecny, from Sydney's St. George Hospital, said the fungal disease,
called mucormycosis, is fatal in 80 percent of cases if left untreated.
.... My name is Dr. Pamela Konecny. When asked if 80 percent of cases are
fatal, I stated there is a high mortality in severely immunosuppressed and
untreated patients, but the outcome is much better with early
identification and aggressive management.
Found in soil and rotting plants, it aggressively infects wounds and kills
flesh with necrotizing lesions. ... I stated when embedded in such
traumatic wounds, it may invade aggressively in necrotic tissue.
Kocecny said she knew of 3 Australian tsunami survivors diagnosed with
mucormycosis... the journalist has added...which would have gone undetected
had they remained in the disaster zone.
She said it was impossible to estimate how many survivors in
tsunami-affected areas were infected, because it was hard to detect even in
hospitals with advanced laboratories... I did not state the latter as the
diagnosis is not particularly difficult, but in affected areas, the
resources and accessibility to the diagnostic facilities may be difficult.
"We don't know how prevalent it... (the infection is vs the organisms which
are ubiquitous)... is, because large numbers of people in these areas don't
have access to the diagnostic facilities needed to find it," she told
Agence France-Presse.
Treatment involves surgically removing all dead and infected tissue and
administering a course of antifungal therapy. She said doctors treating
tsunami survivors should be on the lookout for mucormycosis, which was
...more...most aggressive in patients whose immune systems had been
weakened by other infections.

[ProMED-mail empathizes with Dr. Konecny as many of us have had the
misfortune to have been misquoted by the press. We hope that the primary
message here -- the importance of being aware of mucormycosis as a post
tsunami wound complication -- has not been diluted by the press misquoting.
