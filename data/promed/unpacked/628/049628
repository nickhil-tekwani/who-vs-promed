The Seeta High School student who died recently was not poisoned, but
died of botulism, medical reports have revealed. The director General
of health services, Dr Sam Zaramba, yesterday [11 Nov 2008] said the
Senior Five student died of botulism, according to reports from the
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the health ministry.

On the morning of Mon 20 Oct 2008, the female student was taken to
the school's sickbay, with pain in the throat and breathing
complications. Her parents were called in after the school nurse said
she could not manage her condition. She was taken to International
Hospital Kampala, where she died 5 days later.

The student's friend, who a day before had complained of vision
problems, was admitted at Mulago Hospital's Intensive Care Unit and
remains hospitalized. Another student who was admitted has since been
discharged.

"When the student died, we took samples from all the girls' property
that we could get and sent them to CDC-Atlanta, for investigations.
We also did a post-mortem of the student," Zaramba said. He said
results from the samples are expected in the next 2 weeks. "We tried
to trace all that they had eaten and used."

Zaramba said it was discovered that this was food-borne botulism. "We
have advised the school to limit the amount of food that is brought
for students on visitation days."

This is the 2nd botulism outbreak in Uganda, Zaramba said. The 1st
was in the 1970s.
