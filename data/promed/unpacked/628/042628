At least 8 children in [the frontier village of Tumina], about 32 km [20 mi] from Kupwara, have been disabled in the past one month due to an outbreak of a mysterious disease.

Residents of snowbound Tumina village nestled in Shamsbari mountain range are finding it hard to tackle the crisis as more and more children are getting disabled with each passing day. "Doctors are unable to diagnose the disease properly and treat the patients. People are making rounds of SKIMS [Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences] and other medical institutions but to no avail," parents of 2 patients told Greater Kashmir.

They said their children are unable to speak and it seems that their nervous system, liver, eyes, and brain have got affected. Similarly parents of 3 other children said, "Hands and feet of our children have started bending and their arms and legs have stopped working; as a result they are unable to stand, work, and eat." Parents said they have been running from pillar to post to get their children treated but doctors are unable to treat them. "We rushed these patients to SKIMS Soura. Doctors told us to get some tests done but technicians at SKIMS expressed their inability saying that there are no facilities in the hospital for these tests," said a parent, adding, "Our children have been badly hit by this mysterious disease. Authorities are not paying any heed towards our plight."

Residents said that after repeated reminders and representations a team of doctors comprising Dr Nazir Ahmad and Dr Masrat Iqbal Nodal officer Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) Kupwara visited the village 10 days ago and took the water samples from the bore wells and blood samples of the affected children and their parents. "Neither any medicine was given nor was report of the samples returned," they said.

Locals are up in arms against the officials of PHE [Public Health Engineering] department. "Our area has vast water resources like Chowkibal stream but the PHE department dug 8 bore wells around 250 feet [75 m] deep each at the whopping cost of Rs 2.50 crore [1 crore=10 million; about USD 500 000]. Without testing the water of bore wells they handed these to the residents of Tumina village with a population of 1500 souls. There could be several more cases of same disease as the entire village has been using the water of these bore wells since 2009."

The Sarpanch [elected head] of Tumina village appealed to Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to intervene and send a special team of doctors to the affected village and treat the children so that their lives are saved.

When contacted, Director Health Dr Saleem-ul-Rehman said, "The Directorate has not received any report from the concerned CMO [Chief Medical Officer], BMO [Block Medical Officer], or concerned IDSP unit. I have shot a letter to them. We are planning to send a team of doctors to the area to asses the ground situation."

[An apparently disabling illness is affecting a number (at least 8) of children in this rural area of Kashmir. It is difficult to discern the nature of the illness from the scant details available in this report, but it appears to be evading diagnosis at medical facilities. There is no mention of fatalities. The illness affecting mentation suggests an encephalitis, but the mention of "bending" of hands and feet might suggest arthritis or arthralgias. Given the elevation of the region and time of year, mosquito-borne infections seem unlikely. An intoxication or nutritional cause might be possible. ProMED-mail would like to hear from anyone with knowledge of the situation.

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1_R2. Kupwara is located about 90 km [56 mi] from the state capital Srinagar. - Mod.LM]

[India reports half-a-dozen outbreaks of undiagnosed disease every year -- see below-- and we never see a final diagnosis. If the National Institute of Virology does not have the capability to diagnose them, CDC Atlanta or the Institut Pasteur of Paris would be glad to receive samples. - Mod.JW]
