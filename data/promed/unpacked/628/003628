Ethiopian coffee output slides 58 percent in 2 main growing regions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethiopian coffee output will fall 58 percent in 2 of the country's
main growing regions this year because of disease and a lack of
water, the government said. Output in Sidama region fell as much as
55 percent and Gedeo by 62 percent, Berhanu Gezahegn, an official at
the agriculture ministry's coffee development office, said. The areas
in southern Ethiopia produce about 60 percent of Ethiopia's
high-quality washed coffee and are home to the Yirgacheffe and Sidama
varieties.

"There's a big reduction in washed coffee," Gezahegn said. "There was
a moisture shortage in the 3rd flowering and a big infestation of
coffee berry disease and coffee wilt disease." Washed coffee makes up
70 to 75 percent of the production in the 2 regions, while lower
quality dried coffee accounts for the remainder, he said. A drought
from March to June [2008] harmed coffee flowering in the region, he
said. "In August and September there was a big rain and that rain
caused" coffee berry disease, he added.

A U.N. report warned that the drop in production combined with lower
world coffee prices and higher food prices were leading to widespread
malnutrition in the regions.

[2] Leaf rust, berry disease - Kenya

Kenya runs a weekly auction of the commodity at the Nairobi Coffee
Exchange (NCE) but has recently struggled to break even amid hitches
in production caused by among other things outbreaks of coffee berry
disease and coffee leaf rust.

At the peak of a production crisis that forced the NCE into an early
closure early this year [2008], several international dealers turned
their eyes on Ethiopia, effectively sounding a warning to rivals such
as Kenya.

New coffee wilt threat to Uganda crop
-------------------------------------
Uganda's efforts to double its coffee output in 7 year's time are
threatened by a likely resurgence of the debilitating coffee wilt
disease -- due to the planting of non-resistant varieties.

"Around half of the 80 million coffee trees planted since 2004 in the
ongoing replanting programme are not resistant to the disease," David
Muwonge, head of production and marketing at the National Union of
Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises (NUCAFE), said. The trees
in question could be attacked by the disease in the next 4 to 5
years, reversing the success that has been registered in the sector.

This is despite the fact that the Minister of State for Agriculture,
Animal Industry and Fisheries, Bright Rwamirama, announced recently
that Ugandan scientists had developed 8 new strains of robusta coffee
that are tolerant to the disease.

NUCAFE's Mr Muwonge, however, claimed that inadequate funding of the
country's coffee research bodies and lack of improved varieties had
compelled farmers to plant the inferior varieties that lacked
resistance. By 2006, the coffee wilt disease, which was 1st detected
in Uganda in 1993, had wiped out half of the country's 300 million
robusta coffee trees.

The disease attacks robusta trees, which make up 85 percent of
Uganda's annual coffee output. Farmers have been advised to destroy
and burn the affected trees on the spot to stop it from spreading.
The government is also introducing coffee farming to new regions such
as northern Uganda that are not prone to the disease. Industry
sources said the disease had destroyed the entire crop in some
districts such as Bundibugyo. Uganda loses about USD 187 million
annually due to the wilt disease.

[Coffee wilt disease (CWD) is caused by the fungus _Gibberella
xylarioides_. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea
arabica_(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta
or lowland coffee), it affects only the latter where it can lead to
100 percent plant mortality. Spread occurs with infected plant and
other materials, by wind, water, and mechanical means. While cultural
practices have shown some success in disease management, crop
varieties with higher levels of CWD resistance appear to be the most
promising approach. For more information see ProMED-mail post no.
20080731.2346.

Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_,
one of the most feared pathogens of the crop which has destroyed
arabica plantings in many countries. Spores are spread by wind and
rain from lesions on the underside of the leaves. Disease management
relies mainly on fungicides since rust resistant cultivars tend to be
of poorer quality.

Coffee berry disease (CBD) is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum
kahawae_ which affects arabica coffee only with losses of up to 80
percent. Infected berries are considered the major source of
inoculum. Disease management includes cultural practices, quarantine,
and periodic fungicide treatments. Some resistant host cultivars
exist.

For more information on CLR and CBD see ProMED-mail post no. 20071108.3631.
