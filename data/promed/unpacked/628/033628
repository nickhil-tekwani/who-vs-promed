RABIES IMMUNE GLOBULINS, WORLD-WIDE SHORTAGE

WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE OF RABIES IMMUNE GLOBULINS
It has come to our attention that Equine (ERIG) and Human Rabies Immune
Globulins (HRIG), both essential life-saving drugs, are in extremely short
supply worldwide. Dealers are often not able to fill orders. Furthermore,
the cost of these products, particularly HRIG, is such that it discourages
purchase and the storing of these products in adequate quantities. Several
previous manufacturers of ERIG have gone out of business due to problems
with horse farming and the high cost of production. HRIG depends on a pool
of healthy donors hyperimmunized for rabies and is even more costly to
manufacture.

This issue has been discussed in a paper in 1996 [1] but the situation is
even worse now. There is also a worldwide shortage in quality equine
anti-snake, tetanus and diphtheria sera. The human tetanus and diphtheria
sera are not affordable where they are needed the most. This is an other
argument for encouraging pre-exposure rabies vaccination for all extended
travelers to rabies endemic countries. If they incur an exposure, there may
not be any immune globulin nearby.
