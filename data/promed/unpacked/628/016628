An investigation commissioned by Bayer and carried out by TUV Product
Service, an independent organization accredited by the EU, has concluded
that the dialyzer Althane A-8 is safe, and that there is no connection
between the product and the 10 patients who died after undergoing
hemodialysis in August in Spain in the hospitals Virgen del Consuelo in
Valencia and La Princesa in Madrid. The procedure used consisted of a
biological evaluation, 3 tests in vitro and in animals, and the results
were made public yesterday by Frank Pitzer from TUV.
The dialyzer used in Spain does not produce any hemolytic substance,
cytotoxic agents, irritants, or corrosives. The necropsy performed did not
find any signs of toxicity in the animals' organs, and the hematology
parameters were normal. Pitzer said, adding "No bio-incompatibility has
been found in the product. Data is unquestionable. There were other causes
of the deaths."
Jose Divino, head of the Renal Division of Bayer Europe, said that they
were waiting for the Spanish Health Department inquiry, and added that in
the hemodialysis process there are other intervening factors, like treated
water, concentrates, needles, and medication. Sr. Divino also said that
between 1980 and 1990, at least 80 deaths worldwide can be traced to badly
treated water.

VALENCIA: The officer of Court No. 7 in Valencia, Maria Isabel Sifre, has
named as responsible 3 representatives of the Baxter company in relation to
the death of 6 patients between the 21st and 29th of August in the Virgen
del Consuelo Clinic of Valencia, after having received hemodialysis
treatment, according to information received from judicial sources by
Europa Press.
This decision of the magistrate coincides with the notification last Sunday
of 23 deaths of patients in 8 dialysis centers in Croatia, in which
dialyzer Series A had also been used in 22 of the cases.
Nevertheless, the company indicated yesterday in a press release that it
had initiated an extensive scientific analysis on the treatment safety and
announced that it had interrupted the distribution of this series of
dialyzers, in addition to advising their clients that they should
temporarily suspend the use of them [dialyzer series A until the committee
of experts finalizes their investigation.
On the other hand, the company makes assurances that no element of dialysis
treatment had been submitted to an analysis "so exhaustive" as the
dialyzers [under question, which were analyzed by the European TUV Product
Service, which presented a study in Madrid on 9 Oct 2001 which, according
to the multinational [company, demonstrated "irrefutable evidence that
supports the safety of the A-18 dialyzers."

[With the appearance of an additional 23 deaths coming from 8 different
dialysis centers in Croatia, the attribution of the deaths to "treated
water, concentrates, needles and medication" in this case seems to be less
likely. Any information from official sources involved in the
investigation would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP
