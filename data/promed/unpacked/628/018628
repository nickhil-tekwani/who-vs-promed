An outbreak of dengue fever in Brazil's tourist mecca of Rio de Janeiro has
prompted the authorities to step up prevention measures, fearing a repeat
of a 2002 epidemic that killed more than 100 people, officials said on
Wednesday.
"We have flare-ups in 2 districts. It needs to be blocked urgently, because
without such control there is the risk of an epidemic again in Rio,"
Aloisio Ribeiro, head of Rio state government's Epidemiology Vigilance
Center, told Reuters.
Dengue is carried by mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_] and causes severe body
pain, fever, and headaches. Larvae breed in stagnant waters, in anywhere
from abandoned swimming pools to flower pots and car tires left in the open
air.
State and municipal authorities will launch a task force Thursday to combat
the disease with vehicle-mounted insecticide sprayers and inspections of
private homes and courtyards. Hundreds of workers will be sent to find and
destroy larvae that breed in stagnant water.
One of the affected districts is upscale oceanside Barra da Tijuca. Barra
and neighboring Jacarepagua accounted for more than 250 dengue cases out of
328 registered in Rio [during December 2005], and there are similar rates
in January 2006 so far. December 2005's total number of cases was 3 times
higher than a year earlier.
Rio is preparing to receive hundreds of thousands of tourists for its famed
annual Carnival in February. Ribeiro complained that municipal authorities
had relaxed their anti-dengue effort in the 3 years without major outbreaks
and rejected their explanation that the disease had been brought from
Brazil's north east by poor slum dwellers.
"The problem is that there are plenty of mosquitoes, that Rio is an endemic
area and there has not been enough effort to prevent dengue," he said,
adding that the overall number of cases in the state was still around last
year's levels. Because the disease is common within the region, its
residents are more likely to contract more than one of dengue's 4 strains,
increasing the chance of a potentially deadly hemorrhagic form of the
disease. A total of 134 Brazilians died from that in 2002, with nearly 80
per cent of the deaths in Rio state. Nearly 740 000 people contracted
dengue across the country that year.

A total of 1099 people died of dengue fever in Indonesia in 2005, a health
ministry official said here on Tuesday [17 Jan 2006].
"The number is higher than 2004's 957," said Rita Kusriastuti, head of the
subdirectorate of arboviruses of the directorate general of disease control
and environmental health.
In percentage, the number of deaths this year [2005] ranged from 1 per cent
to 1.4 per cent, compared with 2.5 per cent last year [2004], Antara news
agency quoted the official as saying. She said cases of dengue fever were
found across the provinces in the country with Jakarta claiming the highest
number of lives (238), followed by East Java (200). "In some cases the
deaths occurred because of the lack of health services," she said.
Kusriastuti said the number of dengue fever cases in the country had
increased in the past 4 years [2002-2005]. In 2002 they were recorded at
only 40 377, but in 2003 they increased to 52 000 and later to 79 462 in
2004 and 80 837 in 2005.
Besides lack of funds for controlling the disease, implementation of the
government program has yet to be maximized. She said, "the government has
actually prepared a good program for disease control but as usual its
implementation is not always as expected."

<http://www.msds.gov.ve/msds/Boletines/Alertas/2005/Alerta52.zip>

During this epidemiological week [week 52 of 2005] 690 cases of dengue
fever have been diagnosed, and 55 of them were dengue hemorrhagic fever (8
per cent). The ratio for dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever is 12:1.
Cumulated case toll for 2005 is 42 198 cases, 6.4 per cent of them were
dengue hemorrhagic fever (2 681 cases), and the ratio for [classic] dengue
fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever was 15:1. Cumulated morbidity rate is 158.8
per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating serotypes are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Cumulated case toll for this period showed a 37.5 per cent increase
compared to the figures registered for the same time period in 2005
[2004?]. During this week no deaths caused by dengue were reported.
A 21 per cent increase in the number of cases compared to last week [week
51], and the epidemiological situation corresponds to an epidemic (see
endemic channel). People under 15 years old account for 52 per cent of all
notified cases, and those aged 15 to 24 years for 22 per cent of all cases.
States reporting most cases are as follows: Falcon (126), Zulia (88),
Tachira (77), Aragua (72), and Merida (58).

I am requesting information on the status of dengue fever activity in the
above part of St. Martin (French Antilles), on the basis of the following:
A 35 year old otherwise healthy Canadian citizen presented to my hospital
clinic following a one week stay in St. Martin (exclusively along Orient
Bay) ending 4 Jan 2006. Her illness was characterized by a fever that began
on 7 Jan, and which featured a pruritic exanthem involving the chest,
trunk, abdomen, and extremities (including palms and soles), in addition to
retroorbital headache. Most of her current symptoms are currently
resolving. Dengue fever serology (HI) has been requested today.
Of note is that 2 of her 3 travel companions had similar illnesses with
similar times of onset. Both have recovered. One of the 2 was diagnosed in
the US as having dengue fever, apparently on the basis of serology.
A review of the literature implicated Orient Bay as a focus of a dengue
fever outbreak in 2003-2004. Could readers provide information on the
status of dengue fever in St. Martin at this time, as this is a common sun
destination for Canadian travellers at this time of year?

[Thanks to Dr Rau for bringing up the case of suspected dengue infection
possibly acquired during a visit to St. Martin. During the 2003-2004 dengue
outbreak in St. Martin, a dengue type 3 virus was commonly isolated from 6
patients exhibiting clinical symptoms (see also
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no05/04-0959.htm>). So far, no official
report of recent dengue outbreaks could be found. Any further information
with regard to the subject would be appreciated. - Mod.RY]

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed the year's 2nd imported case
of dengue fever, this time a 22 year old man who recently travelled to
Indonesia.
The man came down with fever, muscle pain, chills, and headache on 31 Dec
2005. He travelled to Indonesia between 18 and 24 Dec. He consulted a
doctor and has recovered. His home contacts did not have any symptoms.
