Moko bacterium threatens Quindio bananas
----------------------------------------
According to Colombia's agricultural institute ICA (Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario), growers and organisations must leap into action in order to save banana crops in the department of Quindio. The moko bacterium is threatening to wipe out plantations.

"Quindio will end up without bananas if action isn't taken immediately," warns Carlos Rave, ICA. "Producers have to step up, take responsibility and use ICA protocols to battle possible contagion." Out of 29 000 plants, 150 have been infected. "That may seem little, but this infection spreads like wildfire. Many producers fail to report the plague altogether."

All the institute can do now is to disinfect affected areas and to initiate an awareness campaign. Starting in 2013, drastic sanctions will be imposed on growers not adhering to protocol. "The worst one being to quarantine the farm, sealing it off completely."

Phytosanitary inspections will check plant material being transported using 4 control points in strategic areas of the Department.

[Moko disease was first reported in Trinidad in the late 1890s, leading to severe losses of Moko cooking bananas. It is caused by the bacterium _Ralstonia solanacearum_ invading the vascular tissues of the host. Affected species include banana, plantain, heliconia, red ginger, taro, castor bean, and some weeds. The disease affects all plant parts with symptoms of wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, and bacterial ooze leading to a quick death of the plant.

_R. solanacearum_ is a species complex with 3 "races" (pathovars). Race 2 affects banana and plantain. Moko, Bugtok, and blood disease of banana are caused by different strains of race 2. The pathogens can be clearly distinguished by their host range and other biological and biochemical properties. The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means including animals and insects. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain.

Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70 percent. No resistant banana cultivars are known. It has severe commercial implications of yield losses and high costs of control measures needed. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogen is present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments), and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures or combinations of these.

_R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including many important crops (also causing, for example, brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and affect different hosts.
