More than 50 people in Quynh Luu district of Viet Nam's central Nghe
An Province have recently been hospitalized with acute diarrhea, with
23 patients tested positive for cholera, the Viet Nam News reported
on Tuesday [14 Oct 2008], citing source from the provincial health department.

The department said the Mai Giang River, which runs through the
district, is the main cause of the epidemic, as _Vibrio cholerae_
bacteria was discovered in the river. Many of the seafood sourced
from the river, including fish and oysters, have been found to be
infected with the bacteria, according to the department.

Viet Nam, which has been stricken by cholera since late in 2007,
reported more than 700 cholera cases in the 1st 8 months of 2008.

[5] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau
Date: Tue 14 Oct 2008

<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80887>


The cholera epidemic is still out of control across Guinea-Bissau,
with the number of cases doubling in the past 3 weeks, bringing the
total number of people stricken to 10 476 as of 9 Oct 2008.

There have been 312 new infections in the past 2 days, according to
the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and 181 people have died from the disease.

"The epidemic is not under control. I don't want to be alarmist, but
we haven't reached the peak and there are still new cases every day,"
Daniel Remartinez, emergency coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres
(MSF) Spain, told IRIN from the capital Bissau.

At 7143, Bissau still has the highest number of cases, followed by
Biombo in western Guinea-Bissau with 1405 cases, and the Bijagos
islands, 60 km (37.3 mi) off the coast of the capital, with 441
infections. Most of the Bijagos infections have been contracted in
the past few weeks, according to Agostino Betunda, co-director of the
Centre for Epidemiology in Bissau.

One in 10 people stricken by cholera are dying from it in the region
of Quinara, which neighbors the capital, and one in 9 in Bafata in
central Guinea-Bissau, due in part to a lack of available treatment,
according to Betunda.

The Commissioner of Aweil East County Cirelo Diing Aher said at least
25 people died of cholera in Tiitchok Mareeng area.

Speaking to Miraya-FM from the state government headquarters in Aweil
town on Monday [13 Oct 2008], the Aweil East county commissioner said
that citizens of Toich Area have been displaced by floods forcing
them to over crowd some highlands in the area where acute watery
diarrhea is now in progress.

Cases of cholera were first discovered in the Aweil North and West
counties in July 2008 before it spread to Aweil town.

Over 2-dozen deaths in Aweil East indicate the huge toll the disease
is having in Northern Bahra el-Ghazal State.

(IFRC) report [edited]

Since the last week of September 2008, cases of cholera have been
reported in Malanville and Karimana in the northern part of Benin.
According to the Red Cross of Benin, about 90 cases were referred to
health centres in the 2 districts. By 2 Oct 2008, the epidemic has
spread to other northern districts of Djougou and Bassilla with over
600 cases reported in the affected communities, according to the Red Cross.

No deaths have been reported. Reported cases are increasing, and if
the epidemic is not quickly controlled it could potentially spread to
other neighboring communities. The district of Karimana is recording
the highest number of cases thus far. Health officials in the
locality have been deployed in the district to give medical
assistance to affected persons. The Red Cross volunteers deployed in
the affected communities could only carry out sensitization on good
hygiene practice in a few accessible areas.

A similar outbreak was reported during the month of August 2008 in
Cotonou, the commercial capital of Benin.

A fresh outbreak of cholera has killed 3 people in northern Zimbabwe,
health officials said Thursday [9 Oct 2008]. The country has been hit
by a spate of cholera outbreaks in different regions, including areas
around the capital, Harare. Two weeks ago, 3 people were killed by
cholera and hundreds of others hospitalized around Harare.

But health officials said the latest cases were in the northern towns
of Chinhoyi and Kariba, where scores of other people were left hospitalized.

Poor sanitation, including non-functional sewerage facilities, is
blamed for the outbreaks of cholera.

A cholera outbreak in the town of Cuamba, in the northern Mozambican
province of Niassa, has killed 12 of the 277 people diagnosed with
the disease so far, according to a report in Wednesday's [8 Oct 2008]
issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias."

Laisson Daniel, director of the Cuamba district health services, said
that the main cause of the cholera outbreak is the poor supply of
drinking water in the town, together with poor hygiene habits. The
outbreak began in late August 2008, and this is the 1st time that
Cuamba has been struck by cholera outside of the rainy season.

The town is going through a serious water crisis. "In the few rivers
where one can still find some water, it is highly contaminated, but
this is the only alternative for the residents, because the wells
have completely dried up," said Daniel.

An average of 7 people suffering from cholera are being admitted to
the Cuamba Rural Hospital every day, which the authorities regard as
a very high figure.

Officials said on Wednesday [8 Oct 2008] 4 people died of cholera and
70 more have been admitted to health centres following a fresh
outbreak in southern Tanzania. The 1st death was reported a week ago
in the southwestern Rukwa region, Mpanda District Commissioner
Thobias Sijabaje said.

"A patient believed to have been infected by cholera died on 30 Sep
2008 at Milala Chongo village. His relatives took the body and there
are fears that they did not take necessary precautions before the
burial," he said.

The disease has since spread to several parts of the district and
more than 70 patients have been admitted to different health centres, he said.

An outbreak in northern Tanzania killed at least 13 people in September [2008].

So far, 40 cases of cholera have been reported in Kinawataka, a

2008]. Dr Joseph Senzoga yesterday [6 Oct 2008] said 8 victims were
undergoing treatment at the Mulago Hospital cholera isolation camp.

Three people, including a 5-year-old child, died at the beginning of
September 2008, while the 4th victim died at the end of the month.
Cholera usually hits the city suburbs during rainy seasons. The most
prone areas are Kawempe, Kisenyi, Kamwokya, and Kalerwe.

[12] Shigellosis - USA (Texas)

Earlier this week the Lubbock Health Department reported 44 cases of
shigellosis, a disease that causes fever, diarrhea, and abdominal
pain. The health department says they've heard of more cases since
then. The disease is spread when people use the restroom and don't
wash their hands.

After lunch at Carver Early Learning Center, every child must wash
their hands. "We want to make sure that we don't pass anything off
from child to child and teacher to teacher," said center director,
Whitney McDaniel.

It's especially important to stop the spread of germs now because of
the recent outbreak of shigellosis in Lubbock. From January through
August of 2008 the city had 7 reported cases. They expect fewer than
8 cases in any given month, but since 1 Sep 2008 they've had more than 40.
