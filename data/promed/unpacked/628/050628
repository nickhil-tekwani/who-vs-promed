Improper poultry raising and sales techniques -- rather than the
flights of migratory birds -- play the most important role in the
spread of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, United Nations officials
said yesterday at a conference in eastern China. Dr Vincent Martin,
an official with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, said the
spread of bird flu is mainly the result of the world's rapid and
unregulated development of animal production to meet the increased
demand for protein. His comments came during an international
conference in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province.
Highly concentrated domestic poultry production systems, especially
in Asia, are still using centuries-old practices that place humans
and poultry in proximity, he said. Meanwhile, the constantly evolving
nature of the virus has provided the ideal conditions for the
emergence of new strains of avian influenza. Evidence indicates wild
migratory birds play a minor role in the long-distance spread of the
virus, Martin said, adding that the main causes of the deadly disease
are the trade in poultry and poultry products.
Marco Barbieri, executive secretary of the Convention on Migratory
Species of the UN Environmental Program, said that despite media
attention the spread of bird flu is not widely understood.
Misinformation has led to wild birds bearing major blame for
transmission of the disease, the official said. "This creates
political pressure for ill-advised and disproportionate policies such
as the culling or harassment of wild birds and the destruction of
wetland habitats," Barbieri said.
Other modes of transmission, such as the trade in poultry and poultry
products, the trade in caged birds and human movements may well play
a far more significant role in the spread of bird flu, he said. And
in some cases, these pathways have been underestimated and do not
receive proportionate media exposure.
"We need to present an accurate and balanced view which acknowledges
that there are a number of factors whose relative importance can
change, depending on the area or outbreak concerned," Barbieri said.
It is clear that trade in domestic poultry has been a crucial factor,
even in transmitting avian influenza across continents, he said.
Numerous species of wild birds, especially water fowl, have been
proven to be susceptible to infection by H5N1, however, he pointed
out. Close contact between wild birds and poultry can lead to
cross-infection. The loss of wetlands around the globe has forced
many wild birds into alternative sites such as farm ponds and paddy
fields, bringing them into closer contact with chickens, ducks,
geese, and other domestic fowl.

Migrating ducks, geese, and swans spread the H5N1 bird flu virus from
Russia to Romania, Turkey and Ukraine, researchers said on Thursday.
A careful analysis of the spread of the virus from central Asia into
eastern Europe in the autumn of 2005 shows that wild birds,
especially mallard ducks, were the chief spreaders of the virus. "We
conclude that the spread of (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1
virus from Russia and Kazakhstan to the Black Sea basin is consistent
in space and time with the hypothesis that birds in the Anatidae
family have seeded the virus along their autumn migration routes,"
the researchers wrote in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Anatidae include geese, ducks and swans, some of which are killed by
H5N1, and other species of which often show no ill effects from the
virus but which can spread it. Mallard ducks are the main suspect.
Bird flu remains mainly an animal disease, but has infected 256
people since late 2003, killing 152 of them, according to the World
Health Organization. Experts fear the virus could mutate and spark a
human influenza pandemic, which could kill millions. Domestic ducks
and chickens can spread the virus to people, and the poultry trade is
held responsible for some spread, but experts have also long believed
that wild birds also can carry the virus over long distances.
Marius Gilbert of the Free University of Brussels and colleagues used
satellite data to figure out the start of the autumn migration, and
plotted known seasonal migration pathways against the actual
outbreaks of H5N1. They noted that adult birds can transmit the
virus easily to juveniles during the molting season, when they cannot
fly, and also noted that the virus can survive in cold standing water
-- where many species of birds congregate while molting. "The initial
outbreaks of (highly pathogenic) H5N1 virus in Romania, Turkey, and
Ukraine occurred close to wetlands frequented by overwintering
migratory waterfowl," they wrote.
"These locations were clearly far from any known location where ...
H5N1 virus had been recorded, while the timing and location match the
autumn wildfowl migration ahead of the approaching wave of frost."
The researchers said that their study "by no means excludes the role
of the poultry trade as an important, complementary transmission pathway."
Bird experts around the world are testing many different species to
see which ones carry and transmit the virus. U.S. and Canadian
officials say they expect highly pathogenic strains of H5N1 to
eventually arrive in the Americas, saying it is only a matter of time.

[Obviously the relative importance of the various epidemiologic
factors affecting spread and persistence of HPAI depend on which part
of the elephant one is examining and the tools used. On an economic
basis improper poultry raising and sales techniques are the most
important factors, outweighing all others, and patently where control
must be directed and is most cost-effective. Migrating birds play a
part in the long-distance spread of the virus(es), which is also
shared with the international movements, legal and illegal, of live
and dead poultry. - Mod.MHJ]
