Brazil confirmed 1098 [yellow fever] cases and 340 deaths in the period [1 Jul 2017 to 20 Mar 2018]. During the same period last year [2017], there were 632 confirmed cases and 201 deaths.

The Ministry of Health updated the information provided by the state secretariats of health concerning the yellow fever situation in the country on [Wed 21 Mar 2018]. During the monitoring period (1 Jul 2017 to 20 Mar 2018) there were 1098 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country with 340 deaths. In total, during this period 4102 suspected cases were reported, of which 2150 were discarded and 854 remain under investigation. Last year [2017] during the same monitoring period [July 2016 to 20 Mar 2017], there were 632 confirmed cases and 201 confirmed deaths. These reports of yellow fever cases show a pattern of disease seasonality, occurring mainly in summer, with the period of analysis considered to be 1 Jul-30 Jun of each year.

Although the number of cases of the current monitoring period have been higher than during the previous season, yellow fever today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that have the greatest contingent of the population, hitting 34.8 million, including people who live in areas where [yellow fever] vaccination had never been recommended. In the past season, for example, the outbreak hit a population [at risk] of 9.1 million people.

This explains why the incidence of the disease in this period is lower than in the past period. The incidence of the disease in the monitoring period of 2017-2018 up to [Tue 20 Mar 2018] is 2.9 cases for 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season, 2016/2017, the incidence was 6.9 per 100 000 inhabitants, in the same period [but with a smaller population at risk].

Expansion
The entire territory of Brazil will be the area recommended for yellow fever vaccination. This measure will be done gradually, beginning this year [2018] and being concluded in April 2019. The expansion and prevention has as its objective anticipation and prevention against the disease for the entire population in case of an increase in the area of virus circulation.

Some states in the north east and part of the south and south east are not part of the areas currently recommended for vaccination. With the expansion, 77.5 million people in the entire country must be vaccinated. This number corresponds to a current estimate of people not vaccinated in these new areas.

[Although the yellow fever (YF) outbreak was declared over last year (2017), cases continue to increase, albeit slowly, including in the major metropolitan municipalities. The above report provides a good update on the current YF situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Although there have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission the risk remains that spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note from the case numbers above that cases of YF in humans and monkeys are occurring in areas outside of the 3 states where the main outbreak is occurring. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance in a broad area of Brazil is important. Expansion of the area for vaccination is prudent but ambitious. No comment is made above about the availability of vaccine for the 77.5 million people to be covered, nor if a fractionated or full dose of the vaccine will be administered.
