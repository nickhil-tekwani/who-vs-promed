[ProMED thanks Dr Mahmoud Orabi for alerting us to this outbreak. A review of leishmaniasis in Libya by J Alvar and colleagues (Alvar J, et al. and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Supplement S54, Libya) states:

"Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL, is endemic with occasional outbreaks. The estimated total number of cases between 1971 and 2009 was over 55 000. In 2006, over 7000 cases were recorded in 8 districts, with an outbreak of 3961 cases in Musrata and the disease spread to non-endemic areas. That same year, a control program was started and the number of cases decreased to 1800 in 2008. In 2009, the prevalence of CL was 7.1/10 000 population.

"Risk factors were identified: the occupational exposure to infection of outdoor workers, a lack of knowledge on how to prevent infection, the closeness of animal shelters to houses, and increased soil moisture."
