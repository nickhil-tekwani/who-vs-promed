Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed in 26 Colorado counties: Adams, Alamosa, Arapahoe, Archuleta, Boulder, Broomfield, Chaffee, Conejos, Delta, Douglas, Fremont, Gilpin, Grand, Gunnison, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Mineral, Montezuma, Montrose, Morgan, Ouray, Park, Pueblo, and Weld.

"While we have an overall greater number of premises that have been released from quarantine, we still have a steady number of cases being reported on a daily basis," said State Veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr. "We are seeing increasing numbers in different areas and new counties across the state. It is important to remain diligent in checking your horses and livestock for VSV [vesicular stomatitis virus] lesions and contacting your veterinarian."

All VSV cases are important for the epidemiology and management of this outbreak and must be reported to the State Veterinarian's Office at (303) 869-9130, regardless if the owner and veterinarian decide to have their livestock tested or choose to manage as positive premises based on the presence of typical clinical signs without testing. The only cases that may be managed as suspect positive are equine cases located in counties that have confirmed cases.

Equine owners and livestock producers across the state are impacted by VSV; all livestock owners should carefully watch the case numbers and affected counties to gauge their level of risk and institute mitigation measures.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA)'s Animal Health division is updating this table regularly with the latest data on its CDA VSV website at https://www.colorado.gov/aganimals/vesicular-stomatitis-virus-vsv.

[2] USDA update

On 23 Aug 2019 the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a situation report for vesicular stomatitis that confirmed 43 new vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) affected premises (14 confirmed positive and 29 suspect).

Newly confirmed positive counties (with numbers of cases) [in 4 states] include:

Colorado
- Chaffee (2)
- Fremont (1)
- Park (1)
Nebraska
- Dawes (1)
Texas
- Ellis (1)
Wyoming
- Hot Springs (1)

In addition, the USDA identified new suspect premises (with numbers of suspect cases) in the following counties [in 4 states]:

Colorado
- Adams (1)
- Boulder (1)
- Delta (4)
- Douglas (1)
- Jefferson (2)
- Larimer (2)
- Mesa (7)
- Montezuma (1)
- Montrose (5)
- Weld (2)

Texas
- Williamson (1)

Utah
- Uintah (1)

Wyoming
- Platte (1)

Since the last situation report, 64 previously VSV-infected or suspect premises have been released from quarantine in Colorado; 1 in Nebraska (Lincoln County); 30 in Texas; and 7 in Wyoming.

VSV can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these signs to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for their requirements.

[It is nice to hear a fairly large number of previously quarantined areas are now released from the quarantine.

However, our VSV season is obviously not over, as new cases are still occurring. This outbreak may cease only after a hard frost, capable of killing the insects believed to be responsible for transmitting this virus. Therefore, some may look forward to colder weather. - Mod.TG
