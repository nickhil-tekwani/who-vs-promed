After refusing to share H5N1 avian flu viruses with the World Health
Organization (WHO) since the start of the year [2007], Indonesian officials
revealed on Tue 15 May 2007, that the country sent clinical specimens to a
WHO collaborating laboratory earlier this month [May 2007]. The shipment
was small, however, containing only 3 samples from 2 patients.
Indonesia has confirmed 15 or so human cases since the start of the impasse
over affordable access to pandemic vaccines. It was not clear, whether more
clinical specimens would be sent later, or if this was a one-off gesture.
"I am pleased to announce to all of you that Indonesia has resumed sending
its H5N1 specimens to the WHO collaborating center in Tokyo," Indonesian
health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, told WHO's annual general meeting,
the World Health Assembly, in Geneva (Switzerland). [Dr Masato Tashiro,
director of the WHO Collaborating Center and director of the department of
viral diseases and vaccine control at Japan's National Institute of
Infectious Diseases, said his laboratory began work last week to try and
grow viruses from the specimens, and that they hoped to obtain results this
week].
Supari, who is demanding equitable access to affordable H5N1 vaccine for
developing countries, placed a motion calling for a new system of virus
sharing, one which affords more rights to countries that provide virus
samples to the WHO system. The resolution was brought forward by 17
countries, including Algeria, Laos, Malaysia, Peru, Iraq, and North Korea.
WHO needs regular samples from H5N1-affected countries to monitor the
evolution of the H5N1 family of viruses. That work looks for signs of
mutations that might suggest the viruses are acquiring the ability to more
easily infect people or are becoming resistant to flu drugs such at
oseltamivir (sold as Tamiflu).
The WHO influenza surveillance program, which has been in existence for
more than 50 years, operates on a principle of free sharing. Flu viruses
from around the world are submitted free of charge to WHO reference
laboratories. Viruses deemed to be important new strains are turned into
vaccine seed strains and provided free of charge to vaccine manufacturers.
There was no objection to that system when it was used to make seasonal
influenza vaccine. Annual flu shots are a public health tool used by
wealthy countries; they have not been a priority for developing countries
with many pressing needs and stretched health budgets.The picture has
shifted with the development of H5N1 vaccines, which are being stockpiled
by several countries, including the United States. Other wealthy countries,
such as Canada, have signed long-term contracts with manufacturers to
procure first access to vaccine when a pandemic occurs.
Indonesia, the current hot zone for H5N1 infection, was angered late last
year [2006], when it discovered it would not be given a cut price for
vaccine made from a virus collected within its borders. It has since
demanded viruses from Indonesia not be used to make vaccine without its
prior approval -- a position the World Health Organization has reluctantly
agreed to on an interim basis, while a new sharing agreement is worked out.
At the heart of the proposed WHO compromise is an effort to put together a
virtual vaccine stockpile from which developing countries could draw if
needed. WHO director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said on Tue 15 May 2007,
that she is heartened at the response she is receiving from potential
donors to the notion of a vaccine stockpile. "I am in dialogue with
development partners and with executives from all the leading influenza
vaccine companies. I am greatly encouraged by their commitment," Chan told
the assembly.
The agency's senior official for pandemic influenza, Dr David Heymann, has
said a stockpile of between 40 million and 60 million doses is on the
drawing board. The idea would be to provide developing countries with
limited amounts of vaccine for essential workers, such as police, military,
and health care workers.
Thailand, which has been sympathetic to Indonesia's efforts but was not a
signatory to the resolution, has said it would need enough vaccine to
protect 600 000 people or about one per cent of its population.
Supari said on Tuesday [15 May 2007], that Indonesia would need 22 million
doses of vaccine, enough to protect roughly 10 per cent of that country.
Filling that demand would drain about one-third or one-half of WHO's
proposed stockpile. That is the problem WHO faces. With current production
methods and capacity, global demand for vaccine will far outstrip global
supply in a pandemic, experts insist. Most, if not all manufacturers have
already signed contracts promising their output to developed countries that
are paying to ensure access to that capacity. To date, no company or
country has publicly announced a contribution of vaccine to the virtual
stockpile project.

Indonesia announced on Tue 15 May 2007, that it has resumed sending samples
of H5N1 flu virus from its human cases to international labs so they can
track the evolution of the virus. But only 3 samples have been sent.
Indonesian officials told world health experts meeting in Geneva,
Switzerland, that it will not send more [samples] until there is progress
towards a new international agreement to ensure poor countries get a share
of the vaccines based on such viruses.
WHO officials support Indonesia's rights to fair returns, but told New
Scientist they fear the next flu pandemic may not wait for such
negotiations. Indonesian labs are not able to analyze the viruses'
potential evolution. Indonesia, which has had the most cases of H5N1 flu
after Viet Nam, stopped sending virus samples to laboratories affiliated
with WHO in November 2006, in protest over an Australian vaccine company
that had used an Indonesian isolate to make an H5N1 vaccine, which
Indonesians would be unlikely to be able to buy. [NB: recently revised
figures indicate that in fact the number of human cases of avian influenza
in Indonesia, at 96 now, exceeds that recorded in Viet Nam in the past by
3, see

Indonesia announced it would start sending samples again in March [2007],
but until now, none had been forthcoming -- pending a written agreement
with the WHO labs detailing what they could do with the sample. There has
still been no written agreement, but Japanese officials in Geneva confirmed
that 3 Indonesian samples have now been sent to the WHO collaborating lab
in Tokyo.
Since the country stopped sending virus samples, 15 Indonesians have died
of the virus, and more have fallen ill. Every human infection represents a
chance for the virus to adapt further to people, which could allow it to go
pandemic. The dispute is being thrashed out this week at the WHO's annual
assembly in Geneva. Nyoman Kandun, head of communicable diseases at the
Indonesian health ministry, said sending any more samples, and publishing
the genetic sequences of those that have been sent, would depend on
international negotiations to change WHO rules. These currently allow
commercial firms to make vaccines and patent them without sharing the
profits with the countries where the viruses originated.
WHO officials fear the standoff threatens the world's efforts to prepare an
H5N1 vaccine. Indonesian health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, explains her
stance to New Scientist: "In 2005, when bird flu arrived, we needed Tamiflu
[oseltamivir, the antiviral drug used to treat H5N1]. We contacted Roche,"
the Swiss company that holds the drug's patent and its only source at the
time. "They said we couldn't have any, we would have to wait 2 years,
because industrialized countries had already made advance purchase orders"
for millions of doses of Tamiflu to be stockpiled, which would take Roche
years to manufacture. Other would-be buyers had to get in line. But these
countries had no H5N1 cases. "We already had 20 cases," says Supari.
"That's unfair distribution." She says fair distribution of flu drugs and
flu vaccines should be based on need -- and on which country has cases of
the disease -- not on money. Meanwhile, WHO officials fear that by the time
that perennial problem is worked out it could be too late to develop a
vaccine for any pandemic H5N1 that may emerge from Indonesia.
