A Taichung hospital warned the public Friday [9 Sep 2011] to make sure
to fully cook seafood at barbecues after a man recently died 48 hours
upon swallowing a single raw oyster.

Barbecues are a favorite pastime during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which
falls on 12 Sep in 2011.

The tradition has prompted Taichung Tzu Chi Hospital to give this
warning. The victim, a 50-year-old man, sought medical treatment after
developing the symptoms of fever and fear of cold in late August 2011.


He was still conscious when he checked into the hospital, but soon his
blood pressure dropped, and he became delirious. Doctors suspected he
had a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria _Vibrio vulnificus_
and treated him. The patient had alcoholic liver cirrhosis and died 2
days later due to shock and multiple organ failure.

Huang Ming-yi, director of the hospital's Department of Infectious
Diseases, said that in a case like this, the average person would only
have diarrhea or cellulitis, a skin infection characterized by
swelling, warmth, redness and pain. But the victim had low capability
for detoxing his body because of his liver condition, and could not
tolerate the bacterium.

Huang said the bacteria often appear in the coastal areas of
southwestern Taiwan and in the aquacultural industry. He noted that
there are over one million liver disease and diabetic patients at risk
for severe consequences of this infection. They should be on guard and
not eat raw seafood, especially shellfish.

[It is important to note that not all cases of _V. vulnificus_
infection are acquired by eating raw oysters. The disease can also be
acquired from saltwater exposure itself and has also been linked to
other bivalve molluscs such as clams.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic [salt-loving],
Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine
environments and associated with various marine species such as
plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams and crabs), and finfish. It is
usually found in the warmer waters. Cases of illness have also been
associated with brackish lakes. Environmental factors responsible for
controlling members of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the
environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved
organics.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with
seawater harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on
coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The
ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemic" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with
underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism
can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the
microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock,
rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70
per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions
(shown at http://safeoysters.org/images/sym_2_photo.jpg).

A reasonable discussion of the disease in humans can be found in
ProMED-mail posting "Vibrio vulnificus, salt water exposure - USA (TX) 20070719.2317." There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are
normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage
contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur
in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including
immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes.
So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range
of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern
geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.
