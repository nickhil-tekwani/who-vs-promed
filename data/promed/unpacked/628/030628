The Oregon Department of Agriculture is trying to figure out what killed thousands of honeybees in Sherwood last weekend [19-20 Apr 2014].

A mass of the dead bees were found scattered along on Highway 99 at Sunset Boulevard on Sunday [20 Apr 2014].

"We did receive some calls of concern, and so we're in investigation mode right now," said Oregon Department of Agriculture Insect Pest Prevention & Management specialist Pat Mitchell.

Sherwood resident Danya Anderson was driving on Highway 99 when she spotted the bees.

"There were a bunch on the ground and a bunch swarming," she said. "Some were crawling and some were dead already."

There are agricultural fields nearby, and even a beekeeper's colony less than a mile away. Mitchell said there are many theories as to what happened, but the state won't know for sure until samples can be completely tested.

Last year [2013], tens of thousands of bumblebees were found dead in a Wilsonville shopping center. Anderson said she remembered that die-off, which is partly what prompted her to alert authorities about what she saw in Sherwood. "I know that something similar happened in Wilsonville, so I just want to make sure that the bees around here are OK," Anderson said. "I know that they're important to us."

In the Wilsonville case, 2 companies were eventually fined for spraying pesticide and killing the bees.

[It is expected that the dead bees were found on the highway because it is precisely there where there are people able to spot and report dead bees. However, the fact that there were live bees swarming at the same location makes one wonder whether they were simply killed by the vehicles that were circulating there. - Mod.PMB
