Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iraq over the past decade
--------------------------------------------------
WHO indicates that 2893 cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) were
reported in Iraq in 2001, producing an incidence that year of 10.9 cases per
100 000 population. The major areas of endemicity are central Iraq and the
greater Baghdad metropolitan area, but over the last decade, VL has extended
its reach into additional areas, including that around Basra.
Transmission occurs between May and October, after hatching of sandfly eggs,
while the peak of identification of new cases occurs between December and
January. The etiologic agent of VL is generally _L. donovani_. However, after
Desert Storm in 1991, VL due to _L. tropica_ was detected (often with great
difficulty) in U.S. military personnel (N Engl J Med 1993;328:1383-1387).

First of all, up until the war, data were available from the Ministry of
Health, Baghdad. I discount the possibility of a current "epidemic," as the
transmission season has just begun (the major transmission risk is in
September and October). I cannot discuss the possibility of an increased
number of cases, but the current cases are the last of the 2002 transmission,
due to the long incubation time. It is very different in terms of potential
increasing risk and level of international response. VL is very common in
Iraq, especially in central plains near Baghdad and in some foci between
Baghdad and Basra. VL is due to _L. infantum_ (_L.donovani_).

[ProMED thanks Dr Deresinski for providing the reference to the very valuable
WHO assessment of the communicable disease profile of Iraq, which had escaped
our search for background data. Also thanks to Dr Desjeux for pointing out
that new patients with visceral leishmaniasis were infected during the last
transmission season from May to October 2002, and have no relation to the
present situation.
WHO reports that cutaneous leishmaniasis has decreased over the last 10 years
in Iraq, from a high in 1992 of 8779 cases (45.5 per 100 000 pop.) to 625
cases in 2001 (2.3 per 100 000 pop.). Visceral leishmaniasis has fluctuated
somewhat but seems to be increasing, with 744 cases in 1999 (3.0 per 100 000
pop.) to 2893 (10.9 per 100 000 pop.) in 2001. - Mod.EP]
