[The following message was from William Aldis, who is in Sierra Leone, to
his brother John. ProMED-mail asked for permission from John Aldis to post
it and he graciously gave it. In addition to the information about
availability of ribavirin in Sierra Leone. William's personal insights and
experiences might be enlightening to our subscribers, which is the reason
we are posting it. - Mod.CHC
Dear John,

There is a producer of ribavirin in China. All of the ribavirin we have
here is Chinese origin. It was assayed a couple of years ago and found to
be OK but I have no current info on production standards/manufacturing
practices of the source company. I need to get that info so this prompts me
to go ahead and get it sooner....

Things are tense here. I have retreated from my house (which unfortunately
is right next door to Foday Sankoh's place where at least 10 people were
killed earlier this week) to the UNAMSIL HQ, where I'm crammed into a small
space with UNICEF and WFP reps.

Fortunately they are delightful people and we are having lots of fun.
Yesterday we sent out five teams to the east of Freetown along the path of
displaced people fleeing the fighting. We have assessed the needs of health
clinics in the camps and at key hospitals and government clinics and are
now re-supplying drugs and equipment based on the assessments. Thank God
for Merlin, Concern World Wide, the MSFs, Goal, Terratec and the others who
are all pitching in. By the next day or two, frontline hospitals and
clinics will be able to handle an influx of war wounded etc. if necessary.
Tomorrow I will re-locate to a UN ship offshore. It has a helipad which is
handy. During the day we convoy into our offices. There is scattered
firing now and then but it is mostly re-armed Civil Defense forces just
practicing.

Other than that things are fine. I can get to Guinea in 30 minutes (or out
to the boat in five) so there is no danger. The people here feel a bit let
down by the international community so we want to avoid programme suspension.

William
