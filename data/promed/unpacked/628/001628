Summary
-------------
Background
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.

Methods
To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April [2020]).

Findings
Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April [2020]; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively.

There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April [2020] in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.

Interpretation
Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April [2020], would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

Discussion
COVID-19, a contact-transmissible infectious disease, is thought to spread through a population via direct contact between individuals; 1,9,10. Outbreak control measures aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the population have the potential to delay the peak and reduce the final size of the epidemic. To evaluate the effect of location-specific physical distancing measures -- such as extended school closures and interventions in workplaces -- on the timing and magnitude of the peak and the final size of the epidemic, we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model. We simulated outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices for China. Mathematical models can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 could spread across the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future transmission. We simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan using an age-structured SEIR model.

As individuals' mixing patterns are non-random, they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease. Models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals.

In our model, we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. The measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond. Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the Re above 1, once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion.

Evidence of the effects of various physical distancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce, and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time, either during an outbreak or otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in Wuhan, we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact rates.

Much is unknown about the true age-specific susceptibility and transmissibility of COVID-19. Therefore, we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between children. Furthermore, for simplicity, we assumed that children and adults were equally transmissible, other than the differences in their contact rates (subclinical children could be more infectious than subclinical adults; appendix pp. 5-6). Similar to an influenza-like pathogen, our model suggests that interactions between school children and older individuals in the population have important public health implications, as children might have high infection rates, but the elderly are more vulnerable to severe infections, with potentially fatal outcomes. However, unlike models built for pandemic or seasonal flu, we accounted for the lack of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

This study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies, relying on Wuhan as a case study. Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households.

Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases.

As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models; more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. Nosocomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO.

A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (R0), which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases) and probably varies over time (because of different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent Re based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and the number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan.

We acknowledge that the underlying reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger than that used in our study. However, other studies of early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan, using different methods, arrived at the same estimate with similar ranges. Although the precise effects of interventions might vary by country and different estimates of key parameters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical distancing interventions and the need to carefully calibrate their lifting to avoid 2nd and subsequent waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei's extreme measures. Policy makers are advised to reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health systems.

In conclusion, non-pharmaceutical interventions based on sustained physical distancing have a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak of COVID-19 and lead to a smaller number of overall cases. Lowering and flattening of the epidemic peak is particularly important, as this reduces the acute pressure on the health-care system. Premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually.

[2] Critical Supply Shortages
Date: 25 Mar 2020
Source: NEJM [edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006141?query=featured_home


On 11 Mar 2020, the World Health Organization designated "coronavirus disease 2019" (Covid-19) a global pandemic. As the number of cases in the United States continues to grow, political leaders are encouraging physical (or "social") distancing to slow the rate of transmission. The goal of this practice is to flatten the curve of new infection, thereby avoiding a surge of demand on the health care system, but the effects of physical distancing may take weeks to appear. U.S. hospitals are already reporting shortages of key equipment needed to care for critically ill patients, including ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff. Adequate production and distribution of both types of equipment are crucial to caring for patients during the pandemic.

There is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60 000 to 160 000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.

Equally worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.

The U.S. shortage has multiple causes, including problems with the global supply chain. Before this pandemic, for instance, China produced approximately half the world's face masks. As the infection spread across China, their exports came to a halt. Now, as the infection spreads globally and transmission in China slows, China is shipping masks to other countries as part of goodwill packages. The United States has not been a major recipient.

The shortages have led to pleas from individual U.S. health care providers trying to secure adequate supplies of PPE. The situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas. The evidence to support these recommendations is thin.

What can we do to close the gap between the need and the availability of ventilators and PPE? We need a multipronged strategy. 1st, the Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the President to direct private companies to produce equipment needed for a national emergency. The President should use this power to begin to close the gap. But simply demanding more ventilators won't be enough; there are only a few companies that have the expertise to make these devices. The federal government should not only direct these companies to maximize production but should also order their suppliers and others to maximize the availability of raw materials. Finally, the federal government needs to bring other industries into this effort. Automakers, for instance, have said they might have the capacity to make ventilators. It would be helpful to engage them to see whether and how quickly they can contribute to boosting ventilator supply.

For PPE, the solutions are somewhat different. While the DPA is important for directing private-sector companies to make more PPE, there are additional options as well. U.S. factories, for instance, already produce millions of N95 respirators each month, but most of these are produced under standards not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The government recently lifted the FDA standards, stating that N95s approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health could be used by health care workers. Nevertheless, few state health departments or hospital systems have been able to procure this PPE.

State governments could encourage companies in their communities that might be able to shift production to making this equipment to do so. The elements of PPE are complicated but don't require the intensive capital that ventilator manufacture demands, so smaller regional companies can play a key role in filling the gap. State partnerships with these companies will take ingenuity, meaningful resources, and a relaxation of less essential regulatory requirements.

Another role for government and the health care system must be to reduce hoarding of PPE and to tap into already existing stockpiles. Masks and gloves are used in many nonmedical settings -- construction companies, laboratories, artists, and even the sets of some television shows have stores of these items. Though there has already been a grassroots effort to donate this PPE to health care workers, a coordinated effort by local governments to collect these supplies would be helpful.

Beyond increasing the supply, a crucial role for the government is to coordinate efforts to ensure that the areas hardest hit at any given time are receiving needed equipment. Individual state governments and health care systems are currently competing for resources, and those resources are not necessarily being distributed on the basis of need. Surges of Covid-19 cases are unlikely to happen in all parts of the country at once, so there is an opportunity to coordinate the filling of gaps. As New York City, for instance, sees a surge of Covid-19 cases, other communities with few cases could share their supplies; New York could then pass equipment on when its surge subsides. Although such sharing can happen informally, some degree of federal coordination would be helpful from government agencies such as the CDC or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Partnering with technology companies to track the availability of and projected needs for equipment in real time, ensuring that there is a close match between supply and demand, would also be helpful. Ultimately, this type of coordination could also help in identifying other anticipated supply-chain issues, such as threats to access to pharmaceuticals. A coordinated, nationwide response is not something that individual states have the resources or legal authority to accomplish; thus, the federal government, in partnership with technology companies, could play a critical role.

As the United States braces for a growing wave of patients with Covid-19 in our hospitals and ICUs, we must ensure that we have the key equipment needed to care for patients and to keep our health care workforce safe. Achieving this goal will require a concerted approach from all sectors, from local and national government to the private sector and health care providers themselves. Failure to act in a coordinated manner would keep many patients from getting the care they need and would lead to the situation we see in Italy, in which frontline clinicians are making difficult decisions about who will and who won't receive care. Furthermore, without adequate PPE, health care workers will get sick, endangering the functioning of the entire health care system. The human and economic costs of that scenario should not be underestimated.

[3] Defining COVID-19 Epidemiology
Date: 26 Mar 2020

The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical course, counting severe cases, and treating the sick. Experience with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), pandemic influenza, and other outbreaks has shown that as an epidemic evolves, we face an urgent need to expand public health activities in order to elucidate the epidemiology of the novel virus and characterize its potential impact. The impact of an epidemic depends on the number of persons infected, the infection's transmissibility, and the spectrum of clinical severity.

Thus, several questions are especially critical. 1st, what is the full spectrum of disease severity (which can range from asymptomatic, to symptomatic-but-mild, to severe, to requiring hospitalization, to fatal)? 2nd, how transmissible is the virus? 3rd, who are the infectors; how do the infected person's age, the severity of illness, and other characteristics of a case affect the risk of transmitting the infection to others? Of vital interest is the role that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected persons play in transmission. When and for how long is the virus present in respiratory secretions? And 4th, what are the risk factors for severe illness or death? And how can we identify groups most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts?

Types of Evidence Needed for Controlling an Epidemic.
-----
The table lists approaches to answering these questions, each of which has shown success in prior disease outbreaks, especially MERS and pandemic H1N1 influenza.1

Counting the number of cases, including mild cases, is necessary to calibrate the epidemic response. Conventional wisdom dictates that the sickest people seek care and undergo testing; early in an epidemic, case fatality and hospitalization ratios are often used to assess impact. These measures should be interpreted with caution, since it may take time for cases to become severe, or for infected persons to die, and it may not be possible to accurately estimate the denominator of infected people in order to calculate those ratios. As in past epidemics, the 1st cases of Covid-19 to be observed in China were severe enough to come to medical attention and result in testing, but the total number of people infected has been elusive. The estimated case fatality ratio among medically attended patients thus far is approximately 2%, but the true ratio may not be known for some time.

Simple counts of the number of confirmed cases can be misleading indicators of the epidemic's trajectory if these counts are limited by problems in access to care or bottlenecks in laboratory testing, or if only patients with severe cases are tested. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, an approach was described for maintaining surveillance when cases become too numerous to count. This approach, which can be adapted to Covid-19, involves using existing surveillance systems or designing surveys to ascertain each week the number of persons with a highly sensitive but nonspecific syndrome (for example, acute respiratory infection) and testing a subset of these persons for the novel coronavirus. The product of the incidence of acute respiratory infection (for example) and the percent testing positive provides an estimate of the burden of cases in a given jurisdiction. Now is the time to put in place the infrastructure to accomplish such surveillance. Electronic laboratory reporting will dramatically improve the efficiency of this and other public health studies involving viral testing.

More generally, it is useful to synthesize data from simultaneous surveillance studies, epidemiologic field investigations, and case series. Conducting cohort studies in well-defined settings such as schools, workplaces, or neighborhoods (community surveys) can help in describing the overall burden and the household and community attack rate; perhaps most important, it can permit rapid assessment of the severity of the epidemic by counting the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in a well-defined population and extrapolating that rate to the larger population. Understanding transmissibility remains crucial for predicting the course of the epidemic and the likelihood of sustained transmission. Several groups have estimated the basic reproductive number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 using epidemic curves, but household studies can be superior sources of data on the timing and probability of transmission and may be useful in estimation of R0.

Household studies can also help define the role that subclinical, asymptomatic, and mild infections play in transmission to inform evidence-based decisions about prioritization of control measures; measures that depend on identification and isolation of symptomatic persons will be far more effective if those persons have the primary role in transmission. On the other hand, if persons without symptoms can transmit the virus, more emphasis should be placed on measures for social distancing, such as closing schools and avoiding mass gatherings. To evaluate whether the risks that school closure poses to children's well-being and education -- and to productivity if working parents are needed for child care -- are justified, we must learn whether children are an important source of transmission. Household studies can also be used to conduct viral shedding studies that can help determine when patients are most infectious and for how long they should be isolated.

A key point of these recommendations is that viral testing should not be used only for clinical care. A proportion of testing capacity must be reserved to support public health efforts to characterize the trajectory and severity of the disease. Although this approach may result in many negative test results and therefore appear "wasteful," such set-aside capacity will permit a far clearer understanding of the spread of the epidemic and wiser use of resources to combat it. Testing in unexplained clusters or severe cases of acute respiratory infections, regardless of a patient's travel history, may be a sensitive way to screen for chains of transmission that may have been missed. Such findings are relevant particularly in light of evidence that even Singapore, with one of the world's best public health systems, has found cases that have so far not been linked to known cases or to Chinese travel. If such undetected introductions are happening in Singapore, it is prudent to expect they are happening elsewhere as well.

Early investments in characterizing SARS-CoV-2 will pay off handsomely in improving the epidemic response. If sustained transmission takes off outside China, as many experts expect, the urgency of the epidemic will necessitate choices about which interventions to employ, under which circumstances, and for how long. Starting these epidemiologic and surveillance activities promptly will enable us to choose the most efficient ways of controlling the epidemic and help us avoid interventions that may be unnecessarily costly or unduly restrictive of normal activity.

Many urban centers in China are or will soon be overwhelmed with the treatment of severe cases. It may be difficult for many of them to perform the kinds of studies described here. One exception is systematic surveys of persons who are not suspected to have Covid-19 or who have mild respiratory illness, to assess whether they are currently subclinically infected (viral testing), have been infected previously (serologic testing), or both. These studies, which will inform estimates of the severity spectrum, will be most informative in the settings that have the most cases.

Fortunately, the numbers of detected cases outside China remain manageable for public health authorities and too small for the conduct of such studies. But it is vital for jurisdictions outside mainland China to prepare to perform these studies as case numbers grow.

[4] Estimates of COVID-19 Fatality Rate
Date: 27 Mar 2020

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30244-9/fulltext


Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December [2019], a question at the forefront of many people's minds has been its mortality rate. Is the mortality rate of COVID-19 higher than that of influenza, but lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)?

The trend in mortality reporting for COVID-19 has been typical for emerging infectious diseases. The case fatality rate (CFR) was reported to be 15% (6 of 41 patients) in the initial period, but this estimate was calculated from a small cohort of hospitalised patients. Subsequently, with more data emerging, the CFR decreased to between 4•3% and 11•0%, and later to 3•4%. The rate reported outside China in February 2020 was even lower (0•4%; 2 of 464).

This pattern of decreasing CFRs is not surprising during the initial phase of an outbreak. Hard outcomes such as the CFR have a crucial part in forming strategies at national and international levels from a public health perspective. It is imperative that health-care leaders and policy makers are guided by estimates of mortality and case fatality.

However, several factors can restrict obtaining an accurate estimate of the CFR. The virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them. Health care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, also affect outcomes. For example, some countries are able to invest resources into contact tracing and containing the spread through quarantine and isolation of infected or suspected cases. In Singapore, where these measures have been implemented, the CFR of 631 cases (as of 25 Mar 2020) is 0•3%. In other places, testing might not be widely available, and proactive contact tracing and containment might not be employed, resulting in a smaller denominator and skewing to a higher CFR. The CFR can increase in some places if there is a surge of infected patients, which adds to the strain on the health-care system and can overwhelm its medical resources.

A major challenge with accurate calculation of the CFR is the denominator: the number of people who are infected with the virus. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, patients with mild symptoms, or individuals who are misdiagnosed could be left out of the denominator, leading to its underestimation and overestimation of the CFR.

A unique situation has arisen for quite an accurate estimate of the CFR of COVID-19. Among individuals onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, data on the denominator are fairly robust. The outbreak of COVID-19 led passengers to be quarantined between 20 Jan and 29 Feb 2020. This scenario provided a population living in a defined territory without most other confounders, such as imported cases, defaulters of screening, or lack of testing capability. 3711 passengers and crew were onboard, of whom 705 became sick and tested positive for COVID-19, and 7 died, giving a CFR of 0.99 percent. If the passengers onboard were generally of an older age, the CFR in a healthy, younger population could be lower. Although highly transmissible, the CFR of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS (9•5%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (34•4 percent), but higher than that of influenza (0•1 percent).

[5] What does Viral Load mean?
Date: 27 Mar 2020

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30237-1/fulltext


In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Francois-Xavier Lescure and colleagues describe the 1st cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Europe, which were reported in France. The detailed clinical features of 5 patients with COVID-19 are aligned with the quantitative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA load from nasopharyngeal and other selected sampling sites. Previous studies in patients with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 generally provide insufficient detail to allow examination of the relationship between individual patient clinical course and viral RNA load.

Although patient numbers are small, the authors provide the 1st COVID-19 time series correlating viral RNA load and detailed clinical manifestations.

Importantly, the dataset is provided in sufficient detail so it could be readily combined with future similar studies for deeper analysis.

Although the authors make a case for COVID-19 presenting as 3 distinct clinical patterns, we believe a distinction based on such small numbers is highly speculative. Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication, there are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset.

Unfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of 2 patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome and possibly those with COVID-19.

With more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.

In a pandemic, prevention of disease transmission is key. Lescure and colleagues wisely note the implications for transmission from patients with few symptoms but high viral RNA load in the nasopharynx early in the course of disease. Individuals within the community, policy makers, and frontline health-care providers, especially general and emergency room practitioners, should be alert and prepared to manage this risk. Equally worrying is the persistently high nasopharyngeal viral RNA load, and the detection of viral RNA in blood and pleural fluid, of the older patient (aged 80 years) with severe multi-organ dysfunction. This finding broadly correlates with the severely ill group data reported by Zou and colleagues and has important implications for therapy and infection control. Development and effective administration of antiviral therapy to critically ill patients throughout the course of disease is likely to remain important. Vigilance regarding the strict implementation of transmission precautions is required throughout the prolonged course of COVID-19 in patients who are critically ill, and ancillary staff responsible for collecting and disposing of bodily fluids or waste, who are at high risk during an outbreak, should be properly protected and trained.

It is noteworthy that the presence of viral RNA in specimens does not always correlate with viral transmissibility. In a ferret model of H1N1 infection, the loss of viral culture positivity but not the absence of viral RNA coincided with the end of the infectious period. In fact, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR results remained positive 6-8 days after the loss of transmissibility.

For SARS coronavirus, viral RNA is detectable in the respiratory secretions and stool of some patients after onset of illness for more than one month, but live virus could not be detected by culture after week 3.

The inability to differentiate between infective and non-infective (dead or antibody-neutralised) viruses remains a major limitation of nucleic acid detection. Despite this limitation, given the difficulties in culturing live virus from clinical specimens during a pandemic, using viral RNA load as a surrogate remains plausible for generating clinical hypotheses.

[6] Clinical and virological data of the 1st cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series
Date: 27 Mar 2020

Background
---------------
On 31 Dec 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the 1st cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the 1st patient diagnosed with the disease on 24 Jan 2020.

Methods
------
In this case series, we followed 5 patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.

Findings
--------
The patients were 3 men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and 2 women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) 2 paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the 1st 24 hours of the illness onset (5•2 and 7•4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a 2-step disease progression in 2 young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (14 Feb 2020); all other patients had recovered and had been discharged by 18 Feb 2020.

Interpretation
----------
We illustrated 3 different clinical and biological types of evolution in 5 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

[7] Epidemic preparedness in urban settings: new challenges and opportunities
Date: 27 Mar 2020

In recent decades, many emerging infectious diseases have been occurring at an increasing scale and frequency, i.e. Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian and pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The outbreaks of these diseases resulted in wide ranging socioeconomic consequences, including loss of lives and disruption to trade and travel. Preparedness is a crucial investment because its cost is small compared with the unmitigated impact of a health emergency. The financing gap for preparedness, estimated at USD 4.5 billion per year, is miniscule compared with estimated pandemic costs of USD 570 billion per year.

Within urban settings, preparedness activities have the added challenge of navigating a host of disruptive determinants that demand innovative solutions, especially the way in which diseases and their human hosts behave.

Ensuring that urban settings are prepared for emerging infectious diseases is crucially important. In 2018, 55% of the world's population (4.2 billion people) resided in urban areas, and this proportion might increase to 68% by 2050.

Emerging infectious diseases also either originate in urban settings, such as the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, or rapidly propagate because of urbanisation once they are established, such as outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Zika virus disease in the Americas.

Many cities are important hubs of travel and trade; hence an uncontained outbreak would result in severe economic consequences beyond lives lost. More importantly, these urban centres risk becoming conduits of transmission to the world. As seen from the spread of COVID-19, diseases now follow major patterns of travel connections both domestically (with major cities in China connected by high speed rail) and internationally through flights. For example, as of 17 Feb 2020, there were 172 exported cases of COVID-19 from China to 25 countries, with 156 secondary cases in 14 countries, and these were mostly in major cities with travel connections to China.

Urban settings have some common characteristics, many of which are disruptive factors that need to be addressed for effective preparedness. For example, the density of people in housing, during commutes using public transportation, and in work environments is high. Inequalities, exacerbated by the rapid influx of people from rural areas, often results in poor housing, insufficient supply of fresh water, poor sanitation facilities, and ineffective ventilation systems, all of which increase outbreak risks. Rapid urbanisation might lead to encroachment into natural habitats and closer encounters with wildlife and zoonoses, and increased proximity to animals in backyard farms and food markets also provides opportunities for zoonotic infections. Both SARS and COVID-19 might have originated from food markets, and of the 335 emerging infectious diseases recognised between 1940 and 2004, more than 60% were of zoonotic origin.

Ensuring better preparedness in urban settings will require a fresh emphasis on strengthening capacities to deal with outbreaks and other health emergencies. Many of these efforts are applicable across all settings, urban or otherwise, such as having a good understanding of the local socioeconomic and cultural milieu and an active involvement of communities and local leaders in both planning and implementation. However, urban settings also offer new opportunities (table), such as securing the commitment of local leaders and strengthening public health networks to prevent, detect, and respond to disease threats early. Businesses can be appropriately engaged to manage employees in an emergency, and risk communication can be pushed through prevalent social media networks. Many lessons will also be learned from the city-wide community containment measures in Wuhan -- the largest community quarantine exercise in history -- and other containment measures rolled out in other Chinese cities and in Singapore.

Many urban settings now have substantial expertise and experience in preparing for and dealing with health emergencies. Having had large outbreaks of infectious diseases, authorities in some urban areas have developed purpose-built surveillance systems that make use of digital and web-based information.

Other local authorities have established surge capacity and contingency plans, including strong links with health-care facilities and national coordination bodies.

In some urban settings, complex simulation exercises have been run, and disease spread has been modelled to determine the most effective public health actions to control the spread of infectious diseases.

There is room for sharing of best practices and measures in urban settings. Having an assessment and evaluation tool that is tailored for urban settings might also be useful for preparedness planning.

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a strong reminder that urbanisation has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and the need to strengthen systems and local capacities to prevent the spread of infectious diseases is urgent. As a global community, we must collectively invest in and build strong preparedness systems that are better adapted to increasingly urbanised settings.

[8] Mental health considerations for children quarantined because of COVID-19
Date: 27 Mar 2020
Source: Lancet [edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30096-1/fulltext


To control the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Chinese government has implemented strict domestic quarantine policies. As of 24 Mar 2020, more than 80 000 individuals with COVID-19, and 690 000 individuals who have come into close contact with individuals with COVID-19 have been registered and quarantined, including a large number of children.

This quick action has effectively slowed the spread of new cases of infection on both the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world. However, researchers have realised that such measures might have adverse psychological effects on children who are quarantined. For children who are quarantined at home with their parents or relatives, the stress caused by such a sharp change in their environment might be eased to some degree.

However, children who are separated from their caregivers require special attention, including children infected with or suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), who are quarantined in local hospitals or collective medical observation centres; and children whose caregivers are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who have died from the disease and are thus under the care of social charity groups. These children might be more susceptible to mental health problems because of their higher risk of infection, and the grief and fear caused by parental loss or separation.

Companionship is essential for children's normal psychological development and wellbeing. Separation from caregivers pushes children into a state of crisis and might increase the risk of psychiatric disorders.

Sprang and colleagues reported that children who were isolated or quarantined during pandemic diseases were more likely to develop acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and grief. 30% of the children who were isolated or quarantined met the clinical criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Furthermore, separation from parents or parental loss during childhood also has long-term adverse effects on mental health, including a higher risk of developing mood disorders and psychosis, and death by suicide in adulthood.

The age of the initial separation is known to be relevant to psychological development. The parent-child separation initiated in the 1st few years after birth might disrupt the ongoing attachment processes, which might be associated with poorer mental health outcomes.

The Chinese government has implemented a series of strategies to prevent the potential mental health problems that might arise among children who are quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in many Chinese tier 1 cities -- typically the largest and wealthiest -- like Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou, nurses are guaranteed to be available 24 hours per day in the children's isolation ward. Nutritionists are invited to give professional guidance for children's diets according to their medical conditions and normal developmental requirements. To reduce fear and other psychological discomfort, children who are quarantined can communicate with their parents via mobile devices at any time. Many citizens from the local community or district volunteers act as temporary mothers to care for recovered children after their discharge, when their caregivers are not available because of infection, quarantine, or death. In response to the notice on improving rescue and protection for children without effective guardianship issued by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, many cities like Zhengzhou opened free psychological counselling hotlines, which were available 24 hours per day.

Most recently, the National Health Commission of China issued guidelines and listed specific intervention strategies for children who are quarantined in collective medical observation centres. For example, these measures seek to increase children's communication time with their parents; increase children's access to disease information via comic books and videos; guide children to establish a regular activity schedule; provide night lights and small gifts; and provide timely referrals to psychiatrists when children feel mental discomfort, such as worry, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and loss of appetite.

Although great efforts have been made across China, the emerging psychological interventions are unlikely to be provided nationwide because most local support for unaccompanied children focuses only on meeting children's basic daily needs. We propose that paediatric health-care workers should receive formal training to facilitate the early identification of children's mental health problems by learning to discern children's normal and abnormal behaviours, recognise red flags indicating further intervention or referral are needed, and standardise the use of rapid screening tools for mental health. Furthermore, mental health professionals should establish evidence-based guidelines and easy operational strategies to cope with COVID-19 pandemic-related mental health problems in children. We also believe that children's access to mental health services can be improved through collaborative networks that are established nationwide and consist of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, researchers, and community volunteers. Additionally, the post-pandemic surveillance of mental disorders among these children should be considered. Since the global transmission of COVID-19 began, the total number of cases in countries other than China have already exceeded that in China. Following WHO's recommendation, an increasing number of countries have learned from China's experience with regard to quarantine policies. We suggest that the specific response to the mental distress of children who are quarantined should also be considered when designing psychological intervention strategies in response to COVID-19.

[9] Role of CT in COVID-19 Diagnosis
Date: 27 Mar 2020
Source: Lancet [edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30728-5/fulltext


Radiologists have watched the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfold, wondering whether and how imaging could be useful for diagnosis. Perhaps imaging could aid in screening or accelerate the speed of diagnosis, especially with shortages of RT-PCR.

Some radiology literature suggests a pivotal role for CT. Ai and colleagues report on 1014 patients who received both RT-PCR and CT in Wuhan, China, during their epidemic. They found that 97% of cases with RT-PCR-confirmed diagnoses had CT findings of pneumonia, and conclude, "CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19". Other investigators are less optimistic. Inui and colleagues reviewed CT scans of 112 cases of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Less than 2/3rds (61%) of cases had lung opacities on CT; 20% of symptomatic patients had negative CTs.

Although extremely valuable, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied (e.g. ground-glass opacity, consolidation) are not specific for COVID-19. Similar results would probably be found if CT were used during an influenza epidemic, for example. The positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, as we suspect it was in Wuhan. Their cohort includes "patients suspected of [COVID-19]," presumably sick and possibly hospitalised, although details are not provided.

RT-PCR to diagnose COVID-19 has some limitations: the test is not universally available, turnaround times can be lengthy, and reported sensitivities vary. Nevertheless, it is the accepted standard and only positive in patients who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CT findings in patients with COVID-19, on the other hand, are seen with numerous pathogens and in many non-infectious aetiologies. We believe CT does not add diagnostic value; positive results can only be believed if the pre-test probability of disease is high. Using CT diagnostically is not known to provide clinical benefit and could lead to false security if results are negative. If COVID-19 is suspected, patients should be isolated pending confirmation with (multiple) RT-PCR tests, or until quarantine has lapsed. The results of a CT scan do not change this.

We feel that framing CT as pivotal for COVID-19 diagnosis is a distraction during a pandemic, and possibly dangerous. Safely using CT to study COVID-19 patients is logistically challenging and can overwhelm available resources. Even with proper cleaning protocols, health-care professionals and CT scanners could become vectors of infection to other vulnerable patients who require imaging. We urge caution and encourage using published guidelines regarding use of CT imaging.

[10] 3D-video shows Covid-19 attacking lungs
Date: 26 Mar 2020
Source: CNN [edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/health/covid-19-lung-damage-video/index.html


George Washington University Hospital: The Washington, D.C., hospital recently released a 3D video of a coronavirus patient's lungs.

The imagery shows extensive damage to the lungs of a generally healthy 59-year-old male with high blood pressure, Mortman said. Since becoming seriously ill, the patient requires a ventilator to help him breathe, but even on the highest setting, it's not enough. He also needs another machine that circulates and then oxygenates his blood, Mortman said.

"This is not a 70, 80-year-old immunosuppressed, diabetic patient," Mortman said. "Other than high blood pressure, he has no other significant medical issues. This is a guy who's minding his own business and gets it. ... If we were to repeat the 360VR images now, that is one week later, there is a chance that the infection and inflammatory process could be worse."

Areas marked in yellow on the video represent infected and inflamed parts of the lung, Mortman said. When the lungs encounter a viral infection, the organ will start to seal the virus off. From the scan, it is clear that the damage isn't localized to a single area, but instead covers massive swaths of both lungs, showing how rapidly and aggressively the infection can take hold, even in younger patients. A patient with healthy lungs would have no yellow on the scan, he said.

The patient remains in critical condition in the ICU.

"For these patients, who essentially present in progressive respiratory failure, the damage to the lungs is rapid and widespread (as evidenced in the VR video)," Mortman said in an email. "Unfortunately, once damaged to this degree, the lungs can take a long time to heal. For approximately 2-4% (depending on which numbers you believe) of patients with Covid-19, the damage is irreversible, and they will succumb to the disease."

The coronavirus is primarily respiratory in nature. It "gets into the mucus membranes, and then it's in the lung. The way the body tries to control that is with inflammation," Mortman said.

The yellow marks both infection and inflammation. "So you get this pretty strong inflammatory process in the lungs in the body's attempt to control the infection," Mortman said. That would cause a patient to gasp, or inhale a lot of air to balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

The images suggest that the words to describe common symptoms -- coughing and shortness of breath -- can't really capture the impact of the virus on the body. In some people, Mortman said, the damage will be irreversible, making it imperative that Americans heed advice on social distancing and self-isolation.

"I want people to see this and understand what this can do," Mortman said. "People need to take this seriously."

The hospital typically uses the CT imaging technology that produced the video for cancer screenings and to plan surgeries. But for the 1st time, the technology has now been applied to fighting the novel coronavirus.

[11] Vaccine Trials
Date: 27 Mar 2020
Source: NIAID [abridged, edited]
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/atlanta-site-added-nih-clinical-trial-vaccine-covid-19


Emory University in Atlanta will begin enrolling healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years in a Phase 1 clinical trial of an investigational vaccine designed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The trial, supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, began last week at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. KPWHRI and Emory are part of NIAID's Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium.

The trial aims to enroll a total of 45 participants across the 2 sites. NIAID scientists and clinicians have been closely monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 in Washington and throughout the United States. They decided to expand the trial to another geographic area to ensure efficient enrollment.

Evan Anderson, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics and medicine, and Nadine Rouphael, M.D., associate professor of medicine, will lead the study at Emory. Participants will receive 2 shots of the experimental vaccine approximately one month apart and will be followed for approximately one year. The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, was developed by scientists at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center and the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

For more details on the trial, please see NIAID's 16 Mar 2020 press release and visit ClinicalTrials.gov and search identifier NCT04283461. Adults in the Atlanta area who are interested in joining this study should contact <vaccine@emory.edu> (for the Hope Clinic in Decatur) or <ecc.vaccine@emory.edu> (for the Emory campus in Atlanta).
