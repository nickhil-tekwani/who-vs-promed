Yellow fever arrives in Khartoum
--------------------------------
The Minister of Health from the state of Khartoum revealed the emergence of the 1st case of yellow fever in the capital of Sudan, according to a press statement from Thu 8 Nov 2012. Minister Mamoun Hamida said this is the same type of fever that has been spreading in Darfur. Hamida explained that the infected patient has been isolated and will be submitted to health care. He advised citizens from Khartoum to use mosquito nets to prevent the disease.

The press statement also read that a vaccination campaign against yellow fever will be launched in Khartoum. In addition, the government will reportedly distribute 150 mosquito nets in areas where most mosquitoes are found and it will monitor the movement of people traveling out of Sudan, who will be obliged to get vaccinated in health centers. The Sudanese Council of Ministers appealed to citizens to restrict their movement to the affected areas, as the disease is infectious and is spread by mosquitoes.

At the same time, the Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Social Affairs of the parliament, Amira al-Sir, announced that airplanes coming from Darfur to Khartoum will be sprayed with pesticide.

Central Darfur
--------------
According to a coordinator of Hamidiya camp in Zalingei, Central Darfur, local citizens are complaining about the lack of vaccinations and the lack of treatment against the yellow fever. They are also discontent with the lack of health education provided by the government concerning information about the disease and how to prevent it. Citizens claimed that ... doctors, specialists and states' ministers are prevented from releasing information about it to the media. Darfur citizens demanded that the government declares the region a 'disaster zone' ...

Central Darfur residents confirmed to Radio Dabanga that both the local and federal ministries of health have not yet launched spraying campaigns or begun the distribution of mosquito nets.

The disease 1st appeared in the region 2 months ago. Civilians appealed to the World Health Organization to immediately intervene in the situation. They also demanded that the government of Sudan lifts movements' restrictions in Darfur so that humanitarian organizations can reach the affected areas.

Sudan: Fever Kills 78, Reaches 'Epidemic Level'
----------------------------------------------
The spread of yellow fever in Darfur reached an 'epidemic level' that requires immediate intervention from the central government, according to an announcement made by Member of Parliament Ibrahim Abbaker on Wed 7 Nov 2012.

According to an official from the Ministry of Health from Khartoum, the number of cases of hemorrhagic fever in Darfur has reached more than 220. He revealed that 78 people have died so far in 18 localities.

The official disclosed to Radio Dabanga that the World Health Organization (WHO) sent samples of the virus to Dakar, in Senegal, for examination. This way, he explained, authorities will find out the exact nature of the disease that is spreading across Darfur.

The source hopes that the Sudanese Ministry of Health will receive the result of the tests this week still, so that vaccines against the disease can be ordered and a campaign targeting 3.5 million people in Darfur can be launched. He expects that, once ordered, the vaccines would arrive within 2 weeks in Darfur, Radio Dabanga was informed.

The ministry of health from South Darfur announced that 47 people had been infected with the fever by Tuesday [6 Nov 2012]... In a statement, the ministry stressed the importance of providing vaccinations to citizens of Darfur. At the same time, Issa Mohamed, minister of health of Central Darfur, revealed that yellow fever cases rose to 141, including 58 deaths, until Tuesday.

In West Darfur, the government announced that the total cases of yellow fever reached 51 by Tuesday, and that 22 people have died.

The federal Ministry of Health has reportedly issued strict orders to health ministers from Darfur preventing them from talking or making any statements to the media concerning the yellow fever epidemic and its mortality rates. Instead, ministers are expected to provide facts about the disease to the federal department of epidemiology 3 times a week, sources told Radio Dabanga. This way, they explained, the federal government can process the information before releasing it to the media... In addition, citizens demanded that the government officially declares Darfur a 'disaster area.'

Darfur residents are calling on the international community and humanitarian organizations, including the WHO, to immediately intervene and save human lives in Darfur.

New mosquito type
-----------------
Ali Mirghani, South Darfur director of epidemiology revealed to Radio Dabanga that a new type of mosquito has been spreading in 2 Nyala neighborhoods, Sikka Hadeed and Al-Wadi. He called on media campaigns to educate citizens about combating the larval and water stages of these mosquitoes. Meanwhile, the federal Minister of Health, Bahr Idriss Abu Garda, stated that the disease spread by this mosquito can be controlled with vaccinations. Lastly, Mirghani revealed that an armed group has kidnapped 2 vehicles with 3 employees of the ministry of health who were working on spraying areas around Mershing and East Jebel Marra, North Darfur, Radio Dabanga has learned on Thursday [8 Nov 2012].

[South Darfur = 47 cases
Central Darfur = 141 cases within 58 deaths
West Darfur = 51 cases with 22 deaths

This makes 80 deaths not 78 as reported. - Corr.SB]

[In Khartoum, the dry season began this month [November 2012] and it is hot and dusty, so it is difficult to imagine extensive mosquito breeding there. Can anybody tell us what the house index for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes is in the city? See 10-day weather forecast at:
http://www.foreca.in/Sudan/Khartoum?tenday.

I repeat that, since yellow fever vaccination needs 10 days to become protective, it is urgent to start mass vaccination as soon as possible -- but the security situation in Darfur is obviously difficult. - Mod.JW]
