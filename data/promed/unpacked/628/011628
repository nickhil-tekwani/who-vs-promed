I am very concerned about the tone of the remarks about the North Carolina
Department of Health, especially as these remarks appear to come from the
moderator.
I know the moderators are volunteers, and I am generally grateful for the
often thankless work they do, but I think ProMED-mail is not well served by
editorial comments that sound like attacks on public health authorities.
We may well disagree about priorities sometimes, but that does not make us
fools or knaves.

[Thanks very much to Dr. Hopkins for his comments. I'm sorry if what I said
could be construed to be an attack on the public health authorities. I
realize, at least for North Carolina public health authorities, how
difficult the load from this epidemic has been to shoulder. My comments
came from frustrations concerning the way we fund public health in an era
of diminished governmental resources. The lack of flexibility in funding and
the ensuing lack of response to an epidemic is what I was trying to
highlight. Once again, I'm sorry if anyone reading the posting felt like I
was attacking their efforts rather than elements of our system of funding
public health.
