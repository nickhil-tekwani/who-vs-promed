The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday [23 May 2008] confirmed
the 1st human case of bird flu in Bangladesh, a baby boy who has
recovered, bringing the number of countries which have recorded human
infections to 15. Bangladesh authorities announced the case on
Thursday [22 May 2008], and the WHO said it had been confirmed by a
laboratory at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in Atlanta. "The case was confirmed by CDC in Atlanta. It is
the 1st in Bangladesh," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told Reuters.

The 16-month-old boy was infected in January 2008 and has since
recovered, he said. Bangladesh authorities informed the United
Nations agency promptly about the case, but it took time for the
international laboratory testing to be completed, Hartl said.

The H5N1 virus was 1st detected in Bangladesh in March last year
[2007], and since then, the authorities have culled around 2 million
chickens and destroyed more than 2 million eggs. Avian influenza has
spread through 47 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, causing losses of
about 45 billion taka [USD 650 million] for the growing poultry
sector, which accounts for 1.6 percent of the impoverished nation's
gross domestic product. "When a disease is so widespread in poultry,
it is really a matter of time before you get a human case. It shows
the need to control the disease in animals if you are going to reduce
the chances of transmission to humans," Hartl said.

The virus rarely infects people, but experts fear it could mutate or
combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark
a pandemic, which could kill millions of people. Prior to the
Bangladesh case, 14 countries had reported 382 cases including 241
fatalities since 2003, according to the WHO.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the 1st case of human avian H5N1
influenza virus infection, as reported yesterday (24 May 2008) in
ProMED-mail. The new information is that the infection was contracted
in January 2008, and independent confirmation of the local diagnosis
was not available until late May 2008. The affected child has since
recovered, but the nature of his exposure remains unexplained.

Bangladesh has become the 15th country to report human avian H5N1
virus infection. The other 14 countries are: Azerbaijan, Cambodia,
China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Lao People's Democratic
Republic, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Viet Nam.
