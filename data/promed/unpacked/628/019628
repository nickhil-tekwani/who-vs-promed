The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation today reported the finding in Sweden
of Van A _Enterococcus_. Swedish researchers have, they report, found the
potentially multi-resistant _Enterococcus_ in pig faeces on a Swedish farm.
There is concern that this strain, which may develop resistance against
"all" antibiotics will also be found in meats and other products containing
pork.

[It was my understanding that avoparcin, a vancomycin-like antibiotic that
is used in animal feeds in some parts of the world has not been permitted
for use in Sweden for more than a decade (see ProMED-mail reference cited
above). This may be an isolated incident. Follow-up reports would be
appreciated. - Mod.ES
