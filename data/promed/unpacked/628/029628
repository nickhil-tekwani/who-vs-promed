An outbreak of haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, an infectious disease that
causes swelling and bleeding in
the eyes, has spread across several Mexican states, it was reported on
Wednesday. So far this year
11 465 cases have been reported with the vast majority coming in the
last three months, Reforma
said quoting statistics from the Health Ministry. Just 100 cases had
been reported during this year's
first six months. The numbers of infected people were also sharply up
from 1997 when there were
only 816 cases reported, the newspaper indicated.

[On 17 Oct 1998, Silvio Vega reported to ProMED-mail (981018095719)
that more than
10 000 cases of viral conjunctivitis has been reported in Panama City in
the previous three weeks. It
would be useful to know the etiologic agents of the Panamanian and
Mexican experiences.
Otherwise, we could simply report that "a lot of people are sick in
Panama and Mexico", which we
could say about anywhere.
