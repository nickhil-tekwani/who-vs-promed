Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas has said that
compensation for cattle that died of anthrax in Sirajganj and Pabna
was under consideration. He was addressing a discussion on Saturday
[28 Aug 2010] on anthrax vaccine and remedies of the disease at
Nukali School premises under Potazia union of Shahjadpur upazila in
Sirajganj. Shahjadpur Upazila administration organised the meeting.

Chaired by Potazia Union Parishad chairman Ali Ashraf Bachchu, local
parliament member Chayan Islam, deputy commissioner Md Aminul Islam,
superintendent of police Md Mosharraf Hossain, livestock department's
Dhaka unit deputy-director Dr Ranjit Kumar Saha, district livestock
officer Md Shafiqul Islam, among the others, were present at the meeting.

Earlier on Friday [27 Aug 2010] after launching anthrax vaccines at
Sen Bhangabari of Belkuchi upazila, the minister told journalists
that the government had no plans to give financial aid to people who
lost their cattle to anthrax. However, Biswas said at the meeting
that the government was thinking of introducing cattle insurance soon.

Shahjadpur Upazila Nirbahee Officer (UNO) Md Habibur Rahman on
Saturday said that 5 more people have been identified as infected
with anthrax at Garadah union. [They are aged 28, 25, 72, 12, and 24

[If they are going to get compliance in vaccinating the livestock,
subsidies may well have to be considered. The Canadians, who have
some 50 years experience in this have found that it significantly
increases reporting. Latterly they have found that their farmers got
lazy over vaccinating, so compensation is now only paid to ranchers
who had vaccinated their stock before the 'anthrax' season; i.e.,
sick or dead unvaccinated stock were not grounds for compensation.
Also with the present situation they need to get as many animals
vaccinated in as short a time as possible and then establish an
annual vaccination scheme with surveillance. - Mod.MHJ]

Smuggled 'infected' cattle meat on sale in border areas
-------------------------------------------------------
Sale of smuggled Indian cattle meat in several border areas of
Dinajpur and Joypurhat districts is now a common scene as hundreds of
buyers throng there to get the meat for less than half of local
market price. But the meat, allegedly of cattle that are sold out and
slaughtered after getting infected with different diseases, poses
serious health hazard for consumers, said livestock officials and
locals. Against the backdrop of anthrax infection in a few northern
districts, the situation has become a matter of concern among locals.

The price of one kg of meat is Tk 250 (USD 5.10) in the local market
but the meat smuggled from India is selling only for Tk 110 to 120
per kg as smugglers regularly bring the Indian meat.

The border areas of Mongla and Haripukur of Hakimpur upazila, Katla,
Bhaigarh, Achintapur, Raninagar, Chowtha of Birampur upazila
[district] of Dinajpur, Atapara, Chechra, Koya, Uchna, Hatkhola of
Pachbibi upazila of Joypurhat are being used as 'safe points' for
smuggling the meat to Bangladesh lands.

Mostafizur Rahman Milon, a local journalist in Hakimpur upazila, said
the meat of Indian cattle is regularly brought to Bangladesh
territory without the approval of authorities concerned. Attracted by
its low prices, the eatery owners of the upazila and other areas
often go to the border areas to buy the meat.

"The meat brought from across the Indian border is generally of the
cattle that are slaughtered when the animals fall sick, being
infected with different diseases. It poses high risk of infection by
animal-related diseases including anthrax for the consumers," said an
official of Hakimpur upazila livestock department seeking anonymity.

The brokers smuggle it into Bangladesh land in connivance with some
unscrupulous border guards of both countries as most Indians avoid
the meat, especially beef, on religion grounds, while it has huge
demand in Bangladesh market, he added.

When contacted, Panchbibi Upazila Livestock Officer Dr Mamun Ur
Rashid said he and other officials of his department are aware of the
trade of smuggled Indian meat in bordering areas but they have hardly
any scope to conduct tests as the meat is sold out immediately after
its arrival to local markets.

[Meat that can be smuggled in one direction inwards, can be smuggled
as easily outwards when circumstances change. In this context the
proposal in the Philippines to make it illegal to sell 'hot' meat
(i.e., from sick or dead animals) has much to commend it. See:
