Manifestation of disease: sub- clinical disease
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N3

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1

Birds / 1987 / -- / 0 / 1987 / 0 /

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: following the epidemiological surveillance activities on notifiable avian influenza within the national poultry farming and in poultry for import, low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] subtype H7N3 virus has been identified in a lot [shipment] of monk parakeets (_Myiopsitta M. monachus_) imported from South America, using virus identification test, virus isolation, intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), and gene sequencing. Birds have been quarantined and depopulation, washing, cleaning, and disinfection activities as well as the introduction of sentinel birds have been implemented in the affected production unit.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database shows that from January 2012 to June 2013, Mexico reported 157 outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtype H5N2 [not H7N3]:
Year / No. outbreaks
2012 / 19
2013 / 138

For further details of these outbreaks, select the disease, region/country, and year at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

This appears to be the 1st time a LPAI H7N3 subtype has been identified in Mexico.

The monk parakeet (_Myiopsitta monachus_) is a popular species in the pet trade. It is a relatively small, mostly green parrot with a long, pointed tail and a conspicuous grey breast. The monk parakeet is native to South America, where it occurs east of the Andes from southern Bolivia and Brazil, through Paraguay and Uruguay, and into Argentina. For additional background information, including photos and references, please see http://www.arkive.org/monk-parakeet/myiopsitta-monachus/.

The OIE Terrestrial Code Chapter 10.4 on Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses, Article 10.4.1 defines "poultry" as 'all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose. Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry.' (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm).

According to the information provided by Mexico, the monk parakeet, _Myiopsitta monachus_ would not be considered poultry under the OIE definition, since it appears that it is sold as a pet bird. Therefore, this case should not have been reported as an outbreak in poultry. Perhaps Mexico chose to report this event since it appears to be a different strain, but even so, it probably was not necessary to submit it as an immediate report.

Mexico is currently being affected by a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H7N3. Outbreaks of this HPAI have been occurring since June 2012. In 2012, Mexico closed out the event with 46 reported outbreaks. That final report and map can been obtained from http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012466_20121213_142653.pdf. Unfortunately, in 2013 new outbreaks occurred. Based on Mexico's follow-up report no 10, 64 outbreaks have been reported to date (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013992_20130902_153940.pdf). - Mod.CRD

It would be important to determine the country of origin of the parakeets, to
a) search for the same strain in domestic poultry there
b) alert other countries that are importing them. - Mod.JW
