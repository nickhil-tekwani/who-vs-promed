Anthrax Related Cattle and Deer Die Off in San Angelo Area
--------------------
The Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed
[today - 13 Jul 2007 - Mod. MHJ] a positive anthrax culture on an
animal necropsy specimen that was submitted from Tom Green County due
to a cattle and deer die off that was reported by a private
veterinarian on [6 Jul 2007] to the Texas Department of State Health
Services. For a fact sheet on anthrax, please login to the PHIN
Portal. Regional Zoonosis Control staff may also be reached at the

[A full press release from the Texas Animal Health Commission is
awaited. To date, 17 cattle have died on the index ranch along with
an unspecified number of white-tailed deer. Diagnosis was slow
because the initial presumed diagnosis was a clostridial cause. So a
2nd necropsy was carried out and fresh tissue resubmitted to TVMDL
College Station. The herd has now been vaccinated and is under
surveillance. With this number of initial infected animals to load up
the horseflies --- it has been raining --- I think we can confidently
expect further cases in the surrounding ranches starting this
weekend. As of yesterday (12 Jul 2007) the deer carcasses had not
been disposed of. I suspect that the cattle carcass disposal was
delayed. - Mod.MHJ]
