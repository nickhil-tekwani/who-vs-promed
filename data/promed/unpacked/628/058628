["In South Africa, there are defined ASF controlled areas in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and KwaZulu Natal provinces where the disease occurs in wild pigs all the time. Movement restrictions for all wild and domestic pigs and their products apply to, from, and within these areas to prevent the disease from spreading to the unaffected areas of the country."
