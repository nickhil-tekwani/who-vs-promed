4 people die from yellow fever in Ayacucho
------------------------------------------
The death of 4 people from YF in Santa Rosa, San Mart�& Palmapampa, in the
jungle part of Ayacucho Department, has caused the Regional Health Directorate
of Ayacucho to declare an epidemiological red alert.
Silvia Saravia, Regional Director of Health, said the measure included
permanent surveillance for new cases in ministry of health institutions, and
the start of vaccination days. Vaccination will take 30 days and cover 500
000 people. "We will vaccinate in both the jungle and the mountainous part
of Ayacucho. In this way, we hope to control the epidemic, which we haven't
seen in 10 years," said the specialist.
