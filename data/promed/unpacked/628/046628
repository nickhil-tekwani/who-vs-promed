Two more cases of wild boars infected with the deadly African swine fever (ASF) have been confirmed in South Korea.

The National Institute of Environmental Research said on Sunday [22 Dec 2019] that the virus was found in 2 wild boar carcasses found by officials in the inter-Korean border city of Paju. One was found last Wed [18 Dec 2019] and the other on Fri [20 Dec 2019].

The total number of wild boars infected with ASF has now risen to 19 in Paju, bringing the number of confirmed cases in South Korea to 50.

South Korea has mobilized soldiers and civilians to hunt down wild boars near the border areas in recent months to contain the spread of ASF.

[The above 2 cases were reported by the South Korean authorities to the OIE in follow-up reports Nos. 33 and 34, both submitted 22 Dec 2019. A summary of the event since its start on 16 Sep 2019, with links to all reports including the 2 recent ones and an updated interactive map, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778 (click on the cluster and zoom in to the required resolution). All ASF outbreaks are located in the northern regions, most of them close and along the inter-Korean border. So far, 61 outbreaks have been reported, of which 15 were in domestic pigs and 46 in wild boars.

The likely source of South Korea's ASF event is North Korea. An immediate (and solitary) notification to the OIE was submitted by North Korea on 30 May 2019, indicating the start of the outbreak as 23 May 2019, close to the border with China's provinces Liaoning and Jilin (report and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30664). No further information from North Korea has become available since then. - Mod.AS
