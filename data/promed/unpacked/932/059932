[2] Dengue encephalitis

Ref.: Vasanthapuram Ravi, Shafeeq Keeran Shahul Hameed, Anita Desai, Reeta Subramaniam Mani, Vijayalakshmi Reddy, et al.: Dengue virus is an under-recognised causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES): Results from a 4-year AES surveillance study of Japanese encephalitis in selected states of India; International Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2019; [in press]. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.01.008.

Highlights
- Dengue virus is one among the 3 most common agents identified in AES.
- Existing surveillance for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) does not include routine testing for dengue.
- Dengue accounts for 5% of AES cases in India, especially in the absence of laboratory evidence for other pathogens tested.
- Testing for dengue in AES cases must be included in routine surveillance.

Abstract
Background
Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) surveillance in India has indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for 5-35% of AES cases annually; the etiology remains unknown in the remaining cases. We implemented comprehensive AES surveillance to identify other etiological agents of AES, with emphasis on dengue virus.

Methods
Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from patients enrolled prospectively in AES surveillance from 2014-2017 at selected sites of 3 high-burden states of India. All samples were initially tested for JEV IgM. Specimens negative for JEV by serology were tested for IgM to scrub typhus, dengue virus (DEN), and West Nile virus; all JEV IgM-negative CSF samples were tested by PCR for _S. pneumoniae-, _N. meningitidis_, _H. influenzae_, herpes simplex virus type 1, enteroviruses, and DEN [virus].

Results
Of 10 107 AES patients, an etiology could be established in 49.2% of patients, including JEV (16%), scrub typus (16%), and DEN (5.2%) as the top 3 agents. Among the DEN-positive cases (359/6892), 7 (2%) were positive only for dengue virus RNA: one in serum and 6 in CSF.

Conclusion
Among the pathogens identified, dengue accounted for 5% of all AES cases and was one of the 3 common etiological agents. These results underscore the importance of including dengue virus in routine testing of AES cases.

[Establishing the etiology of AES in India is important, given the hundreds to thousands of cases that occur there in various locations every year. The attribution of dengue virus infection as an etiological agent of encephalitis is unusual. It seems curious that the CDC 2009 updated dengue case definitions for dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue do not mention encephalitis (https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/cliephanicallab/casedef.html), nor does the WHO dengue site (https://www.who.int/denguecontrol/human/en/). One hopes that dengue virus as cause of encephalitis will be further substantiated or ruled out as a cause of encephalitis with further studies in the countries that experience large numbers of dengue cases annually. If confirmed, the dengue case definition will have to be updated to include encephalitis. - Mod.TY]

[3] Host genetics of severe dengue

Ref.: Makeda Robinson, Timothy E. Sweeney, Rina Barouch-Bentov, Benjamin A. Pinsky, Purvesh Khatri, Shirit Einav; A 20-Gene Set Predictive of Progression to Severe Dengue. Cell Reports. 2019; 26:1104-1111. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.033.

In Brief
Biomarkers predictive of severe dengue are needed. Robinson et al. revealed a 20-gene set that predicts progression to severe dengue in existing and prospective cohorts via a multi-cohort analysis framework. This 20-gene set is generalizable across ages and host genetic factors and has potential implications for prognostic assay development.

Highlights
- A multi-cohort analysis framework revealed a 20-gene set to predict severe dengue.
- The 20 genes effectively predict severe dengue in existing and prospective cohorts.
- The 20-gene set is generalizable across ages, host genetic factors, and virus strains.
- The 20-gene set has potential implications for the development of a prognostic assay.

Summary
There is a need to identify biomarkers predictive of severe dengue. Single-cohort transcriptomics has not yielded generalizable results or parsimonious, predictive gene sets. We analyzed blood samples of dengue patients from 7 gene expression data sets (446 samples, 5 countries) using an integrated multi-cohort analysis framework and identified a 20-gene set that predicts progression to severe dengue. We validated the predictive power of this 20-gene set in 3 retrospective dengue data sets (84 samples, 3 countries) and a prospective Colombia cohort (34 patients), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, 100% sensitivity, and 76% specificity. The 20-gene dengue severity scores declined during the disease course, suggesting an infection-triggered host response. This 20-gene set is strongly associated with the progression to severe dengue and represents a predictive signature, generalizable across ages, host genetic factors, and virus strains, with potential implications for the development of a host response-based dengue prognostic assay.

[A prognostic assay would be very useful for patient monitoring and treatment of dengue cases. The question is this: Are the tests necessary to establish occurrence of the 20-gene set technically simple enough and of low enough cost to be adopted by hospitals and health clinics that attend most dengue patients? - Mod.TY
