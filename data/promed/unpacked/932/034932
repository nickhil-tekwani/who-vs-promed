New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (ONT-2015-NAI-001): Beachville, Ontario
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 45 000 / 9000 / 9000 / - / -
Affected population: ONT-2015-NAI-001 Meat turkey commercial farm with 4 barns. One barn is affected, with approximately 75 percent mortality. Age of the birds in the affected barn: 16 weeks.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: Sudden high mortality (approximately 25 percent within 48 hours). The National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease - Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed that the virus was a H5N2. Preliminary testing indicates that the virus is similar to other Eurasian origin H5 outbreaks currently circulating in North America and the HA0 cleavage site sequence is typical of HPAI viruses. Additional testing is underway. This outbreak of H5N2 is not linked with the H5N2 outbreaks that affected the commercial poultry in the province of British Columbia late in 2014. One possibility is that the current H5N2 outbreak in Ontario is related to wild bird migration (Mississippi flyway). Wild waterfowls (ducks, geese, swans) were observed around the barns within the last 30 days. The CFIA has immediately quarantined the infected farm and is implementing strict movement controls and a stamping-out policy. The Canadian Notifiable Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) has been ongoing in Canada since 2008 and surveillance activities will be enhanced in Ontario.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
University of Guelph - Animal Health Laboratory (Local laboratory)/ Birds/ real-time PCR/ 5 pr 2015/ Positive
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease, CFIA (national laboratory)/ Birds / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 7 Apr 2015 / Positive
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease, CFIA (national laboratory)/ Birds / virus sequencing 7 Apr 2015/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As indicated in the epidemiologic comment: "One possibility is that the current H5N2 outbreak in Ontario is related to wild bird migration (Mississippi flyway). Wild waterfowls (ducks, geese, swans) were observed around the barns within the last 30 days."

From www.birds.com: "Starting in central Canada and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi Flyway is the name given to the route followed by birds migrating from their breeding grounds in North America to their wintering grounds in the south. The flyway includes Canada's Mackenzie River which flows north through uninhabited forest and tundra into the Arctic Ocean, with tributaries reaching southwards, feeding into and out of a number of lakes, including the Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake and Lake Athabasca. As the name suggests, the Mississippi Flyway follows the route of the Mississippi River in the United States - North America's largest river system. Originating in northern Minnesota, the slow-flowing river travels southwards for a distance of 2530 miles, cutting through, or forming a border for, the states of Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee to before emptying into the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico." http://www.birds.com/blog/the-mississippi-flyway-an-essential-migration-route/

Outbreaks of HPAI H5N2 have also been reported in the United States (Arkansas, Minnesota, and Missouri) which are included in the Mississippi flyway.
