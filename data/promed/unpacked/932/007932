Taiwan goes on offensive against fatal virus
Taiwan is setting up a centralized control team to combat a virus that has
killed 26 children, hospitalized 132 and infected at least 9,000 -- and
perhaps 10 times that many - government officials announced Thursday. "The
cabinet has asked us to establish a disease control team to monitor the
epidemic and to find ways to stop it from spreading further," said a senior
official at the health department's communicable disease control bureau.
The cabinet has ordered a coordinated attack on the "enterovirus type 71"
that has mainly affected newborn babies and small children since it broke
out six weeks ago.
Virologists say the airborne virus can also infect adults, though it has
caused deadly complications only among children. The cabinet ordered the
Ministry of Education to monitor the epidemic and close schools if
necessary. The virus can be transmitted by air, making schools risky for
children. Some parents alarmed by its fast spread have kept their children
away from classes to avoid infection. Although the health department has
confirmed only 9,000 cases, pediatricians estimate that more than 100,000
children probably have been infected by the virus.
National Taiwan University specialist Lee Ching-yun said Taiwan should be
prepared for further deaths, as the epidemic has not yet entered its peak
phase. Lee predicted that 500,000 to 600,000 of the island's infants and
children are likely to be infected by autumn. Health department officials
said many children infected with enterovirus type 71 were likely also to
contract its viral cousin, the Coxsackie virus.
Coxsackie virus and enterovirus type 71, both of which occur in the
intestinal tract, can trigger complications that affect the central nervous
system and can be fatal. An outbreak of Coxsackie in 1997 killed some 30
toddlers in Sarawak state on the Malaysian side of Borneo island. The
children all died of viral myocarditis, or heart inflammation linked to a
lethal strain of the Coxsackie virus.

[Commenting on the officially announced "end" of the Sarawak epidemic last
year I wrote:
>It appears that most of the fatal cases were not due to EV71 or CB5
(Coxsackievirus B5) alone, and that none was due to JE (Japanese
encephalitis) virus.
>We understand that several isolates of a possibly new virus of yet another
virus family were made from fatal cases by CDC and others. It would be a
public service to release details of this agent - Mod.JW.
Mod - CHC (DR Charles Calisher) also wrote:
>Given that the etiologic agent was first reported as a coxsackievirus,
then as maybe not a coxsackievirus, and now maybe a "new" adenovirus, I'll
wait for more details before feeling comfortable with considering this
"new" virus the etiologic agent of this epidemic of myocarditis.
Adenoviruses are commonly isolated from humans, some ill and some not. I
certainly hope molecular studies have not preceded thorough epidemiologic
studies in this episode. - Mod.CHC.
These comments are also applicable to the present epidemic in Taiwan. -
