The collapsed infrastructure and contaminated water supplies are thought to
have contributed to the spread of cholera and typhoid: 685 cases of cholera
have been reported in Goma (eastern regions of the country). Travelers
should take care with food and water hygiene. Water should be boiled or
purified. Iodine resin water purifiers are recommended. The WHO does not
recommend cholera immunization for personal protection.

At least 2 people from Kikambala division have died of cholera while
several others are hospitalized. A subchief in Mtwapa, Mr Simeon Ngome,
confirmed one death and said more than 22 people are in hospital. He made
the remarks at a public baraza at Kikambala trading centre.
The worst hit areas are Junju, Kulewa and Gongoni, he said at the weekend
function. The 22 patients are admitted at Vipingo Health Centre. Medical
personnel have been deployed to the area to contain the spread of the
disease, Ngome said.
He cautioned residents against using unboiled water and eating half-cooked
food. He also advised them to use pit latrines to curb the spread of the
disease. He said the disease had earlier been reported in the neighboring
Kisauni location and it is quickly spreading to Kikambala.

A joint UNICEF, World Health Organisation (WHO) and COSVI (Italian NGO)
team is investigating cases of suspected cholera recently reported in
southern Somalia, from Qoryoley District in Lower Shabelle Region,
humanitarian sources have told IRIN.
In March, a cholera outbreak was reported in the coastal town of Marka,
along with several other outbreaks in southern Somalia since the start of
the year. UNICEF Somalia said the cumulative figure up until mid-April for
cases in these outbreaks was 881, with 71 deaths confirmed -- a case
fatality rate of 8.1 percent.
As of 2 May, no positive confirmation of cholera in 2 cases from 2 separate
villages was made by the team, UNICEF said. Medical supplies and chlorine
have been pre-positioned in Qoryoley, and the team is investigating another
case in Gobale village, Lower Shabelle. Humanitarian sources told IRIN that
recent reports of cholera in Wanle Weyne, Lower Shabelle, had been
"exaggerated", and confused with other diarrheal diseases.
With the onset of the rainy season, a rise of diarrheal diseases was
expected, said the source, but not cholera. Cholera is endemic in Somalia
and, although appearing with different outbreaks every year, is typically
associated with the dry season from December through to May, according to a
UNICEF fact sheet. Regarding cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases in
Somalia, it says Somalia's infant mortality and under five mortality rates
"remain among the highest in the world." Diarrheal disease, acute
respiratory infections, tuberculosis and malaria are still the leading
causes of death for infants and young children in Somalia, accounting for
more than half of all child deaths.

A cholera epidemic has broken out in a coastal prison in South Africa,
officials said Friday, and 500 inmates have fallen ill with diarrhea,
vomiting, and dehydration. The outbreak began Tuesday in the
maximum-security section of Westville Prison after an inmate was admitted
with the highly contagious disease, according to Russel Mamabolo, a
spokesman for the corrections department. Mamabolo told the South African
Press Association that said steps were being taken to contain the disease
and that all prisoners entering or leaving the prison would be screened for
cholera. One of the affected prisoners was in serious condition.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- The number of people infected by a cholera
outbreak in South Africa broke the 100 000 mark Monday, and authorities
said there was no end in sight to the epidemic.
Since it surfaced last August, the highly infectious, waterborne disease
has killed 208 people in the country's southeast, mostly poor rural
dwellers without access to clean water and proper sanitation in
KwaZulu-Natal province. "From the word go, a lot of experts were saying to
us (cholera) is going to be with us for the next 2 to 3 years," said Dave
McGlew, the KwaZulu-Natal health department's head of communications. "We
are not making any predictions, but that seems accurate."
In the early 1980s, South Africa's worst cholera epidemic infected more
than 105 400 people over a 4-year period. More than 340 people died.
Although the number of new cases is declining, the current epidemic
continues to infect up to 250 people a day. Provincial health authorities
said Monday 100 028 people had been infected since August.
McGlew said necessary facilities were now in place to manage the disease at
the province's 60 hospitals and 450 clinics, while mobile hydration
facilities were serving remote communities. To date less than 0.3 percent
of those infected have died. The mortality rate is one of the lowest ever
recorded. Scientists are unsure what caused cholera to become dormant and
then flare up again, but say that until people have access to clean running
water and proper sanitation it is certain to recur. About 7 million South
Africans -- 16 percent of the population -- still do not have access to
clean water, and about 18 million people do not have acceptable sanitation,
according to government statistics.

A total of 126 new Cholera cases were reported on Wednesday in the infected
eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, according to the provincial health
department. However, no more deaths were reported and the death toll
remained at 212, the department said in a statement. The total number of
cases reported since the outbreak of the disease last August has increased
to 103 320. The new cases showed that the disease has not been brought
under control despite extensive efforts to contain the scourge, health
officials said. The disease is mostly confined to the KwaZulu-Natal
Province, which has poorer water sanitation and more impoverished people.
[This is a huge ongoing outbreak. Or perhaps better said, it's an outbreak
in an area with good epidemiologic surveillance, so there's a higher
proportion of cases being captured by the system. - Mod.CM

KATHMANDU, 26 Jun 2001 -- More than 75 people have died of gastroenteritis
epidemic in the far-flung Bajhang and Doti districts in far western Nepal
since the monsoon season began early this month, according to reports
reaching here Tuesday. Among the dead, most are elderly people, women and
infants, while hundreds of others are suffering from the disease that
normally spreads due to consumption of contaminated water and poor
sanitation, the Kathmandu Post, an English daily, quoted local hospital
sources as saying.
Another reason behind the heavy death toll is the geographic
inaccessibility that hinders locals from taking the sick to the nearest
health center and the district hospital, Pitambar Subedi, chief at the
District Hospital of Bajhang district, was quoted as saying. Subedi said
this is the largest ever death toll from the epidemic in the region during
the last 6 years, and the death toll could increase because the affected
areas are located far away from district headquarters, where people can be
treated with better medication. Medical teams are expected to be sent to
the affected areas soon to control the spread of the epidemics, the daily said.

HONG KONG (AFP) -- An area in Shenzhen, at the border with Hong Kong, has
been cordoned off following an outbreak of cholera, a report said Tuesday.
Dapeng, in Shenzhen's Longgang district, has been off limits since Monday
after more than 60 people were said to have contracted the disease.
Several people have died, the Chinese-language Oriental Daily News said.
Authorities denied the outbreak was cholera, saying the victims were
suffering gastroenteritis.
The report said that living conditions in Dapeng, 7 kilometers (4.34 miles)
from Daya nuclear power plants in eastern coastal Shenzhen, were poor, and
there were no toilets in some of the houses. The town is home to some 600
people who are mostly migrant workers from Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi
provinces, and who work in factories run by Hong Kong and overseas firms,
the report said.
A similar cholera outbreak was recently reported in Zhanjiang, 450
kilometers (279 miles) southwest of Shenzhen, where more than 100 people
have reportedly contracted cholera. Of the 8 confirmed cholera cases in
Hong Kong this year, one was an imported case in May, 6 were local cases
reported in June, and the most recent case has yet to be classified.

KUALA LUMPUR - Health authorities in Malaysia's Selangor state said on
Wednesday they have contained a cholera outbreak near the capital Kuala
Lumpur that has killed one person. Since the first person was diagnosed 2
weeks ago in Meru, a town 35 km (22 miles) southwest of Kuala Lumpur, 93
other cases have been confirmed. The authorities have closed down 136 food
stalls after fingering a favorite local snack, "nasi lemak," made from
coconut-flavored rice, as the most likely source of the outbreak. The
victim, a 21-year-old Meru man, died on 7 May 2001 after 3 days in
hospital. In an outbreak in nearby Bangi town in early December, which was
traced to a factory canteen, 9 cases were confirmed. In 1996 more than 800
people were hit by cholera during an epidemic centered in northern Penang
state. No deaths were reported.

A Catholic aid group says dozens of East Timorese refugees are dying from a
rapidly spreading diarrhea epidemic in camps in Indonesian-ruled West Timor.
The Jesuit Refugee Service says the outbreak is spreading quickly at a camp
near the capital Kupang. Malnutrition is also claiming lives, and it says
there have been no rice supplies to the camps since January. All foreign
aid workers fled West Timor after three UN refugee workers were killed in
their office in the border town of Atambua by an pro-Jakarta militia mob in
September. A UN delegation is in West Timor this week to gather information
on the refugees and encourage them to return home.

Cases of typhoid fever have been reported in the Greater Accra Region in
Ghana, the "Daily Graphic" newspaper reported the Ministry of Health as
saying in a statement on Friday. The ministry said reported cases of the
disease were on the increase and many people had been admitted to
hospitals. Adding that it was investigating the cause of the outbreak, it
advised the public to drink water from safe sources and not to eat at
unhygienic establishments. Up to mid-afternoon on Monday no official
statement had been released on the number of people killed or affected by
the outbreaks, Abigail Bonsu, a journalist at the newspaper, told IRIN.
Typhoid fever is transmitted by food and water contaminated by the feces
and urine of patients and carriers. Polluted water is the most common
source of typhoid.
