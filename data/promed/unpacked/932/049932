A new disease affecting pigs has been reported but it is a disease that does not affect the health status of the country and it is not a zoonosis; that is, it is a condition not transmitted to humans through contact or by eating pork or pork products. Also there is certainty that this is an unusual condition that has caused the deaths of pigs, particularly piglets.

According to Mr Luis Humberto Martinez-Lacouture, manager of the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA, according to its Spanish initials), a sanitary emergency state was declared in order to properly manage and control this outbreak.

"This is a disease that causes diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality rates in piglets, symptoms compatible with porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a disease considered very unusual in Colombia," he added. The condition was identified in the departments of Huila and Cundinamarca.

"Studies performed show this is an acute form of a disease characterized by vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite, metabolic acidosis, yellowish and whitish watery diarrhea, anorexia, depression, and low mortality rates in breeding females", emphasized the officer.

Due to this situation, all events involving concentration of animals of any species have been suspended in municipalities where this disease has been reported, in order to prevent its spread throughout the country.

[This disease has been found in the United States and Canada but not previously in Colombia. However it is likely to be confirmed and if so, this would be the first report of this disease in Colombia. This virus likes cold weather and spreads rapidly. Thorough disinfection of a truck, many times over may still miss some of this very hardy virus. Colombia, in the Southern hemisphere near the equator does not seem to be affected with dramatic seasonal changes as locations farther from the equator. With good biosecurity Colombia may be able to control or eradicate this virus as the climate is not as cold and the virus seems to thrive on cold weather. However, the variability and adaptability of this virus to warmer climates is not well known. Hopefully Colombia will be able to get ahead of this very rapid moving virus.
