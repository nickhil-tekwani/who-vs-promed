The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Marche Transatlantique
Inc. are warning the public not to consume the Domaine de l'Oulivie
brand Lucque Olives de Pays described below because the product may be
contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by this
bacteria may cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.

The affected product, Domaine de l'Oulivie brand Lucque Olives de
pays, was sold in bottles of 340 grams net weight bearing UPC 3 760121
190437. All codes are affected by this alert. This product has been

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in these cases)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
