Anthrax outbreak under control in Zimbabwe: official
----------------------------------------------------
HARARE: Zimbabwe's Department of Veterinary Services said here on Tuesday
that an anthrax outbreak that occurred recently in the Dendenyore area of
Mashonaland East Province is now under control. "The outbreak was an
isolated one and all livestock in the area are being vaccinated against the
disease," said the department's director, Stuart Hargreaves.
The department, Hargreaves said, had enough anthrax vaccines as it recently
imported about 500 000 doses. He urged farmers to report any case suspected
to be anthrax to veterinary officers in their respective areas. About 3
weeks ago 2 people were reported to have contracted the anthrax disease at
Dendenyore after eating meat from an infected cow.

[Livestock anthrax hypoendemic (consistent small numbers of cases and not
the randomness associated with the term "sporadic") in Zimbabwe, and the
problem is made worse by the human consumption of such animals. In 2000 and
2001 there was a limited number of livestock cases but over 900 people were
affected. The 2 cases reported here were probably those with the worst
clinical signs, with perhaps another 5 to 8 more with diarrhea and
abdominal pain. - Mod.MHJ]
