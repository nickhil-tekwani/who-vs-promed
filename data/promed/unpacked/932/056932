1st Report of Leaf Necrosis Caused by _Pseudomonas viridiflava_ on Melon
Seedlings in Italy.
C. Moretti, S. Sequino, and R. Buonaurio, Dipartimento di Arboricoltura e
Protezione delle Piante, Borgo XX Giugno, 74, 06121 Perugia, Italy. Plant
Dis. 89:109, 2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0109A, 2005.
Accepted for publication 20 Oct 2004.
In April 2001, necrotic lesions surrounded by thin, water-soaked halos were
observed on cotyledons of 12-day-old melon seedlings (_Cucumis melo_ var.
_reticulatus_, cv. Baggio, Calipso, and Proteo) grown in plant beds in an
unheated greenhouse located in the Province of Perugia (central Italy). The
incidence of the disease was approximately 10 percent, and the economic
impact was limited, as seedlings recovered from the disease.
Cream-colored, mucoid, bacterial colonies were consistently isolated on
nutrient agar from the diseased leaf tissues. 2 representative strains
selected for identification were gram-negative, fluorescent on King's
medium B, and had oxidative but not fermentative metabolism. They were
levan-negative, oxidase-negative, potato rot-positive, arginine
dihydrolase-negative, and tobacco hypersensitive response-positive in LOPAT
tests.
These isolates showed pectolytic activity at pH 8 but not at pH 4 and
utilized L-arabinose, D(-)-tartrate and L-lactate. They did not utilize
sucrose, L(+)-tartrate, or trigonelline, and did not produce acid from
sucrose after 21 days of incubation. These results were similar to those
obtained with the type strain LMG 2352(^T) of _Pseudomonas viridiflava_
(Burkholder) Dowson.
Although it was suitable for strain characterization, we found that
repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) conducted
with primer BOXA1R was not appropriate for identifying _P. viridiflava_. In
fact, each _P. viridiflava_ strain tested, (LMG 2352(^T), LMG 2353, LMG
5397, and NCPPB 1382) generated unique fingerprints, which differed from
the 2 melon strains.
Pathogenicity tests were carried out with 3-week-old melon (cv. Baggio),
cucumber (cv. Lungo verde degli ortolani), and zucchini (cv. Consul) plants
(3 plants for each species and isolate). To prepare the inoculum, the 2
bacterial strains were grown on nutrient agar for 24 h at 27 deg C,
suspended in sterile deionized water, and adjusted to 1 million CFU/ml.
Young leaves of melon, cucumber, and zucchini plants infiltrated with
bacterial suspensions by a glass atomizer at high pressure developed small,
chlorotic spots with necrotic centers surrounded by water-soaked halos 5 to
7 days after inoculation. The most severe symptoms were observed on melon
plants.
The 2 strains also induced severe symptoms (chlorosis and water soaking) on
_Arabidopsis thaliana_ (ecotype Columbia-0) 3 to 4 days after inoculation.
No symptoms were observed in control plants. The bacterium was readily
recovered from inoculated plants, and their rep-PCR fingerprints were
identical to the strains used for inoculation.
On the basis of biochemical, physiological, nutritional, and pathogenicity
tests, it was concluded that the bacteria isolated from symptomatic melon
seedlings were _P. viridiflava_.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P. viridiflava_ attacks on
melon plants in Italy. The disease was previously recorded in Turkey (1)
and Greece (2).

[_Pseudomonas viridiflava_ [Pv] causes bacterial leaf blight of melon,
tomato and eggplant and other food crops. It is rarely found in the region
of Asturias in northern Spain and has been traditionally considered an
epiphyte or opportunistic pathogen. _Pseudomonas_ strains with an atypical
LOPAT profile (where LOPAT is a series of determinative tests: L, levan
production; O, oxidase production; P, pectinolitic activity; A, arginine
dihydrolase production; and T, tobacco hypersensibility) have been
differentiated. Since 1999, a new _Pseudomonas_ type with an atypical
LOPAT profile (convex colonies with uncharacteristic yellowish mucoid
material in hypersucrose medium [L test]; O negative; P variable; A
negative; and T positive) was frequently isolated from and associated with
disease in plants in common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_). It has also
appeared in material from other plants with disease symptoms, including
kiwifruits (from spring of 2000) and lettuce (from 2001).
A novel family of peptide antimycotics, termed ecomycins, is described from
Pv. Ecomycins B and C have molecular masses of 1153 and 1181, and they
contain equimolar amounts of hydroxyaspartic acid, homoserine, threonine,
serine, alanine, glycine and an unknown amino acid. Fatty acids were
detectable after hydrolysis, methylation and gas chromatography and mass
spectroscopy. The ecomycins have significant bioactivities against a wide
range of human and plant pathogenic fungi, including _Cryptococcus
neoformans_ and _Candida albicans_. Pv also produces what appears to be
syringotoxin, an antifungal lipopeptide previously described from
_Pseudomonas syringae_.
