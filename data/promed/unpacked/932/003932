A 79 year old woman presented to a community hospital with an abrupt decline
in mental status over 2 days without fever. Without a microbiological
diagnosis she was transferred to a tertiary care hospital in San Diego. She
was obtunded, had necrotic skin lesions suggestive of ecthyma gangrenosum
[Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is a well-recognized cutaneous infection most
commonly associated with a _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacteremia. EG usually
occurs in patients who are critically ill and immunocompromised. - Mod.LL],
pulmonary infiltrates (but not bloody sputum) and renal failure.
Retrospective examination of the Wright-Giemsa-stained peripheral blood
smear from the initial admission showed few bipolar staining rods. A
peripheral smear from the day of transfer to the tertiary care hospital
showed 6-10 schistocytes per high-powered field and the patient was
thrombocytopenic (approx 30K platelets/microL) [these findings are
suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation - Mod.LL].
Blood cultures from the time of admission were initially misidentified, then
found to grow a non-motile, non-lactose fermenting Gram negative rod that
grew slowly on all media. API biochemical testing suggested _Yersinia
pestis_; an anti-F1 antigen monoclonal antibody test performed by the San
Diego County Public Health Laboratory presumptively confirmed the
biochemical analysis; a PCR test confirmed the identification. The patient
is recovering from the illness with persistent anuria, having been
definitely treated with gentamicin, doxycycline (for a question of
meningitis) among other empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.
The patient lives between Mammoth and Bishop in Mono County, where numerous
small rodents (including ground squirrels) were observed on her property.
Rodent droppings were found in the house. The California State Health
department is currently carrying out epizootic investigation activities.
Post-exposure prophylaxis was offered to hospital personnel, family and
other close contacts.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Vinetz and his colleagues for this first-hand report.
Septicemic (bacteremic) plague can be a complication of the more common
bubonic variety or, as in this case, it may occur without a bubo. It does
not appear that the infection spread to the lungs causing a secondary
pneumonic plague. Plague pneumonia is the form capable of person-to-person
spread.
