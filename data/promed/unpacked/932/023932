Just to let you know that there have been several protests about
this, and that the plan has been radically altered.

Many, if not most of the animals slated for euthanasia will be saved.

Euthanizing animals solely on the basis of ringworm infection and its
'clinical health and welfare' impacts for the majority of (but not
necessarily all) affected cases seems a tad extreme to me.

I can, however, understand the frustration and difficulties involved
in trying to contain and eliminate it from a shelter housing stray,
unwanted and neglected animals. It is practically impossible to
totally prevent affected cases from entering such shelters; and, once
it contaminates cages and environments such as exercise yards, etc.,
it can be rather difficult to eliminate/eradicate and to prevent
transmission within the shelter.

Transmission within the shelter should not, however, be perceived as
entirely the shelter's problem; because ringworm also transmits quite
effectively from the general environment and as animals socialize,
etc., when left to their natural devices outside any shelter environment.

For the future, re-occurrence is highly likely unless rather
comprehensive infection control measures are applied and enforced in
the affected shelter, as follows:

- cleaning up what is obviously a quite contaminated shelter
environment -- very difficult, laborious and potentially also
expensive and time consuming.

- early detection of infection in new introductions -- not an easy
task given that many cases don't have clinical infections and not all
causative fungi show up prominently under a Woods lamp (black light).

- rapid and effective response to aggressively treat new introduced
cases early; and

- effective routine infection control procedures within the
establishment to minimize potential transmission from cases that may
gain entry -- particularly relating to rigorous decontamination of
grooming equipment, common exercise/socialization areas and housing
design (e.g., wood and other organic materials such as scratching
post ropes for cats in the design are often quite animal friendly,
but they are also quite difficult to clean and can harbor the
causative organisms for a long time).

There are 2 solutions which have been used here against severe skin
fungus infections, and both have worked with tremendous efficacy. The
1st is benzalkonium chloride, also known as "Fungisan" or "BenzAll."
The 2nd is a downright antique remedy which also has an excellent
track record, and that is lime-sulfur dip (Lym-Dip). Both can be used
on cats and dogs safely and neither is particularly expensive. I have
found both to be more efficacious than the Betadine scrub mentioned
by the moderator.

While I understand how severe outbreaks can be devastatingly
tenacious, I sincerely hope that the OSPCA has indeed tried these
older methods. While labor intensive, they are not only useful on the
animal but also upon the surroundings without hazard to the workers involved.

I am not cognizant of all the strains of dermatophyte, but a virulent
strain that escapes control seems out of character with the ecology
and physiology of the fungal organisms veterinarians have all come to
know and dread.

Is it possible that this is something more familiar, such as sarcoptes?

[Learning lessons on how to prevent this tragedy is again is very
important. Realizing the outcry from those appalled by the euthanasia
approach is also important. Some of these people may be willing to
volunteer to help treat animals or clean the area. Hopefully someone
in charge of this situation will update us at some point and tell us
the lessons learned, and the method of decontamination that was
effective. - Mod.TG]
