Leprosy Resurfaces
--------------------
About 6 years after the Malawi government and the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared Malawi free from leprosy, the disease has resurfaced. The
Harry Foundation for Development (Hafod), a local NGO for people with
leprosy, said there had since been recorded cases in the districts of
Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mchinji, Machinga, Salima, and Zomba.
Hafod president Harry Khamalatha said there were 6 cases currently being
treated. The disease, which starts as a severe skin infection, can lead to
severe disfigurement and a loss of limbs if not treated early.
A male patient, age 40, who is being treated at Queen Elizabeth Central
Hospital in Blantyre, said it took him about 3 years before he knew he had
the disease. "My wife has since run away from me with my 6 children. I'm a
lonely and miserable man," he said.
The health ministry's Controller of Preventive Health Services, Habib
Somanje, said the eradication of leprosy did not mean the infection would
never resurface. He said the ministry continues to hold awareness campaigns
at district level about the disease. "We go to areas where there are some
cases and treat them accordingly," said Somanje.
He said that internationally, Malawi was still considered as having
eradicated leprosy.

[Leprosy is a capricious disease with a transmission pattern that is only
partially understood. Unlike smallpox, measles, and polio, the immune
response to leprosy is far from simple, and there is no vaccine. Protection
cannot be measured by antibody titers. Public health now distinguishes
between disease elimination & eradication, recognizing that a disease can
only be eliminated, not eradicated, from a country if it is still present
in others and can therefore be reimported -- which seems to be the case
here. Health officials need to educate journalists to use the term "freedom
from" a disease rather than "eradication." - Mods.LJS/JW]
