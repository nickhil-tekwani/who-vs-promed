TUBERCULOSIS, MDR, AIRPLANE EXPOSURE - USA EX INDIA

Federal health officials recently issued an alert about a woman with
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) who flew from India to the
United States in mid-December [2007], and efforts are under way to
locate and test several of her fellow passengers for the disease.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a
statement sent to clinicians on 29 Dec [2007] said the patient, who
was not named, was diagnosed in India with MDR TB and traveled from
New Delhi to Chicago on 13 Dec [2007] on American Airlines Flight
293, and then took a shorter flight within the United States.
The patient is a 30-year-old woman whose final destination on 13 Dec
[2007] was San Francisco and who is recovering in an isolation ward
at a Bay Area hospital, according to a 31 Dec [2007] Los Angeles
Times report.
About a week after the flight the woman went to the emergency
department at Stanford [University] Hospital [Palo Alto, California]
with advanced symptoms of the disease, according to the Times report.
The CDC said the woman sought treatment for hemoptysis [cough
productive of bloody sputum], fever, and chest pain. "These and other
findings indicated a potential for transmission of drug-resistant TB
to others," the agency added. Marty Fenstersheib, MD, MPH, health
director for Santa Clara County [California], told the Times that the
woman had symptoms during the flight, including coughing.
MDR TB is defined as TB that resists at least 2 key drugs that are
considered 1st-line treatments for people who have TB
infections: isoniazid and rifampicin, according to the CDC. Because of
the risk of infection and according to World Health Organization
(WHO) guidelines, the CDC is recommending TB testing for passengers
who sat within 2 rows of the infected woman as well as airline crew
members who worked in the cabin during the flight. The group includes
44 passengers. The woman who has the MDR TB infection sat in row 35,
and the patients flagged for testing sat in rows 33 through 37.
[These were the passengers seated in the same row as the index
patient (row 35), and those seated in the 2 rows ahead (rows 33 and
34) and the 2 rows behind (rows 36 and 37), as well as the crew
members working in the same cabin. These persons should receive an
initial evaluation and testing for TB infection, with follow-up 8 to
10 weeks after the 13 Dec [2007] flight for re-evaluation.
[The WHO air travel guidelines are available at
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_TB_2006.363_eng.pdf>].
Based on location information provided by 42 of the passengers, the
CDC has asked health officials in 17 states to contact the patients
who have been flagged for testing. [These states include California,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee,
Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.] Location information was not available
for 2 of the passengers. The CDC has asked states to notify the
agency if they are unable to contact any of the passengers in their
states.
The CDC said it recommended testing of only the passengers and crew
on the New Delhi to Chicago flight because that leg was longer than
the 8-hour duration specified by the WHO for testing for TB exposure.
The WHO and CDC don't recommend notification and testing of
passengers on shorter flights because they consider the transmission
risk to be minimal.
All forms of TB are believed to spread when TB bacilli from a person
with the disease become aerosolized as a result of coughing,
sneezing, speaking, or singing, the CDC said in its statement. The
bacilli can float in the air for several hours, and people who
breathe them in can become infected. Those who become infected have
usually been exposed for several hours or days in poorly ventilated
or crowded environments.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[This episode of exposure to MDR TB aboard an airplane is similar to
episodes previously reported by ProMED-mail in the past year (see
also below) and undoubtedly will not be the last episode. Prevention
of airplane exposure to MDR TB requires cooperation of the patient
and their health care providers, the airlines, and public health
authorities and other officials in each country where there may have
been a risk of exposure. People with MDR-TB must postpone any air
travel until advised by their physicians that they are no longer
infectious, that is, culture-negative. Physicians must promptly
inform the relevant health authority when they are aware of an
infectious TB patient's intention to travel or their actually having
traveled against medical advice. Public health authorities must
promptly contact potentially exposed passengers and crew and advise
them to seek medical evaluation. This, of course, requires
maintenance of adequate passenger locator records.
Transmission of tuberculosis aboard an airplane depends on the
ability of a patient to generate an infectious aerosol, the adequacy
of airplane ventilation, the duration of air travel, and the
proximity of passengers and crew to the index case. The patient with
MDR TB in the current report is likely contagious based on the fact
that she was febrile and expectorating bloody sputum, an indication
that she was likely expelling aerosols of her respiratory excretions
that contain _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the usual mode of
transmission.
A discussion of aircraft ventilation and the assessment required of
exposed passengers and crew for acquisition of tuberculosis can be
found in the moderator's comments of ProMED-mail 20071130.3861.
