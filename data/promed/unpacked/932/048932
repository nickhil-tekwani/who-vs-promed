[No additional information is available. According to previous
reports, the human rabies cases in Kyrgyzstan are common as a
consequence of lack of comprehensive vaccination of domestic animals
and pets and the abundance of stray animals. A map of Kyrgyzstan
showing the location of the city of Osh can be accessed at
