The hospital's explanation about what they knew about D's travel history has changed in the time since his diagnosis was revealed on Tue [30 Sep 2014].

Federal health officials have advised hospitals to take a travel history for patients with any Ebola-like symptoms. When D's diagnosis was 1st disclosed, the hospital said it wasn't until he came back Sun [28 Sep 2014] that they discovered he had been in West Africa. The hospital later acknowledged that D had told a nurse about his travel history on his 1st visit but said the information hadn't been fully communicated to the whole team.

On Thu [2 Oct 2014], the hospital elaborated by saying that a flaw in the electronic health records systems led to separate physician and nursing workflows and that the doctor hadn't had access to D's travel history.

But the hospital issued a statement late Fri [3 Oct 2014] saying that the doctor who initially treated D did have access to his travel history after all. Hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said on Sat 4 Oct 2014 that he could provide no further details, saying: "We're still looking into the entire chain of events."

[But did the doctor see the names Liberia and/or West Africa? The transcript excerpt released by the hospital stated simply: "Africa," which would have raised malaria as the most likely diagnosis; see ProMED-mail post "Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (04): USA ex Liberia, prevention," archive No. 20141004.2832236. - Mod.JW]

USA: Vomiting man removed from flight in Newark is Ebola-free
-----------------------------------------------
4 Oct 2014: (Bloomberg) A sick passenger was pulled off a flight arriving at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport [New York] from Brussels [Belgium]. The man, who vomited on the plane, doesn't have the virus, according to state health officials. Still, passengers on United Airlines flight 998 were kept in their seats for almost 2 hours as quarantine officers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed the ill individual and a daughter traveling with him.

USA: Ebola ruled out in 2 suspected cases in Washington DC region
-----------------------------------------------
4 Oct 2014: (Baltimore Sun) Howard University Hospital in Washington DC quarantined a patient Fri [3 Oct 2014] who had recently traveled to Nigeria out of "an abundance of caution," officials said. On Sat [4 Oct 2014], officials said the hospital, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had determined the patient did not have Ebola. Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville [Maryland, USA] also determined late Fri [3 Oct 2014] that their patient had malaria, not Ebola. The unidentified patient was isolated after arriving with suspicious symptoms and travel history. Ebola, malaria and cholera have similar symptoms early on, including fever and vomiting... Maryland is one of 13 states capable of testing for Ebola, in tandem with the CDC and with its authorization...

USA: more than 100 possible cases across the US, all false alarms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC has been scrambling to check more than 100 possible reported cases across the US over the last week, all of which have proved false alarms. Dr Frieden said: "We're seeing more people calling us, considering the possibility of Ebola. That's what we want to see. We don't want people not to be diagnosed."...- more

USA: screening in West Africa & on arrival
---------------------------------------------------------
5 Oct 2014: (Daily Mail UK) Federal officials have said every passenger travelling from all countries ravaged by the infection could face the checks such as having their temperature taken on arrival. A source told CNN that 'all options are on the table' but says the increase in measures would not be as easy as it sounds as most routes from West Africa are not direct. They said: 'There aren't that many direct flights from Ebola-affected countries to the U.S. anymore. Many passengers are arriving on connecting flights from other parts of the world, and then they come here, so that makes it more of a challenge.' [CDC Director] Friedan stood by the screening procedures, pointing out today that 77 people have been prevented from getting on planes in West Africa thanks to the efforts of airport officials who were trained by the CDC.
