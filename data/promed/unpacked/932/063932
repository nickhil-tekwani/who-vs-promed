ECHINOCOCCUS MULTILOCULARIS, FOX - SWEDEN (03): COMMENT

The occurrence of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ (EM) in northernmost
Russia, east of the White Sea in the Archangel Oblast, is documented
by Jushkov, 1995, in his book, Fauna Evropejskogo Severo-vostoka
Rossii. Gelminty mlekopitajusih. Nauka, Sankt Petersburg (in
Russian).

We consider the potential spread of EM over the frozen White Sea to
northernmost Fennoscandia to be a serious possibility.

The Swedish finding is from the southwest part of the country, and,
therefore, we suppose that the parasite probably came from Denmark,
i.e. originating from the European focus, not being of Siberian
origin. The most obvious possibility is that sailing tourists between
Sweden and Denmark with their pet dogs have introduced the parasite.

On the other hand, as suggested by Henttonen et al. (2001,
Parasitology 123:547-552) when reporting the Svalbard finding, the
Svalbard source most probably was via migrating arctic foxes over pack
ice from Novaja Zemlja or Siberia.

In Finland, several monitoring programs have been running for long
periods. Some of these programs are targeted primarily to other aims
but coordinated so that _Echinococcus_ surveillance is also achieved.

In Lapland, west of the Kola Peninsula through which the potential
spread from northern Russia could appear, we have screened 1200 red
foxes during the last decade. However, the sensitivity of the
screening method, similar to that used in Sweden, as pointed out by
Prof. C. Kapel in an earlier ProMED message, is not perfect if the
worm burden is very low.

At the southeastern border of Finland, facing Leningrad Oblast (Sankt
Petersburg), hundreds of red foxes and raccoon dogs have been screened
yearly during 2001-2010. All these wild canids have been negative.

In addition, research on strong vole cycles has been a hot topic in
Finnish ecology for many decades, and in that connection, several tens
of thousands of voles and lemmings from various parts of Finland have
been studied. The parasitological research on liver parasites (e.g.
Taenia cysts are common) has been detailed over 3 decades, and even
before that, at least well-developed EM infections would probably have
been noticed. No positive voles have been found.

EM occurs in the Baltic countries, such as in Estonia on the other
side of the Gulf of Finland (northeastern extension of the Baltic
Sea). It would be quite easy for an infected fox to cross to Finland
in winters when sea has been frozen, as is this winter [2010-2011].

Information on EM in Leningrad Oblast is missing, even though we have
been told that EM may occur there.

[ProMED thanks Anti Oksanen and Heikki Henttonen for their comments.
It may indeed be that the EM found in southern Sweden comes from
Denmark. The new data presented here, that no EM-infected fox has been
found in Finland, make a spread from Denmark to Sweden much more
plausible. Studies demonstrating EM in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
have been published. The comment here that EM probably has been found
in the St. Petersburg area is interesting, and ProMED will be happy to
post news from this area. - Mod.EP]
