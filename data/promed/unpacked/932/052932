Animal Health Officials Alert Goat Owners About Illness Detected
in South Texas
--------------------
Epidemiologists are attempting to pinpoint how a South Texas goat
herd became infected with _Brucella melitensis_, a form of
brucellosis (historically called "Malta Fever") associated with
goats, not seen in Texas for 25 years.
*******************************
For more information on having goats tested, producers can
contact their private veterinary practitioners, their TAHC's area
office, or the TAHC's Austin headquarters can be called at 1-800-
550-8242, ext. 712.
*******************************
The epidemiologists are trying to determine if, or where, the
bacterial disease may have spread. Meanwhile, to prevent a risk to
human or livestock health, the herd of nearly 120 goats and sheep
has been depopulated and buried by veterinarians and animal
health inspectors from the Texas Animal Health Commission
(TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency, with
assistance and resources supplied by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) Veterinary Services.
"We're particularly concerned about _Brucella melitensis_, as it
can cause serious illness in humans, if they consume
unpasteurized milk, cheese (milk products) or process the meat
from an infected goat without taking precautions. We're urging
South Texas ranchers to have their goats tested for the disease,
particularly if they are planning to use milk from the nannies, or
slaughter the animals," said veterinarian Terry Conger, TAHC's
state epidemiologist. He noted that ranchers also should bring only
tested goats into their herds, whether the additions are strays or
acquired by purchase, trade, or as a gift.
Dr. Conger also pointed out the Texas Department of Health has
notified physicians and public health clinics in South Texas to be
alert for patients who may have contracted this form of brucellosis,
which in humans is also known as "undulant fever." The disease
can be spread to humans through contact with infected goats,
unpasteurized goat milk, cheese or raw goat meat products.
Sufferers may experience flu-like symptoms, such as night sweats,
aches and pains, headache, loss of appetite, and a fever that
comes and goes throughout the day. A simple blood test can be
used to diagnose the disease, but a physician's care and
antibiotics are necessary to treat the disease.
"Mexico reported 6500 cases of undulant fever in humans in l998,
many of which can be attributed to infected goats," said Dr.
Conger. "The Texas Department of Health recorded 16 cases in
our state. Fourteen of the patients had consumed goat dairy
products, and 9 of the group had also travelled internationally. We
want to ensure producers and consumers are not put at risk by a
preventable -- or treatable -- disease.
To avoid risk of human disease, Dr. Conger repeated goats should
be tested before they are milked or processed for meat. Cooked
meat is safe to eat, as heat kills the _Brucella melitensis_ bacteria.
However, if ranchers are slaughtering untested goats, they should
wear a face mask, glasses and rubber gloves, to prevent the
possibility of breathing in or otherwise exposing themselves to the
bacteria that can become airborne during the slaughtering process.
Clothing should be laundered after the processor has completed
the task.
Dr. Conger emphasized the infected goat herd probably would have
gone unnoticed for some time, if a neighboring rancher had not
sold a cow to slaughter in late summer.
Like all adult cattle moving through a livestock market, a routine
blood sample was collected to test the cow for bovine brucellosis,
which usually affects cattle, and is a disease which the country's
livestock industry has worked to eradicate for more than 50 years.
Texas, one of 6 states that hasn't yet eliminated the disease, has 2
known infected cattle herds currently under quarantine.
"We were concerned, but not alarmed when the cow tested positive
on the 2 brucellosis 'field' tests at the livestock market, because we
were looking for cattle brucellosis," said Dr. Conger. "Additional
blood samples were collected from the cow for laboratory testing,
then the animal was identified as being infected and was shipped
to slaughter. (Cooked meat from infected animals is safe to
consume.) At the processing plant, tissues also were collected
from the cow for other extensive tests."
In the Austin State-Federal Laboratory, which is operated jointly by
the TAHC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), test
results on the cow's blood and tissues were "atypical." Samples
were forwarded to the USDA's National Veterinary Services
Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where the bacteria was confirmed as
_Brucella melitensis_, the goat form of the disease that had not
been seen in Texas for 25 years.
"We moved quickly to spread the net to find the source of this
cow's infection," said Dr. Conger. *We tested the remaining
animals in the rancher's cattle herd and found four other animals
that carried a low 'titer,' indicating they likely have been exposed to
_B. melitensis_. These cattle were depopulated and buried, to
protect workers who might be exposed to airborne bacteria when
handling infected carcasses at the slaughter plant. The remaining
disease-free cattle in the herd were shipped to slaughter, as they
could be slaughtered without risk to human health."
"We also tested other susceptible species of animals, including
dogs, horses, cattle and goat herds, and flocks of sheep on that
site and on 10 surrounding ranches, without finding any additional
infected animals. We broadened the search, and a little more than
a quarter-mile from the cattle herd, the infected goat herd was
detected. Through our epidemiological investigation, we've learned
the cattle rancher in the past, had purchased cattle from the goat
herd owner. That could have been the portal for introducing the
disease from the goats to the cattle herd.
Dr. Conger said for each answer in this disease investigation, an
additional question arises, including:
- How did the flock of goats become infected?
Dr. Conger said widespread herd testing in the area will continue in
the effort to answer this question. Thorough herd records were not
maintained on goats bought and sold, so tracing all animal
movement into and out of the infected herd will be very difficult.
"That's why we want to encourage ranchers to have goats tested,
particularly if the animals live in or originated in the South Texas
area," said Dr. Conger.
Ranchers whose livestock or dogs are within the targeted test zone
near the infected goat herd have been contacted and their animals
have been tested by TAHC veterinarians and inspectors.
- Why didn't the disease spread to animals having fence-to-fence
contact with the infected goat or cattle herd?
Dr. Conger said _Brucella melitensis_ causes nannies to abort 1
time. Animals coming in contact with the bacteria-laden aborted
fetus can become infected. After the initial "abortion storm,"
however, affected goats will not lose fetuses, even though they will
carry the disease for a lifetime, said Dr. Conger. The bacteria are
shed through milk, on newly born kids, and in afterbirth, all products
that pose greater threat to ranchers than to nearby animals.
Dr. Conger said ranchers should protect human and livestock
health by bringing in only tested goats, testing goats before
consuming products from the animals, and by maintaining records
on animals bought and sold. "Carefully maintained records can
save time and help unravel mysteries when an infection like this
occurs," said Dr. Conger. "We have proven tools to protect human
and livestock health; now we must ensure they're put to good use
while we continue to look for the source of this disease incident."
