Disease kills rhinos
------------------
Disease has wiped out almost the entire population of rare Sumatran
rhinoceroses at a captive breeding program in Malaysia, one of the species'
few remaining havens.
The latest death at the Sungai Dusun Rhino Conservation Center was of a
female on Sunday, the New Straits Times newspaper reported, leaving just
one female, which is gravely ill.
6 rhinos have died at the center since January last year -- 3 of them in
the past 3 weeks, including the last male.
The Sumatran is the smallest of the world's five types of rhino and among
the rarest of large mammals.

that the reason for the die-off of this rare animal is unidentified. If
there is more information available, ProMED-mail would be grateful if it
could be shared. - Mod.TG]
