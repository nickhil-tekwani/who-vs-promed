Pat Kluver wrote "(canine) distemper is definitely a disease of declining
incidence... we should be seeing a decline of Paget's as well ..."
Considering that in many countries, dogs are vaccinated against canine
distemper, and people are vaccinated against measles, it would be surprising
if there were not a decline in the incidence of Paget's in countries where
these vaccination programs are effective. It would be both interesting and
disturbing if the vaccination programs had no effect on the incidence of
Paget's disease. Does anyone know if there has been a decline in the
incidence of Paget's disease in vaccinated populations?

Re: Dogs, distemper and Paget's disease.
If there is a causal connection, then Paget's disease of bone should be very
rare in places that lack dogs, e.g. the Maldive Islands. Does anyone know if
this is the case?

[I have a memory that amyoptrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] was once
considered to be associated with keeping dogs and the persistance of viral
inclusion bodies. Am I correct or is my memory like Mark Twain's? If I am
correct, it too should move in parallel. Does it?
