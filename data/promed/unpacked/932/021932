When district health officials visited the house of the 1st victim of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Kochariya village of Bavla taluka [district], they were astonished to find that his house was infested with _Hyalomma_ ticks. The parasite is the main carrier of the nairovirus that causes CCHF. Not only the deceased victim but even his neighbours had severe tick infestation in their homes.

Since the dairy business is the principal occupation in the village, these ticks are in abundance here. CCHF has already claimed the life of this villager and also the doctor who treated this patient at the VS Hospital.

[This report identifies the person who died in hospital in Ahmedabad as a resident of Kochariya village in Bavla taluka [district], where he was engaged in dairying (and presumably exposed to frequent tick-bites). His treatment for an unknown haemorrhagic fever resulted in the death of a physician at a municipal VS Hospital in Ahmedabad.

Ticks of the subgenus _Hyalommina_ are found on the Indian subcontinent and Somalia. Each of the 6 species has a 3-host cycle. Immatures parasitize small mammals, especially rodents. Adult host preferences among livestock reflect the wild gazelle, bovine, caprine, or ovine group with which each species evolved. Two species now infest chiefly cattle and the domestic buffalo: _H. brevipunctata_ (India and Pakistan) and _H. kumari_ (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, northwestern Iran, and Tadzhikistan). Three usually parasitize sheep and goats: _H. hussaini_ (India, Pakistan, Burma), _H. rhipicephaloides_ (Dead Sea and Red Sea areas), and _arabica_ (Yemen and Saudi Arabia). _H. punt_ (Somalia and Ethiopia) feeds on antelope, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats.

The subgenus _Hyalomma_ contains 15 species of veterinary and public health importance. Three of the 15 species have 2, 3, and 4 subspecies, respectively. Chief among these is the 2-host _H. anatolicum anatolicum_, which ranks high among the world's most damaging ticks and has been widely distributed by camels, cattle, and horses in steppe and semidesert environments from central Asia to Bangladesh, the Middle and Near East, Arabia, southeastern Europe, and Africa north of the equator. Immatures and adults generally infest the same kinds of hosts. Nymphs and unfed adults spend the dry and winter season in crevices in stone walls, stables, and weedy or fallow fields. When immatures infest smaller mammals, birds, or reptiles, the life cycle type is 3-host. _H. anatolicum anatolicum_ transmits _Theileria annulata_, _Babesia equi_, _B. caballi_, _Anaplasma marginale_, _Trypanosoma theileri_, and at least 5 arboviruses; it is a significant vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus to humans.

The _H. marginatum_ complex consists of 4 subspecies, each apparently invariably 2-host. Adults parasitize livestock and wild herbivores. Immatures primarily parasitize birds. Rodents are rarely, if ever, parasitized. Hares and hedgehogs are secondary hosts. The subspecies are _H. marginatum marginatum_ (Caspian area of Iran and former USSR to Portugal and northwestern Africa), _H. marginatum rufipes_ (south of the Sahara to South Africa, also Nile Valley and southern Arabia), _H. marginatum turanicum_ (Pakistan, Iran, southern former USSR, Arabia, parts of northeastern Africa, introduced with sheep from Iran to Karoo), and _H. marginatum isaaci_ (Sri Lanka to southern Nepal, Pakistan, northern Afghanistan). _H. marginatum_ subspecies are important vectors of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and also transmit agents of livestock diseases and other viruses that infect wildlife, livestock, and humans [excerpted from the Merck Veterinary Manual: http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72111.htm].
