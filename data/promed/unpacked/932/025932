A 10-year-old girl from Malappuram district [Kerala] has died of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, an infection of the brain caused by _Naegleria fowleri_, commonly referred to as the "brain-eating amoeba."

She is from Aripra near Perinthalmanna in the district. She was admitted to MES Medical College Hospital, Perinthalmanna, on [Wed 15 May 2019] with high fever.

Hospital sources said she died on [Thu 16 May 2019] evening while being taken to a private hospital in Kochi for further treatment. The infection was diagnosed after her cerebrospinal fluid was sent for lab tests. A similar case had been earlier reported from Alappuzha [Kerala].

This amoeba is commonly found in lakes, rivers, and soil. It infects people when contaminated water enters their body through the nose, from where it reaches the brain and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. People do not become infected from drinking contaminated water.

Severe frontal headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting are the symptoms in the primary stage. Later, the patient may experience stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations, and slip into a coma. The mortality rate is comparatively high in this type of infection.

Malappuram District Medical Officer K Sakkeena told The Hindu that the Health Department would issue an alert to be careful against venturing into contaminated waterbodies.

Dr Sakkeena claimed that a rapid response team had been formed to look into other encephalitis and meningitis cases. Doctors had been told to report all atypical fever cases to the team to spot potential epidemics. A treatment protocol would soon be out, she added.

[Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the free-living ameba _Naegleria fowleri_. The ameba is commonly found in warm freshwater, such as lakes, rivers and hot springs, and soil. During swimming or diving in water bodies or inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or use of heated and contaminated tap water, the ameba enters the human body through the nose and reaches the brain, causing fatal meningoencephalitis. Symptoms start after an incubation period of 1-9 days and progress rapidly towards death around 1-18 days after symptom onset. Initial symptoms include severe frontal headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations, and coma.

A case report from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Chandigarh, India reported at least 3 survivors on treatment with amphotericin B, rifampicin and fluconazole/ornidazole/chloramphenicol for 21 days (https://www.indianpediatrics.net/dec2008/dec-1004-1005.htm)
