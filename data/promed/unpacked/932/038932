Salmonella strain spreading on Funen
------------------------------------
_Salmonella_ DT 104 is reportedly spreading on Funen, Denmark.
Karl Georg Andreasen, the chief veterinarian on Funen, has said that the
disease has not been as widespread on the island before and he does not
know why it is spreading.
The disease was first found among pigs at a farm in Faborg 3 months ago.
