The pig which tested positive for the Nipah virus is said to be
from a farm in Seelong, Johor [but see below.
The discovery was made when the animal was in an abbatoir in the state. It is
not known whether the pig was slaughtered or not [nor even whether it
originated from the state?
Cabinet task force on JE deputy chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said
yesterday that culling of pigs at the farm would be conducted if tests
proved the animals were infected.
***To date, however, he said that no pig from that farm had tested positive
for the Nipah virus.***
It was learnt that the farm, which has 4000 pigs, was still under quarantine,
pending results of further tests.
Dr Ling, who is also Transport Minister, was speaking to reporters after
chairing the task force meeting at the Prime Minister's Department here
yesterday.
It was reported in The Star last Saturday that the pig farm in Seelong, 20km
from Johor Baru, was under quarantine since last Wednesday after one pig
tested positive for the Nipah virus.
However, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said on Sunday that the sample
was an old one drawn some time ago to test for the Japanese Encephalitis virus
and there could have been a mix-up.
Dr Ling said that pigs in only two of 212 farms in the country were tested
positive for the Nipah virus under a three-month national testing and
surveillance programme which started on April 21. One was in Kampar and
the other in Bidor [both in Perak state, he said, adding that 7883 pigs from
both farms had already been culled.
There had been no new cases of viral encephalitis over the past 13 days
and, to date, 32 people were still hospitalized and the death toll stood at 100,
he said.
Dr Ling said it was not decided when those who lived in pig farms prior to the
outbreak could return, as many pig carcasses had yet to be disposed of.
For those who did not live near the farms but were evacuated because of the
outbreak, the health and veterinary services departments would decide when
they could return, he added.

[Another confusing newspaper report. It would be nice if we could
have an official report stating that there is still no evidence of Nipah
virus in Johore State - Mod.JW
