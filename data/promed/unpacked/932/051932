A Rhode Island middle school student was rushed to hospital recently after getting sick from eating what police are calling "pot candy". They're small, hard candies made of marijuana -- an emerging trend on the illegal drug scene, especially among kids. "The danger is high because it's a candy substance [and] it's much harder for teachers and staff to detect," said Richmond [Washington County, Rhode Island] police chief, Elwood Johnson.

Teachers at Chariho Middle School in Richmond didn't detect it until the student fell ill. That's when police got involved and tested the candy. They found it to be containing marijuana and traces of methanphetamines. And they found it not only being sold at the middle school. Two 14 year olds at Chariho High School have also been placed under arrest for having pot candy along with prescription pills.

Police say the supply at the schools has practically vanished since the arrests, leading them to believe they've got the dealers in custody. "We're on it and we're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in the school system or anywhere else," said chief Johnson. Meantime, they encourage parents to use this incident as an opportunity to educate themselves and their kids about pot candy. Police say to be aware of unwrapped or re-wrapped candy that looks like a Jolly Rancher [fruit flavoured hard sweet].

[As marijuana becomes legal in some states, it is not surprising it would turn up in candy, which appeals to students/children of all ages. Rewrapped food or candy is always a suspicious sign, unless of course you are the one who has rewrapped it for your own consumption.

Sadly the article does not tell us any clinical signs. Clinical signs may give us a clue as to how much methamphetamines or marijuana, or both, were in the candies.
