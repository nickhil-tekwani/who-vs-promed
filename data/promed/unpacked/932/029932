From a reliable source, we have been informed that foot and mouth disease is suspected in a holding in Rafah, Gaza strip, Palestinian Autonomous Authority, close to the Egyptian border. For a map, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gaza_Strip_map2.svg.

The suspected clinical signs were observed in several animals within a group of about 100 one year old male calves. The vaccination history of the affected animals is not clear.

[Additional information, in particular laboratory confirmation (or otherwise) and, in case confirmed, serotyping of the FMD virus involved, are requested. The veterinary authorities in the Gaza strip have demonstrated their capacity to control introduced animal epizootics during the FMD SAT-2 episode in April 2012. The virus originated in Egypt.

During 2012, 3 FMDV serotypes were circulating in Egypt: SAT-2, O and A.

Recent information on the FMD situation in Egypt was discussed during the FMD Sub Regional Pool Meeting, held in Beirut, Lebanon on 18 Dec 2012 with the participation of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. The Egyptian presentation included a map showing the geographical distribution of lab-confirmed outbreaks (passive surveillance) during 2012, as well as results of passive and active surveillance regarding the serotypes detected in lab-confirmed outbreaks 2009/2012. The Egyptian presentation is available at http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/download/presentation/FMD%20Egypt.pdf. For the other presentations, see http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/viewpage.asp?ID=701. For genotyping results of the 3 serotypes in Egypt (2012), see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm. - Mod.AS
