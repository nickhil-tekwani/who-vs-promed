In March 1996, five elephants from an exotic animal farm in Illinois were in
California as part of a circus act. One elephant (with chronic, unexplained
weight loss since October 1995) died under anesthesia on August 3, 1996,
during a diagnostic dental work-up. Necropsy showed widespread consolidation
of lung tissue with caseous necrosis of the lungs and mediastinal lymph
nodes. Short, fat, relatively scant numbers of acid-fast bacilli were
observed in necropsy tissues. A presumptive diagnosis of M. tuberculosis was
made. The remaining four elephants were recalled to the farm in Illinois. A
second elephant died en route on August 6, 1996. Necropsy revealed copious
respiratory and trunk exudates and caseous necrosis of the lung. [Note the
severity of the elephant lesions. - MHJ

Elephant handlers worked in very close proximity with the elephants around
the clock, whereas tiger handlers had little direct contact with the
elephants. Most of the elephant handlers lived on the farm in a separate
section of the barn; four lived in trailers on the grounds. The handlers'
living quarters had a separate ventilation system from the elephants';
however, the doors between the two quarters were open for unknown periods.
Handlers indicated that they held social events in a building connected to
the elephant barn.
Twenty-two handlers at the exotic animal farm had moderate to frequent
contact with the infected animals; 12 were elephant handlers and 10 were
tiger handlers. Initial PPD testing was performed for 14 handlers in August
1996, 2 in October 1996, and 5 in December 1996. One who was PPD-positive in
November 1995 reported receiving BCG more than 10 years before.
Eleven (50%) of 22 handlers were found PPD-positive as part of this
investigation. Eight of the 11 had positive PPD skin test results upon
initial testing, with a median induration of 12 mm (range, 10 to 19 mm).
Four of the eight were elephant handlers and four were tiger handlers. The
skin test reaction of three handlers converted from negative to positive
with a median induration of 12 mm (range, 8 to 15 mm). The three PPD
converters were initially tested in August 1996; one was positive upon
re testing in January 1997, and two tested positive in April 1997
Eight of the 11 handlers reported that they had negative skin tests in the
past and had not received BCG. The other three reported some type of
reaction from a previous skin test in the past but did not know the results.
All three also reported receiving BCG more than 10 years before. Eight of
the 10 handlers with negative PPD skin tests had at least one negative
follow-up test at 3 months; two left the farm and did not receive follow-up
testing.
The attack rates were approximately equal for the elephant and tiger
handlers. Of the 12 elephant handlers tested, 6 (50%) were PPD-positive with
two conversions documented in April 1997; of the 9 tiger handlers, 5 (56%)
were PPD-positive, with one conversion documented in January 1997. Overall,
a very high rate (52%) of handlers tested positive.
[The human and elephant _M.tuberculosis_ strains had essentially identical
IS6110 RFLP and TBN12 RFLP patterns.

Conclusions
Human-to-human transmission of TB is unlikely because the only handler with
active disease did not have cough. Of the three sputum samples initially
collected, two were smear- and culture-negative; the third had low numbers
of acid-fast bacilli manifested by a negative sputum smear, thus posing a
low infectivity risk to others. In contrast, the three elephants that died
had evidence of widespread pulmonary disease and, therefore, represented a
greater risk for dissemination.
[While it is certain that the sick elephants had a real potential for a
significant shedding, the risk presented by these figures, which are small
and therefore very wobbly, indicates that the less the elephant exposure
(e.g., tiger handlers) the greater the risk. Being conservative, risk was
independent of intensity of elephant exposure in this group as a whole.
However, if the exposure of the 22 tested individuals was above a threshold
value for 50% PPD conversion, these results might be expected.
Unfortunately, the persons with slight to no elephant exposure were
apparently not tested.
