Two wet seasons have masked extensive fusarium crown rot infection across the northern grain growing areas. Random surveys identified significant crown rot inoculum across the region. In north west New South Wales, 54% of surveyed paddocks had high and 31% moderate levels of infection. In southern Queensland, 45% had high and 33% moderate levels. While the disease built up, it largely remained unrecognised by growers.

It is considered crucial now to be careful with where and what gets sown, especially for durum wheat which is very susceptible to the disease. Average yield losses of 58% in durum wheat from crown rot have been observed in conducive years. It is more important than ever to test soil and stubble with the available DNA-based kit to determine the level of crown rot inoculum.

To mitigate yield losses, growers should plant tolerant varieties in paddocks showing the least amount of inoculum. If test readings are high or moderate, they should consider switching to alternative crops or to extend the fallow period.

[Fungal species originally classed as members of genus _Fusarium_ are involved in 2 major disease complexes of wheat: crown, root, and foot rot which may also lead to seedling blight; and head blight, which may be accompanied by mycotoxin contamination to result in total crop loss. A number of the fungi have since been reclassified into other genera, but the common names of 'fusarium' diseases remain.

Crown rot of wheat is caused in most areas mainly by the fungus _Fusarium pseudograminearum_. Other fungal species are also reported to be associated with the disease in some locations. It is a serious disease of cereals such as bread wheats (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheats (_T. turgidum_; used for example for pasta), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_) and triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) with reported yield losses of up to 40 percent. Infection is favoured by good crop conditions in the 1st part of the season followed by dry conditions during flowering and grain filling. These conditions lead to the production of 'deadheads' or 'whiteheads' containing pinched seed or no seed at all.

The pathogens survive from one season to the next on infected crop stubble and other plant debris. Spores can be spread by wind, contaminated materials, and mechanical means. Crown rot incidence increases with continuous cropping of wheat and conservation cropping (such as no-till systems). Disease management may include control of grassy reservoir hosts, crop rotation with broad-leaf non-hosts (for example brassicas or legumes) and burning of infected stubble. Some tolerant varieties of bread wheat are available, but effective genetic resistance in the highly susceptible durum wheats as well as in barley still needs to be identified. Resistance breeding programmes are ongoing.

New strains of the fungi are emerging worldwide and resistance breeding programmes are ongoing. Re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported (for example, ProMED post 20100726.2497).
