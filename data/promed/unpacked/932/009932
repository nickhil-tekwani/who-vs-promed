Second case of salmon anaemia discovered, 24 000 fish to be harvested
----------------------------
An aquaculture company was to remove 24 000 salmon from their cages this
weekend to halt the spread of infectious salmon anaemia.
Stolt Sea Farm was ordered to take the action after the discovery of the
disease in pens in Cobscook Bay near Eastport, Maine. It is the second
case of the disease to be discovered this summer. Last month, 28 000 salmon
were removed from Heritage Salmon's cages in Cobscook. The 2 cases are the
first cases of salmon anaemia to be discovered in Maine since those that
led to the slaughter of 1.5 million salmon in Cobscook Bay in January 2002.
The virus is harmless to humans but can be fatal to fish. There are also
concerns the disease could spread to the endangered wild Atlantic salmon. A
boat owned by the Canadian aquaculture company planned to travel to Maine
this weekend to harvest the fish and take them back to Canada to be
processed for sale.
