[1] ASR on kudzu - Louisiana: 1st report 2006

ALERT: Soybean rust found in kudzu near Lafayette, La.
------------------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust was found today [30 Jun 2006] in a small patch of
kudzu just south of Lafayette, Louisiana, in Lafayette Parish. This is
the 23rd positive county in the USA and the 5th state to have rust
this year [2006].
According to the Louisiana commentary on the USDA site and a release
sent out by Clayton Hollier, plant pathologist with Louisiana State
University, "agricultural consultant Blaine Viator found the infected
leaves in a shady area in which dew probably was maintained. This may
have provided ideal conditions for infection. This is the 1st report
of ASR in Louisiana during 2006. No Asian soybean rust has been found
on soybeans in the state this season.
This confirmation puts soybean rust in the state a full 4 months
before it was found there in 2005. Soybean rust was not found in
Lafayette Parish last year [2005]; the only 2 positive counties in
Louisiana in 2005 were East Baton Rouge (on soybean 28 Oct 2005) and
Tangipahoa (on kudzu 30 Nov 2005).
Don Hershman, University of Kentucky plant pathologist, commented
that "finding rust in the state 4 months earlier than last year
[2005] does not bode well."
"What does this really mean for the soybean industry? The presence of
ASR in kudzu, with no sightings in soybeans, means that soybean
fields need to be scouted at least every 2 to 3 days, especially in
areas along tree lines that are shaded in the morning. These shaded
areas maintain longer dew periods and can reduce temperatures enough
to encourage ASR development if the spores are present.
"Growth stages at which flowers 1st appear through early pod filling
(R1 through R5) are especially sensitive to potential yield losses if
rust develops at that time. It is during these stages that fungicides
should be applied if there is a threat of disease.

[2] ASR on soybean - Alabama: 1st report 2006

ALERT: Soybean rust found in AL soybean sentinel plot
-----------------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust has been confirmed in the Baldwin County soybean
sentinel plot at Fairhope, Alabama.
According to the Alabama state commentary from 29 Jun 2006 on
<http://www.sbrusa.net>,
"soybean rust was confirmed on soybeans in Alabama yesterday. This is
the 2nd report of soybean rust on soybeans in the United States in
2006."
[Stopsoybeanrust.com editor's note: while the 1st report on soybeans
this growing season was in a Florida sentinel plot 15 Jun 2006, rust
also was found on late-harvested 2005 soybeans in Texas in February
2006.]
"The disease was detected on leaves collected from the Baldwin County
soybean sentinel plot in Fairhope on 27 Jun 2006. The leaves were
incubated for 48 hours, and we observed the pustules and spores
typical of this pathogen. A total of 5 soybean rust lesions were
observed on 3 leaves. The disease was detected on Pioneer 93M90
(maturity group III) at the R5-R6 growth stage. The disease was not
observed on a maturity group IV variety (Pioneer 94M80) at the R4
growth stage planted adjacent to the 93M90's. Leaves were also
collected from 3 commercial soybean fields in Baldwin County, but no
rust was observed. These fields ranged in development from V4-V6."
Don Hershman, University of Kentucky plant pathologist, notes that
this find was made almost to the day when it was found in Baldwin
County (Fairhope) last year [2005].
"One big difference, according to Ed Sikora, is that Fairhope is down
15 inches in rain compared to last year [2005], and the beans are
very drought stressed," Hershman said. "This indicates to me that the
soybean rust pathogen is able to infect (albeit not at high levels)
even under very dry conditions. This find is significant in that I
believe it signifies a shift in the soybean-rust situation for this
year [2006]. I anticipate we will now begin to see an upturn in
soybean rust. The main question now is how fast it moves and where.
At this point, it is a race against time as far as the soybean crop
goes. Most of our full season soybeans are nearing or are in the
reproductive stages. Doublecrop soybean are considerably further
behind in development," he said.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green
beans, and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR
pathogen, which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu
(_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is an important
alternate host for the pathogen in southern states of the USA.
New reports of ASR on kudzu in southern states of the USA have been made but
not posted on ProMED-mail since the last posting in this series on 16 Jun 2006
(20060616.1667). In the 1st report in this posting, the detection of ASR on
kudzu for the 1st time in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana (LA) is noted, with the
additional point that this outbreak is 4 months sooner than it was found
anywhere in LA on kudzu in 2005. There is yet to be a report on soybean in LA
in 2006, but growers will use this information to plan spraying of soybean
crops.
The 2nd report announces the 2nd detection of ASR on 2006 soybean
plants in the USA, in this case in Alabama (AL) in one of the
sentinel plots maintained in that state. The timing in that state is
similar to 2005. The 1st report was in a Florida sentinel plot 15 Jun
2006. ASR has yet to be reported in a commercial crop planting in
2006. This report in AL will put adjacent states like Georgia on
higher alert.
It is too soon to predict or compare disease progression in 2006 and
2005, but these reports probably signal the start of more reports of
ASR in soybean in the USA in 2006, especially in fields where plants
remain immature.
