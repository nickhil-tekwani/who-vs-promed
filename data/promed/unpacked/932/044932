West Nile Virus Found in Dead Crows in St. Louis, Missouri
----------------------------------------------------------
CHICAGO: West Nile virus has been identified in 5 dead crows in St. Louis
as the potentially deadly disease spreads westward across the United
States, Missouri health officials said.
The mosquito-borne virus has killed at least 10 people in the United States
since it first appeared in New York in 1999. It has spread to about 2 dozen
eastern U.S. states and southern Ontario, Canada, infecting mostly wild
birds. The virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to people, birds, horses
and small animals.
Human cases of the disease have been reported this year in New York, New
Jersey, Maryland, Georgia and Florida. In Florida, where 7 people have been
confirmed infected with West Nile virus this year, a health alert has been
extended to nearly 75 percent of the state.
The disease produces flu-like symptoms, but the elderly and people with
weak immune systems can develop brain inflammation and die. There is no
specific treatment for the disease or a vaccine to prevent it. Missouri's
Department of Health and Senior Services said in a statement on Friday the
coming onset of cold weather could slow the spread of the virus in the
state this year.
