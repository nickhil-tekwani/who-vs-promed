On 19 Oct 2008 the state government pressed into service
epidemiologists from the Regional Medical Research Centre and Science
Research Centre to visit [Kendrapara] district in the wake of reports
of the outbreak of a mysterious fever. Nearly 1500 patients from
thickly populated villages in Garadpur, Marshaghai and Mahakalpada
block are hit by the virus disease. The epidemiologists from the
research centre are making a symptomatic study of the disease. They
have stationed themselves at the worst hit villages at Mahakalpada
block and are extending clinical treatment to the people with fever
and pain in the joints.

"We will not be able to say anything about the disease till we get
confirmatory reports from the National Virology Institute," said a
member of the research team. "The symptoms vary from person to person;
while the majority encounter fever and joint pain, there are cases
where the patients showed signs of swelling in thigh and lower leg,"
he added. "We are not [sure] of the exact nature of the disease. But
it can certainly be said that the disease is not fatal. Under clinical
treatment, the disease is curable after the incubation
period is over," said the team member.

The disease is still firmly entrenched in Teragaon village where the
1st case of the fever was detected. Fever cases have also been
reported in the villages of Beadri, Chanda, Gadaramita, Bacharai,
Ramchandrapur, Nadi-abarei, Akhua, Ghans-hyampur, Pentha, Dahi-macha
and Karanja.

The symptoms, seasonal nature, and absence of fatalities are features
compatible with an outbreak of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus
infection, comparable to a similar outbreak in the neighboring
district of Jaipur (see: Undiagnosed disease - India: (Orissa)
RFI 20081021.3337). Confirmation of this suggested diagnosis, or
otherwise, is awaited.

There appears to be no connection between these outbreaks of
non-fatal febrile illness and a recent outbreak that caused some
deaths in a different part of Orissa state in August 2008 -- see
ProMED ref. below). Nor is there likely to be any connection with a
contemporaneous outbreak of fatal disease in buffalo, also in
Kendrapara district. This disease has been provisionally diagnosed as
bovine foot-and-mouth disease, which cannot be contracted by
humans -- see ProMED ref.20081025.3369 below. - Mod.CP]
