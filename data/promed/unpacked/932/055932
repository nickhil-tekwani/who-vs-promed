[Following a report of a single new laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 20 Nov 2016, there was a 6 day hiatus with no new cases reported until the past 3 days when there have been 6 newly confirmed cases reported (1 case reported 2 days ago - 27 Nov 2016; 2 cases reported yesterday - 28 Nov 2016; and 3 cases reported today - 29 Nov 2016). This brings the total number of newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Nov 2016 up to 20. One of the newly reported cases since 1 Nov 2016 was classified as a secondary case in a household contact, while the other 19 cases were classified as primary cases with 7 having a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and the remaining 12 were still under investigation for possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness.

Of note is that these 20 cases were reported from different locations in the country: Afeef (Afif - 1 case), Alaflaj (1 case), Alkharj (2 cases), Alzulfi (1 case), Arar (1 case), Bahrah (1 case), Buqayq (1 case), Buraidah (2 cases), Hafr-Elbatin (2 cases), Najran (2 cases), Rejal Alma' (1 case), Riyadh (2 cases), Tabuk (1 case), Taif (1 case), and Yanbua (1 case).

So the question remains, is there a not-so-silent outbreak ongoing in the country? Or is this just an increased awareness to test for the disease coinciding with a season increase in transmission?
