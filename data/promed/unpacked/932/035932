UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, VEGETABLE CROPS - GHANA (VOLTA): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Farms at Anloga and other districts in the Volta Region have been
bedeviled by a strange disease, which is undermining the growth of
crops and killing them early before the harvest period. The cause of
the disease is not immediately known and it is virtually eating up
all crops on farms, compelling farmers to seek remedy to the problem.
Simon Akukorkor Avor, the 1999 National Shallot Farmer, has, on
behalf of other farmers in the region, appealed to the Food and
Agriculture Ministry through the Volta Agriculture Extension Officer
to dispatch experts to the region to study the situation and find
ways of controlling it.
He expressed concern that farmers may not be able to harvest any crop
during this farming season, should things continue as they are now.
He explained that the disease normally attacks crops like shallot,
tomatoes, pepper, okra, and carrot, adding, "The disease can start
attacking the crops beneath the ground."
Other farmers who spoke to the Guide also contended that they were
facing similar problems on their farms, and disclosed that about 20
years ago, a similar disease attacked their crops. When the Guide
visited some of the farms, farmers were seen destroying dead crops.

[It appears that the area is affected by a soil-borne pathogen that
attacks vegetable crops. The source supplies a very blurred picture
of what may be a tomato crop with patchy yellowing symptoms.
Soil-borne diseases are usually complex and may involve more than one
factor. Generally, fungi are the most important group of soil-borne
pathogens. There are several soil-borne fungi affecting the range of
crops described above causing root rots and wilts, for example
_Fusarium_ or _Verticillium_ species, which could be involved in the
problem. Species of root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_) may also
affect the hosts mentioned. Less likely in this case would be
bacterial root rots (for example by _Erwinia_ species which have a
wide host range). Some soil-borne viruses (genera _Furovirus_ and
_Nepovirus_) exist as well but seem an unlikely cause for the
problems above because of the range of crops affected.
