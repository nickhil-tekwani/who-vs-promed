Elderly city resident tests positive for West Nile virus
Woman, 70, is third Marylander infected
--------------------------------------------------
An elderly Baltimore woman has tested positive for the West Nile
virus, bringing to three the number of Marylanders infected with the
virus this summer.
The 70-year-old woman, who lives in the Jonestown area, showed up
confused and delirious at Mercy Medical Center about 2 weeks ago, said
Dr. Peter L. Beilenson, city health commissioner. The patient suffered
from chills, tremors and other symptoms of encephalitis, or brain
inflammation, caused by the virus. Although she has improved, she is
still at Mercy Medical Center, authorities said.
Conclusive tests are not finished, but officials say they are 90% sure
that the woman, whose name was not released, has the virus. Like the
rare few who get sick from West Nile, she is elderly and has other
health problems. She also gardens and is frequently outside, making it
easier for her to get bitten by the mosquitoes that transmit the
disease.
Maryland's other two cases are a 72-year-old city man, who was
recently discharged from Sinai Hospital, and a 63-year-old Baltimore
County woman, who died the weekend of 8 Sep 2001 at Johns Hopkins
Bayview Medical Center. Her death was not caused by West Nile, but by
unrelated health problems.
Because of the new case, Beilenson said city crews will spray to kill
mosquitoes in the Jonestown area Monday night. Weather permitting,
crews will also spray in Brooklyn and the Herring Run watershed.
Routine monitoring showed that both neighborhoods had a high level of
mosquitoes, as well as a significant number that were infected with
the virus. Maps showing the specific spraying areas will be released
today.
Still, most people have little to fear from West Nile, health
officials say. Roughly 80% of the people infected with the virus never
develop symptoms.

BALTIMORE, 8:13 p.m. EDT 21 Sep 2001 -- Maryland's fourth and fifth
human cases of the West Nile virus were reported by the state health
department Friday.

Carney area of Baltimore County tested positive for the disease, the
department said. Both patients were treated and released from area
