[Re: BSE - Israel: OIE confirmed 20020605.4406]
In the past 2 days the normally meticulous editors of ProMED-mail
have referred to the Golan Heights as "Israel." The "kibbutz" which
reported the outbreak is not an "Israeli farm" but a settlement in
occupied territory. Concerning the infected animal which had been
acquired from "another farm situated in the Jordan Valley," the
phrasing of this report suggests that the farm of origin is a Palestinian
farm in the West Bank rather than in the corresponding Jordanian
region. Had the report been produced from within the Gaza Strip or
West Bank, would you have also identified this as an Israeli report?
[No -- we'd have identified it as from the Palestinian Authority. -

You might wish to adopt the U.S. State Department's policy of referring
broadly to "Israel and the Occupied Territories."

[We have also had a complaint that in our Dengue/DHF updates (21): 4
Jun 2002 20020604.4391 the text appears to imply that New Caledonia
is part of French Polynesia.
We therefore take this opportunity to state that the geographic names
used by ProMED-mail are not meant to imply recognition by us -- or
anyone else -- of territorial integrity, but are indicative of the general
region where the outbreak occurred. Diseases do not recognise national
boundaries.
Incidentally, we are not at all sure that the Palestinian Authority -- or
Syria -- would want to take credit for the introduction of BSE into that
region. - Mod.JW]
