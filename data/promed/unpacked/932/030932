The Ambassador of Chile in Brazil, Jaime Gazmuri, confirmed to Tele 13 the death of the 2nd Chilean infected with yellow fever. The deceased is a 20-year-old young man, that adds an additional case to another young man whose death was confirmed this past [Fri 16 Feb 2018].

The 2 young men met on Ilha Grande [island in the state of Rio de Janeiro], along with a 3rd [infected] Chilean, who is currently under observation.

Gazmuri stated that the 20-year-old "was admitted [to hospital] on [Sat 18 Feb 2018] with a yellow fever diagnosis, but yesterday [19 Feb 2018] his condition worsened."

Concerning the 3rd infected Chilean, the Ambassador stated to the media that "the information he had as of yesterday [19 Feb 2018] was that he was in stable condition, that there are no complications, but this is a disease with which one can not be tranquil until he is discharged [from hospital]."

Yellow fever is a potentially lethal disease transmitted by a mosquito called _Aedes aegypti_ [in the urban transmission cycle, forest mosquitoes in the sylvan forest cycle that is occurring currently in Brazil. - Mod.TY]. The symptoms range from fever and muscle pain to progressive kidney insufficiency. To date, [yellow fever] has left more than 150 dead and 450 infected in the outbreak area that includes the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.

The Ministry of Health has called for those Chileans who are contemplating travel to the outbreak area to be vaccinated. In addition to this, it is extremely important to utilize repellents with 30 percent DEET, a key compound to avoid mosquito bites that as well as yellow fever, can transmit Zika, dengue, and chikungunya [viruses].

"I take advantage [of this opportunity] to recommend to all Chileans who travel to the Brazilian states affected by this yellow fever outbreak to get vaccinated, which is the only guarantee of not contracting the disease," Gazmuri said.

[The cases above are not the first associated with Ilha Grande. An 8 Feb 2018 ProMED-mail post (see Yellow fever - Americas (11): Brazil monkeys 20180208.5613594) reported that a 38-year-old Argentinean man died of yellow fever in Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde of the state of Rio de Janeiro on the morning of Sat 3 Feb 2018. This information was issued by the Municipal Secretariat of Health of the city. The man had visited Praia da Longa, and also Ilha Grande, where the cause of death of a monkey was confirmed as yellow fever. It is suspected that this is where the man contracted the disease. This is the 1st confirmed yellow fever case in humans in Angra dos Reis, which is located in the Sul Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro. The man's death comes at the height of the summer vacation season, when the Ilha Grande is a popular tourist destination.

Interestingly, the sister of the 20-year-old man indicated that he had decided not to be vaccinated for ideological reasons (http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2018/02/20/muere-en-brasil-segundo-turista-chileno-por-fiebre-amarilla/). Vaccination refusal has begun to arise in the Brazil population as well. A Washington Post report [edited] stated, "With cases of yellow fever multiplying in Brazil, a woman, a 42-year-old accountant, was considering whether to get vaccinated. Then she saw a viral Facebook post about a teenage girl's supposedly fatal reaction after receiving the vaccine, and she decided it was a firm no for her, her 14-year-old son, and her husband. "I'm very afraid of that vaccine. I don't trust it," said the woman, who lives in Sao Paulo. "I got scared when I saw the post and thought, 'Thank God my family hasn't taken it yet.' Now we're not going to." (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-battles-yellow-fever--and-a-dangerous-anti-vaccination-campaign/2018/02/17/fccb9528-0d1e-11e8-998c-96deb18cca19_story.html communicated by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall). Serious vaccine reactions that can lead to death occur in approximately one in one million vaccinations. Although these reactions are tragic, the benefit of population and individual immunity justify the risk of these very rare adverse consequences.

Drs Perret, Hamer and Schlagenhauf are thanked for sending these reports to ProMED-mail.
