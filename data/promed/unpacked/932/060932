Alabama: 2 Suspected Eastern Equine Encephalitis Deaths in south of State
--------------------------------------------------
A man and a child died at the same hospital within 24 hours of each other
from what officials said could be Eastern equine encephalitis, which has
not killed anyone in Alabama since 1996. Dr. Dan Raulerson, the medical
examiner for Escambia County in rural south Alabama, said both patients
came to the hospital in Brewton on Fri 25 Jul 2003. The adult, an older man
from Castleberry, died that night and the child died the next day. "Both
autopsies indicated encephalitis," he said. The man and child lived within
6 miles of a farm where a horse recently died of the rare but deadly
mosquito-borne disease, county health officials said. Tests are to be
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine
the cause of death in both cases.
Along with the 2 possible deaths from Eastern equine encephalitis, an
81-year-old World War II veteran from Gulf Shores became the 2nd Alabamian
to die of West Nile virus, a relative told the Mobile Register on Wed 6 Aug
2003. West Nile virus is not nearly as deadly as Eastern equine
encephalitis, which is rare in the United States. The CDC says there are
only 5 cases on average reported each year, but it kills about 1/3, and
survivors may suffer brain damage. "The chances of getting the disease,
West Nile or EEE, are still very slim," said Ricky Elliott of the Escambia
County Health Department's environmental health office. "But when 2 people
die within 24 hours -- it has many in health care nervous. People have got
to act to reduce standing water near their homes and take precautions to
protect themselves."
