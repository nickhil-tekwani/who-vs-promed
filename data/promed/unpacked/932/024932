Regarding the moderator's [Dick Hamilton comment:
[The identity of tomato leaf curl virus requires comment. According to the
latest rules of nomenclature adopted by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses published in 1999, the proper name for the virus is
tomato leaf curl begomovirus (ToLCV). There are at least 2 isolates
(strains?) of the virus from Bangalore, I and II. In addition to the
Bangalore isolates, there are others from Australia, India (New Delhi),
Senegal, Taiwan, and Tanzania. I have no information on possible
relationships between ToLCV and other begomoviruses...
According to the 7th Report of the ICTV (1), the viruses causing tomato
leaf curl are:
Tomato leaf curl virus - Australia (ToLCV-Au)
Tomato leaf curl virus - Bangalore I (ToLCV-BanI)
Tomato leaf curl virus - Bangalore II (ToLCV-BanII)
Tomato leaf curl virus - New Delhi (ToLCV-NDe)
Tomato leaf curl virus - Senegal (ToLCV-Sn)
Tomato leaf curl virus - Taiwan (ToLCV-Tw)
Tomato leaf curl virus - Tanzania (ToLCV-Tz)
These are all distinct viral species, as defined by their nucleotide
sequence identity (below 90% for the entire A component), inability to
trans-replicate each other and inability to generate infectious
pseudorecombinants. However, all cause tomato leaf curl, being essentially
impossible to distinguish the symptoms caused by each virus.
The geminivirus study group of the ICTV thus decided to name all of them
Tomato leaf curl virus (the generic name is no longer placed in the virus
name), plus the name of the country/city where the virus was first
isolated. The same criteria were used to define Bean golden mosaic virus -
Brazil (BGMV-Br) and Bean golden mosaic virus Puerto Rico (BGMV-PR), as
well as the variety of viruses causing Tomato yellow leaf curl (all named
Tomato yellow leaf curl virus - _Location_, including Israel, Sardinia,
China, Nigeria, Tanzania, Yemen, and a few others).

P.S.: I am *not* a member of the geminivirus study group, just an
interested virologist with a particular interest in taxonomy.
