Bird flu is spreading in Iowa, with the state reporting its 2nd outbreak Monday [7 Mar 2022], this time infecting 50 000 turkeys in a northwest Iowa commercial facility.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture said the 15-week-old turkeys were destroyed at a Buena Vista County facility to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus.

Officials are "restricting movement in, within, and out" of a quarantine area in a 6 mi [9.6 km] circle around the infected facility, said Iowa State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand. Birds in 5 commercial facilities and 37 backyard flocks in the quarantined area are being tested.

Tests verified the virus in the Buena Vista County flock late Sunday [6 Mar 2022], Kaisand said. The destroyed birds will be disposed of on location, he said. The owner has the option of composting the birds or burying them.

On Monday [7 Mar 2022], Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster declaration for the county, allowing the state agriculture department and other agencies to assist with detection, tracking, and monitoring of the disease and containment, disposal, and disinfection.

Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said Monday [7 Mar 2022] the outbreak at a commercial facility could have trade implications. The US Department of Agriculture will report the case to global animal health and trade officials and wait to see if any restrictions are placed on Iowa birds.

Last week, the Iowa and US agriculture departments said a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks, where bird flu was detected in Pottawattamie County, had been destroyed and incinerated.

Kaisand said he believes wild birds infected the turkey facility as they migrate across the US. He sees no connection between the Pottawattamie County and Buena Vista County outbreaks.

Agriculture officials also set up a quarantine area in Pottawattamie County, but with just 3 backyard flocks in that zone, officials only required that the birds be monitored for signs of infection.

Over the weekend, avian influenza also was discovered in commercial flocks in Maryland, South Dakota, and Missouri, bringing to 12 the states with reported outbreaks detected.

Kaisand said poultry producers should put up "as many firewalls as possible between your poultry and wild birds," adding that "separating any connections between wild birds and domestic birds is absolutely critical this year [2022]."

State and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach US food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States.

The virus' spread is particularly concerning in Iowa, which leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens, and ranks 7th nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds annually.

Kaisand said it's important to note that there is no cure or vaccine for bird flu.

The virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours. A 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys, and other birds in Iowa. That was about 2/3 of the 50.5 million that were destroyed nationally in what is considered the worst foreign animal disease outbreak on record.

The US Department of Agriculture helps the state and producers get rid of potentially infected birds and disinfect facilities, Naig said. The federal government also will help producers financially with the loss of the birds. "This is a devastating blow to them economically," he said.

He said he believes industry and state and federal government officials are better prepared than in 2015, with tighter biosecurity measures limiting access to facilities and preventing contamination of birds' water and feed.

"None of us want to be facing a foreign animal disease again here in Iowa, but we have learned a lot," Naid said, adding that "we're ready to respond quickly" when an outbreak is identified to prevent the virus' spread.

Last week, Naig said Iowans with flocks should be "on high alert" over the next couple months while wild birds are migrating. The state is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds annually.

Naig said the discovery of disease in Iowa on 1 Mar [2022] was "not unexpected," given reports it had been detected in wild, backyard, and commercial flocks, mostly in eastern US states.

Kaisand urged poultry owners to immediately report to the state and federal agriculture departments any birds that become sick or die unexpectedly.

Officials say poultry products remain safe to eat when properly handled and cooked.

US Department of Agriculture figures for 2020, the latest available, show Iowa's poultry industry receipts were USD 1.28 billion.

[2] Missouri (Stoddard County): commercial poultry

Stoddard County Health Center Director Ben Godwin stated in a social media release that a flock of broiler chickens in Stoddard County has tested positive for avian influenza (AI). Godwin said the test was confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

Godwin's release said samples from the flock were tested at the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network NAHLN, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

The APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Missouri on a joint incident response to the positive test. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease; birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

Godwin said according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern.

Godwin said cases of avian influenza in humans is very rare but could cause flu-like symptoms. Additionally, Godwin said no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

Godwin said everyone should cook all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] to kill bacteria and viruses.

As part of the existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the areas around the affected flock. Godwin's release said the United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. The APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

Godwin said the USDA will report these finding to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. He said the USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts.

The OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region posing a risk of spreading the disease of concern.

Godwin said APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

According to Godwin's release, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS's toll-free number in addition to practicing good biosecurity.

Additionally, the APHIS is urging producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs being depopulated during a disease response.

The APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of H and N proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a flock of commercial chickens in Cecil County, Maryland, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

Samples from the flock were tested at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced in a statement released Saturday [5 Mar 2021].

The USDA said state officials quarantined the affected premises, and action is being taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Chicken from the flock will not enter the food system, the USDA said. Federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock, the USDA said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

As a reminder, the USDA said the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.

[Avian influenza continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.

While most of these articles do not specifically mention H5N1, it is highly likely this is the specific strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Migrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill. So this is a time to be very vigilant about all birds near your flock. - Mod.TG]
