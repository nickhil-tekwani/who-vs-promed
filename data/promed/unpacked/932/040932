Veterinarians at the Animal Medical Center in Gillette, Wyoming received laboratory confirmation this week [week of 16-22 Jul 2017] that a horse under their treatment tested positive for the West Nile Virus.

According to Dr Marshall Kohr the horse presented wobbly and unsteady on his feet. Even though about 33 percent of the horses who exhibit signs of West Nile virus will succumb to the disease, Dr Kohr reports that "this horse is improving and expected to make a full recovery."

West Nile virus in horses is easily prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. Horses, humans and some species of birds are the most susceptible to West Nile Virus, but dogs and cats can become infected.

Dr Kohr was quick to add that "even though they can get infected it is highly unlikely that dogs or cats would become ill. "The Veterinarians at the Animal Medical Center recommend that horses in Campbell County get vaccinated against West Nile Virus every year."

Even though the same mosquitos that infect our horses with the virus can also infect humans, "there is no risk that a human can contract West Nile Virus from their horse" Kohr was quick to point out.

[Gillette is in north east Wyoming; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/WY/Gillette.html. There is a small inset showing where Wyoming is for those that are uncertain.

There is a vaccine for horses though it is not cheap. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-to 6-week period. WNV vaccine is effective and usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis), WEE (western equine encephalitis), and tetanus. When it is made this easy it is baffling as to why owners have not vaccinated, preferentially in the Spring. - Mod.MHJ
