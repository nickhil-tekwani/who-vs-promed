1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season
1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (Interim National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management)
1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases
1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF
1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected States are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.
1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and updating of VHF case-based management database
1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centers across the States with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted

[During week 23, there were just 3 new suspected cases. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.

Once again, Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi is thanked for sending in the above Epidemiological Report.
