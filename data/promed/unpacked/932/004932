[Now that the incidence in the UK of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or at least reached a plateau, the Department of Health full
table of definite and probable CJD deaths and referrals will no longer be
reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of variant CJD
statistics will be posted unless there is a substantial change in the
situation. The full table updated monthly can be accessed at the Department
of Health website: <http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definitions of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of
Health website or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) -

Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 5 Jul 2004
----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today issuing the latest information about the
numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This includes cases of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the form of the disease thought to be
linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as follows:
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 104
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 38
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 142
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of definite/probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive): 147
The next table will be published by the Department of Health on Mon 2 Aug 2004

[These figures reveal that there has been one further death from (probable)
vCJD since June 2004, increasing the total number of dead and alive vCJD
cases to 147. This case is the first to be confirmed during the past 5
months, which is consistent with an interpretation that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK has now passed its peak. As of 5 Jul 2004, according to the
Department of Health table of vCJD deaths, there have been only 3 deaths
during the first 6 months of 2004, compared with 18 deaths during 2003 and
a peak of 28 deaths in the year 2000
