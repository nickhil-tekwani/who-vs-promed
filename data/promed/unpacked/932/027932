The Kathmandu reported on Friday [20 Apr 2007], the deaths of some
700 sheep and goats in the last 2 weeks in an outbreak of Peste des
[petits] ruminants (PPR) in Kalikot District, about 400 km. (249
miles) west of Kathmandu.
The animals died mainly in the [settlements of the] Village
Development Committees in the northwestern part of the district.
According to local residents, sheep and goats died 4 to 5 hours [see
commentary] after the disease hit and the PPR was reportedly
contacted by animals that were taken to a remote region of the
country for grazing.
The disease claimed some 200 [animals] in Naula Singh alone, said the
District Veterinary Office (DVO). PPR is an acute or sub acute viral
disease of goats and sheep characterized by fever, stomatitis,
gastro-enteritis, [and] pneumonia.
Local residents are concerned over an epidemic in the villages of the
region from the dead animals. DVO chief, Dr. Kalyan Kumar Shrestha,
said that 2 DVO teams equipped with PPR vaccine have left for the
most affected areas of the region.
Last year [2006], some 400 sheep and goats died of the disease in
several villages of the region.

[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) occurs in Africa, the Middle East,
and the Indian subcontinent. Outbreaks are known to be common in
India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
The incubation period for PPR can range from 3 to 10 days, 4-5 days
being typical. Most cases of PPR are acute, with signs of a sudden
fever that may last for 5-8 days before the animal either dies or
begins to recover. Mass mortality of sheep and goats within 4 to 5
hours after the commencement of PPR (or, as the posting says, "after
the disease hit"), as described above, is highly exceptional.
According to previous (1998), 1st-hand information from Nepal, the
mortality is very variable (from 0 percent to 90 percent, sub
clinical infection occurring very frequently); see ProMED-mail
posting, Peste des petits ruminants: origin & distribution (02)
19981012.2007.
Either the current observation on the per-acute course of the disease
is erroneous or, if accurate, a different etiology (infectious or
otherwise) -- in addition to PPR or as the sole cause of the
mortality -- should not be excluded.
Details from Nepal on the clinical signs, the size of the exposed
population (namely the denominator), the age of the affected animals,
PM (post-mortem) findings and, particularly, laboratory test results
are expected.
