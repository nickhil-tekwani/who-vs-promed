I, a veterinarian based in Arusha, Tanzania, would like to report a high morbidity/mortality in sheep and goats in the Southern part of Kenya and Northern part of Tanzania, possibly caused by _Coenurus cerebralis_. The term "possibly" is applied since the diagnosis is based only upon the finding of cysts localized outside the animal's brains.

The Maasai call the disease "Ormilo" (head disease). They started complaining about it some 10 years ago; during the past 3 years, the reported morbidity-mortality has reached around 20 percent. Today, Ormilo is the main Maasai's concern among the small ruminant diseases/parasitoses. Ormilo is reported to affect both goats and sheep at any time of the year. It is reported to be more prevalent in 1 to 3 year-old animals.

In the past 3 years, I carried out 103 post mortem examinations; the reported age is also confirmed by my findings, mainly on the Tanzanian side. They were applied in slaughtered animals or in animals bought for examination. The market price of diseased animals is usually half that of unaffected animals.

During the most recent investigation (Longido, Tanzania), we randomly bought 5 out of the 23 small ruminants [sheep, goats] having nervous signs. Therefore, it should be considered a biased sample. The total number of animals on sale was 143. All [of the examined] animals had cerebral cysts. No other causes for nervous signs were found.

Looking at the number of postmortems carried out, the livestock owners are able to identify 100 percent of the diseased animals. It is interesting to note that the Maasai shepherds, knowledgeable about animal diseases and their epidemiology, are not aware of the role of dogs as sources of coenurus infection in their sheep and goats.

As far as I know, few people are aware of the phenomenon and nothing has been done to tackle this major problem. Hopefully, this posting will raise awareness among the concerned institutions/organizations and lead to the dissemination of the required information.

[The description provided by Dr Di Giulio is indeed highly indicative of _Coenurus cerebralis_ in sheep and goats. Definitive confirmation from a parasitological laboratory, including the demonstration and identification of the relevant tape-worm in dogs' feces, will be helpful.

The following text, titled "Coenurosis," from the Merck Veterinary Manual (https://goo.gl/T8whvD), is copied here for the benefit of subscribers who are not familiar with the clinical condition, globally distributed, also known in English-speaking countries as "gid," "sturdy," or "staggers":

"_Taenia (Multiceps) multiceps_ is an intestinal parasite of canids (especially dogs, foxes, and jackals) and man. Its intermediate hosts include sheep, goats, deer, antelope, chamois, rabbits, hares, horses, and less commonly cattle, which acquire the eggs while grazing. Some oncospheres reach the brain and develop by endogenous budding into a metacestode (larval) stage known as _Coenurus cerebralis_. Initial invasion and development of the oncospheres may be responsible for acute suppurative meningoencephalitis. The fully developed coenurus may be 5-6 cm in diameter and cause increased intracranial pressure, which results in ataxia, hypermetria, blindness, head deviation, stumbling, and paralysis. In sheep, palpation of the skull caudal to the horn buds may reveal refraction; surgery to remove the cyst, including its wall, has a reasonable chance of success and is justified in valuable animals. Dogs associated with sheep and other livestock should not be fed the heads or nervous tissue from infected animals and should be dewormed regularly."

The presence of _T. multiceps_ in Tanzania and Kenya should not surprise; the parasite is considered to be spread globally. The extremely high incidence of coenurosis, caused by its larval stage in small ruminants, is remarkable.

To control coenurosis of sheep and goats, tapeworm infection in working dogs and in strays should be prevented:
- prevent dogs from accessing sheep carcass;
- dispose of all sheep carcasses (even apparently healthy sheep may have cysts!).

Human infection occurs accidentally and rarely. Humans, especially young children, become intermediate hosts by ingesting eggs passed in the excrement of a definitive (carnivore, particularly dogs) host. The ingested eggs release oncospheres in the intestine of the patient (=intermediate host) that penetrate the intestinal wall, passing through the blood stream towards target organs, usually the brain, spinal cord and eyes. Human disease caused by _T. multiceps (Coenurus)_ is a rare phenomenon that has been reported from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas (for details see table I, page 622 in ref 1). The most common symptoms of brain coenurosis in humans include headaches, vomiting and pappiledema [swelling of the optic nerve inside the eye] that are related to the increased intracranial pressure caused by the mass effect of the cystic lesion. Focal neurological deficit, such as cranial nerve palsy and motor disturbances are also frequent.

The said and additional epidemiological, clinical and pathological information on human coenurosis, is available in Ref 1 (illustrated, extensively referenced).
