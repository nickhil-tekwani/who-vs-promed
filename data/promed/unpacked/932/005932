Rates (per 100 000) of tick-borne encephalitis [TBE] in Switzerland have increased somewhat since the year 2000, and are currently higher than those reported by surrounding countries.

The following image link was created by a tool in Gideon (<GideonOnline.com>) that converts incidence data into population rates and combines user-selected graphs into a single chart. See link https://www.gideononline.com/2017/10/11/tick-borne-encephalitis-switzerland/

[ProMeD-mail thanks Steve Berger for the comment that TBE rates in Switzerland are higher than in surrounding countries. Many of the European TBE reports that ProMED-mail receives are from Germany. The Gideon tool that converts incidence into population rates will be useful for many epidemiologists.

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
