Malaria is fast spreading in agency areas
-----------------------------------------
Malaria is fast spreading in tribal villages in Bhadrachalam division
due to lack of preventive measures. So far, 2 persons died of malaria
fever in Kunavaram and VR Puram mandals. And people of VR Puram,
Kunavaram, Chintur mandals are suffering with malaria for the last a
few days. The disease is fast spreading in Jeediguppa, Pedamittapalli
and Pochavaram villages in VR Puram mandal.

Tribals in these villages allege that anti-larval operations were not
being carried out properly. Medical staff also were not visiting the
villages regularly, they said. It may be noted that the health
department survey revealed the severity of malaria in tribal villages
in the district.

According to survey reports, as many as 355 cases were tested
positive for malaria out of the 24 144 blood samples taken in the
agency area in January this year [2011].

And some 311 positive cases were detected in February [2011] out of
the 25 360 blood samples under scanner. With the 79 101 malaria
positive cases were detected in January and February respectively,
Tulasipaka village in VR Puram mandal was identified as one of the
most malaria-prone village in the district.

District malaria officer S Bikshapathi said they had identified
Tulasipaka as highly vulnerable to malaria. The health department said
that they had introduced Pyrethrum, a liquid spray to kill mosquitoes.


He said that spraying operation was in progress in all the
malaria-prone areas. The anti-malaria wing is considering an action
plan to scale down the incidence of the disease to a minimum in agency
