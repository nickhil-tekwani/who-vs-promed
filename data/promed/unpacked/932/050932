[The report indicates that a group of animals may have been smuggled
from outside the country. The OIE WAHID database records 3
occurrences in 2007 and 2008 of a similar phenomenon where RVF
manifest as subclinical infections in animals that appear to only be
recognized because of serologically positive tests. In 2004, this
same presentation also happened in the Jizan region of Saudi Arabia,
which is the same region as the current outbreak. It is located very
near the western part of Yemen, near the Red Sea. The location of the
outbreak can be seen appended to the the OIE WAHID database reference
above or at <http://healthmap.org/r/03xv>.

It is important to remember in this regard that not all outbreaks in
this region are subclinical as the 2000 - 2001 outbreak affected
large numbers of livestock as well humans in Saudi Arabia and Yemen
resulting in approximately a thousand human cases and around 125
human deaths for each country. - Mod.PC]
