Regarding the material that Dr. LaBudde passed along from a news article
from Lethbridge, Alberta on _E. coli_ O157 in ProMED Digest Tuesday, 3
February 1998, Volume 98 :Number 028.
As indicated by the moderator, several points need clarification.
1. As to the point that "there's a greater chance _E. coli O157:H7_ will
show up in lightweight cattle entering a feedlot": A recent study found an
approximately 3 fold higher prevalence of O157 in cattle which recently
entered a feedlot compared to randomly selected cattle.(ref 1) This same
effect was found in two samples of feedlots independently collected and
tested at two different labs.(1) It does not seem likely that this is a
simple effect of weight. Rather, it may be a reflection of the impact of
dietary change, feed/water withholding in transit, or some other factor(s)
on gastrointestinal flora.
2. As to the point that "a high energy feed like barley may make some
animals more susceptible": It is the case that a recent study found a
higher prevalence of O157 among pens of feedlot cattle being fed a
barley-containing ration in comparison to pens fed rations not containing
barley.(2) However, one should consider the limitations of such broad
studies which include dozens of inter-correlated exposures and for which
measurement of the dependent variable is necessarily limited in quality by
a single point estimate from a limited sample size. As was made clear by
the authors, the study was mainly intended for hypothesis generation. The
hypothesis suggested by the quote that barley in a ration is a proxy for
energy density is unlikely to be correct since barley (qualitative or
quantitative) probably does not correlate with energy density in feedlot
rations. The observed association does suggest some sort of influence of
ration on O157 prevalence that merits targeted studies.
3. As to the point "Â…one published study of feedlot cattle showed 63
percent of feedlots had at least one animal testing positive for _E. coli_
in gastrointestinal systems.": It is the case that O157 was found in at
least one fecal sample in 63% of the feedlots tested.(1) It is worth noting
that this was based on a single-day's sample of 120 fecals from each
feedlot. When an agent documented to occur in a strongly
temporally-clustered manner, such as O157, (3) is found in 63% of feedlots
by sampling a small minority of cattle present/feedlot on a single day,
this is consistent with a ubiquitous distribution.
4. As to the point that "A cow/calf study from Washington state showed 16
percent of herds carried the bacteria but less than one percent shed it.":
There may be a serious misconception. All studies have shown that the
individual prevalence of O157 (the percent of cattle with detectable levels
of O157 in feces at any point in time) is very low. However, sampling herds
longitudinally has eventually revealed the agent in most herds. The study
mentioned in the quote involved a single sample of 60 fecals from each of
25 beef herds.(4) In this same paper it was reported that O157 was found in
5 of 60 dairy herds. Yet, O157 was detected in 4 of 8 of the initially
negative herds which were subsequently followed with monthly sampling.(4).
A study in which 60 fecals were collected monthly for 6 months in each of
36 dairy herds found at least one O157 positive fecal in 27 (75%) of
herds.(5) Longitudinal sampling of individual cattle indicates that O157
can rarely be detected in the feces of individual cattle for more than a
month or two and that the cattle fecally positive for O157 regularly change
(within a herd) on a month-month basis.(6) Thus it would be erroneous to
infer that the low prevalence is due to the existence of a few carrier
animals in each herd that are consistently positive over time.
5. As to the point "_E. coli_ appears to be a seasonal problem. One British
study showed there was a higher percentage of cattle shedding _E. coli_ in
their feces in April and May. In Canada, a similar study showed more
incidents occurred in May to July, which is also barbecue season, according
to Doug Viera." Two different British studies (7,8) have shown a seasonal
effect (higher in warmer months) as has one in the NW USA.(3) The pattern
of O157-associated disease shows a similar pattern in humans in
England/Wales (9) and in the USA.(10) The pattern of human disease, as the
quote may be suggesting, has been commonly attributed to barbecue season
and the presumed increase in cooking/cross contamination problems; but this
is speculative and, to this writer's knowledge, unsupported with any hard
data.
On a more scientific level, the close parallel between seasonal O157
shedding in cattle and O157-associated disease humans--observed repeatedly
in different areas--is more than a little suggestive of a causal
relationship. The reasons for the seasonal distribution of O157 shedding in
cattle are being investigated in at least two sites. In the NW USA, we are
pursuing the hypothesis that moist, mixed feeds support robust growth of
O157 (as well as salmonella) which greatly increases exposure doses at
temperatures above approximately 23-25C.. We have preliminary data (11)
which supports this hypothesis and suggests that certain naturally
occurring or added organic acids can control O157 growth in feeds. Both the
NW group (Besser, Lejeune, Rice, Hancock, et al) and a Wisconsin research
group (Kaspar, Luchansky, Shere, Faith, et al) are investigating the role
of water troughs; maintenance and seasonal proliferation of O157 in
sediments/biofilms could potentially explain the seasonal pattern.
