The board of the organization of Médicos Unidos de Venezuela [MUV/United Physicians of Venezuela] reports cases of leishmaniasis and other diseases in the rural areas of Lara state.

They indicate that patients could not be treated with the urgency required, since the health personnel has not been able to move due to lack of fuel for transportation.

Dr Luzmila Leal, director of the MUV, added that health programs have slowed down. Likewise, the epidemiologists consulted by that institution have confirmed that there are cases of leishmaniasis in Duaca, Sanare, and Macuto; and that the disease has been there for many years.

However, lately, there have been reports of infected people in the town of La Ruezga in Barquisimeto. Despite this, health personnel has not been able to provide care and implement a control program. "The official agencies have not been able to send staff to critical sites, due to the lack of transportation and fuel," said MUV. Leal explained that "it is not that the programs have been paralyzed, but that they have been slowed down.

[ProMED thanks Mahmour Orabi for communicating this news. For specific data on leishmaniasis in Venezuela, see supplement 98 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.s098) in Alvar J et al. 2012 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22693548/).

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is mainly an occupational disease, affecting, among others, farmers, hunters, and military personnel. It occurs throughout the Venezuelan territory, in 22 municipalities, and it can be considered as both a rural and an urban disease. The incidence is estimated at 9.9 per 100 000 inhabitants. Visceral leishmaniasis occurs sporadically, with very low endemicity, in almost all states, but there are 4 major foci in central, western, southern, and eastern Venezuela. The annual average incidence from 1990 to 2007 was 0.2 per 100 000 persons. - Mod.EP
