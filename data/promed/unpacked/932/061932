Malaysian bird flu jumps quarantine zone
--------------------------------------------------
Malaysia has detected 3 new outbreaks of bird flu in its northeastern
state of Kelantan, one of which is outside a quarantine zone around
the first village hit by the deadly virus, officials said.
The discovery of the disease outside the 10 kilometre (6.2 mile)
quarantine area is a worrying new development for veterinary
department officials, who had given assurances that the outbreak was
contained within the zone.
"The new case is outside the quarantine area in Kuchelong village. 5
birds had signs of the disease. Authorities will cull birds in the
infected area immediately," said Hawari Hussein, director-general of
the veterinary department.
Hawari said the disease was also detected in 2 villages within the
quarantine zone around the settlement where the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus, responsible for 28 human deaths in Asia so far in 2004, was
1st discovered in August.
Some 579 birds have been culled in the 2 villages, and Hawari said
authorities were carrying out house-to-house surveillance and
conducting tests to find out whether the virus had spread to other
areas.
A 26-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl from one of the villages
were admitted to hospital for observation after developing coughs and
flu-like symptoms, said the director of the Health Ministry's Disease
Control Division, Ramlee Rahmat.
"They have a history of contact with the dying chickens," he said.
Officials announced Monday that the entire state of Kelantan was
under intensive monitoring after 3 new outbreaks were announced over
the weekend. More than 200 officers conducted clinical checks at wet
markets, bird sanctuaries and pet shops.
Officials say the disease was first brought into Malaysia by fighting
cocks that had been exposed to the virus in Thailand and that the new
outbreaks were caused by the continued smuggling of chicken meat.
[This statement is in need of substantiation; it is generally agreed
that chicken meat is less likely to play a role in the dissemination
of the virus among avians than are live animals. - Mod.AS]
Malaysia is seeking an urgent meeting with Thai authorities to
discuss measures to combat the spread of the virus.
Thailand has been criticised by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
for not doing enough to monitor birds capable of carrying the deadly
avian flu virus following the kingdom's 9th human death last week.
The WHO fears that the H5N1 virus could mutate into a highly
contagious form that triggers a global human flu pandemic.
