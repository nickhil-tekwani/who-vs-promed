The vice minister of public health, Antonio Barrios, in an interview
indicated that there were 15 confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases in the
country, and 3 fatalities from this disease. He advised that this week
[week of 24 Feb 2008] that [YF] vaccinations will be done without charge in
he private hospitals in Asuncion [the capital of Paraguay. - Mod. TY].

"Yesterday [24 Feb 2008] the number of confirmed YF cases reached 15, with
2 additional people [infected] from the risk zone of San Lorenzo. The
number of deaths has not changed, 3 confirmed up to the present," Dr
Antonio Barrios, vice minister of health confirmed this morning [25 Feb
2008]. Vaccination will be continued in all the hospital centers throughout
the country.

Barrios indicated, moreover, that Laurelty is considered a zone of high
risk [of YF virus infection] and so work to block the disease will proceed
there, with the intention of vaccinating 100 per cent of the population.

In addition, the subsecretary of state announced that early this Sunday
morning [24 Feb 2008] 2 million doses of YF vaccine arrived in the country,
and will begin to be distributed in the afternoon, announced Antonio
Barrios. He said, also, that with the 400 000 additional doses which will
be arriving during the week, there will be sufficient [vaccine] for the
population, above all to cover 100 per cent of [people in YF] risk zones
and border areas of the country.

[These report include one more YF death than our post of 23 Feb 2008
(archive no. 20080223.0739) and indicates that nearly one million people
have been vaccinated, out of a population in Paraguay of about 6.5 million,
in a relatively short period. We hope that the arrival and administration
of the new shipments of YF vaccine will quickly bring this outbreak to a
halt. Further information is awaited with interest. A map of Paraguay can
