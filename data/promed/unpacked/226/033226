US residents of low-income, crowded, and racially diverse communities had outsized rates of death, heart attack, stroke, and new-onset heart failure when hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19, according to an abstract on preliminary study results to be presented at the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on [13 to 15 Nov 2021].

A team led by Emory University researchers used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to identify US poor and diverse US communities. The index ranks communities based on socioeconomic status, household composition and disability status, racial group and primary language, and housing type and transportation resources.

The team also mined the AHA's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry for data on 20 925 infected adults admitted to 107 hospitals from [14 Jan to 30 Nov 2020]. Roughly 40% of patients lived in communities in the poorest areas of the United States.

Of the 20 925 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6083 (29.1%) lived in the most deprived US communities (the highest national quartile of the SVI). Compared with those in more affluent areas, patients in the highest quartile were younger (average age, 59.8 vs 62 years), more likely to be women (47.1% vs 43.2%) and Black (36.1% vs 13.3%), and less likely to have private health insurance (29% vs 39.1%).

Regardless of age, sex, race, insurance status, and underlying illnesses, relative to more affluent areas, people living in poorer areas were more likely to have major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and new-onset heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 1.28, or a 28% higher risk) and in-hospital death (OR, 1.37, or a 37% higher risk).

In an AHA news release, the researchers noted that although previous studies have shown that racial minorities and those from socially vulnerable neighborhoods have poorer COVID-19 outcomes, only limited research has been conducted into whether hospitalized coronavirus patients from vulnerable communities had more complications or worse outcomes than those from less deprived areas.

"Unfortunately, I'm not surprised by the findings of this research," Michelle Albert, MD, MPH, president-elect of the AHA (who was not involved in the study), said in the release. "Getting into the why, how, and which social factors are most consequential in affecting health and then putting our patients in contact with the resources to help them are key for health care professionals."

Albert said that reducing health disparities will require a range of solutions, including community relationship building, increasing the diversity of the healthcare workforce, and strengthening research funding and clinical care focused on addressing the social determinants of health.

"These solutions will require sustained efforts over time; there's a lot of work to be done," she said.

"While this study was not focused on the root cause of health disparities and social determinants of health, the American Heart Association's 2020 Presidential Advisory, "Call to Action: Structural Racism as a Fundamental Driver of Health Disparities," specifically identifies structural racism as a cause, both in the past and presently, for persistent health disparities in the U.S. Structural racism is defined as the normalization and legitimization of an array of dynamics - historical, cultural, institutional and interpersonal - that routinely advantage white people while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color."

Addressing the disparities is "going to take a multi-pronged approach of societal solutions, such as building community relationships, increasing diversity in the health care workforce, and strengthening research funding and clinical care focused on social factors and their impact on health. These solutions will require sustained efforts over time; there's a lot of work to be done' said Michelle A. Albert, president-elect of the American Heart Association, and professor of medicine, associate dean of admissions and director of the CeNter for the StUdy of AdveRsiTy and CardiovascUlaR DiseasE (NURTURE Center) at the University of California, San Francisco. - Mod.LK]

[2] US: travel ban lifted and other US developments

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/11/us-lifts-covid-19-travel-ban-20-months-after-it-began


Today [Mon 8 Nov 2021] for the first time since [March 2020], foreigners visiting the United States for nonessential travel will be allowed to cross air and land borders if they prove they are vaccinated against COVID-19 and can demonstrate a recent negative test for the virus.

The United States will recognize full vaccination with any of the vaccines approved for use by the World Health Organization. Negative tests will need to have been procured within 72 hours of a flight or crossing into the United States.

For thousands of Canadians and Mexicans, the lifted ban will allow families to reunite after almost 2 years apart. The American tourism industry is also set to get a boost during the upcoming holiday season; the US Travel Association estimated a loss of nearly USD 300 billion in foreign spending and 1 million US jobs due to the travel bans.

The new rules apply to citizens of 33 countries, including China, India, and nations in the European Union. Children (under 18 years) are exempt from the vaccination requirements but must show a negative test taken within 1 day of travel.

Fed workers seek vaccine exemptions
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of federal workers have requested exemption on religious grounds from the Biden administration's vaccine mandate, the Washington Post reports. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-workers-vaccines-exemptions/2021/11/07/761eb9d8-3da3-11ec-8ee9-4f14a26749d1_story.html]

Federal employees and contractors have until [22 Nov 2021] to be fully vaccinated, which means today [Mon 8 Nov 2021] is the last day to get either a single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine or a 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine, and then allow 2 weeks for immunity to build.

According to federal union officials who spoke to the Washington Post, only around 60 people at the Education Department have requested religious or philosophical exemptions, compared with thousands of employees at the Bureau of Prisons.

In related news, a federal appeals court this weekend temporarily halted the Biden administration's vaccine requirement for businesses with 100 or more workers, the Associated Press reports. That requirement is set to go into effect on [4 Jan 2022]. [https://apnews.com/article/appeals-court-stays-vaccine-mandate-coronavirus-biden-b235b6fa858bd23b02ab5f9c009428db]

The 5th Circuit Court, based in New Orleans, said it was delaying the requirement because of potential "grave statutory and constitutional issues" raised by the plaintiffs.

Officials from the Justice Department said they "will vigorously defend this rule in court."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows that 58.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 67.4% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 12.4% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

Other US developments
- The Biden administration sent letters to school superintendents and principals across the United States today [Mon 8 Nov 2021], urging them to set up COVID-19 clinics inside their elementary schools, according to ABC News.
[https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=81030970#81031434]
- The country reported 21 968 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [Sun 7 Nov 2021] and 119 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

[At least 27 states filed lawsuits challenging the vaccine mandate rule in several circuits. Vaccine mandates have become a very divisive issue. The administration's position is that OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) has the authority "to act quickly in an emergency where the agency finds that workers are subjected to a grave danger and a new standard is necessary to protect them," (U.S. Labor Department's top legal adviser, Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said).

A spokesman for the Justice Department, Anthony Coley, said in a statement: "The OSHA emergency temporary standard is a critical tool to keep America's workplaces safe as we fight our way out of this pandemic.

However, the opposing opinion is that "The president will not impose medical procedures on the American people without the checks and balances afforded by the constitution," said a statement from Landry, a Republican.

This disagreement comes at a time that cases top 250 million globally. - see next report.

[3] Cases top 250 million globally and more global headlines

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/11/global-covid-19-total-tops-250-million-infections


Over the weekend, the global total topped 250 million cases as delta (B1617.2) variant activity fuels fresh surges in Europe and keeps countries on other continents on an uncertain path heading into winter.

The notable global high mark for infections comes about a week after the world passed 5 million deaths and as the pandemic's 2-year mark approaches.

At a World Health Organization (WHO) media briefing on [4 Nov 2021], the group's COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, said virus activity is rising in places where it shouldn't be--in countries with ample vaccine and tools to fight the pandemic.

She urged world leaders and health officials to channel their grief and anger over the pandemic's grim totals into actions to bring transmission under control and cut severe impacts and deaths.

"The trajectory of the pandemic is in our hands. It has always been in our hands. What happens now and into 2022 is up to us," she said.

In Europe, currently the world's main hot spot, Russia's week-long work stoppage designed to curb virus transmission has ended, but cases are still near record daily highs.

Meanwhile, Germany's 7-day incidence rate climbed to its highest level of the pandemic, according to the latest update from the Robert Koch Institute. Health officials are facing the prospect of postponing some surgeries, and some regions are already transferring patients to cope with increased burden on hospitals from COVID-19 patients.

More global headlines
---------------------
- Costa Rica on [5 Nov 2021] announced mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for children ages 5 and older, one of the first countries to do so, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rica-issues-covid-19-vaccine-requirement-children-2021-11-06/]

- New Zealand today [Mon 8 Nov 2021] announced the end of COVID-19 restrictions for Auckland, the country's main hot spot that has been in lockdown since the middle of August [2021]. So far, about 90% of the eligible population has received at least one vaccine dose, according to the New York Times. The country has moved away from a "zero COVID" policy as it continues to track the outbreak, which recently passed the daily total of 200 cases for the first time.

- The global totals today [Mon 8 Nov 2021] reached 250 224 441 cases, and 5 054 028 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/]

[4] Rheumatology patients: persistent symptoms
Date: Mon 8 Nov 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/11/news-scan-nov-08-2021


Over half of adults diagnosed as having a rheumatologic disease reported persistent COVID-19 symptoms at least a month after recovery from their infection, according to survey results presented late last week at the virtual American College of Rheumatology annual meeting.

A news release from the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City described the study, in which researchers emailed surveys to 7505 men and women 18 years and older who had been treated for rheumatologic conditions at the hospital from 2018 to 2020.

Among 2572 survey respondents, nearly 56% who said they tested positive for COVID-19 reported symptoms lasting 1 month or more, including loss of taste or smell, muscle aches, and difficulty concentrating. Patients who smoked, took corticosteroids, or had a chronic condition such as diabetes or congestive heart failure were at particularly high risk for long-haul symptoms.

Only 2 patients reported pre-existing fibromyalgia, a condition that produces symptoms similar to those of long-haul COVID-19. "Our findings do not suggest that symptoms of fibromyalgia are being misinterpreted as long haul COVID in patients with rheumatic diseases, which is something that has been raised as a possibility," senior study author Lisa Mandl, MD, MPH, said in the release.

Lead author Medha Barbhaiya, MD, MPH, said that understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 in this population is critical. "For rheumatology patients, long-haul COVID may be particularly challenging, as these patients already have significant chronic health issues and warrants further investigation," she said.

The researchers plan to use the data in a longitudinal analysis to determine if lingering COVID-19 symptoms interact with or aggravate rheumatologic conditions.
