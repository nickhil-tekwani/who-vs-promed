A child suffering from Japanese encephalitis died today [14 Jul 2015] at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital [NBMCH], taking the death toll from the dreaded disease to 24 in North Bengal since January [2015].

The boy, under treatment at the hospital in Siliguri for the past several days, died at the hospital, NBMCH acting Superintendent Nirmal Bera said.

He said 14 persons have died of the mosquito-borne disease since 1 Jul [2015] at the hospital. A total of 24 have died since the outbreak of the disease in the 1st week of January 2015, Bera added.

17 persons were currently undergoing treatment, he said, adding that patients were from Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling Hill district areas of the region. Of the 17 afflicted with the disease, 4 were in the paediatrics department.

Meanwhile, Siliguri Mayor Ashok Bhattacharya went around the wards of the hospital and talked to the patients' families. Bhattacharya said that to avert any outbreak of the disease in Siliguri, camps were being set up for collecting blood samples, and people are being asked to dispose of stagnant water and maintain close vigil on cow sheds.

So far, no case has been reported from the Siliguri city area, he added.

[This is the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season in northeastern India. However, the above report does not indicate whether these cases are laboratory confirmed as JEV infections or are due to some other etiologic agent.

As mentioned in previous comments, the encephalitis picture in this region of India is complicated, and reports are often confusing. In the previous report of encephalitis in West Bengal, 6 patients have acute encephalitis, while 3 were diagnosed as JE. The above report attributes 14 deaths to JEV infections. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. No mention is made of the JE virus vaccination status of the cases above or of the population in the affected area. Vaccination is more likely to be effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide abundant _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
