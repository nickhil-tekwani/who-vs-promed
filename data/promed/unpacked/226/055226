Medical workers in [southern Kazakhstan's] Kyzylorda Region have
confirmed the diagnosis of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
a 12-year-old child, the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of
Emergency Situations has said.

According to the source, at 2230 [local time, 1630 GMT] on 7 Jun 2010,
a 12 year-old boy was admitted to the Zhanakorgan district hospital
for infectious diseases near the Akkum station in Kyzylorda Region on
suspicion of having contracted CCHF. Medical workers confirmed the
