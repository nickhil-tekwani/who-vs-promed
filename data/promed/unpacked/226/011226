Contamination of water in the west of San Jose
------------------------------------
The laboratory of the Water and Sanitation system (AyA), the Institute
of Health Investigations (Inisa) and the Costa Rican Institute of
Investigation and Education in Nutrition and Health (Inciensa), agreed
yesterday that Shigella was the disease that affected some 7000
persons 15 days ago.
"The confirmation of this was that the bacteria were isolated from
clinical cases, that is to say, that the ill persons were tested. In
the analyses of the water [the bacteria] were not encountered" said
Gabriela Catarinella, of AyA.
If the bacteria was not found in the water, how does one know that the
water was responsible for the diarrhea and vomiting? The explanation
was given yesterday by Catarinella, Elena Caampos and Hilda Bolanos of
Inciensa.
On 11 & 12 Jul 2001, the aquaduct that carries the water supply
treated in Puente de Mulas, San Antonio de Belen - which supplies the
[the western zone of San Jose] -- was without chlorine, and the water
consumed during 17 hours was contaminated. The bacteria incubated and
3 days later cases began to appear. It was [at the time of the
appearance of the clinical cases of shigellosis] that the samples were
taken from the water supply, but on that day the water supply was no
longer contaminated [presumably the water supply was being chlorinated
again. - Mod.MPP], which is why it was not
possible to isolate Shigella.
Although they will never be able to isolate the bacteria from the
water, because it is now bacteria-free, the specialists of the 3
institutions were sure that Shigella was responsible for the problem,
since it is transmitted through this medium. "The outbreak can
continue, because Shigella can also be transmitted by the oral route
and contact between people; for this reason it is important to
maintain good hygiene," added Campos. The most common symptoms [of
shigellosis] are: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and general malaise.

cheap disinfectant, chlorine, can result in epidemic illness & massive
medical costs. - Mod.JW]
