New record of nephropathia epidemica (HFRS) in Finland
------------------------------------------------------
Nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS), is a rodent-borne disease caused by Puumala
hantavirus (PUUV). The virus was discovered in Finland in 1979, and
has subsequently been found to occur in most areas of Europe. In fact
most of the HFRS in Europe is caused by PUUV. The host is the bank
vole, _Myodes glareolus_ (former _Clethrionomys glareolus_). The host
species is found in the whole of Europe, except in the very North and
in Mediterranean regions. The bank vole is characterized by strong
populations cycles in northern Europe, and by more stable seasonal
dynamics, with mast driven (good seed years of deciduous trees)
outbreaks in the temperate Europe.

Like in many other European countries, HFRS is a notifiable disease
in Finland. According to the records collected by National Public
Health Institute (<http://www3.ktl.fi/>) there were 2300 human cases
in 1999, 2603 in 2002, 2526 in 2005, and now in mid December 2008,
with statistics lagging a bit behind, already a new all-time record
of 2700 cases. The total in 2008 will probably exceed 3000 cases.
Most probably the epidemic will go on still early in 2009 as it did
in 2006 after the autumn 2005 peak when some 700 cases were still
diagnosed in January and February.

Since the late 1990s, the 3-year rodent cycles have been
geographically synchronous in the whole southern half of Finland,
within 150 000 km2, resulting in regular NE epidemic years in the
area where most of the population lives. Earlier the cycles were more
asynchronous geographically. The present vole peak and epidemic as
such were well predicted already a year ago, but the magnitude of the
vole peak is highest in many areas in 20 to 30 year national vole
monitoring by the Finnish Forest Research Institute.

At the moment, bank vole populations are still high, and in our
monthly monitoring of populations of individually marked live
animals, transmission has been efficient in November and early
December, producing a lot of fresh virus carriers for the coming
months. At the moment, around 30-40 percent of the bank voles are
seropositive, and with a careful density estimate of 10-30 bank voles
(range 5-60) per forest hectare, we apparently have at least 100
million bank voles shedding the virus in Southern Finland.

So far, at least 2 fatal cases have been recorded in 2008. As known,
several percent of the hospitalized cases need dialysis. Based on the
population studies it has been estimated that only 20 percent of
infections lead to an acute disease suggesting some 15 000 infections
in 2008. The incidence of disease in 2008 will be around 60/100 000.
