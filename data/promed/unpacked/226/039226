95/235 Maconellicoccus hirsutus a new pest in Grenada and Trinidad
Maconellicoccus hirsutus (pink or Hibiscus mealybug) has newly been
introduced into the Caribbean. It was found in Grenada in November 1994 and
is causing serious damage on ornamentals, vegetables, forest and fruit trees
of economic importance. In addition, it has now been found in Trinidad in
August 1995. An FAO-funded programme has been set up in Grenada to control
the pest with selective insecticides and in the medium term with biological
methods. A parasitoid wasp, Anagyrus hamali is being studied. The aim of
this programme is also to prevent further spread of the pink mealybug in the
Caribbean region and Latin America. This pest is present in Africa, Asia
and Oceania and is extremely polyphagous. It is felt that M. hirsutus
should be considered of quarantine importance for the Caribbean and Latin
America region.
