Killer Hendra virus outbreak in Brisbane
----------------------------------------
A property on Brisbane's bayside has been placed into quarantine
after a confirmed outbreak of Hendra virus. Biosecurity Queensland
says 3 horses at a veterinary practice tested have positive to the
virus, one has died and another has been put down this evening [8 Jul
2008]. Biosecurity Queensland's chief vet Ron Glanville says the
virus is rare but can also be spread to humans and the property has
been locked down. "There are a number of other horses there so we
have quarantined the premises and are doing a detailed investigation
to determine what has actually gone on there and also carrying out
disinfections," he said. "We don't want the infection to spread to
other horses or people."

In 1994, the virus claimed the lives of high-profile trainer Vic Rail
and 13 horses.

[In 1994, in Australia, a fatal infection in horses and humans was
identified to be caused by a new paramyxovirus, Hendra virus, and in
1998 in Malaysia, a closely related virus, Nipah virus, was
responsible for fatal infections in pigs and humans. These 2 viruses
were sufficiently different from previously described paramyxoviruses
to rank as a new genus, _Henipavirus_. A 2nd case of equine Hendra
virus infection in Queensland, Australia, was described in 2007 (see
ProMED-mail references below).

The natural reservoir of these viruses is the fruit bat (_Pteropus)_,
which is found in regions extending from the western Pacific to the
eastern coast of Africa. Serological studies have established that as
many as half the fruit bats in colonies throughout these regions may
have antibodies against this virus genus.

Hendra virus was first isolated in 1994 from specimens obtained
during an outbreak of respiratory and neurologic disease in horses
and humans in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In
that outbreak 3 human cases of Hendra virus disease were recognized.
Two of the 3 individuals known to be infected had a respiratory
illness with severe flu-like signs and symptoms. Consequently people
who have contact with body fluids or excretions of horses infected
with Hendra virus are at risk of contracting Hendra virus disease.
One of the 3 Hendra virus infections was marked by a delayed onset of
progressive encephalitis. Two of the 3 human patients infected with
Hendra virus died.

A recent study of the dynamics of Hendra virus infection in its
reservoir hosts (species of the flying fox _Pteropus_) by Plowright
et al. (Proc Biol Sci. 2008 Apr 7; 275(1636): 861-9; abstract
available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18198149>) suggests
that environmental processes that alter flying fox food sources, such
as habitat loss and climate change, may increase Hendra virus
infection and transmission, and promote its spill over into other
susceptible species.
