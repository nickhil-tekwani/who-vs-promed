There have been 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the United Kingdom
(UK), all linked to travel to Corfu [Greece] since August [2011],
according to the Health Protection Agency [HPA]. However, the HPA
cannot rule out a UK source of the infections and is still
investigating. It is advising people to be aware of the symptoms of
Legionnaires' disease if they are going to the Greek island.

The illness can lead to severe pneumonia and is sometimes fatal.
Symptoms can take up to 2 weeks to develop after infection and
generally start as a "flu-like" illness. It can be treated with
antibiotics. The bacteria that cause the disease cannot be spread from
person to person. They can live in water so cooling systems, showers
and taps are common sources of infection.

Prof Nick Phin, from the Legionnaires' disease department at the HPA,
said: "We are concerned that UK residents travelling to Corfu should
be aware of this potential risk, however we are not suggesting that
people change their holiday plans. We are continuing our
investigations so we that can provide the best advice for travellers
and minimise the risk of further cases. We will also assist the Greek
Public Health authorities in their investigations into a possible
source or sources within Corfu."

General practitioners (GPs) in the UK are also being told to keep an
eye out for patients with the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease.
