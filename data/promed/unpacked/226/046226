[While the two conditions - sea lion deaths and coastal marine deaths - may
be of a common cause, I have split them to reduce reader confusion. Members
are strongly advised to get out an atlas to see where these places are
along the NZ east coast. - Mod.MHJ
Hot weather blamed for sealife deaths, Diane Keenan and Seth Robson [edited
The disturbing developments on the New Zealand east coast in the past week
include:
[1 Reports of mysterious deaths of seals, crayfish, octopuses, and
shellfish at Kaikoura.
[2 Toxic algae confirmed as causing health problems such as sore throats
and nose and eye irritations in beach goers in the Wairarapa.
[3 Dead and dying fish washed up along the Wairarapa coast.
[4 Public health officials have closed the coasts of Great Barrier Island
to shellfish-gathering after detecting a poison that can cause paralysis.
Bob McDavitt, of the MetService, said that the weather pattern of El Nino
was a factor in the emergence of toxic algae in coastal areas. "We're going
for the mother of all El Ninos this summer, so it wouldn't surprise us if
it also produced algae blooms."
Canterbury Health yesterday tested for algal bloom off the Kaikoura coast
after reports of dead seals, crayfish, octopuses, and shellfish. The
National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research was taking samples
from the dead octopuses washed up along the coast. Divers have reported
dead kina (sea eggs) and crayfish off the Kaikoura Peninsula. Department of
Conservation staff are investigating the Kaikoura reports. DOC Kaikoura
field centre supervisor Mike Morrissey said two dead seals had been found
near Kaikoura on Wednesday and tissue samples had been sent to Massey
University for testing.
Further south, a seal separated from its mother was found at Waikuku, along
with a dead adult seal. Mr Morrissey said there were about 3000 seals along
the Kaikoura coast and some occasionally died of natural causes. However,
the testing of the pair of dead seals was to ensure there was no connection
with the dead New Zealand (Hooker) sea lions that were discovered last week
at the Auckland Islands.
Mr Morrissey said he went diving off Kaikoura at the weekend and did not
find any dead crayfish. "But I cannot think of any reason why kina would be
lying upside down on the bottom unless they were suffering from an
infection," he said.
Stress from hot weather killed an endangered adult female albatross and her
chick at Taiaroa Head near Dunedin yesterday. DOC staff used fire hoses to
spray nesting birds every two hours to keep them cool from high temperatures.
