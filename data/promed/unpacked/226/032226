1st report of ear soft rot of corn (_Zea mays_) caused by _Burkholderia
gladioli_ in the United States
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the summer of 2005, an uncharacterized disease was observed on sweet
corn commercially grown in Sunflower County, Mississippi. Initial symptoms
developing at the base of the ear on interior husk leaves were brown,
water-soaked, irregular lesions. These gradually enlarged up to 10 cm (3.9
in) in diameter. Market value was significantly affected when the corn ears
had visible symptoms of this disease. Bacterial cell streaming was observed
at a magnification of 675 times from the diseased husk. A bacterium was
consistently isolated from lesions.
Isolates MS102 and MS103, which were chosen for further characterization,
were Gram negative, and biochemical characteristics were the same as those
described previously for _Burkholderia gladioli_. Confirmation was made by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the nearly complete 16S rRNA
gene (1471 base pairs). DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the 16S
rRNA gene of the bacterium shared highest identities (99.4 to 99.6 per
cent) with that of 3 _B. gladioli_ strains. A product (approximately 300
bp) characteristic of _B. gladioli_ also was obtained from both isolates
using species-specific PCR.
To confirm pathogenicity, cell suspensions of the isolates were injected
into interior husk leaves of field-grown sweet corn. Control corn ear husks
were injected with phosphate buffer. After 3 days, ear rot symptoms were
observed on all plants inoculated with the isolates but not those injected
with phosphate buffer. Cell suspension of isolates dropped on non-wounded
husks also incited the same symptoms as those inoculated with a syringe.
Koch's postulates were fulfilled with reisolation from the inoculated
tissues. The identity of the reisolated pathogen was proved by sequencing
the 16S rRNA gene.
This disease was previously reported in Brazil. To our knowledge, this is
the 1st report of _B. gladioli_ causing a disease of corn in the United
States. Although the impact of this disease was not observed from 2005 to
2006 because of dry weather and rotation to other crops in the affected
field, there is a potential that the bacterium could become established in
corn-producing areas as a member of the corn ear rot complex if
environmental conditions are favorable.

[_B. gladioli_ (formerly _Pseudomonas gladioli_ or _P. marginata_) was
initially described in 1921 as a soil inhabiting phytopathogen of gladioli
and other flowers. It causes, for example, bulb soft rot of onion; scab,
soft and corm rots of gladiolus, iris, freesia, and other flower crops;
soft rot of orchids with up to 50 per cent loss; grain rot, panicle blight,
and leaf-sheath browning of rice plants (sometimes together with other
species in the genus). The pathogen is spread in soil and water, by
mechanical means (including on insects), and with infected plant material.
Disease management includes the use of clean planting material and cultural
practices such as frequent disinfection of tools, insect control, and
reduction of free moisture in plantings.
_B. gladioli_ is a heterogeneous species with phenotypic and genetic
variability and has been divided into 3 pathovars (pv. _gladioli_, pv.
_alliicola_ and pv. _agaricicola_) based on their host ranges. Strains
assisting in nitrogen fixation have been found in the rhizospheres of a
number of cereals and sugarcane. Some strains are nematode and fungal
antagonists and can be used in biocontrol (for example for _Fusarium_
species); some strains are plant growth promoters. Strains producing human
toxins or associated with infections in humans have also been reported.
A number of fungal pathogens causing ear and stalk rots are known for
maize. Bacterial stalk and ear rots are less frequent and may be caused by
one of several species that live as saprophytes on plant debris in the
soil, for example _Erwinia_ species. They are sometimes found in maize
crops after accidental flooding. However, such a trigger is not being
reported here and may not be needed for _B. gladioli_ ear rot.
