Just to give a brief follow up of a previous message on a measles outbreak
in the Netherlands.
First notified case in June 1999 (in retrospect also 5 cases in April
1999). Up to today (3 Sep 1999) 235 cases reported, 39 laboratory confirmed
(IgM/PCR). Most cases (126) in the age group 6-10 years. The outbreak is
limited to the group of people that refrain from vaccination on religious
grounds, but some transmission to others has occurred.
Two cases (both 7 years old) were vaccinated once (MMR)
[measles/mumps/rubella, 1 unknown vaccination status, 232 cases
unvaccinated. Of these unvaccinated cases 16 were in infants under the age
of 14 months (the age for MMR in the Netherlands).
In 2 infants the parents did not belong to the religious group.
We were informed by the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver that we
have exported the virus by airplane to Canada, where by now the Dutch index
[case, his Canadian sister and her two children are notified with measles.
