The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the death of a Canada goose as a result of avian influenza H5N1.

The CFIA is now advising poultry farmers to be vigilant and to apply biosecurity measures at all times.

Since the confirmation of the case, a hobby farm located in Porters Lake has lost nearly their entire flock -- 59 of 60 birds within the past week.

"I'm devastated by this. They were my pets." says the owner of the small hobby farm located outside of Halifax.

The virus can be transmitted between humans and animals, although that is rare.
