Eight people have died and a further 59 have been hospitalised after drinking homemade alcohol in Iran's southern port city of Bandar Abbas [Hormozgan province].

According to the Iranian news outlet, Peykeiren, 17 people are in intensive care and connected to a ventilator, Dr Fatemeh Nowruzian, the spokesperson of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, said on Monday night [2 May 2022].

Nowruzian also warned of the possibility of a new outbreak of alcohol poisoning, saying people should refrain from drinking any alcohol.

Last year [2021], Hormozgan University reported the poisoning of 19 people and the death of at least one person a week in the province.

The number of people dying due to alcohol poisoning has increased since 2020 when more than 700 people died in Iran after drinking beverages containing methanol after thinking it could cure COVID-19.

Police have arrested 8 people on suspicion of producing and distributing alcohol, which is strictly forbidden in the Islamic Republic.

According to Timur Dolatiari, the police commander in Bandar Abbas, police officers "discovered 1278 litres of alcohol during a search of the homes of the detainees," adding that 2 of these people "were also consumers and were hospitalised".

The addition of the toxin, methanol in alcoholic drinks has been linked to the rising number of alcohol poisoning cases. The ingredient, which is odourless and tasteless and normally found in anti-freeze, is sometimes added to homemade spirits to increase their strength.

Even in small amounts, drinking anything containing methanol can result in blindness or death.

Officials in Bandar Abbas did not identify the toxic substance causing the alcohol poisoning.

[Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick until sometime after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Wood alcohol is also known as methanol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 0.3-1 g/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid, early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH [alcohol dehydrogenase], but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10-20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of its high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL [1 oz] of methanol ingested; (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL; (3) observation of visual complications; and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.

Anecdotal reports of other potentially harmful "home remedies" for COVID-19 being sold or touted as a cure on the internet or by someone wishing to make a quick profit remind us that education of the general public and responsible messaging are more important now than ever.
