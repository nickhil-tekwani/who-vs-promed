Porthmadog is not a veterinary service, despite the appearance of the name.
Welsh colleagues will hopefully forgive the simplistic English
pronunciation of the name as something usually resembling "Port Madock."
This is situated in the county of Gwynedd, pronounced "Gwynneth." This is a
county in North Wales where Welsh is spoken extensively.

Now hold on just a second......
[ From a previous post : The pilot scheme will operate for 1 year before a
decision is taken on whether to extend it. Only cats and dogs traveling to
specified Western European countries are eligible. The animals must be
injected with an identifying microchip, vaccinated against rabies,
blood-tested and issued with a certificate. They must also be checked by a
veterinarian in the country they visit and vaccinated against tapeworm and
ticks not more than 48 hours and not less than 24 hours before returning to
Britain. Animals can also be subject to spot-checks by ministry
veterinarians on British soil, and may be sent into quarantine if illnesses
develop.
I know there is a vaccine against _Echinococcus granulosus_, the only human
important parasite of dogs, but I do not know of a vaccine against the
other tapeworms of dogs. So what is the scientific justification for
testing for other tapeworms, and ticks. It does seem to me this is a
non-tariff barrier erected by the UK.

[I too wondered about this statement and am hoping someone in the UK can
give us a better explanation of this statement. Thanks for bringing it more
into focus. - Mod. TG
[For the interested reader, there are many other parasitic infections which
dogs have been documented to transmit to humans, including _Toxocara
canis_, T. cati_, _Trichuris vulpis_, _Ancylostoma braziliense_, _A.
caninum_, _Uncinaria stenocephala_, _Taenia (Multiceps) multiceps_, and
even a case report of transmission of _Strongyloides stercoralis_. Dogs can
also serve as reservoirs of parasites such as _Dirofilaria immitis_ and
_Leishmania_ species that can be transmitted to humans via arthropods. -
