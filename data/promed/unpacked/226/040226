The Health Ministry has called on everyone over the age of 6 -- especially pregnant women and people of all ages with chronic diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or Down syndrome -- to get a flu shot, following the death of a 54 year old woman from H1N1 (swine) flu at the Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Campus in Petah Tikva on Thu [24 Dec 2015].

The woman, who was first hospitalized a month ago at Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba, was transferred to Beilinson to undergo special treatment with a device designed to keep the heart and lungs working until they can recover. She had a chronic illness, but had not gone this year to her health fund clinic to receive the vaccine, which contains protection against the strain.

The ministry stressed that "it's not too late to be vaccinated. Go now," the representative said. Unfortunately, the percentage of people who have been vaccinated so far in 2015 is lower than during 2014, apparently due to the relatively dry and pleasant weather during the day. The current wave of terrorism also may be keeping people in their homes.

The ministry said there have been 11 patients so far this season to be diagnosed with serious cases of swine flu. 3 were hospitalized at Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center, 3 at Soroka, 2 at Tel Hashomer's Sheba Medical Center, 1 each at Hadassah-University Medical Center in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem and Mount Scopus, and 1 at Tel Aviv's Sourasky Medical Center.

Children of all ages are also at higher risk of suffering complications from the flu. Free vaccinations are available from health fund clinics. Every winter, several hundred people -- mostly elderly or people with chronic illnesses -- die of flu complications, but the public tends to be apathetic. About half of hospital doctors do not get the shot at work, even though it is free and the virus in it is killed and cannot cause the flu.

The 3 others being treated at Soroka are all pregnant women. The condition of 2 of the women has improved since their admission; they are being kept in isolation at the hospital. The 3rd woman is in the intensive care unit of the hospital, in serious condition. Due to the severity of her state, the hospital delivered her baby by cesarean section on Wed [23 Dec 2015]. The infant was in satisfactory condition and was transferred to Soroka's premature baby unit. A 4th woman, 57 years old, was diagnosed at Soroka with swine flu and is in a serious condition. She is on a respirator at the hospital.

None of the 4 women had received the vaccination against the flu.

[Influenza A(H1N1) virus is also referred to as Influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus (pH1N1) because it caused a flu pandemic in 2009-2010 that claimed several hundred lives. The influenza virus leads to respiratory disease that results in a variety of symptoms in humans, including nasal secretions, barking cough and decreased appetite. Seasonal reassortment and re-emergence of the virus leads to severe and untreatable infections, causing the generation of drug-resistant strains and antigenic shift, which can influence viral entry into cells, transmission and tissue tropism.

Because pigs are an important reservoir for influenza A viruses, acting as an intermediary host for both interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment, the virus is commonly referred to as "swine flu", which is really a misnomer. It is important for the public to understand that while H1N1 circulates in pigs, they are not critical to transmission to humans, and in fact, the virus is more commonly seasonally transmitted person-to-person. Most importantly, disease can be prevented by vaccination with a killed vaccine, which presents no danger to recipients. - Mod.LK

Israel's public shares a view which, I believe, also prevails in other countries (US?), attributing this seasonal flu virus -- because of its name "swine flu" -- to a disease in pigs. An informative source is at http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h1n1/. In fact it is infectious among humans, swine presently playing a negligible role if any. The public should know that H1N1 is included in the current HUMAN vaccine.

Initially the virus was named "influenza A/H1N1pdm09" (ProMED-mail. Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009, animal (38): Mexico, swine, OIE 20091211.4214). For various considerations, the name of this virus, which initially caused a major outbreak in Mexico in 2009, was changed to "A/H1N1(swine)". This year's vaccination coverage, in Israel, has been, as of Fri 25 Dec 2015, 18 per cent of the population, compared with 21 per cent for the same period in 2014. The vaccine, according to MOH statement, is satisfactorily protective against the named strain. - Mod.AS
