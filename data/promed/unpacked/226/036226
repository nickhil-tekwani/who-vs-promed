Bird flu found in 2 more Thai provinces
-------------------------------------------
A strain of bird flu that can be deadly to humans has been detected
in 2 more Thai provinces, livestock officials said, bringing to 6 the
number of provinces affected by the disease.
The H5N1 virus was detected in locally bred chickens in the northern
provinces of Nakhon Sawan and Uttaradit last week [final week of
January 2005], the livestock department said in a statement.
An outbreak was confirmed on 24 Jan 2005 in the Pichai district of
Uttaradit, where 78 chickens died of the flu and 22 others were
culled to prevent the disease from spreading, the department said.
Another outbreak was confirmed 28 Jan 2005 in Nakhon Sawan's Krok
Phra district, where 37 chickens died. Both areas were placed under
21-day surveillance.
12 people have died in Thailand from the virus that has swept Asia
since December 2003.
Thailand has been under high alert for bird flu, since the deadly
H5N1 strain of the virus was detected in chickens and fighting cocks
in the provinces of Phitsanulok, Rayong, and Nakhon Pathom.
The disease was also detected in pigeons in the central Thai province
of Uthai Thani, where more than 400 pigeons were culled.
Thailand's cabinet last week [final week of January 2005] endorsed a
THB 4.8 billion (USD 124.7 million) scheme to fight bird flu.

Bird flu under strict scrutiny
-----------------------------
Bird flu has spread to 31 cities and provinces nationwide, with more
than one million poultry culled, according to the Veterinary
Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on
Sunday [30 Jan 2005].
In the past 2 days, outbreaks were reported in Ninh Binh, Phu Tho and
Hai Phong in the north. In Ninh Binh province, the virus was detected
in a flock of 10 chickens owned by a farmer in Ninh Xuan commune, Hoa
Lu district. In Phu Tho province, samples taken from a flock of 100
chickens from Dong Thinh commune, Yen Lap district, tested positive
for H5N1. Outbreaks were also reported in Kien Thuy, Vinh Bao and An
Lao districts of Hai Phong city, with nearly 450 chickens and ducks
dying or being destroyed.
As a result, since 1 Jan 2005, bird flu has been found in 9 northern
provinces, namely Ha Nam, Ha Noi, Hai Duong, Thai Nguyen, Bac Ninh,
Thai Binh, Phu Tho, Ninh Binh and Hai Phong city.
In the south, 15 more locations in Bac Lieu, Long An, Ben Tre and
Dong Thap provinces reported bird flu last Saturday [29 Jan 2005]. In
Bac Lieu province, the virus was detected in 4 communes of Gia Rai
and Phuoc Long districts.
Meanwhile, the number of flu-hit spots in Long An province fell by
half, to 3 households in Tan Tru district and Tan An town.
*** Southern Hau Giang province has decided to subsidize farmers
whose poultry were killed due to the flu. They will receive between
VND 5000-6500 [USD 0.32 - 0.41] and VND 1000 [USD 0.063] for each
poultry and quail killed, respectively. The province will assist
households to buy new breeds at a reasonable price of VND 2000 [USD
0.13] each.
*** Hanoi's 1st quarantined slaughterhouse was inaugurated on Monday
and will begin operations on Tuesday [1 Feb 2005] at the wholesale
Long Bien market. With a total investment capital of VND 600 million
[USD 38 000], the slaughterhouse is designed to slaughter quarantined
poultry and wrap, seal and provide safe products for sale to local
consumers.
*** HCM City on Sunday [30 Jan 2005] announced that it will purchase
more than 200 000 chickens to kill and reserve to minimize the risk
of spreading the disease. 2/3rds of chicken breeders at a meeting on
Sunday welcomed the initiative, as they complained that they have
found it difficult to sell their products on the market even though
they are flu free.
*** Another H5N1 patient, a 10-year-old from Long An province, died
of the avian strain of the virus at HCM City's Children 1 hospital on
Sunday [30 Jan 2005]. Last Friday, a 14-year-old from Dong Thap
province also died of the virus at the hospital. Another patient from
Tra Vinh province suspected of contracting H5N1 virus was
hospitalized.
Meanwhile, the General Hospital in Da Nang city on Sunday [30 Jan
2005] reported that a 39-year-old male patient had died, and hospital
doctors suspected that he had contracted the H5N1 virus. The hospital
took blood samples and have sent them to the Pasteur Institute in HCM
City for further testing. This is the 1st suspected case of bird flu
infection in the city.
*** The General Hospital of southern Kien Giang province reported on
Sunday [30 Jan 2005] that a 25-year-old Cambodian patient died on
Sunday morning after showing symptoms of avian influenza. Earlier,
her younger sister also died of similar symptoms. 2 weeks ago, the
victims were involved in poultry slaughtering and were hospitalized
with high temperatures and symptoms of pneumonia.
