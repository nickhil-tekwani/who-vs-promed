[1] UK, Vaccination backlash
Date: Sat 19 Sep 2008

A backlash against bluetongue vaccination has seen growing numbers of
producers shelving plans to protect livestock against the virus. Many
farmers, particularly in the north of England, fear that the breeding
ability of stock -- already stressed by the difficult late summer and
autumn weather -- may be adversely affected by the vaccine.

Uptake of the vaccine has been so low that only one in 5 livestock
farms is protected. One group of farmers, who spoke to Farmers
Weekly, admitted that they were "undecided" about using vaccine until
the breeding and sale season was over.

While the farmers were not prepared to be identified, they said
reports about stock deaths following vaccination had done little to
instill confidence in the vaccine. "I've decided to leave my vaccine
in the fridge until the spring," said one Cumbria suckled calf
producer. "I want my cows safely in calf and a crop of calves on the
ground before I start to jab."

Although farmers selling breeding sheep at the big autumn sales have
had the option to jab or leave it to purchasers, many were worried
that buyers were also becoming "nervy." Some buyers preferred gimmer
lambs that had not been vaccinated, a sheep producer told Farmers Weekly.

The doubts over vaccinating were reflected at Penrith livestock
market, which reported that, of 6000 mules through, only 2 batches of
ewes were vaccinated.

Across the Pennines, farmers in Yorkshire also expressed worries.

"It's been the worst summer and autumn we can remember, and stock
have suffered," said a North Yorkshire hill farmer. "If we jab sheep
that are clearly under pressure at a critical time of year, we may be
at risk of dealing ourselves another body blow." In Wales, where the
1st case of bluetongue in imported cattle occurred on a Denbighshire
farm this week, chief veterinary officer Christianne Glossop reported
that the uptake of vaccine had been disappointingly low.

She said that confirmation of the virus in 2 cattle imported to a
farm near Ruthin highlighted the importance of vaccination and the
need for farmers to consider carefully before importing animals from
bluetongue-infected areas. "Over the past few weeks, there have been
too many instances of imported animals testing positive for
bluetongue in England and now in Wales."

Alun Edwards, a local farmer and Farmers Union of Wales office
holder, claimed producers who resisted vaccination were "bloody
idiots," and he questioned the sanity of importing livestock from
infected areas.

[2] Clarification on vaccines efficacy and lab results interpretation
Date: Sat 20 Sep 2008
From: Chris Oura <Chris.Oura@bbsrc.ac.uk>


Recent reports that not all animals vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8
vaccines seroconvert post-vaccination have been causing alarm. People
have concluded from this that the vaccine may be failing and may not
be protective.

We have found at the bluetongue CRL here at Pirbright that not all
sheep seroconvert after one shot of inactivated vaccine (when
antibodies are detected using the commercial routinely-used
competitive ELISAs). However, we have every reason to believe that
these animals are protected, as challenge experiments carried out by
the vaccine companies have proved that animals that have not
seroconverted are protected.

Antibodies are only a component of the immune system, and previous
scientific research indicates that there are likely to be
cell-mediated immune responses that are contributing to protection
against BTV. Also, low levels of antibodies may be present in
vaccinated animals that are below the threshold of detection of the
competitive ELISAs. This low level of antibodies may be sufficient to
produce an effective memory response on challenge.

It seems clear that, for animals vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8
vaccines on a single occasion, the absence of antibodies detected by
the cELISA tests does not correlate with a lack of protection. In
other words, seronegative vaccinated animals are still likely to be
protected from BTV-8. Therefore, reports of low levels of
seroconversion post-vaccination should not put people off vaccinating
their stock. However, this does cause a problem in that, at the
present time, we are unable to reliably confirm by testing that
animals have been successfully vaccinated.

Also, I would like to try to clear up another issue that is causing
some confusion about PCR testing. PCR detects viral RNA and not
infectious virus. Viral RNA detected by PCR persists in infected
animals often for around 100-200 days post-infection. However,
infectious virus persists for a maximum of 60 days post-infection.
Therefore, animals will be PCR-positive for a considerable time after
they have cleared infectious virus from their blood.

In the recent reports of PCR-positive animals imported into the UK,
these animals have been found to be PCR-positive in post-import
testing and have, in the majority of cases, had a PCR result
consistent with the animal being viraemic (early infection). In many
of the samples from these imported animals, we have gone on to
successfully isolate virus from them.

Therefore, it is important to be cautious about interpreting PCR
results, as animals will, in some cases, be PCR-positive; however,
they may not be at risk to the local midge population. Laboratories
however are able to go some way to interpret the PCR results and,
depending on the CT levels*, can predict if the animals are likely to
be in the early (viraemic) or late (non-viraemic) stages of
infection. The only test available to confirm that the animal is
viraemic is virus isolation, and the drawback of this is it takes at
least a week to perform.

[* The ct value -- or threshold cycle -- is the PCR cycle at which a
statistically significant increase of the fluorescence signal is 1st
detected. Ct values form the basis for quantitative comparison of
individual PCR reactions. The smaller the ct value is, the bigger the
quantity of target cDNA in a given PCR reaction].

[The above observation from an internationally recognized scientific
authority, for which ProMED-mail is very grateful, is a welcome
contribution in clarifying the vaccine efficacy issue raised in
previous postings, such as Romania's questions in its recent
presentation to SCFCAH (article 3, sub-article 5 in 20080918.2930).
Hopefully, this detailed, pacifying information will encourage animal
breeders in regions at risk, both in the UK as well as in continental
Europe, to complete the timely vaccination of their susceptible
animals against BTV-8. The peak disease season may continue until the
end of October 2008, trailing beyond.

Regarding the vaccine safety issue raised in item [1], according to
the (45-year-long) experience of this moderator, all animal mass
vaccination campaigns against any disease in any species in
industrialized as well as in developing countries are accompanied by
owners' complaints. Most of such complaints reflect honest but
subjective observations of concerned individuals, in the majority of
cases eventually found to be groundless, provided the vaccines in
question are properly certified, and in particular when they are
inactivated ones. This does not mean that accidents never happen on
the manufacturing level but, mainly, during application; complaints
should always be thoroughly investigated and their results published. - Mod.AS]
