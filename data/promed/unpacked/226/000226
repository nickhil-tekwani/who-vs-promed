Virulent Newcastle disease [vND] has been confirmed at a live bird market. There are pastured poultry and identified additional cases of vND within existing disease-control areas. Affected flocks are quickly being euthanized. Together, these actions will help us prevent additional disease spread and eradicate the disease more quickly.

USDA is announcing confirmed vND cases weekly. Cases are still being tested and confirmed as they are identified. If there is a finding in a new state or a different segment of the industry, USDA will issue an announcement for that case immediately. A complete list of confirmed cases is available on USDA's website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment.

Samples from the flocks were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS). The APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirms all findings. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to respond to these findings and to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Federal and state partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at Biosecurity for Birds.

[This outbreak of virulent Newcastle disease has been rocking on since May of 2018. It feels like this is a flashback to 2003, when cases smoldered along in backyard flocks, which is a euphemism for fighting fowl. In 2003, the disease eventually moved into commercial flocks, where many flocks were euthanized out of an abundance of caution regarding the public food supply. While this problem is currently difficult to control, it does not seem to be getting any better. We can only hope for a solution soon. - Mod.TG
