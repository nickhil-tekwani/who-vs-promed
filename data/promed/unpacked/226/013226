UN, international agencies and experts today released a groundbreaking report demanding immediate, coordinated and ambitious action to avert a potentially disastrous drug-resistance crisis. If no action is taken - warns the UN Ad hoc Interagency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance who released the report - drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deaths each year by 2050 and damage to the economy as catastrophic as the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. By 2030, antimicrobial resistance could force up to 24 million people into extreme poverty.

Currently, at least 700 000 people die each year due to drug-resistant diseases, including 230 000 people who die from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. More and more common diseases, including respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections, are untreatable; lifesaving medical procedures are becoming much riskier, and our food systems are increasingly precarious.

The world is already feeling the economic and health consequences as crucial medicines become ineffective. Without investment from countries in all income brackets, future generations will face the disastrous impacts of uncontrolled antimicrobial resistance. Recognizing that human, animal, food and environmental health are closely interconnected, the report calls for a coordinated, multisectoral "One Health" approach.

It recommends countries:
- prioritize national action plans to scale-up financing and capacity-building efforts;
- put in place stronger regulatory systems and support awareness programs for responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials by professionals in human, animal and plant health;
- invest in ambitious research and development for new technologies to combat antimicrobial resistance;
- urgently phase out the use of critically important antimicrobials as growth promoters in agriculture.

"Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats we face as a global community. This report reflects the depth and scope of the response needed to curb its rise and protect a century of progress in health," said Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Co-Chair of the IACG. "It rightly emphasizes that there is no time to wait and I urge all stakeholders to act on its recommendations and work urgently to protect our people and planet and secure a sustainable future for all." The recommendations require immediate engagement across sectors, from governments and the private sector, to civil society and academia.

Convened at the request of world leaders after the first ever UN High-Level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2016, the expert group brought together partners across the UN, International organizations and individuals with expertise across human, animal and plant health, as well as the food, animal feed, trade, development and environment sectors, to formulate a blueprint for the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

This report reflects a renewed commitment to collaborative action at the global level by the World Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO). "The report's recommendations recognize that antimicrobials are critical to safeguard food production, safety and trade, as well as human and animal health, and it clearly promotes responsible use across sectors," said Jos√© Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)."

"Countries can foster sustainable food systems and farming practices that reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance by working together to promote viable alternatives to antimicrobial use, as laid out in the report's recommendations. Antimicrobial resistance must be addressed urgently, through a One Health approach involving bold, long-term commitments from governments and other stakeholders, supported by the international organisations," said Monique Eloit, Director General of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)."This report demonstrates the level of commitment and coordination that will be required as we face this global challenge to public health, animal health and welfare, and food security. We must all play our part in ensuring future access to and efficacy of these essential medicines."

"We are at a critical point in the fight to protect some of our most essential medicines," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and Co-Chair of the IACG. "This report makes concrete recommendations that could save thousands of lives every year."

The report highlights the need for coordinated and intensive efforts to overcome antimicrobial resistance: a major barrier to the achievement of many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including universal health coverage, secure and safe food, sustainable farming systems and clean water and sanitation.

Notes to the Editor:
The September 2016 Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (Resolution A/RES/71/3) called for the establishment of the ad-hoc Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (IACG), in consultation with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The IACG's mandate is to provide practical guidance for approaches needed to ensure sustained effective global action to address antimicrobial resistance, and to report back to the UN Secretary-General in 2019. The IACG Secretariat is hosted by WHO, with contributions from FAO and OIE.

No time to wait: securing the future from drug-resistant infections
Report to the secretary-general of the united nations, April 2019

Summary of IACG recommendations
-------------------------------
A. Accelerate progress in countries
A1: The IACG calls on all Member States to ensure equitable and affordable access to existing and new quality-assured antimicrobials as well as alternatives, vaccines and diagnostics, and their responsible and prudent use by competent, licensed professionals across human, animal and plant health.
A2: The IACG calls on all Member States to accelerate the development and implementation of One Health National Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plans within the context of the SDGs.
A3: The IACG calls on all Member States to phase out the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion, consistent with guidance from the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE and WHO) and Codex Alimentarius, starting with an immediate end to the use of antibiotics categorised as the Highest Priority Critically Important Antimicrobial Agents on the WHO List of Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine

B. Innovate to secure the future
B1: The IACG calls on public, private and philanthropic donors and other funders to increase investment and innovation in quality-assured, new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics), novel compounds, diagnostics, vaccines, waste management tools, and safe and effective alternatives to antimicrobials for human, terrestrial and aquatic animal and plant health, as well as implementation and operational research.
B2: The IACG recommends that existing and future global access initiatives should promote and support equitable and affordable access to existing and new, quality-assured antimicrobials, diagnostics, vaccines, waste management tools and safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics for human, terrestrial and aquatic animal and plant health.
B3: The IACG calls on public, private and philanthropic research funders and other stakeholders to build upon current research and development efforts for new antimicrobials, diagnostics, vaccines, waste management tools, and safe and effective alternatives to antimicrobials; and to strengthen implementation and operational research and research coordination and collaboration in a One Health context.

C. Collaborate for more effective action
C1: The IACG calls for the systematic and meaningful engagement of civil society groups and organizations as key stakeholders in the One Health response to antimicrobial resistance at global, regional, national and local levels.
C2: The IACG calls for the systematic and meaningful engagement of and enhanced action by the private sector as key stakeholders in the One Health response to antimicrobial resistance at global, regional, national and local levels.

D. Invest for a sustainable response
D1: The IACG calls on governments; global, regional, national, bilateral and multilateral financing and development institutions and banks; and private investors to systematically apply standards to assess risks and impacts related to antimicrobial resistance (an antimicrobial resistance and One Health "lens") when making investments.
D2: The IACG emphasizes the need for increased investments in the response to antimicrobial resistance, including from domestic financing in all countries; urges existing and future financing mechanisms in human, animal and plant health, food and feed production and the environment to give greater priority to antimicrobial resistance in their resource allocations; calls on public, private and philanthropic donors to contribute additional funding, including to support implementation of National Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plans.

E. Strengthen accountability and global governance
E1: The IACG requests the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE and WHO) together with UN Environment, other UN agencies and the World Bank, in the context of UN reform, to further strengthen joint One Health action, based on target-setting, country priorities and needs, by enhancing their organizational capacity and providing adequate and sustainable core funding for antimicrobial resistance related activities.
E2: The IACG recommends the urgent establishment of a One Health Global Leadership Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, supported by a Joint Secretariat managed by the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE and WHO).
E3: The IACG requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE and WHO), UN Environment and other international organizations, to convene an Independent Panel on Evidence for Action against Antimicrobial Resistance in a One Health context to monitor and provide Member States with regular reports on the science and evidence related to antimicrobial resistance, its impacts and future risks, and recommend options for adaptation and mitigation.
E4: The IACG recognizes the ongoing process led by Member States to develop the Global Development and Stewardship Framework to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance and urges the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE and WHO) and UN Environment to expedite its development in line with the scope described in the 2015 World Health Assembly resolution on antimicrobial resistance (WHA68.7).
As Member States finalize this process, they should also consider the need for new international instruments.

["One Health" would require a coordinated approach involving animal and human, as well as agricultural use of antimicrobial agents. Recently ProMED-mail posted reports on EPA approval of spraying streptomycin on citrus trees in the US up to 3 times a year that would cause widespread environmental contamination with the antibiotic, creating selective pressure for the emergence of antibiotic resistant environmental organisms; if the genes that encode resistance are attached to mobile genetic elements, resistance to streptomycin would be able to spread widely to multiple bacterial species. The effect might not be limited to streptomycin. Depending on the resistance mechanism, resistance to streptomycin may also be associated with cross-resistance to other aminoglycosides and perhaps to other classes of antibiotics if the genes encoding these additional resistances are linked to the gene encoding streptomycin resistance (ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - USA: spraying streptomycin on citrus trees, EPA 20190320.6377319).

Similarly, ProMED-mail recently posted a report on extensive use of triazoles as environmental fungicides in agriculture that has been linked to treatment failure and increased mortality in immunocompromised patients due to invasive _Aspergillus fumigatus_ infection due to its resistance to structurally similar triazoles that are used in human medical practice (ProMED-mail post Aspergillosis - USA: multidrug resistance 20180928.6057087). The use of antibiotics in agriculture should be subject to strict regulations. - Mod.ML]
