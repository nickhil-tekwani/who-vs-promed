From: Pamela J. Reynolds, Environmental Specialist, New Mexico Environment
Dept.

Two recent cases in pets from Sandoval County have been reported. In the
last 5 years plague has been found in cats, rodents and one human in an
area of the county that is being rapidly developed for housing.
1. Dog, male, 6-7 years old. Onset of fever up to 106 F and swollen
submandibular lymph node on 10 Dec 1997. Aspirate of node was both FA
(fluorescent antibody) and culture positive for _Yersinia pestis_ at the
state lab and at CDC. Animal was treated with antibiotics and recovered.
He was a hunter and had caught a rabbit within a week of onset.
Serological studies have shown that dogs do become infected with plague,
but clinical illness is rare, and isolation of the organism from dogs is
even rarer. Ref: K Orloski & M Edison, _Yersinia pestis_ infection in
three dogs. JAVMA 1995, 207:1-3.
2. Cat, male, 7-8 years old. Onset of fever, lethargy & loss of appetite on
14 Jan 1998. Developed a swollen submandibular lymph node. Blood culture
positive at the state lab. Recovered after antibiotic treatment. Tissues
from the carcasses of 2 ground squirrels caught and partially eaten by the
cat were FA positive for plague at the state lab.
No human cases of plague have occurred in New Mexico since Sep 1996.

[Hypochondriacs should note that while plague is widespread in wildlife in
certain areas, and the wildlife is hunted by pets, there is almost zero
transmission to humans, and it is highly treatable by antibiotics - Mod.JW
