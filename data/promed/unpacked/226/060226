DENGUE - VANUATU & PACIFIC ISLANDS: REQUEST FOR INFO

What's the situation with dengue fever in Vanuatu and which strains are
implicated? I know of several people who have had haemorrhagic dengue
fever, some of whom survived and some of whom didn't. If anyone is doing
work in this area of the Pacific, I would be interested.
