Does anyone know anything about the following press report in the Sri
Lankan media? Could this be something tsunami-related?

Mystery heart disease worries docs
Emergency meeting of medical bigwigs
-----------------------
A fever that affects the human heart is prevalent in some parts of
the country, and medical specialists have expressed grave concern
over the inability of the health authorities to identify what really
causes it.
In Badulla, over 70 persons have contracted this fever, Senior
Cardiologist Dr. Anindu Pathirana of the Badulla General Hospital
told The Island. He said the patients had breathing difficulties,
severe chest pain and dizziness as symptoms.
Palpitation was also common among the patients, he said. Over 50
percent of them had a history of the undiagnosed fever.
Dr. Pathirana said it was the 1st time that he had come across the
disease. It took months for patients to recover and in some cases
death could result due to heart failure if early treatment was not
sought, he said, adding that there was however no need for the public
to panic.
He said the majority of the patients were above 12 years -- mostly
young adults. Doctors suspect a viral infection to be the cause of
this condition, but there was no conclusive proof, Dr. Pathirana
said. 2 doctors had also contracted the disease, he said.
He said the hospital had sent blood samples to the Medical Research
Institute (MRI) for investigations but it had not received reports.
Dr. Mrs. Geethani Wickremesinghe of the MRI, contacted for her
comments, said they had not received any such samples. She referred
The Island to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry.
Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe said his institution was
aware of the disease and an emergency meeting of medical experts
including cardiologists and virologists had been called tomorrow to
conduct investigations.

[The above newswire description of this "outbreak" is very
interesting. The illness is described as a febrile illness with
respiratory difficulties, chest pain, dizziness, and palpitations in
some cases. It is unclear whether the respiratory symptoms are
primary pulmonary or secondary to cardiac dysfunction.
Using Gideon (<http://www.gideononline.com>) to identify the most
likely diseases in Sri Lanka that conform to the symptoms stated
above, the leading diagnostic possibilities are: Influenza (86.5
percent), _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection (6 percent), enterovirus
infection (4.7 percent), pleurodynia (1.3 percent), and
Legionellosis (1 percent). A few of the other possible diagnoses
included Q fever, anthrax, melioidosis, and brucellosis.
Widespread influenza-like illness is not mentioned coincident with
this reported outbreak, but much important information is missing.
Those who have been following the avian influenza outbreaks in
southeastern Asia may jump on this a possible early warning of
serious human influenza disease, affecting the young adult
population, reminiscent of reports of the 1918 epidemic. But again,
one would expect to have heard of a concurrent influenza outbreak,
quite likely described as "explosive", and this is not the case from
the tone of the newswire.
Musing further on the possible etiologies, the introduction of one of
the enteroviral myocarditis agents such as Coxsackie B3, (the most
common associated with myocarditis) or other agents such as:
Coxsackie A, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, hepatitis virus, acquired
immunodeficiency (AIDS) virus, influenza virus, poliomyelitis,
respiratory syncytial virus, rubella, rubeola, varicella, variola,
and vaccinia. _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ also seems highly likely,
especially with the suggestion that early treatment could prevent
more serious disease (although the type of treatment is not
mentioned). However, though the medical literature to date has case
reports of cardiac manifestations such as myocarditis or pericardits
associated with _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, no outbreaks have been
reported.
Dr. MacIntyre, who kindly submitted this report, questions whether
this outbreak may be related to the tsunami. Badulla district is in
the southeastern part of the country, with the capital located in the
southern portion of the hill country significantly inland. The
southeastern end of the district does have areas relatively close to
the coast. It is difficult to tell from the newswire the timing of
the outbreak, but the statement that "It took months for patients to
recover and in some cases death could result due to heart failure if
early treatment was not sought" suggests that they have been seeing
cases for several months, quite possibly pre-dating the tsunami.
The 2001 census has a population of 69 971 for Badulla, with 40 920
in urban areas, 19 790 for rural areas, and 9261 for estate areas
(tea plantations). Using the total population for Badulla as the
denominator, the apparent overall "attack rate" is 10 per 10 000
population.
All of this is speculation based on a somewhat sketchy newswire. More
information from knowledgeable sources would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
