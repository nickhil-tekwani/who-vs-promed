Outbreak of rabies has killed 42 children in Luanda
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of rabies in the Angolan capital has resulted in the
death of 42 children since October [2008], Luis Bernadino, the
Director General of the Pediatric Hospital of Luanda, revealed today
[20 Jan 2009]. The Health Services of the Provincial Government of
Luanda has not yet provided data on the total number of cases,
including adults.

Luis Bernardino told the Lusa News Agency that the number of deaths
[42] refers to the total number of children admitted to the hospital
that were infected with rabies virus. The doctor stated that that the
majority of victims are male children, between 4 and 10 years old.
According to the Director General of the Luanda Pediatric Hospital,
the high number of [cases], is due to the fact that they are admitted
'too late' when it is no longer possible to save lives. "The vaccines
are only effective if administered within 24 hours after infection
[the bite]," he stressed. The report advises that, 'when there is the
knowledge that a child (and perhaps also adults), has been bitten by
animals -- mostly dogs, cats or monkeys -- the child she should be
taken immediately to a medical post so they can be vaccinated and monitored.'

To combat the rabies outbreak, during the past 12 days, the Luanda
Provincial Government has implemented a campaign involving mass
vaccination of animals and collection of strays. This campaign ends
next Friday [?23 Jan 2009] and data currently indicate that more than
50 thousand animals have been vaccinated. In statements to Lusa, the
Provincial Director of Agriculture and Rural Development, Maria
Galeia da Paz, said that the campaign is going well, having already
vaccinated in 8 days, the number of animals that, in normal years,
took 45 days to vaccinate. A total of 25 brigades, with 100
vaccinators for each municipality were formed, with the exception of
the municipality of Maianga which has only 80 vaccinators. Luanda has
9 municipalities. There are already 9 cars, one for each municipality
that are being used for the collection of animals. Each municipal
government has the task of preparing a place where the animals can be
held temporarily pending identification by owners. "People have no
more than 24 hours to make the claims, so after that period [24
hours] animals that have not been claimed by owners will be killed,"
he stressed.

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Angola is available at:
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=-12.3,17.5.5>. The capital, Luanda,
is situated on the northern coast of Angola, some 200 miles to the
north of Huambo where a similar large scale outbreak of rabies
occurred in 2007. The authorities in Luanda appear to be responding
with vigor to control the domestic and feral dog population, but the
balance between vaccination and killing is not clear from the
report. - Mod.CP]
