Dr. Sabah Mehdi, director of the Center for Disease Control in the Department of Public Health, said that there is no human infection with the virus (H5N1) avian flu, indicating that the last infection [with H5N1] was registered in 2006 and since then and so far no human case of the disease has been recorded.

Mehdi said that the Ministry of Health and its departments in Baghdad and the provinces carried out a number of vaccination campaigns against seasonal influenza, the normal season flu of various kinds that occur during the winter and autumn, noting that there are bird flu cases infecting poultry only in the province of Diyala and Babylon and Taji area north of Baghdad.

He added that the Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture has taken control of the disease, which appeared in the above-mentioned areas and reduced the spread out of the geographical area infected with the virus in poultry and egg production fields in these areas affected by the disease. Mahdi said that the Ministry of Health and The Ministry of Agriculture have put all the field workers working in the fields infected with avian influenza (H5N1), under examination for 7 days and they did not show any infection with the disease to the moles and workers in these fields and confirm that there has been no human case since 2006 so far.

On the preventive measures and advice to be followed by the citizens, the director of the Center for Disease Control of the Ministry of Health asked to the citizens to attend the nearest health institution in the event of symptoms similar to the flu -- such as high temperature with cough and runny nose and general and burning in the pharynx -- for the purpose of classification and evaluation of the disease. They also recommended staying away from crowded areas and the use of paper napkins when sneezing; they also called patients with chronic diseases to take the seasonal flu vaccine, stressing that the Ministry of Health is conducting awareness campaigns and inspection and control of citizens and workers in poultry fields, in interest of public health.
