The epidemic of legionellosis has already affected 575 people, 12 of them
in the ICU. Analyses have found DNA of legionella in 14 refrigeration
units of the Murcian capital, among them "the English Court, the seats of
the Presidency of the regional government, the councils of Health and
Agriculture, and the central offices of CajaMurcia." The advisor of
Health, Francisco Marques, affirmed that the epidemic "is in declining
phase", although did not rule out new cases.
Tests performed on the 575 patients with pneumonia indicate that 228 were
infected by _Legionella_. The advisor indicated that of the 575 affected
people, 413 remain in
hospitals of 8 hospital centers. Marques clarified that the DNA detection
does not indicate that the mentioned facilities are the [source of the
epidemic. He clarified, also, that the Palace of San Esteban, regional seat
of the government, and the central
offices of CajaMurcia do not have cooling towers but a closed circuit of
conditioned air, [making them unlikely sources.

The epidemic of legionellosis is over, Francisco Marques, representative of
the local health authority, said to the press today Friday 13 Jul 2001.
So far the number of affected people stands at 575 (228 confirmed) 2 of
whom have died. 74.6% are men. 68% live in the Murcia city centre, 80% in
the area of Santa Maria de Gracia, and 43.7% are older than 60 years of age.
_Legionella pneumophila_ have been detected in 14 different refrigeration
towers in public buildings and commercial shopping centres by a "molecular
technique" (PCR?). All of them have already been disinfected.
To confirm that the bacteria detected in these buildings are the cause of
the outbreak will take few weeks said Carmen Navarro, Head of the
Epidemiology Department in Murcia.
