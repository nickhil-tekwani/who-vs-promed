Bird flu vaccination could lead to new strains
-----------------------------------------------
Vaccinating chickens may be the only way out of the bird flu nightmare in
Asia. But it could also lead to the evolution of new strains, the latest
research shows, increasing the risk of a human pandemic.
Only intensive surveillance can stop this happening, but experts say the
countries affected do not have the necessary systems in place.
Last week China declared its bird flu outbreaks had ended. Health officials
are vaccinating millions of the birds that escaped slaughter. Indonesia is
also vaccinating, and other Asian countries hit by the H5N1 bird flu are
considering the same strategy.
But the H5N1 virus is almost certainly still circulating among the
vaccinated birds, and the fear is that in this abnormal setting it may
evolve into a form that is not only fatal to people, like the current one,
but can also spread from person to person.
Research in Mexico has shown for the first time that under these conditions
bird flu evolves at an unprecedented rate, with unpredictable consequences.
Veterinary scientists usually prefer to control livestock epidemics by
destroying sick and exposed animals, instead of vaccinating.
The reason is that vaccines, especially flu vaccines, are not 100 percent
effective. While they prevent animals falling ill, low numbers of viruses
can still replicate inside their bodies and spread from animal to animal.
Such "silent epidemics" are very hard to spot, but can cause new outbreaks
if unvaccinated animals are exposed or if vaccination ends.
But with H5N1 bird flu now affecting a huge area of Asia, vaccination could
help end the outbreaks more quickly. Fewer flocks destroyed would leave
fewer small-scale poultry farmers destitute. "They really have few choices
now," says Ilaria Capua of the World Organisation for Animal Health
reference lab for bird flu in Legnaro in Italy.
There is a precedent -- but it is a worrying one. In 1995 Mexico stopped an
outbreak of severe H5N2 flu by vaccinating chickens. But the virus is still
circulating silently, and Mexico is still vaccinating.
Normally the bird flu virus changes little in chickens, because it rarely
persists long enough, says David Suarez of the US Department of
Agriculture's poultry research lab in Georgia. But in Mexico the virus has
been exposed to vaccinated chickens for years and this has encouraged new
forms to evolve.
In a report that will appear in the Journal of Virology, Suarez's team
reveals that "major antigenic differences" have been found in the bird flu
viruses isolated from vaccinated chickens in Mexico since 1995. It is
increasingly different to the vaccine strain, which means that infected
birds will shed more of the virus and spread the infection more readily.
The H5N1 virus circulating in vaccinated chickens in Asia is likely to
evolve the same way. There has already been speculation that vaccination
programmes in China may have led to greater genetic diversity in the virus
over the past 2 years, and perhaps even contributed to the emergence of the
current strain (New Scientist, 28 January) [see Avian influenza, poultry
vaccines 20040128.0330].
It is possible, however, to eradicate wild virus like H5N1 from vaccinated
flocks. The key is to detect and destroy silent infections. The low-tech
way of doing this is to place unvaccinated birds next to vaccinated flocks.
If any flu is circulating, these "sentinel" birds will develop obvious
symptoms. The weakness of this system, says Capua, is that farmers who want
to save their flocks from destruction can cheat by replacing any sick birds.
The high-tech method is to use a marker vaccine that elicits the production
of a different set of antibodies to the wild virus. Antibody tests can then
distinguish between infected birds and those that have simply been
vaccinated. In 2002 Italy became the first country to eradicate bird flu
using a marker vaccine and regular testing.
The surveillance part is vital, Capua says. "The vaccine used without this
monitoring can have a boomerang effect, and become a tool to spread the
virus, not control it."
Richard Webby, a leading flu expert at St Jude Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis, Tennessee, agrees. "The key to using vaccination successfully
is strong surveillance, with a vaccination versus infection marker," he says.
China does at least have the right vaccines. Its agriculture ministry
announced last week that it is launching 2 marker vaccines [see Avian
influenza, poultry vaccines (07)]. But thousands of vaccinated chickens
must still be tested, and infected flocks destroyed, to eliminate the virus.
Yet such surveillance systems will be a tall order for the Asian countries
that are vaccinating or plan to. Joseph Domenech, head of animal health at
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, says that Indonesia, which is
vaccinating chickens, does not have adequate controls. "In China, we just
do not know," he says, while Vietnam has not revealed its plans.
