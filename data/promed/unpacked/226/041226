BLUETONGUE IN BULGARIA
Information received on 21 Sep 2001 from the Delegate of Bulgaria to
the OIE:
Outbreaks of bluetongue were reported on 19 Sep 2001 in Kyustendil
district, in the westernmost part of the country.
The following measures were immediately taken:
1. Ban on all movements of any ruminants situated on the territory of

2. Mass clinical examinations of all ruminants situated in the same
district.
3. Immediate destruction of all sick animals and sample taking for
laboratory testing.

BLUETONGUE IN GREECE
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: December 1999).
Emergency report
Information received on 18 Sep 2001 from Dr Vasilios Stylas, Head,
Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
Report date: 17 Sep 2001.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 30 Aug 2001.
Estimated date of first infection: 20 Aug 2001.
1. Introduction - Background
- In 2000, following the major epizootic of bluetongue in 1999,
involving parts of northern and eastern Greece and islands in the
eastern Aegean Sea, the Greek Authorities implemented an
epidemiological surveillance scheme in the affected areas, based on
European Commission Decision 2000/350/EC, which indicated a low and
geographically confined circulation of bluetongue virus.
- No clinical signs of bluetongue were reported in any parts of Greece
throughout 2000 and up until September 2001.
- In early 2001, in light of the favorable surveillance results
obtained in 2000, the Greek Authorities lifted the restrictions on
animal movements in mainland Greece. This action was endorsed by
European Commission Decision 2001/138/EC.
- The prefectures of Ioannina and Grevena, in particular, had never
been affected by bluetongue and random sampling carried out in 1999
produced consistently negative serological results.
- The terrain in Ioannina and Grevena is largely mountainous and
inaccessible, scarred by a network of canyons and rivers running in a
general north-south direction favouring the spread of disease.
2. Circumstances surrounding the recurrence of bluetongue
2.1. Events leading to initial suspicion
Multiple clinical suspicions involving one sheep flock in Grevena and
several flocks in various areas of Ioannina were first notified on 30
Aug & 6 Sep 2001, respectively.
On the basis of the clinical picture and morbidity/mortality rates,
the estimated date of primary infection is 20 Aug (±2 days) for
Grevena and 27 Aug (±2 days) for Ioannina. This assessment, however,
is a provisional one pending the completion of a widespread clinical
surveillance and epidemiological investigation.
Observed clinical signs included high fever (40.5 C), lameness, facial
edema with nasal discharge, inflammation of the buccal cavity and lips
and ptyalism. Full bluetongue clinical signs, however, developed over
an observation period of 3-4 days.
On average, morbidity and mortality rates are 3.5% and 1.0%,
respectively. Samples (serum, blood with EDTA[1 and spleen) were
collected from clinically affected animals, and animals contiguous to
such animals, in the period from 6-10 Sep 2001.
2.2. Events leading to confirmation
On 13 Sep 2001 the Laboratory of Virology, Athens, reported positive
serology results for antibodies to bluetongue virus (by ELISA[2 and
AGID[3) on samples collected from sheep flocks in Ioannina and
Grevena.

Virology tests aimed at virus isolation and typing are in progress.
2.3. Epidemiological considerations
a) Source of agent / origin of infection
Two scenarios are being studied, viz:
- Overwintering of bluetongue virus previously occurring in Greece, or
- New incursion of bluetongue virus.
Typing of a recent field isolate in conjunction with the outcome of a
large scale epidemiological investigation currently in progress may
shed light on this question.
The epidemiological investigation is aimed at clarifying, in
particular, the exact extent of spread within Ioannina, Grevena and
adjoining Prefectures, the temporal and spatial pattern of spread and
animal movements into and out of the affected areas during the
critical time period.
However, the high sero-prevalence rates obtained in preliminary
serological results combined with the severe clinical signs observed
in affected animals suggest that the sheep population in the area was
naïve and not previously exposed to bluetongue virus.
In this case, the relatively low morbidity and mortality rates may be
due to low virulence and/or the particular type of bluetongue virus
strain involved.
b) Mode of spread
Depending on the identification of the source, two scenarios may be
applicable, viz:
- Internal movements of viraemic susceptible animals and/or wind-borne
infective vectors from previously affected areas inside Greece, or
- Imports of viremic animals or wind-borne infective vectors carried
from neighbouring countries.
Again, typing of the field isolates and the epidemiological
investigation may help answer this question too.
All consignments of live susceptible animals dispatched to Ioannina
and Grevena since 1 Aug 2001, irrespective of their origin, are being
identified and screened for possible exposure to bluetongue virus.
3. Applicable safeguard and control measures
As of 14 Sep 2001, the Greek Authorities have implemented measures(4)
aimed at controlling bluetongue in compliance with European Council
Directive 2000/75/EC, and in particular Articles 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
thereof.
Briefly, these measures include:
a) Killing and destruction of animals clinically affected or suspected
of being infected.
b) Establishment of a 20-km-radius zone around the cluster of
outbreaks, within which a census, close monitoring and a complete
standstill of susceptible animals are applied. It should be noted that
part of the Prefecture of Kastoria is also included in this zone.
c) Establishment of a single 150-km-radius zone ... delineating both
the protection and surveillance zones, where animal movement
restrictions apply and initiation of epidemiological surveillance is
being organised (sentinel bovines and light traps).
d) Launching of a vector control campaign, especially inside the
20-km-radius zone.
e) Epidemiological investigations (see paragraph 2.3. above) and
enhanced clinical surveillance inside the 150-km-radius zone.
It is pointed out that, in accordance with European Commission
Decision 2001/138/EC, the entire territory of Greece is considered as
a single surveillance zone for bluetongue and, therefore, live
susceptible animals may not be exported.
[1 EDTA: ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid.
[2 ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
[3 AGID: agar-gel immunodiffusion.
(4) Ministerial Decision No. 391397 of 14 September 2001.
[This is an informative report on good field work, setting the stage
for some interesting viral typing results. Detailed information may
shed light on where the virus came from and why such low prevalence
and mortality. Furthermore, it appears as if Dr. Stylas and colleagues
are thinking along the lines of investigating the spatial
epidemiology. Good work. - Mod. PC
