Since the discovery of a 1st case in November 2018, Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues to circulate in the department of Mayotte. To date, 31 human cases of RVF have been reported by the CHM laboratory to the ARS Indian Ocean.

RVF mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), but can occasionally infect humans. The Prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) reminds the population of the importance of implementing recommendations and actions of prevention to protect against the disease.

Epidemiological situation
As of 6 Feb 2019, 31 [human] cases of RVF were reported to the monitoring and health emergency platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte by the CHM laboratory.

Samples taken by the veterinary services in sick animals or during abortions have also made it possible to identify 23 outbreaks of infected animals (comprising from 1-6 animals) including 7 in sheep/goats, mainly located in the center of the island.

RVF is a zoonosis (infectious disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans) of viral origin, which mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals.

Transmission to humans can occur in different ways:
- Contact with blood, body fluids or tissues of a sick animal (during slaughter, cutting of meat, calving, nursing, etc.) is the most important risk. The most exposed people are professionals such as breeders, slaughterers and veterinarians.
- By mosquito bites that can transmit the virus from animals to humans, especially near infected flocks.
- Infection can also occur when eating curd or unboiled milk from an infected animal.

On the other hand, no direct person-to-person transmission of RVF has been reported to date.

The disease in humans is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness that clears in a few days: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, tiredness. However, in 5% of cases, more serious forms may occur: ocular meningitis/meningoencephalitis, haemorrhagic fever.

Since the 1st report, every sick person is being interviewed by the Indian Ocean SAR to try to describe the circumstances of the infection. Treatment of [mosquito] larval breeding and adult mosquito control are done by the service of the anti-vector fight and are taken to the homes of sick persons and around the houses.

Information to health professionals was made available to strengthen surveillance and identification of human cases.

Health authorities recommend:
For breeders and people in contact with animals:
- Wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).
- Do not handle sick or aborted animals, or abortion products without protection.
- Do not handle animal carcasses without protection.
- Always wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may have no signs, although they can transmit the virus.

For food consumption:
- Boil the local milk.
- Do not eat curd unless it is pasteurized.
- Wash your hands after cutting meat.
- Cook meat well.
- Do not consume the meat of a sick animal.

To protect yourself from mosquito bites:
- Eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water.
- Use mosquito nets and repellents.

In the event of symptoms appearing: Immediately consult your doctor

[This outbreak has been going on since November 2018. The numbers of human cases of RVF have increased from 19 to 31 in about a week. The above report does not indicate whether the human infections are the result of virus transmission by mosquito vectors, but the cattle cases certainly are. Because RVF virus can be transovarially transmitted in populations of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors, and those resulting eggs can persist for a long period of time in nature, cases can occur periodically when the virus-containing eggs hatch, and infected adult females emerge from them. Recent studies have shown that RVF virus may severely injure human fetuses if contracted by mothers during pregnancy. There is no indication of whether any of the 31 RVF virus-infected people were pregnant. Abortions in infected livestock are common. There is no vaccine available for human use, but there is for livestock. There is no mention of whether the livestock populations in the area have been vaccinated.

The clinical findings related to the above human cases are not mentioned. In an earlier comment, Mod.CP noted that, "The most common complication associated with RVF is inflammation of the retina. As a result, approximately 1-10% of affected patients may have some permanent vision loss. Approximately 1% of humans that become infected with RVF virus die of the disease. - Mod.TY
