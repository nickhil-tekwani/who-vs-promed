As of today [Tue 11 Jul 2017], there has been a total of:
1674 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
680 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.6 percent],
981 recoveries, and
13 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. - Mod.MPP]

[Now that the most recent nosocomial transmission has been interrupted, it appears as though the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia has returned to a more "stable" pattern of sporadic cases occurring in different areas. The most recent case reported prior to this case reported today (11 Jul 2017) was reported on 4 Jul 2017 (who was documented as having recovered in today's report as well).

Among the questions that still remain are:
- What are the high risk exposures for the cases that have been classified as primary but do not have an identifiable contact (direct or indirect) with camels and camel products?

- Why Saudi Arabia and not other countries in the region where there has been documented MERS-CoV transmission?

Maps showing the geographic locations within Saudi Arabia for the newly discussed case/death/recoveries can be found at the source URLs.
