An outbreak of cholera has spiked dramatically in several areas of Yemen, including its largest governorate of Hodeidah, Save the Children is warning.

Recent health figures from the WHO reveal a far more mixed picture than reports of a nationwide slow-down have previously suggested.

In the coastal Hodeidah Governorate, where the charity runs malnutrition and cholera treatment centres, suspected cholera cases have jumped by 40 percent over the past 3 weeks amid heavy rains and a heat wave. Some districts are now reporting weekly caseload figures more than double their previous peaks. Hodeidah also has some of the worst malnutrition rates in the country, with an estimated one in 4 children under the age of 5 suffering from acute malnutrition. Save the Children has previously warned of the deadly link between hunger and cholera, with malnourished children at least 3 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal diseases.

Neighboring Raymah Governorate has seen an 18 percent increase in suspected cases over the past 3 weeks, while the southern port of Aden has seen a 12 percent jump.

James Denselow, Head of Conflict and Humanitarian Policy at Save the Children, said: "This epidemic has spread at a frightening rate, and it's clear we're far from seeing the end of it. Given the ongoing bombing, and restrictions on bringing life-saving aid into the country, aid agencies are struggling to get cholera under control. Just when we think we've got it under control in one area, it suddenly spikes elsewhere."

"We need to get more medical supplies, fuel and food into Yemen and to the children who need it without delay. The warring parties that are obstructing the country's ports, roads and airspace are directly responsible for this cholera outbreak and must immediately facilitate humanitarian relief."

Suspected cholera cases nationwide have declined from a peak of about 50 000 weekly cases at the end of June 2017 - but that drop stalled 3 weeks ago. Levels now remain at about 35 000 new cases every week.

In the last 4 months, there have been more than 591 100 suspected cases of cholera and 2035 deaths, according to WHO figures from [Wed 30 Aug 2017].

Children make up an increasing proportion of both suspected cases and deaths - representing 54 percent of cholera infections and nearly a 3rd of all deaths.

[Although a number of sources have reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period. With the continue hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever is being reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically reversed. In August 2017, 171 296 cases were reported, that is 5710 new cases of cholera PER DAY.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is almost 17 weeks old and is almost 3.5 times the total number of cases of 2015 and 74 percent more than the peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. - Mod.LL
