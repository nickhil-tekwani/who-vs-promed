Of 706 horses in Singapore tested for the Hendra virus [as a surrogate for
Nipah virus - Mod CHC, 695 have been given a clean bill of health. The
Primary Production Department [PPD is still awaiting test results for the
remaining 11 horses.
The blood samples taken from the 706 horses were sent to the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory [Geelong for testing, said the department. This
was carried out after the outbreak of a viral infection in Malaysia and
Singapore. It killed one abattoir worker here and about 100 pig farmers and
others linked to the trade across the causeway. Those killed had died from
infections, mainly of the brain, caused by a new virus named Nipah.
The 706 Singapore horses were screened for the Hendra virus as the Nipah
virus is from the same family, said the PPD. Test results for 541 race
horses were negative. Of the 165 polo ponies and other horses, the test was
negative for 154. The Singapore Turf Club has also screened [more than
400 stable hands and other employees who come into contact with horses, and
found them to be free of any infection.
Meanwhile, the ban on the movement of horses between Singapore and Malaysia
remains in place.
