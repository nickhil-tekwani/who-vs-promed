An outbreak of cholera has killed 5 people in the western Kenyan town
of Naivasha over the past week, a health official said Monday [7 Apr
2008]. The fatalities occurred in Naivasha, about 90 kilometers (55
miles) northwest of the capital, said local health official Bota Nyakiba.

"Among the dead are 2 minors, but we are trying to manage the
situation," he added. "Hawking of food has been outlawed in order to
contain the disease."

Health experts have warned that possible disease outbreak in camps
housing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the violence
spurred by the disputed 27 Dec 2008 presidential elections.

Health officials in northern Zimbabwe said Sunday [6 Apr 2008] a
prolonged outbreak of cholera in the area had killed 20 people and
affected more than 200 others. They said Shamva district in the north
had been hit by a cholera outbreak since February [2008], which had
claimed 20 lives and left 221 others sick.

District medical officer Tendai Kamuriwo said it was suspected the
disease broke out after villagers used contaminated water from
streams and mishandling of victims' bodies. "We are not sure how the
1st cholera victim contracted it, but we suspect it could have been
from the river where the community gets its water," he said.

As part of measures to control the spread of disease, health
officials said they had banned food at funerals, and enforced strict
sanitary standards in the area.

At least 12 people have died from watery diarrhea in a small town in
southwestern Somalia, which is ill equipped to fight the disease,
town officials said.

Mohamed Hersi Dudi, the mayor of Bardhere, a town in Gedo region,
told local media that 60 other people have been suffering from the
disease since last week.

A local journalist said there is a privately owned hospital in town,
but cited a general shortage of medicine needed to treat watery diarrhea.

Acute diarrhea has spread to Viet Nam's northern provinces of Quang
Ninh and Thai Nguyen, raising the total number of affected localities
in the country to 14 since early March 2008.

In Quang Ninh, 2 acute diarrhea sufferers were hospitalized on 6 Apr
2008. [On Wednesday [9 Apr 2008], local newspaper Pioneer quoted the
provincial Department of Health as reporting] that initial tests
showed that they were infected with cholera. Now, Viet Nam's National
Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute is testing their specimens to give
final results.

In Thai Nguyen, a 27-year-old woman, admitted to the hospital on 7
Apr 2008, was initially tested positive for cholera.

[6] Cholera - Viet Nam (north)

Viet Nam has detected nearly 500 acute diarrhea cases in 12 northern
cities and provinces since early March 2008, of whom over 100 have
been diagnosed with cholera. [On Tuesday [8 Apr 2008], local
newspaper Saigon Liberation quoted the Vietnamese Ministry of Health
as reporting that] the patients have come from Hanoi capital, Hai
Phong city and the 10 provinces of Ha Tay, Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Thanh
Hoa, Phu Tho, Ha Nam, Nam Dinh, Vinh Phuc, Hai Duong, and Ninh Binh.

Up to 78 percent of cholera patients ate unsafe foodstuffs such as
blood budding, raw vegetables and raw shrimp paste, the ministry
said, noting that the high risk of cholera infection in Viet Nam is
also due to local people's habit of not washing their hands before
eating and after going to the toilet. Only 12 percent of Vietnamese
citizens have the habit of washing hands with soaps.

ill during her visit to the Philippines.

She traveled to the country from 29 Mar 2008 to 2 Apr 2008 and
developed diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vomiting on 31 Mar
2008. She is now stable at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. She tested
positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ biotype Ogawa.

[Although the cholera updates have included clusters of diarrhea with
some fatalities in various places in the Philippines, none of the
recent updates involving the Philippines have specifically reported cholera.

As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which
is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C). The latter serotype is relatively rare.
