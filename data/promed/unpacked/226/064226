Unfortunately, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases are widespread in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

This province is one of the backward and remote provinces of Pakistan. The CL cases have been reported from all over this province throughout the year [2012]. Khyber agency is about 100 km from Kohat, where I am based and working on leishmaniasis.

During my PhD, I worked on CL in 3 districts of this province, Kohat, Karak, and Hangu. There are hundreds of cases in all of these 3 districts plus hundreds of extra cases which remain unnoticed.

It is very unfortunate that there is no case recording system for leishmaniasis being practised in any of the government or private hospitals of Pakistan, so hundreds of cases remain unnoticed. The toll of CL in this province is increasing day by day.

I have done molecular identification of leishmania species in these districts by PCR and RFLP [restriction fragment length polymorphism]. _L. tropica_ is the prevailing species in this part of Pakistan. _L. major_ was also characterized in some of the samples, but most of such patients with _L. major_ had travel history to Afghanistan and some endemic parts of Pakistan, like Balochistan and Sindh province, where _L. major_ is the prevalent species. Moreover, sand flies have been trapped in the study districts, and we need to identify the species. The mass movement of internally displaced people (IDPs) from tribal areas (military operation zones) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has resulted in bringing the infection to urban areas of this province.

There is another very important issue which I want to highlight here, which is the unavailability of specific treatments (Glucantime injections, Sanofi Aventis Co.) in local hospitals. These injections are very expensive (about 2000 Pakistani rupees [USD 20] for one box containing 5 ampules of 5 cc each, and the average cost for full treatment is up to USD 80.

The expense of treatment depends upon the severity and the number of lesions. Poor people are unable to afford the high cost of this medicine, which is not registered in Pakistan and is usually smuggled in from Afghanistan or provided to some health authorities by WHO in limited amounts, not accessible to poor people.

We want help from international agencies if somebody can help us in this regard. We have personally treated about 100 patients free of charge, and they were successfully treated by Glucantime injections (special thanks to Dr. Kasbari Mohammad, Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES), France for his personal efforts and financial help).

I am already working under the kind supervision and guidance of Dr. Kasbari Mohammad (ANSES, France), who has trained me in leishmaniasis research. We need further help from scientific people who can collaborate with our university in scientific research, as there are many areas untouched in this part of Pakistan, and also, unfortunately, we don't have too many experts in this field in Pakistan.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Hussain for these important data on leishmaniasis in the tribal regions of Pakistan.

It is well known that leishmaniasis was increasing dramatically in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime (see ProMED reports below), and it is no surprise that in the difficult situation in Pakistan [across the international border] with internally displaced persons, leishmanisis is not under control there either.

ProMED is happy to relay Dr Hussain's request for support and his contact information. - Mod.EP
