As volume of mangoes from Mexico starts building, customers are noticing a problem that can pester mango growers and sellers. Anthracnose black spots have developed thanks in part to a rainy season. Part of the problem is that the anthracnose isn't being detected until it's too late.

"In Florida [USA], we pick mango with great ripeness," says [a Florida mango grower]. "But in Mexico, they have to pick it almost green and they don't see the anthracnose until it gets ripe. So when they come through everything looks fine, [but] at the stores, there have been a lot of complaints."

[Anthracnose is considered the most important disease of mango. It is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_) or _C. acutatum_. Symptoms may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig dieback, and leaf spots. Anthracnose can completely destroy the flowers and cause extensive dead areas on leaves, greatly reducing yield. The fungi apparently invade the skin of young fruit and remain in a latent state until fruit ripening begins. Ripe fruit, either before or after picking, can then develop prominent dark-brown to black spots. Fruit infection commonly occurs and can result in extensive rotting.

The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and fallen leaves. These are the main sources of inoculum and spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers
on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, as well as cultural measures to reduce moisture in the orchard. More Indo-Chinese/Philippine type mango varieties show levels of resistance to anthracnose than Indian type varieties.

Fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ have been reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.
