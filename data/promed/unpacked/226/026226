Two human cases of infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_ resistant to
isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide have been reported to the Scottish
Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) in the past three
months. Both patients were from Lanarkshire, in central Scotland. One, a
woman aged 65 years, died in May 1998 with smear negative pulmonary
disease, and the other, a woman of 79, died in August after surgical
treatment of a tuberculous spinal abscess. Neither had any history of
previous tuberculosis or of antituberculous therapy. Contact tracing has
identified no links between the cases.
Multidrug resistant (MDR) status in mycobacterial infections is defined as
resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. _M. bovis_ is usually
resistant to pyrazinamide, but neither isoniazid nor rifampicin is used in
veterinary practice in the United Kingdom (UK). This suggests that these
infections may have been acquired from a human rather than an animal
source, and that they were acquired at some point after isoniazid and
rifampicin were introduced to treat mycobacterial infections in humans. The
incident raises the spectre of transmission of MDR _M. bovis_ to animals;
human to animal transmission is known to occur, and animal isolates are not
tested routinely for antimicrobial susceptibility in the UK at present.
The MycobNet database, which collates data from all mycobacterial reference
laboratories in the UK, includes data on four other cases of MDR _M. bovis_
infection that have arisen in the UK since 1994. Two were reported in
Cardiff (Wales) and two in Edinburgh (Scotland). The gene sequences of
isolates from Scottish cases are being studied to see whether the cases may
have had a common source.
Nineteen cases of MDR _M. bovis_ arose in an outbreak of hospital acquired
infection among HIV infected patients in Spain. The outbreak affected more
than one hospital, and the infection was exported: an HIV infected MDR _M.
bovis_ case diagnosed in the Netherlands had been treated in one of the
affected Spanish hospitals. Transmission of MDR _M. bovis_ from a Spanish
patient with HIV infection to an HIV negative relation was recently
reported; an isolate from the HIV negative relation was indistinguishable
on genetic fingerprinting from the hospital outbreak strain. These case
studies show the potential for this pathogen to cause major problems: this
strain was essentially untreatable (resistant to 11 antituberculous drugs)
and all cases were fatal.
Surveillance of human cases of _M. bovis_ infection is to be enhanced in
the UK following an increase in the number of cases seen in cattle in Wales
and south west England. Two hundred and ten human cases in the UK were
reported to MycobNet from 1993 to 1997, but no trend has been seen, despite
the rise in cattle cases. Fifty-eight cases of _M. bovis_ infection have
been reported to SCIEH since 1992, 21 of whom were aged under 65 (40% of
the 54 whose ages are known). The numbers are small, but cases in Scotland
account for a disproportionate contribution to UK numbers (20% of cases
from 1993-97, from 10% of the UK population).
