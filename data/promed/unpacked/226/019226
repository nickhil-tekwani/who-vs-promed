Schmallenberg virus [SBV] - recent developments, 5 Jan 2012
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary report, Netherlands
---------------------------
In the Netherlands, approximately 3.9 million heads of cattle are held in over 39 300 officially registered holdings, over 1 million sheep in 30 300 holdings and 0.4 million goats in 16 000 holdings. These holdings are very diverse in structure and size, ranging from large commercial plants to small, hobby farms. The [congenital malformations] reporting requirement applies to all holders and the clinical signs have been reported from all categories.

As of 5 Jan 2012, reports on observed clinical signs which may indicate SBV infection have been received from 157 holdings. This included 90 sheep, 61 cattle and 3 goat holdings. [These sum up to a total of 154 holdings; see an update in commentary below]. Meanwhile, 52 sheep, 30 cattle and 2 goat farms have been tested, with the SBV actually demonstrated on 40 sheep farms, and, for the 1st time, also on a goat farm. In 43 tested holdings, the virus was not demonstrated. The remaining 73 holdings are still under study. The fact that the virus has not been demonstrated on 43 of the tested farms does not exclude the past involvement of the SBV since the infection could have taken place during the early stages of pregnancy.

A test for antibodies against the virus, which may provide definitive evidence of past infection, is under development. Based on the results of such test, the number of positive farms is likely to widen further. At my request, the nVWA has published an overview of the reports on their website [see most recent data in commentary below].

Situation in Europe
-------------------
In Germany, the virus has now been found in a deformed calf. In Belgium, 20 farms, with reported congenital malformations in ruminants, have so far been examined. These included 8 cattle farms (all found negative), 11 sheep farms (of which 9 tested positive) and a negative goat farm. [See Belgium's update of 6 Jan 2012 in item 4 below].

The Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs) from France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom indicate that they have no abnormalities reported. In these countries the situation is closely followed, with France now also officially requiring notification.

Research
--------
Though SBV is not known from other parts of the world, it is strongly
related to other Orthobunya viruses. This also means that there are still many questions about its characteristics, introduction and spread. The analysis is even more complicated by the fact that the phenomena we observe are the result of an infection which probably took place several months ago. I therefore maximise the (scientific) research and have asked Commissioner Dalli for support of this research. The researchers, including the Animal Health Service (GD), the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) and the National Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) adopt the said approach this week with their German colleagues and partners from the (Pharmaceutical) industry to benefit available expertise and avoid duplication. There are four named areas of research (Diagnostics, vaccine development, epidemiology, virus characterization), with the highest priority given to the development of a test that detects antibodies against the virus.

(European) exchange of information
----------------------------------
Given the transboundary nature of the problem, my ministry maintains intensive contacts with the European Commission and other States. The developments surrounding the SBV are explicitly on the agenda of the meeting of the Standing Committee on The Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH) on 11 Jan 2012 in Brussels. Netherlands will stress the importance of joint research efforts to the other Member States. Previously I have already asked the Commission to set a reporting obligation on SBV, so that the the extent and distribution of this issue can be obtained on a European level. This request will be raised again by the Netherlands during the SCoFCAH meeting.

I will keep the House informed of further developments.

Warning over virus risk from cattle imports
--------------------------------------------
UK cattle farmers have been urged to be extra vigilant after a new viral disease of cattle emerged in northern Europe.

Schmallenberg Virus [SBV], which causes significant production losses, was 1st reported in Germany and the Netherlands last summer.

Since then, more than 80 farms in the Netherlands and 14 farms in Germany have been affected, according to DEFRA's International Disease Monitoring report.

Although no similar reports of clinical signs have been made in the UK, vets are warning farmers to have heightened awareness.

Vet Carl Padgett and president of the British Veterinary Association said it was important farmers were aware of the clinical signs, particularly if they had imported animals from affected countries.

"Farmers should be extra vigilant where cattle have been imported or have been in contact with animals that have been imported. The symptoms are quite generic but this disease seems to affect a few animals, not just one. If you see any of the clinical patterns investigate it with your vet immediately."

Clinical symptoms reported initially in northern Europe include fever, reduced milk yield, loss of appetite, loss of condition and in some cases diarrhoea, with clinical signs disappearing after a few days.

However, more recent reports of abortions and congenital deformities have also been reported following recovery of infected cattle.

[Farmers are directed above to clinical signs which are not to be expected anyway during the non-vector season. What European farmers should be watching for(and hopefully, not see) in the near future is the outcome of infection which could have taken place last summer/fall, namely the possible appearance of malformations in progeny of imported ruminants. These, however, are not likely to be infective. -Mod. AS].

Warning over new viral disease threat to livestock
-----------------------------------------------------
Scottish livestock farmers have been alerted to look out for a new viral disease which causes foetal malformations in cattle, sheep and goats.

Brian Hosie, veterinary services manager with the Scottish Agricultural College, said last night that the warning follows the detection of “Schmallenberg virus” (SBV) in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium; the 1st time this disease has surfaced in northern Europe.

Hosie has written to vet practices and farmers in Scotland asking them to report incidences of limb and brain defects in new-born animals and foetuses.

"We want to fully investigate certain types of limb and brain defects in new-born ruminants and foetuses. Specifically, contractures that are present at birth that result in reduced mobility of several limb joints. In severe cases, limbs and the spine also may be twisted. [Scientifically termed Arthrogryposis. - Mod. AS].

"The brain damage caused by this virus is severe and results in blindness and lack of brain function.”

He emphasised that while there was no evidence that SBV was currently present in Britain, the enhanced surveillance was necessary to ensure that, should SBV infection occur, it was detected and controlled at the earliest possible stage.

“Current evidence suggests the likelihood of incursion of this viral infection into Britain is low but heightened surveillance on the part of vets and the farming industry will allow us to further assess the risk,” he said.

An update on Schmallenberg Virus in Northern Europe: Situation Assessment
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
------------------
Since our previous report on the 20 Dec 1012 (http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/poa-
smallenberg-111220.pdf), there have been significant changes in the disease situation for Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in northern Europe. Disease is currently being confirmed on the basis of a PCR test for viral RNA developed by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) and in use in other European countries. There is no serological test yet, but it is in development. Once available it will provide information about current and past infection as well as exposure in humans.

Belgium has now reported finding virus-positive lambs with congenital deformities on 11 sheep farms in the North Western region of Antwerp, while a further 8 cattle, 3 more sheep and one goat farm have reported deformities (Belgium AFSCA, 2012).

[According to Belgium's update of 6 Jan 2012, 110 samples from 29 farms have been received so far, of which 10 cattle farms (all negative), 18 sheep farms (14 positive) and 1 goat farm (negative). The table, in Flemish (Dutch), is available at
http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/dierengezondheid/schmallenberg/_documents/schmallenberg_resultaten_20120106_nl.pdf. A map, showing all foci along Belgium's northern coast line, at http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/_pictures/users/Schmallenberg_20120106_000.jpg. - Mod. AS].

In Netherlands there have now been nearly 160 farms reporting deformed lambs, calves and in 3 cases, kid goats. Of these, 40 of the 92 sheep farms and 1 of the 3 goat farms are positive but none of the 62 cattle farms (map included).

[The recent Dutch data, updated on 6 Jan 2012, are to be found in the commentary to item 1 above].

In Germany, there are now 6 cattle premises where virus has been detected [In clinically affected adult dairy cattle, August/Sep 2011. -Mod. AS]. The FLI reported the virus has been isolated and used to experimentally infect 3 cattle. Viraemia was observed 2-5 days post inoculation. Of the 3 cattle, one developed a fever (40.5 C) while a second animal developed moderate diarrhoea.

Sequence analysis confirmed the virus is a member of the Orthobunyavirus Simbu serogroup and has been provisionally classified as a Shamonda-like virus (Friedrich Loeffler Institute, 2011). Additionally, the virus has been isolated from the abdomen of one of twin calves which died during parturition (Friedrich Loeffler Institute, 2012).

The map above [see page 2 of the report; visit, at the source URL, recommended] shows the geographic distribution of currently affected regions in Netherlands (all 12 provinces)[but in 2 provinces not lab-confirmed yet] , Belgium and Germany. Also indicated are the consignments of cattle which originated in the affected regions and moved to the UK during July – November 2011. The areas of risk from midge movements from the Belgium and Netherlands coasts during this period are indicated for South East England, according to Met Office modelling of wind direction and conditions during the risk period.

France has also put in place guidance for reporting suspect cases in high risk areas (Alsace, Lorraine, Nor Pas de Calais, Picardie, Champagne Ardennes) which are those with proximity to currently affected areas (ANSES, 2011).

2. Situation Assessment
-----------------------
Although developments have been rapid in advancing the knowledge of this new virus, there are still uncertainties. For example, the prevalence of neonate deformities and abortions in an affected herd, whether newborn ruminants can still be viraemic, what effect immune status has on further pregnancies, whether other exotic ruminants are also affected (such as llamas, alpacas, camelids) and how long the disease has been present in Europe. The lack of virus identification in newborn infected calves is not unusual for viruses from the same serogroup, such as Akabane virus (Uchida et al. 2000).

No similar reports of clinical signs or neonatal deformities in the UK have been made, but as can be seen for the map [page 2], there are certain areas which would
have been at risk of disease introduction.

Animal keepers need to be aware of lambs, calves or kids born between now and late summer and report any abortions and deformities. As infection may have occurred some time ago, it would be difficult to take disease control measures on affected premises. Exotic ruminants, such as camelids, should also be kept under observation.

This is not a notifiable disease, although in the Netherlands it is now reportable; that is, the disease is considered important enough to require reporting to local veterinary authorities, but not necessarily that government intervention is required. Trade restrictions are not in place nor are there any current control measures. This may change based on the Commission taking a view over the next week. According to the initial risk assessment carried out by the Netherlands RIVM and a follow-up risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, 2011), although there are still some uncertainties, the risk to human health is likely to be very low.

In newborn ruminants and foetuses, suspect cases are considered to be cases of limb and brain defects (such as arthrogryposis [locked joints], shortening of the hamstrings, deformation of the jaw, hydranecephaly, stiff neck or newborns with neurological disorders, flaccid paralysis, blindness, exaggerated movements, hyperexcitability, feeding difficulties and ataxia.

3. Conclusions
--------------
We consider there would be a negligible risk of introduction via infected vectors at this time of year. During the vector season, the risk level is likely to rise but this will depend on what the vector is and its distribution. It is difficult to quantify the risk of introduction of disease into the UK through imports of pregnant animals as little is currently known of the disease epidemiology, however given the numbers of recent imports during the risk period and the current distribution of disease in North Europe, it is a possibility that disease will be found in the UK.

The risk of spread is difficult to quantify until the full epidemiological characteristics of the disease are known. We consider vector borne transmission to be negligible at the current time of year, as the UK would be considered vector free.

Animal keepers are requested to be vigilant and inform their veterinary surgeons of any such cases. Stillbirths, malformations or nervous disease in newborn animals or foetuses born to imported animals should be sent for screening to the AHVLA.

We will continue to monitor the situation.

[The Dutch notification requirement seems to have been prolific; the Belgian accumulated information is based upon voluntary reporting, thus the true numbers of congenital malformations and their geographic distribution may somewhat differ. The absence of positive test results in cattle, in both countries, is waiting for clarification.

So far, no information on the occurrence of congenital malformations in ruminants has become available from Germany, besides a piece of information (from a Dutch source) on a single positive case in cattle (foetus?). Such information will be appreciated.

Though SBV has not been reported previously in Europe or elsewhere, 2 other teratogenic orthobunyaviruses, Akabane and (to a lesser extent) Aino, have been reported since the 70's in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

The Netherland official report to the OIE "Event summary: Schmallenberg disease, Netherlands" on 39 outbreaks of an emerging disease, including a map, was submitted on 5 Jan 2012 and is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11447. - Mod.AS.]
