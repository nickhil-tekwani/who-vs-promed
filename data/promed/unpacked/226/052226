Viet Nam: Avian influenza; WHO Update 11
----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed an additional 10
cases of human infection with avian influenza (H5N1) avian influenza.
Today's report is an official notification to WHO of some recent cases,
whose infection was detected in March [2005], combined with retrospective
notification of older cases, some of which date back to late January
[2005]. Of these newly reported cases, 3 have been fatal.

This notification of cases follows new reporting procedures established
within the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO staff in Hanoi.

Today's official report brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed
cases in Viet Nam, detected since mid-December 2004, to 24. Of these, 13
have been fatal. Pending further information from the Ministry of Health,
WHO will issue details showing dates of onset, outcome, and province for
all 24 cases in tabular form.

Full information on new cases, including those that may be closely related
in time and place, is critical to ongoing assessment of the pandemic risk
posed by the H5N1 virus. Rapid field investigation of each new case is
essential to ensure timely detection of clusters of cases occurring in
family members or health care workers. Such cases can provide the first
signal than the virus is altering its behaviour in human populations and
thus alert authorities to the need to intervene quickly.

Total human cases (all countries) since January 2004
-----------------------
The 1st human cases of H5N1 infection, linked to poultry outbreaks in parts
of Asia that have been ongoing since December 2003, were reported in
January 2004 in Viet Nam and Thailand. Since then, altogether 69 cases have
been reported, of which 46 were fatal.

Human cases have occurred in 3 phases: from January through March 2004 (35
cases, 24 deaths), from August through October 2004 (9 cases, 8 deaths),
and from December 2004 to the present (25 cases, 14 deaths). In the present
phase, the total includes a single case in Cambodia, which was fatal, in
addition to those in Viet Nam.

since 28 Jan 2004

<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_03_11/en/>

The total number of cases is 69 (Cambodia - 1, Thailand - 17, Viet Nam -
51), and the total number of deaths is 46 (Cambodia - 1, Thailand - 12,
Viet Nam - 33). The total number of cases includes number of deaths. The
WHO reports only laboratory-confirmed cases.

[The new arrangements established between the WHO and the Vietnamese
Ministry of Health for the reporting of avian influenza A (H5N1) cases and
deaths are a welcome development which will allow the progress of the
outbreak in Viet Nam to be followed with greater clarity, and eliminate
ambiguous diagnoses, misidentification of patients, and double counting.

influenza in Viet Nam by CIDRAP can be accessed at:
