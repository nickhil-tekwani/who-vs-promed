[Israel's State Veterinary Services publish on their website, for veterinary practitioners, farmers, shareholders, and the public at large, the drafts of its official reports. This is done simultaneously with their dispatch to the relevant international agencies. The following report (in Hebrew) is titled "Urgent notification 7-2-22". The original draft report in English follows (slightly abridged). - Mod.AS]

4. Outbreaks (2)
a. Outbreak 1
Location: Maale Shomeron
1st administrative division: HaMerkaz
Started on: 1 Feb 2022

Description of the affected population: the dot in the map is the most approximate emplacement that the software allows. The right location is 32.1643955722, 35.068510622 [see comment].

Free ranging beef cattle in Judah and Samariah, an area where FMD has been diagnosed in the Palestinian Authority. 3 bulls, 48 dams, 32 heifers, 10 calves.

The owners reported that one of the cows disappeared for 2 days and a while after she came back, the clinical symptoms were seen in the herd.

Epidemiological statistics:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered / Vaccinated
Cattle / 93 / 80 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 93

b. Outbreak 2
Location: Kefar Yehoshua
1st administrative division: HaZafon
Geographic coordinates: 32.680227,35.150894

[The location of outbreak 1 (Ma'ale Shomron) is indicated on the map at https://tinyurl.com/59kmrsyt. It is situated 60 km (37.3 mi) south of Outbreak 2 (Kfar Yehoshua) and 8.5 km (5.3 mi) east of the old demarcation line between the 'West Bank' and Israel (lined on the map).

The earlier outbreak, in Maale Shomeron, reportedly started 1 Feb 2022, affecting a 93-strong beef-cattle herd that grazed in an infected region, within the West Bank. FMD O reportedly started spreading in the territory of the Palestinian Authority (within the West Bank) in mid-December 2021 or earlier (ProMED post 20211216.8700299). The Kefar Yehoshua outbreak, involving about 800 housed fattening calves, reportedly started 2 days later. A linkage between the 2 foci seems likely, either by a common source or otherwise (for example, a cattle dealer, feed supplier, labor).

The report includes vaccination statistics in both outbreaks. These figures probably present 'vaccination in response to an outbreak'; the history of previous vaccination(s) is requested. Periodic FMD vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats is compulsory in Israel; the responsibility for the acquisition of matching vaccines and the execution of the vaccination is borne by the State Veterinary Services.

An FMD virus, reportedly circulating in Jordan since early November 2021, has been sequenced and genotyped there as FMDV O, topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia 2, sublineage ANT-10 (ProMED post 20211229.8700556). The strain from the Palestinian Authority was found by the Kimron Veterinary Institute to have the same profile (ProMED post 20211231.8700601). Genotyping results of the virus from the 2 new outbreaks in Israel are not yet available, but it will surprise me if they differ from the Palestinian Authority strain. Hopefully, samples from Jordan, Palestinian Authority, and Israel have been submitted to an international reference laboratory for comparative studies and for vaccine matching tests.

The current event seems to involve 3 political entities: Jordan, where the epizootic reportedly started (early November 2021), spreading to the Irbid province, adjacent to the Jordan River; the Palestinian Authority, where it was initially recorded (close to the Jordanian border) on 12 Dec 2021 (and spreading since); and Israel's 2 outbreaks (including one outbreak in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank). Collaboration in combatting infectious animal diseases, within a common ecological niche, is essential for the sake of the region and beyond, and in the spirit of One Health. It will require the involvement of international agencies and lots of goodwill -- to overpower the political obstacles.

Sharing a draft with the public testifies to transparency. The draft may undergo editorial updates by OIE/WAHIS before its final publication/distribution as an OIE "Immediate Notification". - Mod.AS
