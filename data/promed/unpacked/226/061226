MICRONUTRIENTS & PLANT BREEDING

Citation:Plant breeding: a new approach for solving the widespread, costly,
and complex problem of micronutrient malnutrition, by Howarth Bouis.
It is only in the past decade that nutritionists working in poor countries
have recognized theenormity, for which new and compelling scientific
evidence is rapidly accumulating, of the problemof mineral and vitamin
deficiencies.
Extent and Costs of Micronutrient Malnutrition.
For example, over 2 billion people in the world suffer from iron deficiency
and that this deficiency is severe enough to cause anemia in over 1 billion
people. Because of their elevated requirements, women of reproductive age
and young children are at particularly high risk. It is estimated that 50%
of pregnant and 40% of non-pregnant women in developing countries are
anemic. Iron deficiencies during childhood and adolescence impair physical
growth and mental development and learning capacity. In adults, iron
deficiency reduces the capacity for physical labor.
A recent World Bank publication estimates that deficiencies in iron,
vitamin A, and iodine alone, at levels of malnutrition that presently exist
in South Asia, cause economic losses equal to 5% of GNP each year due to
sickness, poor work performance, lost education, and other factors.
Initially there was some optimism that supplementation and fortification
programs, which treat the symptoms but not the underlying cause of
micronutrient malnutrition (which is diets of poor quality, consisting
primarily of staple foods to meet basic calorie requirements), could solve
much of the micronutrient deficiency problem quickly and easily. Although
in some situations the payoff to investments in these programs has been
high, in general these programs have not worked as well as in developed
countries because of poor institutional infrastructure, among other reasons.
Plants which fortify themselves is an inherently appealing approach in that
they provide a delivery system for nutritional supplements that would have
few recurring costs. Once farmers have the appropriate seeds, they could
continue to grow them year after year. In contrast, supplementation or
fortification programs require ongoing expenditures to keep delivering
required nutrients. Furthermore, if the nutrient dense crops are unchanged
in appearance, processing and cooking qualities, and taste, they could
provide higher levels of micronutrients in the diet without requiring any
apparent dietary change.
Why Has this Strategy Not Been Tried Before?
The few past attempts at breeding for nutritional characteristics (usually
for vitamins or protein) have encountered substantial barriers to producing
both nutrient-dense and high-yielding (and so high-profit) varieties which
would be accepted by farmers. Thus, the usual presumption has been that
giving plant breeders an additional characteristic (better nutritional
quality) will be too costly in terms of the opportunity foregone in
developing higher-yielding genotypes. However, as science makes new
advances, it is often the case that conventional wisdom requires
rethinking. New knowledge in three areas has led to a reevaluation.
First, as already alluded to above, the payoff to improved micronutrient
content is much higher than previously thought; and the difficulties are
greater than previously thought of treating the micronutrient problem using
methods which have worked in developed countries.
Second, advances in plant breeding techniques can speed the process and so
lower the costs of breeding.
Third, and perhaps most importantly, relatively recent research shows that
nutritional balance specifically for trace minerals is just as important
for plant nutrition as for human nutrition. Breeding for trace mineral
dense seeds improves plant nutrition, reduces input costs, and improves
yields and profits on trace mineral deficient soils. Agricultural
productivity in poor countries may be substantially improved, at the same
time as the nutritional quality of seeds for human consumption is improved.
Agronomic Advantages.
The basic reasons for these agronomic advantages may be stated in a simple
way. Plant nutrition may suffer from trace mineral deficiencies in a number
of ways (for example, zinc and manganese play key roles in preventing root
disease in wheat). These "deficiencies" are caused not by the physical
absence of trace minerals in the soil (in fact, sufficient amounts are
usually available for hundreds or thousands of crops soils may never be
depleted due to additions such as through windblown dust), but by the fact
that the trace minerals are bound chemically to other elements that make
them "unavailable" to plants. Such soil "deficiencies" are widespread in
developing countries. Certain plant genotypes, however, are more efficient
than others in the uptake of trace minerals from soils (for example, their
roots exude substances that chemically "unbind" minerals in the soil,
resulting in their becoming available to plants). Plant breeding may select
for such "efficiency" characteristics, including the characteristic of
translocating high amounts of trace minerals to the plant seeds. When
replanted in "deficient" soils, such mineral-dense seeds have been shown to
be more vigorous and disease-resistant, which, in turn, leads to higher
plant yields, even though fewer chemical inputs and less irrigation are
required.
Comparative Costs.
What are the relative costs of plant breeding as compared with
supplementation and fortification? If successful, plant breeding has
tremendous leveraging power in that research output at central facilities
(a one-time cost except for maintenance breeding) eventually may be adapted
by national programs to growing conditions all over the world. For example,
the CGIAR pre-breeding project (described on pp. 25-26 in this issue) is
proposing to spend $9 million over five years for five crops to develop
appropriate breeding tools. A similar amount might be spent over the
following five years using these tools to breed the high-yielding nutrient
dense material which may be distributed to national programs for adaptive
breeding.
The additional profits made by farmers could well justify the research
investment. A CIMMYT wheat breeder based in Turkey, where soils are
particularly zinc-deficient, has estimated that, if the zinc-dense seed
varieties already available on a commercial basis in Australia were adapted
to growing conditions in Turkey, Turkish wheat farmers would save $75
million annually in reduced seeding rates alone (seeding rates could be
reduced from an average of 250 to 150 kilograms per hectare on 5 million
hectares; a ton of wheat sells for about US$150 on the world market). This
does not even count the benefit of higher yields.
Compare this with the recurrent annual costs of supplementation and
fortification. A lower-bound estimate of the cost of iron supplementation
is $2.65 per person per year when all administrative costs are taken into
account. A lower-bound estimate for iron fortification is 10 cents per
person per year. Consider a populous country such as India where as many as
28 million pregnant women may be anemic in any given year out of a total
population of 880 million. These figures imply that treating one-half of
the anemic pregnant women in any one year through a well-targeted
supplementation program would cost $37 million per year. A fortification
program reaching half of the population would cost $44 million per year.
The CGIAR Micronutrients Project: History and Objectives.
In 1993, the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) was
commissioned to take the lead in identifying activities which the CGIAR
might undertake to join other international and national organizations in
the fight against micronutrient malnutrition. IFPRI , a CGIAR center which
is based in Washington, D.C., and staffed primarily by economists,
undertakes research which examines alternative government policies for
increasing food production and improving food consumption and nutrition
among the poor in developing countries.
Perhaps the two best known centers within the CGIAR are the International
Rice Research Institute(IRRI) located in the Philippines and the Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center (with the Spanish acronym of CIMMYT ) located in
Mexico, which were both established in the 1960s . High-yielding varieties
of rice, wheat, and maize developed at these two centers now are grown
widely in developing countries, where over the past three decades, cereal
production has grown faster than demand. These developments, dubbed the
"Green Revolution," and the resulting lower food prices and higher farm
incomes, up to now have been viewed as the primary contribution of the
CGIAR to improved nutrition.
When the idea of breeding for micronutrient content was first broached with
individual scientists within the CGIAR in visits to Colombia, Ethiopia,
India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Syria, and Taiwan in 1993, the
suggestion was generally met with skepticism, although with a few
exceptions. Notwithstanding the fact that there was virtually no
institutional knowledge of genotype variation in micronutrient content of
crop varieties developed by the CGIAR centers, the presumption among most
of those scientists contacted was either that there again would be a
trade-off between plant yield and nutritional value, or at best, that there
would be no correlation with yield and that adding an additional breeding
objective (nutritional quality) would slow down the overriding breeding
objectives of higher and more stable crop yields.
In the course of these discussions, one scientist recommended a visit to
the Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory (PSNL), run by the USDA-ARS and
located on the Cornell University campus, a visit which was to dramatically
change the direction of the CGIAR micronutrients project. The PSNL
,established in the 1930s , has been charged with looking at the linkages
between minerals in soils and the nutrition of plants, animals, and humans
in the United States.
During that initial visit, Ross Welch of PSNL provided information about
research conducted by Robin Graham of the Waite Agricultural Research
Institute at the University of Adelaide in Australia to improve plant
nutrition by breeding for crops with improved efficiency in the uptake of
trace minerals from "deficient" soils, and which loaded high amounts of
these minerals into plant seeds. This work was aimed primarily at
improving wheat yields in Australia (the soils in Australia are among the
most trace mineral "deficient" in the world) and such varieties had already
been released for commercial production.
After subsequent lectures by Robin Graham at CIMMYT , IRRI , and a fourth
CGIAR center to be mentioned here based in Colombia, the International
Center for Tropical Agriculture (with the Spanish acronym of CIAT), a core
of CGIAR scientists became convinced of the feasibility and enormous
potential of breeding for nutritional improvement.
Eventually, it was agreed that a plant breeding strategy could be
successful only through such a global network involving close cooperation
between Waite, PSNL , the CGIAR Centers, and developing country national
agricultural research institutions. The CGIAR does not have the requisite
know-how or equipment (certainly in the area of bioavailability and, it
turns out, in the area of screening material for trace minerals) for some
of the more "upstream" research that needs to be undertaken. The CGIAR has
an obvious comparative advantage in terms of (1) the amount of germ plasm
available for screening, (2) undertaking the task of incorporating
promising micronutrient -dense characteristics into existing elite lines
through breeding, and (3) dissemination of the nutritionally-improved elite
material to a large number of countries.
The target crops are iron, wheat, maize, phaseolus beans, and cassava. The
target micronutrients are iron, zinc, and vitamin A. For these crops and
nutrients, the project is conceived as a five-year pre-breeding study to
determine:
1. The range of genetic variability available for exploitation by future
breeding programs;
2. The bioavailability of the micronutrients contained in the grain (or
seeds or other storage tissue) of the best selections;
3. The genetics and physiology/biochemistry of the selected traits;
4. Screening protocols for use in subsequent breeding programs. Screening
of germ plasm has commenced at a low level of effort. What is lacking now
is medium- to long-run funding to proceed with the full proposed research
agenda over the next five years, although approximately $1 million in
funding from the Danish aid agency, DANIDA, ensures that the project will
extend at least through the end of 1998.
After full funding is obtained for research at the five central research
institutes, collaborative agreements with national agricultural research
programs will be negotiated. Preliminary discussions have already taken
place with groups in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, India,
Nepal, and Turkey. For further information about the CGIAR
