The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has reported 4 new strangles cases in the state.

A 13-year-old mare in Brown County presented with lymphadenopathy (swelling or abscessation of the lymph nodes under the jaw) and fever. Three horses were exposed at the boarding facility, which is now under voluntary quarantine.

A horse in Racine County presented with nasal discharge. The 15-year-old Belgian gelding was reportedly purchased at an auction in Illinois in late May [2022], and the facility where he currently resides is under voluntary quarantine.

Two horses in Sheboygan County tested positive at a boarding facility where 3 horses were suspected positive and 27 were exposed. A Miniature Horse gelding presented with unilateral nasal discharge on 8 Jun [2022] and confirmed positive on 11 Jun [2022]. A 15-year-old warmblood mare presented on 9 Jun [2022] with lymphadenopathy, nasal discharge, and fever and was also confirmed positive on 11 Jun [2022]. A yearling warmblood filly on the property also presented with a fever, and a 22-year-old Paint mare had an abscess and draining lymph node, but tests have not confirmed their diagnosis. The facility is under voluntary quarantine.

About strangles
Strangles in horses is an infection caused by _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies equi and spread through direct contact with other equids or contaminated surfaces. Horses that aren't showing clinical signs can harbor and spread the bacteria, and recovered horses remain contagious for at least 6 weeks, with the potential to cause outbreaks long term.
