MULTIPLE DISEASES, CASSAVA - SOUTH EAST ASIA: ALERT

CIAT and partners in South East Asia have issued urgent preliminary
guidelines to tackle deadly pest and disease outbreaks that have crippled
cassava production in parts of the region. This follows reports from
Thailand's east and north east of damaged and stunted cassava plants with
low root yields.

Thailand
--------
For example, in the Korat region, about 3 hours from Bangkok, the road is
flanked by field after field of affected plants.

The Thai fields were found to be infested by a large number of mealy bugs,
tropical whiteflies and red mites, while cassava bacterial blight (CBB) and
brown leaf spot disease were also widespread. None of these pests and
diseases had previously caused significant losses in Thailand, but the
severity of the current outbreak has been attributed, in part, to higher
than usual rainfall in the region, linked to climate change.

Some analysts now predict a cut in Thai cassava output by at least 30 per
cent this 2010 season, but some farmers face losses as high as 80 per cent.
Many have already abandoned their crops, and widespread economic and social
implications are expected. The country accounts for three quarters of the
world's cassava exports.

Viet Nam
--------
In neighbouring Viet Nam, similar symptoms were found, but the main
problems were not pests, but diseases. "The CBB was incredible," continued
Tony Bellotti, CIAT. "The disease was just oozing from the stems. I've
worked with cassava for 35 years, and I'd never seen anything like it."

The experts also found symptoms known as witches' broom, still new to
Vietnamese farmers, typified by discolouration and distortion of leaves and
reduced branching of the stems. When the affected cassava is uprooted, the
roots are thinner and smaller, with rough-textured skins, and drastically
reduced starch content.

Other countries
---------------
CIAT is now investigating reports that fields in Cambodia, Laos and the
Philippines have also been affected. "It's no surprise if these problems
are spreading quickly," said Bellotti. "We can be fairly sure that China
and Myanmar will be hit soon, and in time, Indonesia too. Cassava
production in SE Asia has enjoyed an extended honeymoon period. That period
is now over."

CIAT Asia is working with national partners. "This is a red alert," said
Tin Maung Aye, CIAT. "We're still coming to terms with the scale of the
problem. The spread is almost certainly caused by the movement of infected
planting material. One of the 1st responses is strict quarantine
regulations on the movement of cassava material and of related species like
jatropha. Establishing an effective surveillance and monitoring system is
essential. We will also need to develop an Integrated Pest and Disease
Management (IPDM) strategy, based primarily on biological control. Breeding
of cassava varieties with greater pest and disease resistance will become a
priority. There is no time to lose."

[Bacterial blight of cassava (CBB) is caused by _Xanthomonas manihotis_.
Symptoms include leaf lesions which may lead to severe defoliation, leaving
bare stems ("candlesticks") as well as brown discolouration of stems and
roots. CBB is favoured by wet conditions and is primarily spread by
infected cuttings. It can also be transmitted by water splash, contaminated
tools, chewing insects and human activity. Yield loss may range from 20 to
100 per cent depending on variety, bacterial strain and environmental
conditions.

Brown leaf spot of cassava is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
henningsii_. Symptoms of brownish spots with definite borders are
restricted to older leaves. Infected leaves later become yellow and
eventually drop. In wet areas, the disease may reduce yield by up to 20 per
cent.

Witches' broom of cassava is caused by Cassava witches' broom phytoplasma
(_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group) and can seriously affect starch
content of tubers. For more information on all diseases, see links listed
