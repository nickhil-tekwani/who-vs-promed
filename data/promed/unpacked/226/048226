WHO Plans Urgent Action On Ruweng Polio Outbreak
-----------------------------------
A wild poliovirus sample isolated on 22 Jul 2001 from a stool sample
from Ruweng County, Western Upper Nile/Unity (Wahdah) State, southern
Sudan, came from a 2-year-old girl, originally from Akot-weng village
in Gul Dit Payam (district), WHO official Jeff Partridge told IRIN on
Wednesday.
At the time of the onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in April
[2001, which ultimately drew attention to the polio outbreak, the
girl's family was living in the ´toich´ (wetlands) area 2-3 hours walk
from Padit, where people can get fish, water, and grazing for their
cattle during the dry season (January-May), he said. Similar cases of
paralysis were also reported in the toich where the case was
presented, he added. Due to ongoing
insecurity, Ruweng was the only county accessible to the inter-agency
Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) where WHO has been unable to establish
surveillance staffing for polio on the ground, Partridge said. For the
same reason, no immunisation of the under-5 population has been done
this year, although Ruweng has 5 districts with an estimated under-5
population of 12 800.
This is the first P1-type wild poliovirus that has been isolated from
southern Sudan since the start of the polio eradication programme
there in 1998, although it was isolated in 4 AFP [acute flaccid
paralysis cases in north Sudan last year, according to Partridge. WHO
was "very concerned" about the incident, because one could presume
that there were many more infected carriers, due to inadequate
vaccination cover and because there was a lot of population movement
in Ruweng County, among others reasons, he said. "We look at this as
an outbreak, because it's proof that the virus is there, that polio is
circulating in south Sudan," he added.
"Fortunately, most areas WHO would want to visit are not flight-denied
at this time, and no active fighting is happening," so the agency
plans to send emergency teams, complete with cold-chain requirements,
into Pagol, Padit and Biem between 28 July and early August [2001.
These teams will try to find the polio-positive patient in order to do
a detailed case investigation, as well as to collect samples from
contacts of the positive case, random children in the surrounding
households, and from households in
Pagol, Padit and Biem and surrounding villages, WHO added.

[This article serves to highlight the challenges still facing the
polio eradication effort. There are still areas of the world
preventive health activities are unable to reach, yet wild
polioviruses can. The identification of wild virus from cases in both
the north and south of the country strongly suggests that there is
significant transmission of the wild virus in the Sudan and that the 5
virus isolates referred to are "tip of the iceberg" in terms of actual
disease burden. - Mod.MPP

Polio Outbreak Confirmed in Western Upper Nile
---------------------------
The presence of wild polio virus has been confirmed in a stool sample
collected by a MEDAIR team operating in Ruweng County, Western Upper
Nile/Unity (Wahdah) state, southern Sudan, the World Health
Organisation told IRIN on Tuesday.
The WHO was "very concerned" about the finding for a number of
reasons, said the head of the WHO's polio eradication programme for
Sudan, Jeff Partridge.
In the first case, MEDAIR was on the ground in Ruweng for just a
couple of days, and there could be many more cases of paralysis there,
since the virus was extremely contagious. Perhaps more importantly,
paralysis occurred in approximately one in every 200 people infected
so one could presume that there were many more infected carriers, he
added.
With the confirmed case of wild polio having caused the paralysis of a
child 3 months ago, the danger was that thousands of other people had
been infected since; this was especially so since Ruweng had been
reached by only 2 rounds of National Immunisation Days (NIDs) last
year and one in 1999, and it had not been accessed at all in this
year's because of insecurity, Partridge said.
"We look at this as an outbreak because it's proof that the virus is
there, that polio is circulating in South Sudan," he added.
The MEDAIR mobile and response team had been operating in Ruweng
county when it identified a case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and,
suspecting polio, contacted WHO at the OLS southern sector operations
base in Lokichoggio, northern Kenya, the NGO stated in a press release
on Saturday.
Initial analysis in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, followed by more
detailed analysis at a virology laboratory in South Africa had
isolated a wild polio virus (P1) from the stool sample on Friday last,
20 Jul 2001, Partridge told IRIN.
WHO officials were currently contacting staff and field assistants in
Lokichoggio and in districts neighbouring Ruweng, as well as other UN
agencies, MEDAIR and the Sudan Rehabiliation and Association [since
Ruweng is in an area controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement/Army (SPLM/A), whose humanitarian wing is the SRRA in order
to decide on the approach to take, and to gauge what is feasible in a
situation of limited access, Partridge said.
Knowing the insecurity in the Ruweng area, and that people could be
forced by violence to move into other parts of Western Upper
Nile/Unity, into Lakes District or Twic country, there was a real need
was for urgent rounds of polio immunisation to halt the spread of the
disease, he added.Ruweng County continues to be one of the neediest
areas covered by the southern sector of Operation Lifeline Sudan
(OLS), according to MEDAIR's statement on Saturday.
With the area plagued by insecurity, it was not possible to maintain a
permanent presence on the ground and MEDAIR's mobile and response team
was the only health programme within OLS that maintained a capacity to
respond in this difficult area, the agency said.
