In ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza (21): Netherlands (GE) poultry, H7, RFI 20130312.1583751", you requested more information:

The virus has been further characterised in our laboratory as an LPAI H7N7 based on the result of the influenza nucleotide array (Gall A et al J Clin Microbiol. 2009 Feb;47(2):327-34).

These results were confirmed by partial sequencing of HA and NA genes. The cleavage site motif is PEIPKGR GLF, which is indicative of a low pathogenic phenotype of the virus.

The chickens in one of 3 houses showed decreased production and slightly increased mortality. The veterinarian decided to submit trachea and cloaca swabs to exclude avian influenza (AI). In the Netherlands, submission of samples without involving the authorities is allowed under the umbrella of an AI syndromic surveillance programme, enabling veterinarians to submit samples for differential diagnosis of AI if he/she suspects that other pathogens most likely induced the clinical signs.

Since the infected farm has free ranging facilities, the virus most likely was introduced from wild birds. Although clinical signs were seen in one house, samples collected in all houses tested positive in the influenza A (matrix) and H7 PCR.

A surveillance zone of 1 km was establish, and the 3 farms located within this zone will be screened in due course. Results of the screening are expected before the weekend.

In the Netherlands, an intensive serological monitoring programme is conducted by the GD Animal Health Service (Deventer, NL) commissioned by the Dutch Production Boards (PPE). All poultry farms are tested at least once a year, farms considered at risk for AI such as free ranging farms 4 [times a year], and turkey farms twice a year. As a result, we have detailed information of AI introductions and spread. Mainly, AI viruses of subtypes other than H5 and H7 are detected. In most cases, viruses did not spread to other farms even when located in poultry-dense regions, or spread was very limited. Based on this knowledge, we expect the infection to be limited to a single farm (Gonzales JL, et al. Influenza Other Respi Viruses. 2013;7: 6-10).

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Koch for the above firsthand, detailed, transparent information on the diagnostic and epidemiological aspects of the current LPAI H7N7 outbreak in Lochem.

The outbreak has been duly reported to the OIE by the Dutch CVO, Dr Christianne Bruschke, in an immediate notification dated 13 Mar 2013, which includes the following additional data:

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 80 152 / 200 / 0 / 80 152 / 0

Epidemiological comments:
On 12 Mar 2013, a 1 km protection zone has been established. In this 1 km zone, there are 3 premises which will be screened.

The full OIE notification, which includes also details of the applied control measures and an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13128. - Mod.AS
