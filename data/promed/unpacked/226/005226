Tver veterinary laboratory specialists confirmed brucellosis in 7 out of 10 samples obtained from small ruminants in the village Danilovsk, Kalininsky district.

The information about the outbreak is being sent to the department of veterinary surveillance of the Tver and Pskov regions to initiate prevention measures addressing further spread of infection.

[The term "small ruminants", applied in the media report above, refers to goats (caprines) and sheep (ovines) combined. These 2 species share a common title name, also in several Middle Eastern countries, probably because many flocks are composed of both.

_Brucella melitensis_ (biovars 1, 2, or 3) is the main causative agent of 'caprine and ovine brucellosis'. Sporadic cases caused by _B. abortus_ have been rarely observed in these species.

Clinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.

Presumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

_Brucella melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. All infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. _B. melitensis_ is included in OIE list of reportable diseases/pathogens.

_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are Northern and Central Europe, South-East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Southern and some central territories of the Russian Federation are long known to be infected by _B. melitensis_. The most recent Russian periodic report to the OIE, covering January-June 2014, mentions 19 new outbreaks (total of 30). In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).

According to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 "Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009" in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.

"However", the authors of Ref 1 say, "relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District."

"In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:
- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,
- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),
- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,
- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,
- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories."

Additional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.
