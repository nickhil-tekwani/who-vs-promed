_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria were involved in the deaths of 8 patients in the Gaia Hospital, a neighboring town of Porto (Portugal). 30 patients are also infected, but most without symptoms.

Margarida Mota, head of hospital infection control, reported at a press conference on Wed 14 Oct 2015, that it is difficult to attribute these 8 deaths to the bacteria, as the patients were admitted with very serious illnesses.

"A direct link between the bacteria and the deaths can only be established in 3 patients, and not even at 100 percent," said Mota, who noted that some cases were terminally ill with cancer. There are 13 patients still in isolation "as a precaution" because they have surgical drains, "which [increase the risk] of infection."

In total, the hospital has monitored 44 people who could have been in contact with the bacteria. It was detected in 30 of them, "but only 8 had clinical manifestations." These 8 people are not the 8 who died.

Mota said the hospital conditions are not "ideal" and that "it cannot be said that the situation is under control."

The KPC bacterium, discovered in the hospital on 7 Aug 2015, is highly resistant to antibiotics. It is found in the human gut and produces an enzyme that destroys antibiotics. It mainly affects weak persons and patients with surgical drains. It is transmitted through contact with secretions [of infected patients], and [contaminated] instruments and gloves of healthcare personnel. Symptoms include fever, hypothermia, tachycardia, and respiratory problems.

[_Klebsiella_ species, particularly _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Klebsiella oxytoca_, are frequent nosocomial pathogens, causing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicemia, surgical wound sites, meningitis, and bacterial endophthalmitis. The presence of invasive devices such as IV catheters, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, and use of antibiotics are factors that increase the likelihood of nosocomial infection with _Klebsiella_ species. The primary pathogenic reservoirs for transmission are the gastrointestinal tract and the hands of hospital personnel. _Klebsiella_ can spread rapidly, often leading to clonal nosocomial outbreaks, which may be caused by multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ spp, especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) or _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC)-producers.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) are plasmid-encoded enzymes 1st found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). KPCs are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. KPCs also hydrolyze all other beta-lactam antibiotics, and consequently KPC-producing organisms are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. KPC-producing organisms are also resistant to multiple other classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones due to linked resistance genes.

KPCs have also been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs are now commonly encountered in the USA, and have also been reported worldwide. Often breaks in infection control practices are found to have facilitated nosocomial outbreaks.

Porto, also known as Oporto in English, located in Northern Portugal, with a population of 1.4 million in 2011, is the 2nd-largest city in Portugal, after Lisbon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto).
