The federal health minister, Dr Tabitha Butrus, has stated that 7690
meningitis cases have been reported in the south during the period from Jan
2007 to the end of Mar 2007, pointing out that the high tide of the disease
is now receding following the rainfalls.
The health minister further revealed that 1405 meningitis cases have been
recorded in the northern states during the period from Jan 2007 to the
first week of May 2007, explaining that fatalities rate reached 6.2 per
cent as compared to the international average of 10-15 per cent.
In response to a query yesterday made at the national assembly on the
spread of the disease, Dr Tabitha stressed that her ministry, aided by
international organizations, has mobilized efforts for controling the
disease through availing medications and organizing vaccination campaigns.
She, on the other hand, had denied that the cases so far listed, Kassala,
North Kordofan, and South Darfur, as 95 cases and 5 fatalities were
recorded in Kassala, 61 cases and 4 fatalities in Gadaref and 92 cases and
4 fatalities in South Kordofan. [A further report to clarify this statement
would be appreciated. - Mod.SH]
Referring to the marked shortage in meningitis vaccines, Tabitha argued
that the world is suffering an acute shortage of those vaccines for reasons
related to quality the vaccines produced by the main plant in France. She
disclosed that 812 500 doses have been dispensed during the vaccination
campaigns while GOSS Health Ministry has provided 180 000 doses to be used
for northern states following the ebb of the disease in the south.

Reports indicate that scores of infected persons have died of meningitis at
different hospitals in Jigawa State, while several others died at homes in
Dutse, Kazaure, Gumel, Birnin-Kudu, Hadejia and Ringim Local Government
Areas of the state.
Confirming the incident, the chief medical director of Birnin Kudu Federal
Medical Centre (FMC), Dr Bashir Umar said about 16 per cent of those
diagnosed with the disease that also come from neighboring states to the
hospital have already died as a result of the severity of the infection.
He said 4 infants were confirmed dead in a spate of 90 days at the FMC due
to the ravaging effect of the disease in Ningi Local Government of Bauchi
and Takai Local Kovernment Area of Kano State, adding that the hospital
management was compelled by the circumstance to write to the head of the
department, Birnin Kudu Primary Health Care, alerting it of the increase of
the incidence in the area.
Vanguard reported that the state commissioner for information, Alhaji
Muktar Birniwa, had in a press briefing last week denied the outbreak of
the disease in the area, stating that only neighboring states with Jigawa
were officially confirmed to experience the outbreak.
