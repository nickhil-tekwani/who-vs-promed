O'nyong-nyong (ONN) fever - Uganda:
[This article reports on an outbreak of O'nyong-nyong (ONN) fever that
was first noted in June 1996, in the Rakai District in south-central
Uganda. - In early February 1997, a new focus of suspected fever cases
in west-central Uganda was reported and by late February, similar
unconfirmed reports were received from western Kenya.
ONN virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that, during 1959-1962, caused
a central African pandemic which began in northern Uganda and
ultimately involved an estimated 2 million persons in an area
extending from Mozambique to Senegal. Geographical extension of the
epidemic is thought to have been largely due to the movement of viremic
humans. Although mortality due to ONN fever was never documented,
short-term morbidity was significant. The primary epidemic mosquito
vectors were shown to be the region's major malaria vectors,
_Anopheles gambiae_ and _An. funestus_. The natural reservoir hosts of ONN
virus are unknown.
