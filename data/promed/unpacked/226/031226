[Please note that there may be discrepancies between the various
sources of information due to different times of "closure" of daily
figures reported. Times of daily report closures where known are
listed in the table of contents below. Oftentimes a newswire will
mention a confirmed case in a location that has not been on the
official reporting entity list as the confirmation arrived after
closure of the day's report. As the number of reports has been
increasing, we are changing the format of the tables to give the
cumulative cases reported by the weeks ending on Fridays (1 May 2009,
8 May 2009, 15 May 2009) and then daily for the current week of
reporting. The daily summaries for prior dates can be found in all
"case count" postings ending with Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide
