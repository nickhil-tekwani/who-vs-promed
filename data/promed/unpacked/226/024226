Yield loss associated with soya bean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ Syd.) in
Uganda
-----------------------------------------
RS Kawuki, E Adipala <acss@starcom.co.ug>, P Tukamuhabwa. Department of
Crop Science, Makerere University, PO Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda. Received
12 Jul 2002; accepted 9 Oct 2002
Studies were conducted to quantify yield loss attributable to soya bean
rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, of soya bean (_Glycine max_), which
is a new and emerging disease in Uganda. Data was collected from 3
consecutive seasons in the central, eastern, northern, and western parts of
the country, using 3 commercial varieties (Nam 1, Nam 2, and Namsoy 3) and
2 elite varieties (UG-5 and GC-00138-29).
The commercial varieties recorded higher yield losses (26.9-36.3 per cent)
and higher rust severities >50 per cent, whereas the elite varieties
recorded lower yield losses of <10 per cent and rust severities of <30 per
cent. Yield losses were highest in the central region of Uganda (22.9 per
cent) and lowest in the northern region (15.1 per cent).
Yield losses differed significantly between seasons and were associated
with reduction in seed weight and filled pod per plant.

[This is apparently the first report of soybean rust in Uganda. Given the
marked distinction between commercial and elite lines with regard to
soybean yield, I asked Professor Adipala Ekwamu whether the elite soybean
lines were essentially breeding lines for use in increasing yields, or were
they lines to be used for commercial soybean production. He responded that
elite lines UG-5 and GC-00138-29 were introduced as breeding lines. After
satisfactory evaluation, these lines have been adopted in the breeding
program to improve the 3 commercial varieties that are highly susceptible
to rust. However, some soybean farmers in eastern Uganda have adopted them
as suitable substitutes for the previous commercial varieties, which are
being abandoned. - Mod.DH]
