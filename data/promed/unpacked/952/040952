An outbreak of leishmaniasis [cutaneous], a skin disease caused by the bite of a sandfly, has been reported in parts of the Balochistan province. "Over 8000 cases of the disease from different parts of the province have so far been reported in a few days to the health department," director general health Balochistan Dr Noor Mohammad Qazi told the media on Monday [21 Mar 2022]. He said the number of leishmaniasis patients was expected to rise in the coming days due to the non-availability of preventive injections.

The [glucantime injection] is used against the disease, but the Health Department was unable to purchase it as it was not registered by the Drug Regulatory Authority Pakistan, he added. He said leishmaniasis was endemic in the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan and some other parts of the country. It was reported in Sindh for the first time in 2000, and since then its cases have been mounting. "We have contacted the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for the immediate supply of the [glucantime] injections, and they have agreed to extend all-out support," he added.

The DG Health said 6 districts of Quetta, Qilla Abdullah, Qilla Saifullah, Jaffarabad, Zhob, and Kech were at high risk. Some 2317 cases of leishmaniasis were reported from Quetta, 1774 from Jaffarabad, 1906 from Qilla Abdullah, and 1649 from Kech district.

The health authorities of the districts have been directed to submit the data of patients so that the department could plan effective interventions, Dr Asfand Yar, WHO provincial officer in Balochistan told a meeting chaired by DG Health Balochistan on the leishmaniasis outbreak in the province. "We are going to establish 3 medical centers each in Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, and Zhob districts to provide treatment to the affected people," he said. They had also planned to set up such medical centers in Naseerabad, Lasbella, and Kech districts as well.

It may be mentioned that following the bite of a sandfly, a pimple appears on the skin that grows with time, and persists for a long time. "To control the disease, there is dire need to speed up spraying against the sandfly," the DG Health said. "Due to the large area, it is difficult to cover the entire Balochistan, however, all possible resources will be utilized to effectively control the disease."

[Balochistan has previously been regarded as a low risk area for cutaneous leishmaniasis (Alvar J et al and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671. Pakistan Suppl. S70; available at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). This report implies a rapidly spreading epidemic in Balochistan.
However, there is no systematic, government-supported control program (Mursalin SM. Leishmania disease gap analysis study -- Pakistan. Int J Infect Dis. 2016; 45 (Suppl.1): 185; available at https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)30410-6/fulltext).
Control relies on vector control (transmission by the sandfly _Phlebotomus_ spp) and control of the rodent reservoir. - Mod.EP
