The cause of the mass deaths of birds in lake Tagar, Minusinsk
District of Krasnoyarsk, is to be investigated. On the shores of the
lake, more than 100 wild ducks have been found dead. Sick birds were
seen as well.

Specialists of Rosselkhoznadzor are investigating the event, putting
the lake under a monitoring regime and collecting samples to determine
the causes of illness and death of the birds.

This is not the 1st such incident at the lake. In September 2010, more
than 500 birds died there.
