Number of laboratory diagnosed cases of West Nile virus infection and deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The total number of encephalitis and/or meningitis cases with West Nile
virus (WNV) laboratory diagnosis on 12 Aug 2010 are 2 with no deaths. The
total number of cases as of 12 Aug 2010 is 34 with 2 deaths (West Nile
virus infection manifestations do not differ from those caused by a variety
of other viruses. Therefore, diagnosis is based on laboratory testing.
Consequently, cases are recorded by date of laboratory diagnosis rather
than by date of disease onset or hospital admission.)
