[2] Infant development

Wheeler AC. Development of infants with congenital Zika syndrome: what do we know and what can we expect? Pediatrics 2018; 141 (Supplement 2) S154-S160; doi: 10.1542/peds.2017-2038D
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and severe birth defects in infants has led to worldwide attention focused on the mechanisms of the disease and the prevention of future exposure. Surveillance efforts around the world continue with the goal of identifying and monitoring all potentially exposed women and their newborns. For infants who were born with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and their families, an uncertain future awaits. As infants who were born with CZS during the most recent outbreak enter their 2nd year of life, new developments in the outcomes of the condition continue to unfold, providing some insight into the likely long-term sequelae. In this article, I review the literature on emerging findings regarding the impact of CZS on the developing infant and provide some predictions regarding the long-term outcomes and lifetime needs of these children and their families.

[This article addresses the following themes:]
- Impact of Zika on the developing brain
- Likely impact on cognitive development
- Likely impact on communication skills
- Likely impact on motor development
- Likely impact on behavior
- Likely impact on functional skill development
- Discussion and implications for pediatricians

[The adverse social and economic consequences for these CZS infants and their families is yet to be fully understood and quantified. These adverse effects will be most severely felt in areas where families with CZS infants have limited financial resources and live in areas with little or no social safety nets in South And Central America. Pediatricians and others interested in this topic are urged to read the full article. - Mod.TY]

[3] Silent pathology in fetal brain

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.

[The finding that that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, provides an incentive for prospective follow up studies on human infants infected with the virus in utero who do not have microcephaly to determine if they have other teratogenic effects. - Mod.TY]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.

Seferovic M, Sánchez-San Martín C, Tardif SD, et al. Experimental Zika virus infection in the pregnant common marmoset induces spontaneous fetal loss and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. doi: bioRxiv 259317
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
During its most recent outbreak across the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) was surprisingly shown to cause fetal loss and congenital malformations in acutely and chronically infected pregnant women. However, understanding the underlying pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant in vivo experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets that faithfully recapitulates human disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous pregnancy loss was observed 16-18 days post-infection, with extensive active placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.

[This marmoset model is very promising for studies on the physiopathology of Zika virus infections in pregnancy. Although some previous studies have been done in pregnant rhesus macaque monkeys (see Zika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Middle East, research 20170529.5069572) and in a in a pregnant pigtail macaque (see Zika virus (49): Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East, research, notes 20160915.4491053), marmosets are smaller and more easily handled. It will be interesting to see if marmosets are suitable for additional studies on host-virus relationship, immune responses and drug tests. - Mod.TY]
