All the 168 live poultry markets in Beijing were shut yesterday as
the authorities beefed up efforts to contain the spread of the bird
flu virus. The municipal government also closed pet-bird markets,
banned the raising of chickens in urban areas, and asked citizens to
keep their pigeons in cages.
Residents have been told to vaccinate all animals, including pets,
against bird flu and foot-and-mouth disease; and those who refuse to
do so can be taken into custody or fined.
The tough measures in the capital are being replicated around the
country as a meeting of hundreds of international experts opened in
Geneva with warnings that a global human flu pandemic is inevitable.
"It is only a matter of time before an avian flu virus ... acquires
the ability to be transmitted from human to human, sparking the
outbreak of human pandemic influenza," World Health Organization
Director General Lee Jong-wook told the gathering.
China has not reported any human case of bird flu, but the
authorities on Sunday would not rule out that 3 people could have
been infected in Xiangtan, Central China's Hunan Province. One of the
3, a 12-year-old girl died last month, while her 9-year-old brother
and a 36-year-old middle school teacher are reported to have
recovered.
The World Bank report said previous studies on flu pandemics had
suggested any new outbreak could kill between 100 000 and 200 000
people in the United States alone, which it said translated into
economic losses for the country of between USD 100 billion and USD
200 billion.
"If we extrapolate from the US to all high-income countries, there
could be a present-value loss of USD 550 billion. The loss for the
world would, of course, be significantly larger, because of the
impact in the developing world," the report said.
Authorities in China are taking such dire warnings seriously as
evidenced by a string of measures. Health Minister Gao Qiang
yesterday ordered health departments across the country to act
quickly in the prevention and control of human infection of bird flu.
Addressing a nationally televised conference, Gao told them to
strengthen work in monitoring, control and treatment, stressing that
rapid response is crucial.

All live poultry trade and downtown poultry feeding was temporarily
suspended in Beijing as of Monday, an effort by the municipal
authority to prevent an outbreak of bird flu.
In compliance with the central government's measures against bird
flu, Beijing has suspended poultry trading and culling in all its 168
markets, poultry feeding in downtown areas, and poultry imports from
regions outside the national capital, according to the headquarters
in charge of vital animal epidemic prevention and control.
The municipal government also ordered the closing of bird markets,
the cessation of domesticated pigeon flying, and the quarantine of
imported poultry products through land, railroad and air. Officials
with the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Bureau said those who
disobey the orders will face stern penalties.
The Chinese central government has committed to allocating 2 billion
yuan (25 million US dollars) out of 2005's central budget to set up a
bird flu prevention and control fund and create a national
headquarters to supervise the work.
China has slaughtered innumerable sick poultry after bird flu was
spotted in various regions this year.
So far China's Ministry of Health has reported 3 pneumonia cases with
unidentified causes in Xiangtan County, central-south China's Hunan
Province, where an H5N1 bird flu epidemic broke out recently.
Experts said they would not rule out the possibility of human
infection by the deadly H5N1 bird flu, according to a spokesman for
the ministry.

China's Health Minister Gao Qiang on Monday [7 Nov 2005] ordered
health departments across the country to act quickly in the
prevention and control of human infection with bird flu.
Addressing a nationally televised conference, Gao ordered them to
strengthen work [in 3 key areas], namely monitoring, control, and
treatment, stressing that early action is crucial in all of them.
"The health departments should work synchronously with the
agricultural departments once they learn about the outbreak of an
epidemic among animals," said Gao. He said health personnel should
arrive at the spot, conduct an investigation, and proceed to handle
the epidemic at the same time, together with personnel from the
agricultural departments.
He ordered the health departments to maintain an efficient
information-sharing mechanism with relevant departments, including
civil aviation and transportation departments, to ensure quick action.
Gao said in case any humans are infected with bird flu, the health
personnel should [use] traditional Chinese medicines [in] treating
them. "There should also be an expert panel to provide technical
support," he said.
Gao also stressed the importance of promoting publicity of epidemic
prevention knowledge and actively strengthening international and
regional cooperation.
The ministry has invited the World Health Organization to support the
ongoing investigation of 3 cases in Hunan Province currently
diagnosed as "pneumonia of unknown causes."
"After conducting comprehensive analysis, experts said although the 3
cases are diagnosed as pneumonia of unknown causes at present, the
possibility of human infection by the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain
of bird flu cannot be ruled out," a spokesman for the ministry said
on Sunday.
A dialogue is underway between China and the WHO to determine what
this assistance should be, according to WHO's Beijing Office on
Monday.

People feeding pigeons or ducks face a hefty fine in Hong Kong, where
authorities, fearing an outbreak of avian flu, are trying to reduce
human contact with wild birds.
A HKD 1500 (USD 260) fine will be slapped on anyone caught throwing
bread crusts or other food scraps to the city's flocks of birds. The
move comes as concerns mount that feral and migratory birds may be
spreading the H5N1 flu virus to poultry flocks around the world.
"The droppings of feral pigeons may help spread harmful germs,"
deputy director of housing Lau Kai-hung said in a statement today.
"The safest and most effective, economical and humane way to minimise
congregation of pigeons is to avoid feeding them," he said.
The measure is an extension of littering and environmental hygiene
laws introduced in 2003 after an outbreak of the pneumonia-like
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed almost 300
people.
More than 60 people have died in Asia after contracting the lethal
strain of avian flu through contact with farm chickens or ducks.

[The swift actions and severe control measures applied by the Chinese
authorities, which follow the published detection of 3 suspected
human cases, underline the seriousness with which the Chinese
authorities view the current situation. Details of the performed
(negative) tests, carried out on the samples from the 3 human cases,
will be appreciated. The final results of the repeated tests,
reportedly to be performed in cooperation with WHO, are urgently
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
