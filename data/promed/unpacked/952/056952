Update: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003
-----------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local
health departments continue to investigate cases of monkeypox among people
who had close contact with wild or exotic mammalian pets or people with
monkeypox (1). This report updates epidemiological, laboratory, and animal
data for US cases.
Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
As of 18 Jun 2003, a total of 87 cases of monkeypox have been reported to
CDC from Wisconsin (38), Indiana (24), Illinois (19), Ohio (4), Kansas (1),
and Missouri (1). Of the 87 cases, 41 were males. The median age for the 82
patients for whom age data were available was 28 years (range: 1 to 55
years). Data on symptom onset were available for 78 persons [shown
graphically in the original report]).
Among the 75 patients for whom data were available, 20 were admitted to
hospital. The majority of patients were not seriously ill; some were
admitted to facilitate proper isolation.
Twenty cases were laboratory confirmed at CDC [data tabulated in the
original report]. Among these 20, one was a child admitted to hospital with
severe encephalitis 3 days after developing a vesicular rash, which was
originally thought to be varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Diagnostic testing
for VZV and for herpes simplex virus in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and
skin lesion biopsy was negative. A skin lesion biopsy was positive for
monkeypox DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for orthopox antigens
by immunohistochemical (IHC) testing.
The majority of patients had direct or close contact with wild or exotic
mammals such as prairie dogs (_Cynomys_ sp.). In one instance, 28 children
attending a day care facility in Indiana were potentially exposed to 2
prairie dogs that subsequently became ill and died; 12 reported handling or
petting the prairie dogs, and 7 subsequently became ill with symptoms
consistent with monkeypox infection. Laboratory evaluation of these
children is in progress.
Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Clinical specimens obtained from 82 patients in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
and Wisconsin were forwarded to CDC for testing. Twenty of 27 patients with
skin rash-lesion specimens were laboratory confirmed for monkeypox by viral
isolation, PCR, electron microscopy, and/or IHC; four were negative for
monkeypox virus; one patient was found to have varicella by PCR testing;
and 2 are pending. Two health care workers in Wisconsin who were suspected
initially of acquiring disease by human-to-human transmission had no
evidence of monkeypox-specific DNA signatures in blood and nasopharyngeal
and/or oropharyngeal swabs; culture results are pending. These people did
not have a rash, and IgM testing has not revealed any anti-orthopoxvirus
immune reactivity.
Animal investigation
--------------------
Traceback investigations of animals are ongoing to identify how monkeypox
virus was introduced into the US. Preliminary results have determined that
an animal vendor in Wisconsin (distributor A) sold prairie dogs to the
index patient in Wisconsin; this vendor had obtained prairie dogs from an
animal vendor in Illinois (distributor B), who had housed prairie dogs and
Gambian giant rats (_Cricetomys_ sp.) in close proximity.
Because Gambian giant rats often are imported from regions of Africa where
monkeypox is endemic, traceback investigations of the Gambian giant rats
were initiated. These investigations identified a shipment of animals from
Ghana, including Gambian giant rats that were delivered to a Texas animal
importer (distributor C) on 9 Apr 2003. Distributor C's Gambian giant rats
were sold subsequently to an Iowa animal vendor on 15 Apr 2003 (distributor
D) who in turn supplied them to distributor B. The shipment of animals from
Ghana contained about 800 small mammals of nine different species,
including 6 genera of African rodents that might have been the source of
introduction of monkeypox. These rodent genera included rope squirrels
(_Funiscuirus_ sp.), tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_ sp.), Gambian giant
rats, brushtail porcupines (_Atherurus_ sp.), dormice (_Graphiurus_ sp.),
and striped mice (_Hybomys_ sp.). Laboratory testing of animals from the 9
Apr 2003 importation from Africa is underway to determine which, if any,
animals in the shipment might have introduced the virus into the US.
On the basis of the epidemiological link between the shipment from Ghana
and distributor B, trace-forward investigations have been initiated to
locate animal vendors and owners who purchased imported African rodents
from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment or purchased prairie dogs from distributors A,
B, C, and D after 15 Apr 2003. In addition to routine sales by animal
vendors, animals also were sold or traded at "swap meets" (that is,
gatherings of animal traders, exhibitors, and buyers). An investigation of
distributor B revealed that infected prairie dogs from this animal vendor
might have been sold or traded at swap meets to unidentified buyers in
Schaumburg, Illinois, on 20 Apr 2003, 3 May 2003, and 18 May 2003;
Indianapolis, Indiana, on 27 Apr 2003 and 18 May 2003; and Columbus, Ohio,
on 19 Apr 2003. In addition, distributor A sold infected prairie dogs at a
swap meet in Wausau, Wisconsin, on 11 May 2003. In several instances,
identifying individuals who purchased animals has been impossible. Invoices
and other records are incomplete for many of these sales, especially those
transacted at swap meets.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Preliminary findings from these investigations suggest that the primary
route of monkeypox transmission to humans is from close contact with
infected wild and exotic mammalian pets. Person-to-person transmission has
not been identified in this outbreak. Investigations are underway to assess
the possibility of secondary transmission among health care workers and
household contacts exposed to patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox
infection.
Compared with previous reports of monkeypox among persons in central Africa
(2), the illness associated with the current outbreak in the US has been
relatively mild. Monkeypox infection in adults has been described rarely in
Africa; among adults, previous vaccination against smallpox might attenuate
clinical illness (3). The report of encephalitis in a child indicates the
potentially serious consequences of the disease.
Because suspected cases of monkeypox might actually represent varicella
infections, patients should be assessed for history of varicella or having
received varicella vaccine. Rash illness suspected to be monkeypox should
be confirmed by laboratory evaluation, particularly if use of smallpox
vaccine is being considered for purposes of monkeypox outbreak control. CDC
has issued interim recommendations for use of smallpox vaccine, cidofovir,
and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) for prevention and treatment in the
setting of outbreaks of monkeypox infections (4).
Health care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who
suspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their
state and local health departments. CDC requests that reports of suspect
cases from state health departments be directed to the CDC Emergency
Operations Center, telephone 770-488-7100. Additional information about
