A disease diagnostic visit was carried out by a team of experts to affected paddy fields at Budgam and Chadoora sub divisions [of Budgam district]. The observations include that at all the places the paddy fields were found affected with rice blast disease. "As enquired from farmers, no disease management practice was adopted in the affected fields. Disease incidence ranging from 10 to 30 per cent and intensity of 3.5 to 17.6 per cent was recorded in China varieties," [a spokesperson] added.

The probable causes of [the] outbreak, as per experts, are: cultivation of varieties susceptible to blast, use of own saved seed, no management practice applied. The team has recommended immediate spray of [fungicide].

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilisers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread with infected plant material (including seed), by mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed, as mentioned above, would pose a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

Kashmir has been using rice cultivars from China for a long time. The pathogen strains in that area have been shown to be more closely related to Chinese and Japanese variants than to other Indian ones (ProMED-mail post 20160407.4145967). This would indicate that these strains were imported into Kashmir together with the host and that resistant rice cultivars developed in China or Japan may be a useful resource for developing resistant varieties suitable for Kashmir.
