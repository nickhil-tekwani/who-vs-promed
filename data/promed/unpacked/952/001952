Tenth addict dies from mystery illness
-------------------------------------

A tenth person has died from a mystery illness which has been spreading
among Glasgow drug users. The man, who has not been named, died in the
city's Stobhill Hospital on Tuesday morning.

A Greater Glasgow Health Board spokeswoman said the death meant eight women
and two men have now lost their lives to the condition. Both police and
doctors have been continuing to investigate the outbreak which has resulted
in 20 known cases.

A number of addicts have been treated in hospital, although their
conditions were not said to be giving cause for concern.

The possibility of a contaminated batch of the drug has been undergoing
examination by police and health officials. Tests for infection have so far
proved negative, the spokeswoman said, adding that there was no evidence
that the illness was spread from person to person and the wider community
was not at risk.

GPs, accident and emergency departments and services for drug users have
been alerted to the situation.

Fears over the mystery illness reached Fife on Monday when police there
issued a warning about the possibility of contaminated heroin circulating
in the area. However, the force said there was no suggestion of a
connection with the deaths in Glasgow.
