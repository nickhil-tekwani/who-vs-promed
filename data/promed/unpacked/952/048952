SALMONELLA, FINCHES - COLORADO (USA)
======================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD: Salmonella, Finches - Austria
Two years ago, the western US experienced a significant epizootic of
salmonellosis in Pine Siskins and a few other types of finches. S.
typhimurium was isolated from most cases. The typical pathology included
a necrotizing ingluviitis (inflammation of the crop)- which was the most
consistent lesion. Observation of the birds revealed that the ill ones
(presumably also having ingluviitis) would regurgitate feed at bird
feeders and other birds would eventually pick up the infected seed or
other infectious material. It would not be uncommon to find multiple
birds at a single feeder dead or ill.
The Colorado Division of Wildlife and local birding societies distributed
information on clinical signs and what to do with dead birds. Also, they
provided reccomendations for stopping feeding where birds had been
affected, "sterilizing" the feeders, etc.
The efforts seem to have paid off (so far as we know) as there have been
a minimal number of cases since then. People who have been involved with
wildlife in Colorado say that there may be a long term cyclic nature to
this particular epizootic.
Regards,
Dave
