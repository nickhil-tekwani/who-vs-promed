Tuha Oilfield Hospital has diagnosed a case of black fever [visceral
leishmaniasis], extremely rare in the Hami region of Xinjiang for
more than 40 years. After a period of isolation and treatment, the
young Uygur patient's condition is stable, all pathological
indicators have clearly improved, and he has been discharged from hospital.

[Visceral leishmaniasis or Kala Azar was highly prevalent in China
but has been effectively controlled since 1958. Only sporadic cases
occur in the hilly and newly reclaimed desert areas in northwestern
China (Zhi-Biao X. Present situation of visceral leishmaniasis in
China. Parasitol Today 1989;5: 224-8).
Genetic typing of recent cases from Xinjiang province has found that
Kala Azar from eastern China is similar to that from India (Lu DM, Hu
XS, Qiao ZD. Analysis of _Leishmania_ species and strains from China
by RAPD [random amplification of polymorphic DNA] technique [article
in Chinese]. Zhongguo Ji Sheng Chong Xue Yu Ji Sheng Chong Bing Za
Zhi 2001;19(5): 290-3).
A review of leishmaniasis in China concluded that apart from sporadic
cases in Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia, leishmaniasis had been
brought under control in China (Guan LR. Current status of Kala Azar
and vector control in China. Bull World Health Organ 1991;69: 595-601).
It should be noted that leishmaniasis is also found in neighboring
Kazakhstan. - Mod.EP
