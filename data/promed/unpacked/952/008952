Santa Catarina has recorded its 1st case of human rabies in 38 years.

The Office of Epidemiological Surveillance of Santa Catarina (DIVE/SC), linked to the Superintendence of Health Surveillance (SUV) of the State Health Department (SES/SC), reports that laboratory diagnosis was confirmed by the Laboratory Institute Pasteur as rabies for the death of a 58-year-old woman living in a rural area of the municipality of Gravatal, last Saturday (4 May 2019).

The samples were sent to Sao Paulo by the Central Laboratory of Public Health (LACEN/SC). Santa Catarina had not registered cases of rabies in humans since 1981, when a patient from Ponte Serrada was a victim of the disease. The last cases of rabies in dogs and cats were recorded in 2006, in the municipalities of Xanxere (1 dog and 1 cat), Itajai (1 dog), and in 2016, in Jabora (1 dog).

DIVE/SC technicians were present on Mon 6 May 2019 in the municipality of Tubarao meeting with the Regional Health Management, the Municipal Health Department of Gravatal and Capivari de Baixo, CIDASC (Integrated Company for Agricultural Development of Santa Catarina) and UNISUL for the development of actions, according to the protocol of the Ministry of Health, considering Santa Catarina is a controlled area for animal rabies in the urban cycle. The actions involve home-to-house vaccinations of dogs and cats within a 5-mile radius from the patient's home as well as active search for sick and dead animals and population orientation. "In addition, if a person is attacked by a dog or any other animal, it is very important to seek health services even if the injury is not serious, as there may be a need to take the vaccine against rabies," says John Fuck, manager of Zoonoses of Dive/SC.

Vaccination of all dogs and cats is the most effective form of protection against the disease. The vaccination is expected to begin on Thu 9 May 2019. The population of Gravatal and Capivari de Baixo can search for more detailed information about the action directly at the Municipal Health Department. DIVE/SC has already requested 10 000 doses of rabies vaccine for the vaccination scheme.

According to the veterinarian of DIVE/SC, Alexandra Schlickmann Pereira, the population should be attentive to the strange behavior of their pets. "Any change in behavior such as restlessness, increased aggression, limb paralysis and photophobia (sensitivity to light) should be observed and reported to the Municipal Health Department," he warns.

Rabies is a transmissible disease affecting mammals such as dogs, cats, oxen, horses, monkeys, bats and humans when the saliva of the infected animal comes into contact with the skin or mucosal membranes such as eyes, by biting, scratching or licking of the animal. The virus attacks the central nervous system, leading to death after a short time of incubation. Rabies has no established cure (there are only 3 known cases of cure in the world, one in Brazil), and the only way to prevent it is through the vaccine.

[As the article points out, survival is extremely rare once a person shows symptoms after being bitten by a rabid animal, even with treatment.

Rabies post-exposure vaccinations
------------------------------
For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.

The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

There is no recognized value in administering rabies immune globulin greater than 7 days after initiating a vaccine course, since vaccine-induced antibodies begin to appear within one week.
