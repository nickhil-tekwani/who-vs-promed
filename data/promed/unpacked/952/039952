A total of 32 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O121 have been reported from 18 states. 5 additional ill persons have been reported from California (1), Colorado (1), Florida (2), and Ohio (1).

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 30 Dec 2012 to 2 Apr 2013. Ill persons range in age from 1 year to 75 years, with a median age of 17 years. 81 percent of ill persons are 21 years of age or younger. 56 percent of ill persons are female. Among 26 persons with available information, 9 (35 percent) reported being hospitalized. 2 ill people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, but no deaths have been reported.

Investigation Update
--------------------
20 (100 percent) of 20 ill persons interviewed reported consuming frozen food products. 10 (63 percent) of 16 ill persons reported consuming Farm Rich brand frozen food products. Investigations are ongoing to determine the specific types and sources of frozen food that might be linked with illness, as well as to determine which particular ingredients or components of these products may be contaminated.
Testing conducted by the Outbreaks Section of the USDA-FSIS Eastern Laboratory identified the outbreak strain of EHEC O121 from individually wrapped Farm Rich brand frozen mini pizza slices from an opened package collected from an ill person's home in Texas. The frozen mini pizza slices were included in the products that were recalled on 28 Mar 2013.
