Unidentified chickpea disease found near Pittsworth
---------------------------------------------------
A southern Queensland agronomist is keeping a watching brief on
chickpea crops around Pittsworth after he found an unfamiliar plant
disease. Hugh Reardon-Smith says he has sent away tests but they've
not yet identified the problem.

Chickpea farmers in battle to defend crop
-----------------------------------------
Chickpea farmers in the state's central and northwest are facing
increasing pressure in their battle against a worsening ascochyta
outbreak [see ProMED-mail post 20100802.2589]. The fungal disease can
kill chickpea crops and is difficult to remove once it sets in.

Chickpeas are worth millions of dollars to the NSW [New South Wales]
crop industry and farmers are doing their best to defend the crop.
But plant pathologist Kevin Moore says the continuous rain is
hampering their efforts. "The crops are doing it tough because it's
very wet. It's favouring the ascochyta fungus causing growers much concern."

Dr Moore says farmers are having to weigh up whether it is
financially worthwhile to continue spraying the disease.

Ascochyta blight found in chickpeas on the Darling Downs
--------------------------------------------------------
A devastating crop disease that occurs in chickpeas has been
confirmed on the Darling Downs after serious incursions in New South
Wales [ProMED-mail post 20100802.2589]. The pulse industry's peak
body says the recent rain has created the right conditions for
ascochyta blight.

The northern region, from Dubbo in New South Wales to Emerald in
Central Queensland, has seen a record chickpea planting of 400 000
hectares [988 acres]. Pulse Australia says growers should keep an eye
on their crops, especially if they scored some rain.

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Ascochyta
rabiei_ and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas
worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and
is specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool,
wet conditions. Symptoms include spots and lesions on leaves, stems,
and pods which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may
break off and the plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled,
spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2
years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high
humidity. It is seed borne at a high rate of 50-80 percent. Seed
transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and
worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed
treatment, prophylactic fungicide applications, and use of varieties
with improved resistance. The current unusually wet season in eastern
Australia favours pathogen development and spread, as well as
hindering application and effectiveness of fungicides.

A number of other fungal as well as viral diseases are known to
affect chickpeas in Australia. Reliable diagnosis is essential to
address the problems reported in item 1.
