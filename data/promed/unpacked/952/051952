[The event reported in posting 20140402.2374768, which seemed synchronic in humans and chickens, presented a need to exclude a zoonotic etiology, with special reference to avian influenza, which has been definitely excluded. Commendably, appropriate precautionary measures have been applied, in a timely and transparent manner.

It is conceivable to assume that the abrupt feed change, as described, and not an infectious disease, was behind the observed health problem in the chickens.

As David Duffy rightly concludes, "All's well that ends well." - Mod.AS
