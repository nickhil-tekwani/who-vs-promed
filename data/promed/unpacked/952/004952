[According to the information published by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) found at https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Animal/AnimalHealth/Avian_influenza/Pages/default.aspx (last update 7 May 2018):

"On 5 May [2018] a detection of low pathogenic avian influenza H5 has been done in a holding with ducks near the town Vinderup in the municipality of Holstebro in the western part of Jutland.

The population of the holding consists of approximately 9000 ducks and 12 000 ducklings.

There have not been clinical signs of disease among the animals. The ducks were tested in accordance with the Danish surveillance programme for avian influenza in poultry by routine sampling of blood samples.

Following an investigation of tracheal and cloacal swabs, low pathogenic H5 was detected in cloacal swabs by PCR followed by sequencing at the National Veterinary Institute the 5 May 2018.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has established a restricted zone of 1 km [0.6 miles] around the holding and has implemented the necessary measures in accordance with Council Directive 2005/94/EC.

The birds at the infected holding will be killed and destroyed. There has not been any export of either live birds or poultry products from the establishment.

There are no other commercial poultry holdings within the restricted zone 1 km [0.6 mi] around the infected holding." - Mod.CRD
