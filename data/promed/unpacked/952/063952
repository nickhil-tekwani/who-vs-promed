Botswana is investigating the mysterious death of 56 elephants in the past 2 months [March-May 2020]. Authorities have ruled out poaching, as all carcasses were found intact. The country's Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism says 12 elephants were found dead last week in villages in the Okavango Delta panhandle. In March [2020], 44 animals died.

Wildlife officer Dimakatso Ntsebe downplayed the possibility of farmers poisoning the elephants, who tend to eat and stomp on crops.

A local farmer says it is difficult to know the cause of death, but says elephants are a constant menace. "Farmers had a good harvest this year, but they constantly face problems with the encroaching animals," the farmer said. "But it is a rare occurrence (to poison the elephants). It might be something else. We will have to wait for investigations."

Local conservationist Ive Maps says the animals could have died of natural causes. "It is also possible that it is a natural phenomenon from the disease anthrax, which occurs in Botswana occasionally, especially after a good rainy season or a severe drought. Poisoning is not something common up there," Maps said. "I think we should wait for pathology to find out if this is indeed poisoning or a natural anthrax phenomenon."

Fellow conservationist Neil Fitt says if the cause of death was poisoning, other species could be dying, as well. "I wonder why we have not heard reports of other species also dying," he said. "If elephants are eating the poison, then it surely means other things will be eating it."

The public has been urged against consuming meat from dead carcasses.

Botswana has the largest elephant population in Africa, numbering over 130 000 animals.

[These deaths are being investigated, and the preliminary diagnosis of anthrax has yet to be confirmed. This number of "anthrax" deaths in one area in one time period is unusual. But this, to quote Sherlock Holmes, might just be that they have been seen but not observed. We await the result of confirmation with interest. Over the years, we have had many anthrax reports in elephants, but the great majority were in Chobe, never the Okavango Delta area.

This is a very interesting part of northern Botswana, well described by Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okavango_Delta) with useful maps. In brief: The Okavango Delta (or Okavango Grassland) (formerly spelled "Okovango" or "Okovanggo") in Botswana is a swampy inland delta formed where the Okavango River reaches a tectonic trough in the central part of the endorheic basin of the Kalahari. All the water reaching the delta is ultimately evaporated and transpired and does not flow into any sea or ocean. Each year, about 11 cubic km (2.6 cu mi) of water spread over the 6000 to 15 000 sq km (2300-5800 sq mi) area. Some flood waters drain into Lake Ngami. The area was once part of Lake Makgadikgadi, an ancient lake that had mostly dried up by the early Holocene period.

The Okavango is produced by seasonal flooding. The Okavango River drains the summer (January-February) rainfall from the Angola highlands, and the surge flows 1200 km (750 mi) in around one month. The waters then spread over the 250 by 150 km (155 by 93 mi) area of the delta over the next 4 months (March-June). The high temperature of the delta causes rapid transpiration and evaporation, resulting in a cycle of rising and falling water level that was not fully understood until the early 20th century. The flood peaks between June and August, during Botswana's dry winter months, when the delta swells to 3 times its permanent size, attracting animals from kilometres around and creating one of Africa's greatest concentrations of wildlife. The delta is very flat, with less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in) variation in height across its 15 000 sq km (5800 sq mi).

Every year, about 11 cubic km (11 000 billion L, 2.6 cu mi, 2900 billion US gallons) of water flow into the delta. Roughly 60% is consumed through transpiration by plants, 36% by evaporation, 2% percolates into the aquifer system, and 2% flows into Lake Ngami. This turgid outflow means that the delta is unable to flush out the minerals carried by the river and is liable to become increasingly salty and uninhabitable. Water salinity is reduced by salt collecting around plant roots as most of the incoming water is transpired by plants. Peat fires might contribute to deposit salt into layers below the surface. The low salinity of the water also means that the floods do not greatly enrich the floodplain with nutrients. When the water levels gradually recede, water remains in major canals and river beds, in waterholes and in a number of larger lagoons, which then attract increasing numbers of animals. Photo-safari camps and lodges are found near some of these lagoons.

The grazing areas must be very attractive to wildlife, not just because of the volume of grazing but from the added taste from the salts around the plant roots. The flooding is approaching peaking, so one might hypothesise that if anthrax is occurring (note caution), we are seeing a repetition of the multiple deaths seen with hippopotami in similar circumstances. The origin is unclear, but maybe the index case was an elephant succumbing to an active latent infection. Then where had she been originally exposed? And if it is anthrax, with a wealth of wildlife in the region, other cases in other species may be expected. All in all, an interesting -- though very tragic -- event. - Mod.MHJ
