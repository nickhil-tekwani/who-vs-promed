Leishmaniasis [cutaneous] has affected hundreds of people, including children and elderly, in the Lachi tehsil and several adjoining villages. The disease is caused from a bite by sand fly.

The affected people have been left with scars on the face and other body parts.

The focal person on the disease told Dawn on Sunday [23 May 2021] that the sand fly parasite had come from Afghanistan and Balochistan during the war against terrorism, as earlier there was no sign of it in the country.

He said that, presently, 150 patients were undergoing long treatment of taking 18-20 injections after every 2 weeks. He said the scars remained on the skin for over a year.

The focal person said it was possible to control the spread of the disease by killing the female phlebotomine sand fly, which caused the infection, but the government lacked the resources. He said teams should be mobilised to fumigate mountains, ponds, forests, and fields.

The focal person said an impression was being created that Lachi had been ignored, which was not true, adding the disease had spread because the local people did not take the patients to the basic health centres and the Type-D Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.

[Lachi is one of the 2 tehsils in the Kohat District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachi_Tehsil). Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. (See previous ProMED postings listed below.)

It is true that the numbers increased 20 years ago with an influx of a large number of refugees from Afghanistan, where leishmaniasis has been ignored by the then Taliban regime. However, the problem of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Pakistan now cannot be blamed on other countries. Control rests on vector control and control of the rodent reservoir. This is an ongoing battle, and starting the spraying against sandflies when an outbreak occurs is too late. - Mod.EP
