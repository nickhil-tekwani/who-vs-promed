Eight horses have died since the presence of West Nile virus [WNV]
has been detected. This virus is the causative agent of a disease
that has affected 34 of the 30 000 registered horses in Cadiz
Province, as reported by the Andalucia Agriculture and Fishing
Council.

On the basis of this information, Judit Anda, General Director of
Agriculture and Livestock Production, issued a "reassuring message"
to the community representatives pointing out the "low incidence" of
WNV infection in the equine population.

Ms. Anda said this after meeting with representatives of livestock
associations, health advocacy groups, agricultural producer
organizations and members of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Cordoba. During the meeting, she explained that until this day, only
34 horses in Cadiz Province had become affected by the disease, out
of a total number estimated as 30 000 registered animals; 8 of the
affected animals died.

In this 2nd coordination meeting that included representatives of the
Ministry and the sector, Anda pointed out that this outbreak is
restricted mainly to the province of Cadiz; there are also 2 pockets
in Seville. Animal movement restrictions have not been required.

The General Director also stressed the need for farmers to continue
application of preventive measures focusing on farm management, and
strengthening the monitoring and observation of their animals. She
noted that although vaccines are available to farmers, compulsory
vaccination "is not envisaged or necessary" since the WN fever is a
mild, non-contagious disease.

The Director General explained that the agent involved in this
outbreak has been characterised as lineage 1 virus, genetically
similar to the one found in Morocco. She emphasized that there is no
[direct] horse-to-horse transmission, nor horse-to-humans. It is not
a food-borne infection. She said that the Agriculture and Fishing
Council maintains a web-site where affected areas are listed and
updated in real time. The site also includes a description of
symptoms and procedures to be taken by owners of affected animals.

[While Spain's 1st clinical WN fever case in a human was identified
already in 2004 (Ref 1), and the circulation of the virus recognised
since 2003 (demonstrated by a serosurvey for neutralizing antibodies
in common coots; Ref 2), clinical cases in equines have been
recorded/reported for the 1st time this year (2010). This may be
indicative of intensification of the WNV circulation. Have cases in
humans -- another WNV-dead-end species -- been seen as well?

Spain's immediate notification to the OIE on its 1st outbreak of WNV
in horses, which started 26 Aug 2010, follow-up report No 1, and a
map showing the locations of the 1st 16 cases (zoom in) are available
