Since 18 Aug 2017, 13 suspected cases of cholera have been recorded in Nyanza-Lac Commune of Makamba southern province of Burundi. Nyanza-Lac residents say the lack of clean water for the past 2 weeks is the main cause of the disease. All 13 suspected cases of cholera are receiving treatment in Bukeye Adventist Health Center, said the director of Nyanza-Lac health district, Désiré Nibizi. He also said the situation is stabilized for the moment. "The level of contamination has significantly reduced," said Nibizi.

Cholera patients come from the localities of Mvugo, Bukeye, Kazirabageni, Nyabutare, and Nyanza-Lac urban zone, located on the shores of Lake Tanganyika also bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Nyanza-Lac inhabitants say cholera outbreak is due to the recurrent problems of access to drinking water. "We have just spent 2 weeks without water. We are forced to use water from Lake Tanganyika, "says one inhabitant of Nyanza-Lac. Nibizi calls on the population to avoid drinking water from Lake Tanganyika without boiling it.

A cholera outbreak has been reported in Kilifi county with 8 cases under watch. Kilifi town and its environs have been put on high alert following the outbreak at Kiwandani village. This was after 5 people who came into contact with a child who died as a result of acute diarrhea and vomiting on [14 Aug 2017] tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_, the bacterium that causes cholera. 3 more cases were reported on [Wed 23 Aug 2017], at the same village, according to Kilifi County director of health Bilali Mazoya. 2 of the 3 patients were treated and discharged and the 3rd one was admitted. Dr Mazoya on [Thu 24 Aug 2017] said they had put all medical facilities in the 7 sub-counties of Kilifi on high alert.

Hospitals and dispensaries have been asked to watch out for cholera symptoms and educate patients on measures to stop the spread of the disease. Dr Mazoya said a team of public health officers had been dispatched to treat the 5 patients at Kiwandani Village and keep watch on the disease. "We have set up a cholera treatment centre at Kiwandani Dispensary to manage the identified cases and any other subsequent cases from the locality," he said. Dr Mazoya said the 5 year old child who died as a result of acute diarrhea and vomiting did not test positive for cholera.

"The child had been admitted to a private health institution but soon after the death, 5 of the family members who came into contact with the child later tested positive of cholera and admitted to the Kiwandani Dispensary," said Dr Mazoya.

The outbreak in Kilifi comes after the disease ravaged Nairobi, Nakuru, and Kisumu counties.

South Darfur
------------
On Monday and Tuesday [21-22 Aug 2017] 4 displaced people died of cholera and 49 others have been infected at camp Kalma in Nyala, capital of South Darfur. More deaths and infections have been reported from across the country as rates resurge along the Nile.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
