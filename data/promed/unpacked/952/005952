[There are 3 separate articles in this posting, highlighting the growing problem of Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), the difficulty in diagnosis, and the widespread situation of cannabis use. This is not a US problem, or a North American problem. This situation is occurring on a worldwide basis. The legalization of cannabinoid products indicates users as well as emergency personnel and physicians need to be aware of this condition. - Mod.TG]

A mysterious syndrome in which marijuana users get violently ill is starting to worry researchers.
- A growing number of people are reporting symptoms that align with a mysterious illness called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS.
- Although previously assumed to be very rare, CHS may affect a large number of frequent marijuana users, a new study suggests.
- Most people who are diagnosed with CHS experience nausea, severe vomiting, and stomach pain. Many of them get temporary relief from hot showers or baths.

Mrs X knew something was wrong when she burned herself in the bath for the 3rd time. The Australian woman -- whose experience was documented anonymously in a published case study -- had experienced sudden and severe episodes of illness for 9 years. She'd get nauseous and feel like the room was spinning, which was followed by violent vomiting and severe stomach pains. As it turned out, she had a mysterious syndrome that doctors are only now beginning to recognize.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS, appears to occur in people who use marijuana frequently for years. Aside from quitting marijuana, there are no known treatments.

Mrs X told her doctors that soothing herself with a warm bath was like magic -- her symptoms seemed to melt away into the warm tub. But as soon as the water began to cool, her symptoms crept back. It felt like she couldn't get the water hot enough. She learned to progressively heat the water, preferring to stay in the bath as long as she could.

But one day, the water got too hot and she emerged with red skin and a bad burn. The 3rd time it happened, she ended up in the hospital.

Mrs X was eventually diagnosed with CHS. Patients who get it usually experience a very upset stomach in connection to frequent, heavy marijuana use. Mrs X's case report, along with those of 9 other people with similar symptoms, was published in 2004 in the medical journal Gut, an official journal of the British Society of Gastroenterology [see reference 1 below]. It was the 1st time the set of symptoms was given a name.

Until now, cases of CHS were presumed to be incredibly rare. But some recent evidence indicates cases could be on the rise, and a new study from emergency clinicians at New York University Langone suggests the syndrome may affect far more people than initially thought. The worst part may be that patients have no idea that cannabis may be causing their symptoms, since paradoxically, weed is sometimes used to treat nausea.

"This is something that's poorly understood that doctors don't know about," Joseph Habboushe, an assistant professor at NYU Langone and the lead author on the paper, told Business Insider. "It could affect millions."

The stories of Mrs X and the others in the 2004 study didn't cause widespread concern among medical professionals. Marijuana was still largely illegal at the time, for one thing. And the symptoms appeared to disappear for good as soon as the patients stopped using the drug.

Plus, Mrs X's story was part of a series of case reports, a type of paper that doesn't involve rigorous research parameters; it merely describes the symptoms of one or several people.

The scientists behind the latest study, published in the journal Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology [see reference 2 below], looked into CHS by examining a large sample of adults admitted to an emergency room in New York City. The researchers surveyed thousands of patients in an attempt to find only those who used marijuana frequently -- at least 20 days per month -- and ended up with 155 people who met their criteria. All of those individuals smoked nearly every day or multiple times a day, often for 5 years or more.

Among those patients, roughly 1/3 had symptoms that qualified them for a diagnosis with CHS. That's a big number, Habboushe said -- far bigger than he anticipated.

"Some of my colleagues and I had some idea that this might be more common than initial studies suggested, but we were still pretty surprised," he said.

Given that figure, Habboushe and his colleagues estimated that as many as 2 million US adults could be affected by the syndrome. Still, given the small sample size, it may be too early to say how many people could really develop CHS.

Compliance is a huge problem facing cannabis companies. The only thing that appears to stop the symptoms of CHS is permanently avoiding marijuana. Hot baths and showers offer only a temporary fix.

"As far as we know there are no good treatments for this. Most anti-nausea medications don't work," Habboushe said. "The only thing that helps is stopping. And many patients will stop for a few days, and it goes away, but then they start smoking again and it comes back."

Habboushe is currently working on another study that aims to identify some of these potential treatments.

But as is the case with any study, the latest paper has some limitations. Chief among them is the fact that people are still hesitant to be open and honest about marijuana use, so the figures could be off. Another important factor to consider is that we have no data on the strength, strain, or potency of the marijuana being used. Habboushe said he believes that stronger cannabis may be contributing to the rise in cases of the syndrome, but without data or concrete regulations around THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] content, it's impossible to know for sure.

The study also did not exclude people who took other drugs, meaning that other drugs could be playing a role as well. Lastly, there's no way to know whether a specific compound in cannabis -- such as THC or CBD [cannabidiol], the 2 most well-known compounds -- plays more of a role here than others. [The issue of other substances, prescribed or recreational, seems to be a large unknown. Other factors, such as pre-existing diseases also seem to be an unknown issue in this disturbing syndrome. - Mod.TG]

These caveats mean more research is needed. But in the meantime, Habboushe is concerned. "We are going to see more of this disease," he said. "This doesn't mean marijuana is bad or good it just means it has side effects -- side effects that we need to understand and learn how to avoid and treat."

[Excerpts]
"Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States with over 16.7 million users in 2009 [1]. The 18-25 year old age group has the highest prevalence of marijuana use [1]. Each year 2.6 million Americans become new users. The majority of these individuals are less than 19 years of age [2]. Similarly in Europe, cannabis use is prominent among young adults, with a prevalence that has increased from 5 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2005 [3]. While the overall prevalence of marijuana use has remained stable in the United States at 4 percent, the prevalence of cannabis use disorders (that is cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse) has continued to rise [4]. Risk factors for developing cannabis use disorders include male race, lower income, living in a Western culture, and being separated, divorced, or widowed [5].

"Coinciding with the increasing rates of cannabis abuse has been the recognition of a new clinical condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). The syndrome was first described in 2004 by Allen and colleagues and is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and the learned behavior of hot bathing [6]. This review will provide an overview of cannabinoid pharmacology that focuses on the properties that may contribute to CHS. We review a clinical description of CHS and a proposed clinical evaluation including differential diagnosis and treatment modalities. We conclude with a discussion regarding the shortcomings in our knowledge and suggestions for areas of future research.

"Two case series and numerous individual case reports have been published on cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Patients present with recurrent episodes of nausea, vomiting, and dehydration with frequent visits to the emergency department. [6,51-62]. Patients are typically young adults with a long history of cannabis use. In nearly all cases there is a delay of several years in the onset of symptoms preceded by chronic marijuana abuse [6]. In one study the average duration of cannabis use prior to onset of recurrent vomiting was 16.3 plus or minus 3.4 years [62]. There are at least 4 reported cases where the time lag was equal to or less than 3 years [54,59,60]. Daily marijuana use is characteristic and often reported as exceeding 3 to 5 times per day.

"CHS is a recurrent disorder interspersed with symptom-free intervals. It has been proposed to divide CHS into three phases: pre-emetic or prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery phase [6,62]. The prodromal phase can last for months or years with patients developing early morning nausea, a fear of vomiting, and abdominal discomfort [62]. In this stage patients maintain normal eating patterns, and may increase or continue the use of cannabis because of the believed beneficial effects on relieving nausea [52,56]. The hyperemetic phase is characterized by paroxysms of intense and persistent nausea and vomiting, commonly described as overwhelming and incapacitating. Patients vomit profusely, often without warning and can vomit and retch up to 5 times per hour [62]. Most patients also present with diffuse but relatively mild abdominal pain. In one series approximately 70 percent of patients reported marked weight loss of at least 5 kg during their illness [6]. In the emergency department patients are found to be dehydrated but hemodynamically stable. They undergo an extensive diagnostic work up, including laboratory and imaging studies which, in the majority of cases, are unrevealing. During the hyperemetic phase patients stereotypically take numerous hot showers throughout the day. This idiosyncratic behavior appears to be learned and is repeatedly used as the only alleviating measure to control symptoms and rapidly becomes a compulsive behavior. The recovery phase can last for days, weeks, or months and is associated with relative wellness and normal eating patterns. Weight is regained and bathing returns to regular frequency.

"In clinical practice CHS is most often confused with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). In fact patients with CHS are often mislabeled as having CVS and vice versa. Confusion exists in the medical literature secondary to a failure to recognize chronic marijuana use as a source of vomiting. For example, in 2 recently published series of adult patients with CVS, approximately one third of patients reported daily marijuana use [65,66]. Based on the categorization of functional disorders developed by Rome III, chronic marijuana use (in CHS) is recognized as a mechanism for nausea and vomiting distinct from CVS [67]. Although both conditions share an astonishing similarity, there are several significant differences. For example, CVS patients usually have important psychological comorbidities including depression and anxiety [64,65]. In addition, CVS patients have a high prevalence of migraine headaches or a family history of migraines. Furthermore, gastric emptying rates in patients with CVS are often accelerated rather than delayed [46,65].

"Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a new and under recognized clinical entity. Although its prevalence is unknown, numerous publications have preliminarily established its unique clinical characteristics. CHS should be considered as a plausible diagnosis in the setting of patients with recurrent intractable vomiting and strong history of cannabis abuse. Despite the well-established anti-emetic properties of marijuana, there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Further initiatives are needed to determine this disease prevalence and its other epidemiological characteristics, natural history, and pathophysiology. Additional treatments are needed and efforts to discontinue cannabis abuse are paramount."

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It is rare and only occurs in daily long-term users of marijuana (cannabis). Usually marijuana and other cannabinoids decrease nausea and vomiting, but in some high frequency long-term users, marijuana has the opposite effect.

Marijuana is the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the _Cannabis sativa_ plant. Hashish is made from the concentrated resins of the _C. sativa_ female flower. Marijuana has several active substances. These include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and related chemicals. These bind to molecules found in the brain. That causes the drug "high" and other effects that users feel.

Your digestive tract also has a number of molecules that bind to THC and related substances. So marijuana also affects the digestive tract. For example, the drug can alter the time it takes the stomach to empty. It also affects the esophageal sphincter. That's the tight band of muscle that opens and closes to let food from the esophagus into the stomach. Long-term marijuana use can change the way the affected molecules respond and lead to the symptoms of CHS.

Marijuana is the most widely used drug in the US. Young adults are the most frequent users. A small portion of these people develops CHS. It usually only happens in people who have regularly used marijuana for several years. Often CHS affects those who use the drug at least once a day.

What causes cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?
---------------------------------------------
Marijuana has very complex effects on the body. Experts are still trying to learn exactly how it causes CHS in some people.

In the brain, marijuana often has the opposite effect of CHS. It helps prevent nausea and vomiting. The drug is also good at stopping such symptoms in people having chemotherapy.

In the digestive tract, marijuana seems to have the opposite effect. It actually makes you more likely to have nausea and vomiting. With 1st use, the signals from the brain may be more important. That may lead to anti-nausea effects at first. But with repeated use of marijuana, certain receptors in the brain may stop responding to the drug in the same way. That may cause the repeated bouts of vomiting found in people with CHS. It still isn't clear why some heavy marijuana users get the syndrome, but others do not.

What are the symptoms of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?
----------------------------------------------------------
People with CHS suffer from repeated bouts of vomiting. In between these episodes are times without any symptoms. Healthcare providers usually divide these symptoms into 3 stages. They are the prodromal phase, the hyperemetic phase, and the recovery phase.

During the prodromal phase, the main symptoms are usually early morning nausea and belly (abdominal) pain. Some people also develop a fear of vomiting. Most people keep normal eating patterns during this time. Some people use more marijuana because they think it will help stop the nausea. This phase may last for months to years.

The hyperemetic phase is next. Symptoms during this time may include:
- ongoing nausea;
- repeated episodes of vomiting;
- abdominal pain;
- decreased food intake and weight loss;
- symptoms of dehydration.

During this phase, vomiting is often intense and overwhelming. Many people take a lot of hot showers during the day. They find that doing so eases their nausea. (That may be because of the effects of the hot temperature on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It has effects on both temperature regulation and vomiting.) People often first seek medical care during this phase.

The hyperemetic phase may continue until the person completely stops using marijuana. Then the recovery phrase starts. During this time, symptoms go away. Normal eating is possible again. This phase can last days to months. Symptoms usually come back if the person tries marijuana again.

How is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome diagnosed?
--------------------------------------------------
Many health problems can cause repeated vomiting. To make a diagnosis, the healthcare provider will ask about symptoms and past health. He or she will also do a physical exam, including an exam of the abdomen.

The healthcare provider may also need more tests to rule out other causes of the vomiting. That's especially the case for ones that may signal a health emergency. Based on other symptoms, these tests might include:
- blood tests for anemia and infection;
- tests for electrolytes;
- tests for pancreas and liver enzymes, to check these organs;
- pregnancy test;
- urine analysis, to test for infection or other urinary causes;
- drug screen, to test for drug-related causes of vomiting;
- [radiographs] of the abdomen, to check for conditions like blockage;
- upper endoscopy, to view the stomach and esophagus for possible causes of vomiting;
- head CT scan, if a nervous system cause of vomiting seems likely;
- abdominal CT scan, to check for health problems that might need surgery.

CHS was only recently discovered. So some healthcare providers may not know about it. As a result, they may fail to spot it for many years. They often confuse CHS with cyclical vomiting disorder. It's a health problem that causes similar symptoms. A gastroenterologist might make the diagnosis.

How is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome treated?
------------------------------------------------
[If there is severe vomiting, staying in the hospital for a short time may be necessary]. During the hyperemesis phase, the following treatments may be needed:
- fluid replacement for dehydration, given through an IV;
- medicines to help decrease vomiting;
- pain medicine;
- proton-pump inhibitors, to treat stomach inflammation;
- frequent hot showers;
- symptoms often ease after a day or 2 unless marijuana is used before this time;
- to fully recover, [it is necessary] to stop using marijuana all together. Some people may get help from drug rehabilitation programs to help them quit. Cognitive behavioral therapy or family therapy can also help. [If marijuana use is stopped], the symptoms should not come back.

What are the complications of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Very severe, prolonged vomiting may lead to dehydration. It may also lead to electrolyte problems in blood. If untreated, these can cause rare complications such as:
- brain swelling (cerebral edema);
- muscle spasms or weakness;
- seizures;
- kidney failure;
- heart rhythm abnormalities;
- shock;
The healthcare team will quickly work to fix any dehydration or electrolyte problems. Doing so can help prevent these problems.

How can cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome be prevented?
------------------------------------------------------
[CHS can be prevented] by not using marijuana in any form. The syndrome may take several years to develop, so people affected, who have used marijuana for many years without having any problems, may be reluctant to believe that it might be the underlying cause of the symptoms.

The drug may help prevent nausea in new users who don't use it often. But people with CHS need to completely quit using it. If they don't, their symptoms will likely come back.

Quitting marijuana may lead to other health benefits, like:
- better lung function;
- improved memory and thinking skills;
- better sleep;
- decreased risk for depression and anxiety.

When should the healthcare provider be called?
In case of severe vomiting for a day or more.

Key points about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome:
- CHS is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It results from long-term use of marijuana;
- most people self-treat using hot showers to help reduce their symptoms;
- some people with the syndrome may not be diagnosed for several years. Admitting to a healthcare provider the daily use of marijuana daily significantly speed up the diagnosis and possibly avoid many invasive and expensive tests;
- staying in the hospital may be necessary to treat dehydration from CHS;
- symptoms start to go away within a day or 2 after stopping marijuana use. In people with CHS, symptoms almost always come back if they use the drug again.

Next steps
Tips to get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:
- know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen;
- before your visit, write down questions you want answered;
- bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you;
- at the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you;
- know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are;
- ask if your condition can be treated in other ways;
- know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean;
- know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure;
- if you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit;
- know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.

[These 3 different pieces indicate how difficult it is to recognize the condition from the users' as well as the physicians' points of view. This syndrome has taken a substantial amount of time to attempt to classify and understand what is happening to the individuals affected. It is difficult to treat and there is difficulty in understanding why someone reacts to the cannabis in such a fashion. Trying to understand the syndrome and the large variety of factors causing it may take much longer than has already elapsed.

In putting together this report, I visited both personally as well as by email with a number of physicians, with the vast majority of them never having heard of this situation or knowing how to recognize it.

Also, there are numerous studies of how cannabis has helped people with certain diseases such as Parkinson's disease. One wonders if this is worrisome for those and other individuals who are not recreational users. - Mod.TG
