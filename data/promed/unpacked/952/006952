[JAS], who had tested positive for acute encephalitis syndrome [AES], passed away at his residence in West Garo Hills district, District Magistrate Ram Singh told IANS [Indo-Asian News Service]. "The man was working as National Rural Livelihood Mission cluster coordinator in Rongra, South Garo Hills district [Meghalaya], where he must have got infected," Singh said.

[It is not surprising that there are JE cases in Meghalaya state in northeastern India, since it is adjacent to Assam state where there have been many recent JE and AES cases. The report above apparently uses JE and AES as interchangeable terms. The usual situation in northeastern India is that JE is a minority proportion of AES cases. The 66 cases mentioned above apparently are confirmed JE cases. - Mod.TY
