Avian influenza (AI) recently struck several regions in North Korea, and the country immediately launched measures to stop the disease from spreading, Daily NK has learned.

A source in South Pyongan Province told Daily NK last Thursday [1 Dec 2022] that there were outbreaks of AI -- also known as the "bird flu" -- at an ostrich ranch in Pyongyang's Sunan District and a chicken factory in Anju, South Pyongan Province. The authorities have begun efforts to stop further infections, he said.

The ostrich ranch and chicken factory are of particular importance because they supply side dishes to local residents and the military.

Generally speaking, when there is an outbreak of AI, authorities slaughter birds at the affected farms. The farms are also banned from distributing or processing poultry. In North Korea, provincial quarantine offices take charge of slaughtering all the birds at farms where there are outbreaks of AI.

North Korean quarantine authorities have begun quarantine efforts to stop the spread of AI, focusing on migratory bird habitats. The source said because the bird flu "usually spreads through wild birds," the authorities are "intensifying controls on migratory bird habitats."

"Quarantine officials are currently cracking down on areas around the migratory bird habitat of Soho Lake, Mundok County, South Pyongan Province," he said.

Daily NK reported that during an AI outbreak in early 2020, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called in cadres for an early morning response committee meeting that designated migratory bird habitats as special protection zones.

['Daily NK' is an online newspaper based in Seoul, South Korea, reporting on various aspects of North Korean society from information obtained from inside and outside of North Korea via a network of informants. Official animal health information from N. Korea is traditionally rather scarce. Since 2005, when a relatively large number of reports on the H7 event became available, mainly sourced from S. Korean and related international press agencies, reports on subsequent AI events were exceptional (2008, 2014).

Considering the poor periodic and immediate reporting history to the WOAH, of which N. Korea is a member, one has to rely - with caution - on unofficial sources, such as the above media report. In view of the current HPAI H5N1 situation in South Korea, Japan, and China, where the AI season started in October 2022, synchronic circulation of similar AI strain(s) in N. Korea is plausible. Any additional information from knowledgeable sources will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
