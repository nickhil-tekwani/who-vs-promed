Resistance to ivermectin emerging in onchocerciasis
-----------------------------------
Onchocerciasis is an infection caused by _Onchocerca volvulus_, a parasite
nematode worm transmitted to humans by a species of black fly of the
Simulium genus whose larvae develop in fast-flowing rivers. Infected
subjects suffer not only from severe skin lesions but also eye damage that
can lead to irreversible loss of sight, hence the name "river blindness".

A huge majority -- 99 per cent -- of the 37 million people infected by the
parasite live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Ivermectin, a medicine capable of killing the parasite embryos (the
microfilariae) circulating in the organism of patients and temporarily
interrupting the nematode's reproduction, is the only treatment used for
onchocerciasis control.

Since 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has
been covering 19 of the continent's 28 countries hit by the disease. Access
to this treatment is possible for 70 million people and has significantly
diminished the onchocerciasis-induced morbidity.

However, the doubling of cases of infection in certain communities of Ghana
between 2000 and 2005, in spite of annual treatments, created fear of the
emergence of ivermectin-resistant strains. Such apprehension appears
particularly justified in that a high degree of therapeutic cover is
achieved during mass distribution campaigns and hence only a tiny part of
the parasite population targeted remains unexposed to drug treatment pressure.

Since 1994, a team of IRD researchers, working jointly with Cameroon
researchers and others from McGill University of Montreal, has been
monitoring a cohort of Cameroon patients benefiting from repeated
treatments with ivermectin. Regular parasite sampling from these subjects
was performed over a 13 year period in order to determine the changes in
the genetic structure of _Onchocerca volvulus_ populations.

Each occasion involved measurement of the genotype frequency of
heterozygotes and homozygotes for the gene coding beta-tubulin, a protein
involved in the organization of the parasite's cells. The team focused on
this particular gene because it acts as a marker of resistance to
ivermectin in other nematode species parasitic on cattle. As a control,
they monitored the changes in genotype frequency of 2 other genes, known
for their high evolutionary stability over time.

The proportion of homozygotes and heterozygotes for these 2 genes remained
stable throughout the investigation, but the situation was completely
different for the beta-tubulin gene. Between 1994 and 1998, the percentage
of parasites showing a genotype homozygous for this gene fell from 79 to 31
per cent in subjects receiving quarterly treatment with ivermectin. At the
same time, the proportion of heterozygous genotypes changed in the opposite
sense, rising from 21 to 69 per cent.

These results could be the sign of adaptation of nematode worm populations
to repeated treatments using this drug. The research team inferred that the
parasites showing a genotype homozygous for beta-tubulin are more
susceptible to it. As courses of treatment progressed, they would therefore
gradually disappear, to the benefit of the more resistant heterozygous strains.

Ivermectin's effect on microfilariae, other than its direct one, is to
prevent them from leaving the uterus of adult worms, for several months
after treatment: this is its embryostatic effect. Post-treatment, there
were more microfilariae in the uterus of homozygous female parasites than
in those of heterozygous females. This could mean that, in the latter, the
microfilariae succeed in leaving the uterus, as they usually do in the
absence of treatment, and therefore that the embryostatic effect of
ivermectin would be diminished. Contrary to the effect anticipated, the
repeated exposure to treatments could in this way select those worms more
able to keep up the production of new generations. Nevertheless, the drug's
direct action on the microfilariae appeared not to change, and hence, for
the moment, there is no reason to call into question the current control
strategy against the disease based on annual treatments with ivermectin.

Affirmation of the results requires further investigations, starting from
new cohorts subjects infected by _Onchocerca volvulus_ who have not yet
been treated with ivermectin. This type of approach should bring more
information on the risks of the parasite's resistance to this drug. If such
risks were confirmed, then the whole onchocerciasis control strategy would
probably have to be revised. Nevertheless, for many years to come,
ivermectin could well remain the sole drug applicable for mass treatment in
measures to control river blindness.

[Resistance in _Onchocerca volvolus_ against ivermection was reported from
Ghana in 2007 (ProMED-mail: "Onchocerciasis, drug resistance - Ghana
20070719.2319").

The new report from Cameroon underliness that the problem may be widespread
throughout the countries in Africa, which have used regular mass treatment
with ivermectin as the primary method for onchocerciasis control.
