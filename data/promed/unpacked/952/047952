The yellow rust has been reported from some areas of Jammu district at the international border [with Pakistan], which is considered the grain bowl of Jammu and Kashmir [J&K]. According to news reports, the disease of wheat severely affects the entire Jammu region [which] makes strenuous efforts to manage this disease through farmers' trainings [and] campaigns.

Wheat is the major staple food in India. In recent years, yellow rust has emerged as the major threat to the crop. The pathogen perpetuates through uredospores on volunteer wheat at high altitudes. In India, it survives [in the] Himalayan foothills in J&K, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and western Uttar Pradesh. From there, the spores are blown to lower altitudes and finally reach the plains in the months of December-January [to] cause primary infection.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40 to 100 percent have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

_P. striiformis_ produces 2 types of spores: thin-walled urediniospores (or uredospores) and thick-walled teliospores as resting spores. Urediniospores are the only known source of inoculum for wheat, they germinate and infect at cooler temperatures (as described in the item above).

While stem rust (_P. graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

The Himalayan region, including parts of Pakistan and India, has been identified as a source of most of the aggressive stripe rust races which have arrived in Europe over recent years (ProMED-mail post 20150717.3517395). In India, of the cereal rusts, stripe rust is the most serious constraint to wheat production.
