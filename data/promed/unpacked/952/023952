The Japanese news service, NHK, reported yesterday [19 mar 2011] an
outbreak of avian flu in a local farm. According to their data, the
infection was detected in 5 chickens.

The H5N1 virus (the causative agent of avian influenza) is still a
serious threat in many Eastern countries, particularly Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and China, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO).

The current outbreak started in 2003, and Japan was one of the most
severely affected countries. In 2007, after 3 years in which no severe
case of this infection was detected, this strain of flu virus
reappeared in this country.

[In the greater scheme of things this outbreak is a distraction from
the problems associated with the recent earthquake, tsunami, and
nuclear power stations fires. The prefecture affected by this outbreak
was not reported.
