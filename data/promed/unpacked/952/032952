Re: Avian influenza - Russia (Siberia)(07): H5N1 suspected
-----------------------------------------------
This discussion is important because H5N1 has been isolated many
times and [in] many places. In my lab, we isolated H5N1 from ducks in
1981 and 1985 and experimentally infected ducks with a duck isolate
of H5N1. None of these H5N1s were in any way related to the current
SE Asia outbreak.
With the current lack of understanding in the media and general
public, the detection (and subsequent "reporting") of a generic H5N1
virus or antibody could have devastating consequences related to
panic and politics.

Region Moves to Contain Bird Flu
-------------------------------------
Novosibirsk Governor Viktor Tolokonsky met with local officials on
Monday [1 Aug 2005] to discuss measures for containing an outbreak of
the avian flu strain that can infect humans.
The outbreak began in the Novosibirsk region in early July 2005,
killing thousands of domestic fowl. The country's veterinary service
last week [final week July 2005] identified the virus as the H5N1
strain, which can fatally infect humans. No human cases have been
reported in Russia.
Tolokonsky said Monday [1 Aug 2005] that the local administration had
earmarked 9 million rubles (USD 315 000) to conduct quarantine
measures in 18 towns and villages intended to stem the outbreak of
the avian flu.
"The quarantine entails killing all poultry in the regions where the
outbreak was recorded," Tolokonsky said, Itar-Tass reported.
The veterinary service said the avian flu outbreak had been recorded
in 13 settlements of the Novosibirsk region and one village in the
Altai region. "Necessary measures are being taken to contain the
infection's source," it said in a statement.
The Emergency Situations Ministry said the outbreak already had
killed 2382 domestic fowl, including 127 since Sunday [31 Jul 2005]
morning.
New outbreaks had been registered in the Omsk region, where 450 fowl
had been killed, and the Altai region, where 300 died, but the strain
there had not been determined yet, the ministry said.
Channel One television reported that workers of poultry farms were
ordered to wear protective clothes and undergo disinfection
procedures.
Valery Mikheyev, the chief sanitary doctor for the Novosibirsk
region, said that medical experts conduct regular checks on residents
of the affected villages.
The veterinary service said that the virus apparently had been
brought by birds migrating from Southeast Asia. The virus has swept
through poultry populations in large areas of Asia since 2003,
killing tens of millions of birds and at least 60 people, most of
them in Viet Nam and Thailand.
Almost all the human fatalities had contracted the virus from
poultry. But experts worry it could mutate into a more deadly virus
that could spread from person to person.
