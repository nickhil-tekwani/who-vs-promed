A surge in anthrax has also hit the south of Zimbabwe, claiming the
lives of villagers and their livestock.

Matabeleland North provincial medical director, Dr Gibson Mhlanga,
confirmed the deaths of 2 people from anthrax, but a report in the
official The Chronicle newspaper said 6 had died and over 200 cattle
had been wiped out in the province's Dongamuzi area near Lupane, 120
km (74.6 mi) north of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's 2nd city.

The government dispatched its disaster management Civil Protection
Unit (CPU) to Lupane last week [week of 17 Nov 2008] to work with the
Veterinary Services Department to vaccinate affected cattle in a bid
to contain the disease. Anthrax will further strain Zimbabwe's
crumbling health delivery system. Medical officials in Lupane said the
people who had succumbed to anthrax over the past week had eaten meat
from infected cattle; several other villagers in the district have
been hospitalised.

Villagers in the Lupane area who spoke to IRIN said they had lost a
considerable number of livestock to the rapid onset infection, which
is hard to detect in its early stages. "My entire kraal [enclosure
for cattle or other livestock] was almost wiped out and the few
cattle that I have remaining have been vaccinated [but] I am not sure
whether the 7 remaining cattle I have left will not die also,"
said Matthew Ncube, 57, who had already lost 35 of his animals.

Ephraim Moyo pointed out that the risk of human infection was rising
with the approach of the festive season. "People eat a lot of meat,
and the problem is that people in the village do not throw away
cattle that die ... they eat the meat."

The outbreak is causing serious concern in Bulawayo, where most
people buy their meat from unlicensed butcheries that source the
animals from rural areas like Lupane. "Ever since the outbreak of
anthrax I have not been buying meat from the vendors I normally buy
from, as the meat that they bring from rural areas is not inspected,"
said Bulawayo resident Ndabezinhle Sibanda.

[This confirms that the anthrax epizootic in Matabeleland North is
continuing and possibly 2 more have died since the official report in
the Chronicle, date unknown, of 6. It seems that the number of
deaths, 2 to 6, is oscillating between one official source and the
next, (see ProMED-mail no. 20081117.3631). This report also confirms
the deployment of a CPU to the affected area last week. There is an
interesting photograph of protesters with a banner, "We want drugs
for patients."

Hopefully farmers have been obtaining their livestock vaccine from a
reliable source. - Mod.MHJ]
