Fifteen states have reported influenza outbreaks, a 50% increase from a
week earlier, federal health officials said Tuesday. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said flu activity was widespread in
New York, Tennessee and Texas during the week ended Jan. 3. Flu outbreaks
were also reported in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and
Virginia, the CDC said. These 15 states reported flu outbreaks during the
week ended Jan. 3, the latest date for which figures were available. A week
earlier, 10 states were reporting outbreaks. Influenza type A has been
reported in 47 states. The type A cases include a new "Sydney" flu strain
first detected in Australia and New Zealand in June. Four states and the
District of Columbia have reported type B flu, the CDC said. Other states
reported only sporadic cases of flu-like illness, while North Dakota and
Oregon reported no flu activity. The CDC said the flu season generally
peaks between January and March. Health officials estimate that influenza
is associated with about 20,000 deaths nationwide every year.

I would have to say that the situation here in Northern Virginia is similar
to that in Los Angeles, California [see 980113011534. In our three
offices and in the E.R., we're seeing some cases of influenza but I suspect
that the unseasonably warm weather we've been enjoying is going to delay
the full impact of our flu season. Mostly we're seeing a severe upper
respiratory infection consisting of congestion, dry cough, headache, and
low-grade fever which is lasting 10 to 14 days. Often the cough lingers
for weeks after the illness has subsided.

[By convention, influenza viruses are designated by their serotype/host
species/site of origin/month and year of origin/and (H and N subtype). Thus
(example only; I am not making policy here), A/Chicken/Hong Kong/5/97(H5N1)
if I am not mistaken. The so-called "Sydney" strain is an H3N2 subtype.
Please pardon us if at times we use "slang" because of carelessness or the
lateness of the hour. - Mod.CHC
