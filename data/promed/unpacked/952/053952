The Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports reported earlier this month [November 2018] (computer translated) that of the nearly 1000 suspect schistosomiasis cases tested in Rakhine state, 520 were _Schistosoma mansoni_ IgG (Elisa) positive.

In addition to Rakhine, some people with schistosomiasis were detected in Shwe Kyin of Bago region and Inn Lay of Shan state.

Prevention, treatment and diagnosis for schistosomiasis is a collaboration between the WHO, the Chinese CDC, and local health authorities.

[Once schistosomiasis is established in an area it is to be expected that there are many cases not yet diagnosed. The incubation period may be years and infections with a few symptoms are common. Thus, the number and the area under investigation are expected to increase. It is also important to survey the appropriate water sources for the presence of the intermediate host, the snails. - Mod.EP
