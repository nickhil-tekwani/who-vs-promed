30 dead from mystery disease in PNG
---------------------------------------
More than 30 people have reportedly died from a mysterious malaria-like
disease in Papua New Guinea's Southern Highlands province.
Senior PNG doctor Alex Peawi says he has collected blood samples from 5
people who had malarial symptoms, but the results proved negative. The
symptoms include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish eyes.
Dr. Peawi says more people are being infected, and authorities need to
identify the disease. "I did the necessary tests to exclude malaria,
meningitis, and typhoid, but they all turn out to be negatives," he said.
"We could be dealing with something else apart from malaria and typhoid."

[Using the Gideon (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network
<http://www.gideononline.com>,
the symptom complex of severe, fatal illness, fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, and jaundice gives a differential diagnosis of 31 likely
infectious etiologies. Of this list, the hepatitis group (in decreasing
order of probability - B, E, A, C) head the list, followed by
leptospirosis, malaria, and old-world hantavirus infections. The list also
includes dengue fever, typhoid fever, and endemic typhus, to mention a few.
This moderator wonders why leptospirosis was not mentioned as a leading
diagnostic possibility in the news wire above, as it seems a likely
etiology for a "malaria-like" outbreak in a known endemic/epidemic zone
(note that, according to GIDEON, there were only 116 cases reported in
1989). Obviously, more information from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
