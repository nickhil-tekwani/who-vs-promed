The Ministry of Health confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a 27 year old young man from Tonosí in Los Santos province.

Carlos Muñoz, regional head of Los Santos Epidemiology, stated that in the month of May [2018] there was also a registered case in Tonosí and in the current month [June 2018] the one of the young man, for a total of 31 cases so far in 2018.

This last patient is in the 6th day of his illness, a mild case of the syndrome, and is in the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase slowly in the province this year (2018) and has gone from 26 in late April 2018 to 31 currently. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva. - Mod.TY
