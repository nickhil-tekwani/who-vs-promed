The Ministry of Agriculture has modified on Friday morning [25 Sep 2015] the dimensions of the zoning in place since the appearance of bluetongue in Allier. This followed the publication, on 24 Sep 2015, in the Official Journal, of virological tests obtained by the national reference laboratory ANSES and the accredited laboratory network on 23 Sep 2015. The restricted zone (composed of the protection and surveillance zones) has been extended. The initially affected departments (Allier, Creuse, Puy de Dome and the Indre) now include also the Loire and Haute-Loire. Part of the Ardeche, Isere, Drome and some towns in the north of the Gard are now part of the surveillance zone [a map showing the new zoning is available at the source URL].

This decree also formalizes the opening of the vaccination campaign against BTV [bluetongue virus] serotype 8 in France [excluding Corsica where vaccination has been applied earlier; see comment].

The categories of animals to be vaccinated as a priority are:
- Ruminant animals kept in holdings subject to a decree on declaration of infection following confirmation of the presence of bluetongue;
- Ruminant animals intended for trade or export;
- Ruminant animals belonging to epidemiologically strategic establishments such as insemination centers, experimental stations and individual monitoring stations.

[France has officially notified 10 new BTV-8 outbreaks in follow-up report No. 2, submitted to the OIE today [Fri 25 Sep 2015], available with an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18730.

According to the report, the totals are as follows:
Summary of outbreaks
Total new outbreaks: 10
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1213 / 10 / 0 / 0 / 0

In each of the 10 farms declared infected, one single animal was reported as "a case." The diagnostic test applied was, reportedly, real-time PCR performed in the National Reference Laboratory ANSES, Maisons-Alfort (national laboratory) on 21 and 22 Sep 2015 with positive results. It will be interesting to note if this refers to 10 clinical cases (out of 1213 susceptible animals), or rather randomly sampled animals.

The total number of BTV-8 outbreaks in France since the start of the event, reportedly on 21 Aug 2015, is 28.

EU's map showing the Union's bluetongue restricted zones, last updated on 18 Sep 2015, is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/bluetongue_restrictedzones-map.jpg. In the said map, the newly established BTV-8 restriction zone in central France is indicated. Subscribers may note that Corsica is marked on the map as zone T, where 5 BTV serotypes are regarded to be present or vaccinated, namely BTV serotypes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. - Mod.AS
