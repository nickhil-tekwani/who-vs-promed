Greece detected its 1st case of African swine fever [ASF] at a breeding farm in the north of the country this week, agriculture ministry officials said on Thursday [6 Feb 2020].

The infected pig was found in a small farm in Serres, a region of northern Greece close to the border with Bulgaria and North Macedonia, the ministry said, adding that the trade of pork meat from the area had been banned.
