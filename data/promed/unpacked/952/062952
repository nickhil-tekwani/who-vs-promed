A rabid cat was found last week in Boiling Springs, the state Department of Health reported on Tuesday [21 Dec 2021]. The male, gray-and-white tabby barn cat was found on Lutztown Road in Monroe Township on 13 Dec 2021, according to the department, which added there are 4 people receiving a drug [treatment - Mod.TG] for exposure to rabies as a result of bites or scratches, and 3 dogs in the home have up-to-date rabies vaccines.

The department is notifying the public in case anyone else has been exposed to the cat, or if cats from other nearby farms may have come in contact with the cat as it roamed the area. Anyone with a human exposure to the animal is encouraged to call the Cumberland County State Health Center on weekdays from 8 to 4:30 p.m. After-hours or toll-free calls can be made at a sperate number.

[2] Montana (Big Horn County): skunk, dog

On Friday [17 Dec 2021], the Montana Department of Livestock (MDOL) received confirmation of the 5th case of terrestrial (non-bat) rabies in the state this year [2021]. The rabies-infected dog was in Big Horn County and was submitted for testing after it developed neurologic signs and later died. The dog had contact with a skunk 5 weeks earlier, where it is assumed to have been exposed to the rabies virus. This is the 20th case of rabies in Montana this year.

While the disease is highly preventable in domestic animals through the administration of rabies vaccine, cases involving vaccinated animals do occur on occasion. The dog in this situation was previously vaccinated though was not current on vaccinations.

"This case should catch the attention of Montana animal owners," says Dr Anna Forseth with the Department of Livestock. "A single dose of vaccine is unlikely to protect an animal for their entire life. Booster shots are needed to sustain a strong immunity, especially when exposed to rabid wildlife species."

In response to the diagnosis, MDOL has issued a 60-day county-wide quarantine in Big Horn County for dogs, cats and ferrets not currently vaccinated for rabies (ARM 32.3.1202). The quarantine is in effect from the date of the skunk exposure (15 Nov 2021) until Sat 14 Jan 2022. Animals which are past-due for a rabies vaccine booster, animals not 28 days past the date of 1st vaccine administration, and animals having never been vaccinated are all subject to the quarantine.

Rabies is a fatal viral disease spreading through the saliva of an infected animal. Residents should check the rabies vaccination status of all animals and report any contact between a pet and a wild animal, including skunks and bats, to their veterinarian or the MDOL to ensure potential rabies exposure are assessed for risk and managed accordingly.

The mission of the Montana Department of Livestock is to control and eradicate animal diseases, prevent the transmission of animal diseases to humans, and to protect the livestock industry from theft and predatory animals. For more information on the MDOL, visit https://www.liv.mt.gov.

Mossoró [largest municipality in Rio Grande do Norte] confirmed this Wednesday [22 Dec 2021] another case of animal rabies in a bovine. With this, there are already 2 confirmed cases of the disease this year [2021; other articles indicate 11 more cases are under investigation and awaiting the results of the rabies test. - Mod.TG].

According to Genicleyton de Góis, the veterinarian and coordinator of the Zoonoses Control Center (CCZ), the bovine material was sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory of Rio Grande do Norte (Lacen-RN) in the month November [2021], and the result was confirmed this Wednesday [22 Dec 2021].

This Tuesday [21 Dec 2021], another horse died in Mossoró with characteristic signs of rabies. The material for analysis was collected and sent to the laboratory.

All positive and suspected cases of the disease were detected in the Recanto da Esperança settlement, in rural Mossoró. According to the breeders, the animals died from 4 to 5 days after showing the 1st signs. The Institute for Agricultural Defense and Inspection of Rio Grande do Norte (Idiarn) was informed about the new case.

Since the beginning of the month [December 2021], teams from the CCZ, the Municipal Department of Agriculture and Health of Mossoró, as well as veterinarians from the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid (Ufersa) have been carrying out a series of visits to the community where the cases were confirmed. "These actions will be continuous until everything is stabilized," explained the CCZ coordinator.

The purpose of the visits is to hold lectures with guidance for breeders, mainly on the importance of vaccinating the herd. "The vast majority do not vaccinate (animals). There is always a work to raise awareness in the fight against rabies through farm animal breeders. Certainly, if these animals were vaccinated, we wouldn't have such a high number of cases," highlighted the veterinarian Genicleyton de Góis.

A dose of rabies vaccine in veterinary stores costs less than BRL 3 [USD 0.54]. According to the director of defense and animal health inspection at Idiarn, Renato Dias, vaccination against rabies in farm animals is not a program of compulsory vaccination, like what happens with foot-and-mouth disease. The responsibility for vaccination rests with the breeders.

Rabies is an extremely serious disease in animals and humans. The CCZ's orientation is in case of exposure to the virus or to a suspicious animal, the person should seek an emergency room so the protocol for these cases is followed. The symptoms of the disease in humans can be confused with those of other diseases, such as fever, body weakness and malaise, until it progresses to the most advanced stage of encephalomyelitis and leads to death.

[4] Nunavut: fox, dog

https://www.nunavutnews.com/news/fox-encounter-in-baker-prompts-rabies-advisory/


A fox-and-dog encounter in Baker Lake has led the Government of Nunavut (GN) to issue a public health advisory for signs of rabies. "The significant number of fox sightings in Nunavut has greatly increased the risk of exposure to rabies," stated the GN in a news release 30 Dec 2021. "Due to the danger of rabies, we advise all residents to be on the lookout for foxes in the area."

The fox in Baker Lake was destroyed after being in contact with a domestic dog, which was immediately isolated and is being monitored for rabies. The fox is being tested for rabies as well [This is somewhat confusing because a photo caption accompanying the article states the dog and fox are being tested, which means both animals are deceased. However, this paragraph says the dog is in isolation, meaning the dog is still living. - Mod.TG].

"If you have been bitten or scratched by a fox or a dog, go to the health centre and report the incident immediately," stated the GN. "Treatment must be started quickly after exposure, as rabies infections (are) almost always fatal."

The government also issued an advisory notice for a similar incident in Arctic Bay, where a fox had been [displaying] aggressive behaviour and had an encounter with a sled dog. All sled dogs on the team were being monitored for any symptoms of rabies.

Domestic animals that spend a lot of time tied up outdoors should also be monitored for changes in behaviour and other signs of rabies, which include staggering, frothing at the mouth, choking and making strange noises. Animals exhibiting these signs should be avoided and reported to the regional environmental health office or conservation officer.

Anyone who sees a fox or wolf wandering around the community, or if a dog has been on contact with a fox or wolf, should call the regional environmental health officer or conservation officer.

[Any mammal can be exposed and develop rabies. It is a virus, and it is ruthless. It does not distinguish between large or small, domestic or wild. It is the grim reaper for those animals not vaccinated. There is a treatment for people, provided it is given within set time parameters.

Rabies virus can be deadly to you and to your pet. If your pet is in a fight, or is scratched or bitten by an unknown animal, your pet could be at risk. It is so critical to protect your pets and yourself by vaccinating your animal. If you have received an animal bite, even it is not suspected of rabies, immediately wash the wound, regardless of size of the wound, with soap and water and seek medical attention.

Individuals being exposed to a rabid animal or an animal suspected of having rabies, either through a bite or a scratch, should wash the wound immediately with soap and water and seek medical attention and likely be treated with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

My plea to you is to make sure your pets' vaccinations are current and accurate, regardless of the size or species of your mammalian pet. Protect your pet, yourself, and your neighbors and friends. Be kind -- vaccinate. This includes horses and cattle. These large animals can become quite vicious, and a raged attack can be fatal to humans -- a small victim in relationship to the size of horses or cattle. Furthermore, vaccine is a cheap preventative to protect your livestock, and yourself. - Mod.TG
