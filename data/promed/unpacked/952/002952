Low influenza activity reported in most countries of the [53
countries] of WHO European Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 12/2011 [21-27 Mar
2011] by 46 Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute
respiratory infection (ARI) activity continue to decrease throughout
the Region and are below baseline or at pre-season levels in 29
countries.
- Sentinel hospital surveillance for severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI) from 9 countries suggests that SARI hospitalizations
are declining from previous peaks.
- 22 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or ARI, and
25 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested positive
for influenza.
- Data from sentinel sites show that pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009
and influenza B continue to co-circulate in the Region, but with an
increasing proportion of influenza B detections.

Current situation -- week 12/2011 [21-27 Mar 2011]
--------------------------------------------------
During week 12/2011 [21-27 Mar 2011], low influenza activity was
reported in 34 out of 42 countries, a higher proportion compared to
the previous week, while 8 reported medium intensity. ILI or ARI
consultation rates were decreasing in all 39 countries reporting
clinical data, and were either below baseline or at pre-season levels
in 29 of these. Among 43 countries reporting on the geographical
spread of influenza, most reported no or sporadic activity (28
countries). Local spread was reported in 6 countries, while 7 reported
regional activity, and 2 widespread. The impact of influenza on health
care systems was low in 20 and moderate in 4 of the 24 countries
reporting on this indicator.

Data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were reported
from 9 countries: Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Malta, the Republic of
Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine. In
Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, sentinel SARI hospitalizations
continue to decrease and are now at pre-season levels. While the
number of SARI hospitalizations in Armenia, Georgia, the Republic of
Moldova, and Serbia remained relatively unchanged compared to previous
weeks, declining trends in cases have been observed in Romania and
Ukraine along with decreasing percentages of SARI specimens testing
positive for influenza.

Virological situation -- week 12/2011 [21-27 Mar 2011]
------------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 4
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 8 countries. Influenza B
was dominant in 7 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 681 respiratory specimens, of which 147
(22 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 50 (34 percent) were
influenza A and 97 (66 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 42 were subtyped: 41 (98 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 1 (2
percent) as A(H3). In the 13 countries testing 20 or more sentinel
specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 5 percent to 46 percent,
with a median of 14 percent (mean: 20 percent). In addition, 988
non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for influenza: 595 (60
percent) influenza A and 393 (40 percent) influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 532 were subtyped: 516 (97 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 16 (3 percent) as A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals participating in SARI surveillance (9 countries)
collected 171 respiratory specimens, of which 42 (25 percent) were
positive for influenza compared to 40 percent in the previous week.
Among the 5 countries testing 10 or more sentinel SARI specimens, the
percentage testing positive for influenza ranged from 0 percent in
Malta to 43 percent in Ukraine (median: 23 percent, mean: 18
percent).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010 - 12/2011 [4 Oct
2010-27 Mar 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 81 244 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 57 885 (71 percent) were influenza A and 23 359
(29 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 46 119 were
subtyped: 44 467 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1651 (4 percent) as
influenza A(H3), and 1 as influenza A(H1).

>From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010] to week 12/2011 [21-27 Mar 2011],
1470 out of 5170 sentinel SARI specimens (28 percent) tested positive
for influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 821 (56 percent) were
influenza A and 649 (44 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 569 were subtyped: 518 (91 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 51
(9 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 3950 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1952 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1736 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 117 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 144 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 359 influenza viruses, 77 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 81 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 11 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 4 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 18 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 19 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 93 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
2399 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Out of the 2067 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that
were tested, 1976 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 91 viruses
(4.4 percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 91 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 4
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 332 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 322 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 178 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
Clinical ILI and ARI consultation rates are below baseline or at
pre-season levels in many countries of the WHO European Region and
most are reporting low influenza activity. This is consistent with
declines in the percentage of ILI and ARI sentinel specimens testing
positive for influenza, from 33 percent in week 11 to 22 percent this
week [21-27 Mar 2011]. Data from hospital-based sentinel surveillance
in 9 countries suggest that SARI hospitalizations, and the percentage
of SARI cases that are caused by influenza, are declining overall.
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B are still
co-dominating in the Region, but the ratio of influenza B to influenza
A is increasing.

[In brief: overall the roll of influenza virus in causation of ILI
and ARI is declining throughout most of Europe. Pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B viruses belonging to multiple clades
remain co-dominant in the Region, with the ratio of influenza B to
influenza A increasing.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
