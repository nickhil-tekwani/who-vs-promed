It has been agreed this morning [23 Aug 2007] that live animals and
meat products can be exported from outside of the Surveillance Zone
in Surrey, from Sat 25 Aug 2007, to the rest of the European Union,
with additional veterinary supervision and certification.
Secretary of State for Environment, Hilary Benn said: "This is a
clear demonstration of the confidence which our European colleagues
have in the disease control measures that we have taken in this
outbreak. I would like to thank the Chief Veterinary Officer and her
team, Animal Health, Local Authorities, industry partners and
farmers, and all those involved in this outbreak for their rapid
response, hard work, and vigilance. Cooperation and partnership
working have been key to achieving this outcome."
Alongside this resumption of exports, the GB-wide movement ban on
live animals will be lifted from midnight tonight (23 Aug 2007)
outside of the Surveillance Zone in Surrey. However, as a
precautionary measure, the following restrictions will remain in place:
-Animals will need to remain on the premises they moved to for 20
days before being moved again; the only exceptions to this will be
movements within the same holding of less than 8 km and movements
direct to slaughter.
-Animal markets, shows and gatherings are currently prohibited except
in the case of collection centres for dispatch to slaughter. This
prohibition remains in place pending further announcements.
In addition, the 2 3-km radius Protection Zones in Surrey will be
lifted at noon tomorrow (24 Aug 2007). The Chief Veterinary Officer
has decided that, as a precaution, a 5-km radius Temporary Pirbright
Biosecurity Area will be put in place around the Pirbright site. The
10-km radius Surveillance Zone will remain in place.
Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds said: "The temporary area is
a precautionary measure where we will be working with animal keepers
and vets to ensure enhanced vigilance is maintained as we await the
conclusions of the HSE investigation and the findings of the
independent review led by Professor Brian Spratt."
