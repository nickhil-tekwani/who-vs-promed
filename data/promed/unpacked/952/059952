Horse death prompts mosquito warning in Kingston
-------------------------------------
State health officials are urging residents around Kingston to
protect themselves against mosquitoes, after a horse died of Eastern
equine encephalitis. The virus is transmitted through the bite of an
infected mosquito.
The horse died last month [August 2004]. It's the 1st known casualty
of the disease in New Hampshire in 22 years. The disease rarely
affects people, but, can cause mild flu-like problems, coma and even
death.
Mosquitoes carrying Eastern equine encephalitis have been discovered
in several communities in southeastern Massachusetts. A 64-year-old
Brockton man, and a 13-year-old boy from Holbrook, died from the
disease last month [August 2004]. They were the 1st human cases in
Massachusetts since 1995.

Man recovering from Eastern equine encephalitis, Middleboro resident
3rd confirmed case this year
-----------------------------------------------
A 20-year-old Middleboro, Massachusetts man, the 3rd person in the
state to contract Eastern equine encephalitis, appears to be
recovering from the often fatal disease.
The 20-year old was hospitalized several days ago with a severe
headache and fever. He thought he might have been suffering the
effects of having a few beers, but was shocked to learn that he had
contracted the serious mosquito-borne disease.
"Started about a week or so ago, week-and-a-half. I just woke up, and
I had like a really bad headache, and I didn't think it was much of
anything, 'cause I had a couple of beers the night before, so I
thought it might have been like a little hangover," said the victim.
Doctors at Jordan Hospital, however, conducted some tests and then
transferred him to the neurology department at St. Elizabeth's
Hospital, where labs confirmed that he had the rare disease. "He kind
of took a turn for the worse when he was at Jordan, and he was
completely disoriented. He didn't even know who we were," his mother
said. "They weren't sure what they were dealing with, and it takes
time for this to show up," his father said. "We really don't know why
some people recover and some people don't. So, we are happy to say
that all indications are that, in this case, he is recovering," said
Dr. Al DeMaria of the Department of Public Health. The fatality rate
for the disease is about 35 percent. "We're really, really fortunate
to have him here. We almost lost him," said his mother.
2 other men who contracted the illness this summer -- a 64-year-old
Brockton, Massachusetts man, and a Holbrook, Massachusetts teenager
-- died from the disease. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in
Massachusetts since 1950, but the recovering 20-year-old Middleboro,
Massachusetts man was the 3rd case identified this year [2004]. "We
are talking about a low amount of virus in the environment, but it is
spread through southeastern Massachusetts," said Ralph Timperi,
director of the Massachusetts State Laboratory.
Officials say that people still need to take precautions until the
1st frost kills the mosquito population. "People should still take
precautions and reduce mosquito exposure. You can't entirely avoid
mosquitoes, but, to the extent that you do reduce mosquito exposure,
you reduce the risk. The risk is very low to start with," said
DeMaria.
Officials said the virus is cyclical and expect next summer [2005] to
be worse than this year [2004].
