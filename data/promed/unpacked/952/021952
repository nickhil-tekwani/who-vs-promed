==========================================
Date: Fri, 07 Jun 1996 06:23:13 +0800
From: sklam@pc.jaring.my

The dengue season has started in Malaysia with 2,450 cases reported
throughout the country by 1 June. This is an increase of 30.7% over the
corresponding period last year. Of the 2,450 cases, 132 were dengue
haemorrhagic fever (DHF) with 6 deaths, as compared to 118 DHF cases and 14
deaths in 1995 for the same period.
The States most affected are the Federal Territory (1,069 cases with 3
deaths), Selangor (441 cases), Perak (252 cases), Johor (227 cases with 3
deaths) and Pahang (110 cases).
>From 1992 to 1995, the predominant serotype was dengue 3 and it was noticed
that its activity started to decline towards the end of 1995.

Of the viruses isolated [in 1996] by the WHO Centre in Kuala Lumpur, five
were dengue 1 and five dengue 2, indicating a change in the predominant
serotype responsible for the present outbreak.
The present dengue season in Malaysia is expected to continue for the next
few months and will reach a peak in July-August. All States are on the the
alert for a possible worsening situation and active vector control measures
are in place.
