A measles outbreak that downed at least 50 residents in some areas of
Zamboanga City since last week [16-22 Jul 2007] has been traced to
"conflict" areas in Mindanao, such as Basilan province [located at 54
on the map of the Philippines referenced below - Mod.CP].
On Wed 25 Jul 2007, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III blamed the
conflict in [this] area], which he said interrupted his department's
measles vaccination program there. "The cases were traced to nearby
provinces where there are conflicts, like Basilan. We could not
complete our measles vaccination efforts there because of the
fighting," Duque said in Filipino during an interview on dzXL radio.
Basilan is now the site of ongoing pursuit operations by the military
against the killers of 14 Marines during an encounter in Tipo-Tipo
town on 10 Jul 2007. Of the 14 slain Marines, 10 were mutilated and
beheaded, prompting Malacanang [Office of the President - Mod.CP] to
order "punitive" action against the culprits.
The Zamboanga Today newspaper on Tuesday [24 Jul 2007] quoted
Zamboanga city health officer, Rodel Agbulos, as saying that while
the situation is considered an outbreak, it is still manageable.
Agbulos said 40 were cases reported last week [16-22 Jul 2007], and
another 10 were reported from "sporadic" areas of Sta. Barbara,
Sangali, and Canelar. Children 6 years old and below are the main
targets of the immunization drive.
He said the spread of measles in the city started when Basilan
[province] had experienced an outbreak. Most of those afflicted with
the disease went from Basilan to Zamboanga [located at 53 on the map
of the Philippines referenced below - Mod.CP]], the report said. Some
were taken to the hospital while others stayed with their relatives, he said.
