Sleeping Sickness Kills 10
----------------------------
The district council declared Kaberamaido district a disaster zone on 10
Jan 2005 after 10 people died of sleeping sickness. Sleeping sickness is
transmitted to human beings by tsetse flies, which transmit an equivalent
infection called nagana to animals.
In the meeting at the council chambers, the councillors said the district
could no longer manage the mounting cases of the epidemic. The meeting was
attended by a team of experts in tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis control led
by Dr Nicholas Kauta.
The District Director of Health Services, Dr Geoffrey Balengera, said that
by 17 Jan 2005, 10 people had died of sleeping sickness while 150 others
had been diagnosed as having the disease. He said the infection rate was 2
percent per day, which is too difficult for the poor district to handle.
The LC5 Vice Chairperson, Ms Florence Kamasiko Ouga, said the district is
poor and the epidemic had struck at a time when people displaced by the
Lord's Resistance Army rebels are beginning to resettle in the villages.
Kauta, who is also a Commissioner for Animal Health, and Dr Dauson
Mulambali, a Commissioner for Health in charge of Sleeping Sickness, agreed
with the councillors to declare Kaberamaido a disaster zone. Balengera said
all the subcounties in the district had been affected. He said some
patients had come from Dokolo and Otuke counties in Lira district.
Balengera said Kaberamaido has one poorly equipped centre for diagnosis and
treatment of sleeping sickness.

[This outbreak is near the site of another in Katakwi district reported by
ProMED on 13 Dec 2004; Kaberamaido district is west of Katakwi at the same
latitude. This probably implies that trypanosomiasis is increasing in the
whole of northern Uganda. Trypanosomiasis in Uganda is a zoonotic
infection, with cattle as the main reservoir; slowing the spread of
infection depends on tsetse control. - Mod.EP]
