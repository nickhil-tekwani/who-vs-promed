The posting on ProMED-mail from 19 Aug 1998 on the 1918 influenza virus is
in error. The paper in the 18 Aug 1998 edition of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences USA by H. Goto and Y. Kawaoka (A novel
mechanism for the acquisition of virulence by a human influenza A virus,
PNAS 1998 95: 10224-10228.) looks at hemagglutinin cleavage in A/WSN/33
(H1N1), a mouse-adapted influenza virus that is neurovirulent. They
confirmed experiments going back to the 1970's that 1, WSN/33 can use
plasmin in tissue culture to cleave its hemagglutinin without exogenous
trypsin, and 2, that the neuraminidase gene of WSN/33 binds plasminogen.
I wrote an accompanying commentary on this paper in the same issue (J K.
Taubenberger. Influenza virus hemagglutinin cleavage into HA1, HA2: No
laughing matter, PNAS 1998 95: 9713-9715.)
Goto and Kawaoka did not examine the 1918 influenza neuraminidase gene in
the above manuscript. The WSN/33 mechanism of HA cleavage has only been
identified in these laboratory derived, mouse-adapted influenza strains.
