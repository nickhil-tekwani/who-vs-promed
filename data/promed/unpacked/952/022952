Consumer market analysts Mintel International issued a report today which
was cited as saying today that UK burger sales grew 37 per cent in the five
years to 1997, faster than any other single product in the 4.7 billion
pound ($7.8 billion) market despite the health risk concerns associated
with beef eating.
The report also said that British eaters spent a total of 1.17 billion
pounds in 1997 on burgers -- or about 1.2 million "meal deals" a day at
three pounds each.
The fast food sector as a whole grew 27 per cent in value terms in the five
year period, due partly to a total industry advertising spend of about 60
million pounds in 1997, up from 28 million in 1992 -- the survey said.
McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) accounted for 41 million pounds of this, while
Diageo Plc's (DGE.L) Burger King spent about 10 million.
Mintel's leisure analyst Chris Butcher was cited as saying burgers account
for 25 per cent of the UK fast food market and "are now as British as fish
and chips," adding, "The market is benefiting from the shift towards less
formal mealtimes and eating on the move."
Some 43 percent of consumers described burgers and fried chicken as "handy
when you need a quick snack" against 18 percent who said it was "unhealthy
junk food."
Only nine percent were concerned about any health risks associated with BSE
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) from eating beef.
Pizza and pasta sales saw growth of 35 percent to 822,000 pounds, while
fried chicken sales were up 30 percent from 1992 levels at 503,000 pounds.
Sales of fish and chips, Britain's indigenous fast food, grew 19 percent in
the period and sales totalled 746,000 pounds in 1997.

[I suppose that this will be taken as proof of the quality of English
cooking. On a more serious note, it must reflect the opinion of the man on
the Clapham omnibus as to the real risks posed by beef in the UK. - Mod.MHJ]
