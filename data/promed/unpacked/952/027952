Dengue outbreak on Easter Island: description of index case and update
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first case of dengue fever in Chile was acquired on Easter Island,
which is located in the Pacific Ocean 3800 km off the coast of Chile. The
case was diagnosed on Wed 13 Mar 2002.
The index case was a woman aged 21 years, who suffered high fever,
myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and a maculopapular rash for 7 days.
Laboratory analysis of a blood sample revealed low white cell and platelet
counts: WBC 3000/mm3 and platelets 100 000/mm3.
While febrile she traveled back to Santiago. She was admitted to a private
clinic in Santiago where a dengue virus infection was suspected. Dengue
fever was diagnosed by identification of IgM at the Virology Laboratory of
the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile and confirmed by the Public
Health Institute.
The patient had been living on [Easter Island for 2 months without
travelling elsewhere. The presence of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ on the
island has been known for 18 months. During this time educational campaigns
and fumigations had been carried out and a surveillance system was set up
to detect cases of dengue fever and/or yellow fever. No cases had been
detected.
The _Aedes_ vector has not been detected in continental Chile and no cases
of dengue fever have been diagnosed either, so at this time the problem is
confined to Easter Island only. The size of the outbreak has to be
determined. A team of epidemiologists, infectious disease physicians, and
environmental specialists led by the Ministry of Health have visited the
island to assess the outbreak and reinforce preventive measures.
At the moment another 12 patients who had fever have been confirmed as
dengue fever cases by IgM. 93 patients are waiting to be confirmed by
laboratory tests.
