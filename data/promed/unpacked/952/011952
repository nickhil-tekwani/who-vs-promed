--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
Background: COVID-19 vaccines show excellent efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in real-world data, but some people still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. This study aimed to identify risk factors for post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the characteristics of post-vaccination illness.

Methods: This prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used self-reported data (e.g., on demographics, geographical location, health risk factors, and COVID-19 test results, symptoms, and vaccinations) from UK-based, adult (age 18 years or older) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile phone app.

Findings: Between 8 Dec 2020 and 4 Jul 2021, 1 240 009 COVID Symptom Study app users reported a 1st vaccine dose, of whom 6030 (0.5%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 1), and 971 504 reported a 2nd dose, of whom 2370 (0.2%) subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 2). In the risk factor analysis, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (age 60 years or older) after their 1st vaccine dose (odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.50-2.48; p less than 0.0001), and individuals living in highly deprived areas had increased odds of post-vaccination infection following their 1st vaccine dose (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23; p = 0.039). Individuals without obesity (BMI less than 30 kg/m2) had lower odds of infection following their 1st vaccine dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94; p = 0.0030). For the disease profile analysis, 3825 users from cases 1 were included in cases 3 and 906 users from cases 2 were included in cases 4. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than 5 symptoms in the 1st week of illness following the 1st or 2nd dose, and long-duration (28 days or more) symptoms following the 2nd dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older.

Interpretation: To minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection, at-risk populations must be targeted in efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness and infection control measures. Our findings might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated, and might have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.

Discussion: To conclude, the odds of post-vaccination infection following the 1st dose were increased in frail, older adults and in those living in more deprived areas, and were decreased in individuals without obesity. Compared with unvaccinated controls, after their 2nd vaccine dose, individuals were less likely to have prolonged illness (symptoms for 28 days or more), more than 5 symptoms in the 1st week of illness, or present to hospital.

Determination of risk factors for infection post-vaccination is important to define. "Data suggest that although COVID-19 is usually milder if contracted after vaccination than in unvaccinated individuals, mortality remains high in hospitalised individuals: data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium have shown a mortality of 27.0% (400 of 1482 died) in individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK more than 21 days after vaccination, similar to mortality rates observed during the 1st wave (March-April 2020)" (from the publication by Antonelli et al reported above; see source URL for more, including references and complete data). - Mod.LK]

[2] Europe: vaccine boosters
Date: Thu 2 Sep 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/european-officials-say-covid-19-booster-isnt-urgent


While the world continues to grapple with increased cases, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said COVID-19 vaccine boosters are not urgently needed for healthy people.

The ECDC report, released today [2 Sep 2021], partly echoes the World Health Organization's call last month [August 2021] for a booster moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine doses, as a very low percentage of people worldwide have received the original full vaccination regimen.

"In this situation, the priority now should be to vaccinate all those eligible individuals who have not yet completed their recommended vaccination course," an ECDC press release states. "To complement vaccination efforts, it is also crucial to continue applying measures such as physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, and using face masks where needed, in particular in high-risk settings such as long-term care facilities or hospital wards with patients at risk of severe COVID-19 (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-and-ema-considerations-additional-and-booster-doses-covid-19-vaccines).

The ECDC takes care to note that booster doses for those with healthy immune systems are different from additional COVID-19 doses for those with compromised immune systems -- those should already be considered, according to the agency. In this vein, the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) announced yesterday [1 Sep 2021] that people with severely weakened immune systems should seek a 3rd, mRNA-based dose.

Part of the deliberation included preliminary data from the OCTAVE trial, where 40% of immunocompromised people had low levels of antibodies after 2 doses. While the JCVI acknowledges that many 3rd-dose studies are still ongoing, it says a 3rd dose is unlikely to have adverse effects. If a UK booster program is advised later on, immunocompromised people who received a 3rd dose will be offered an additional dose "at a suitable interval after their 3rd dose."

Surges in COVID hot spots
-------------------------
Ramifications from the world's rising case numbers include civil unrest in Thailand and tightened restrictions in Bulgaria.

Reports of protests in Thailand broke a few weeks ago, but photos and coverage on Twitter show people are back, demanding Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's resignation due to corruption, economic mismanagement, and a poor COVID-19 response. Out of Thailand's 1.2 million infections and 12 103 COVID-19 deaths, most have occurred since April this year [2021], according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thousands-join-protest-bangkok-demanding-prime-ministers-resignation-2021-09-02/).

In Bulgaria, the European Union's least-vaccinated country, new curfews and gathering limitations will be imposed to stem COVID-19 cases, Reuters reports. Through October [2021], restaurants and bars will have to close at 10 pm starting 7 Sep 2021, and other mandates include a ban on music festivals, a 50% limit at cinemas and theaters, and a spectator ban at indoor sports competitions (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bulgaria-imposes-new-restrictions-curb-surge-covid-cases-2021-09-02/).

On the other hand, cases in Australia's Victoria state have caused it to follow New South Wales in abandoning its no-COVID tolerance, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-doctors-warn-health-system-may-capsize-when-covid-19-curbs-ease-2021-09-01/). As the Economist explains, this central government-approved policy shift means that cases will be allowed to rise without triggering mitigations such as lockdowns so long as hospitals can cope with them (https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/08/28/australia-is-ending-its-zero-covid-strategy).

The Australian Medical Association, however, is asking governments to take a close look at healthcare systems to make sure staffing and resource levels are adequate. "If you have opened up and you haven't looked at the safety nets or the life rafts that we've got, we might end up actually trying to push more people on the life rafts and capsizing them," AMA Vice President Chris Moy, MBBS, told ABC, according to Reuters.

While Australia has had very little COVID-19 during the entire pandemic -- reporting 1019 deaths and a little over 56 500 cases -- the country only has about 36% of people 16 and older fully vaccinated.

More global headlines
---------------------
- Israel reported a record daily high of new COVID-19 cases yesterday [1 Sep 2021] (11 187 cases), but serious cases have continued to decline, according to Haaretz (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/covid-in-israel-new-cases-hit-new-record-but-serious-cases-decline-1.10175288). The country is currently rolling out 3rd vaccine doses, which the Wall Street Journal says is now required for all of its vaccine passport holders to enjoy full benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-israel-being-fully-vaccinated-now-means-three-shots-11630426257).

- Some of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine doses sent from South Africa to Europe are going back to the African continent, and the company has said further manufacturing at its South African partner site will be for African countries, reports Fierce Pharma (https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/j-j-covid-19-vaccines-shipped-from-south-africa-to-europe-to-be-sent-back-as-aspen-looks-to).

- According to the Johns Hopkins tracker, the global COVID-19 total today [2 Sep 2021] is at 218 814 466 cases and 4 548 237 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[3] Immune determinants
Date: Thu 2 Sep 2021

Citation: Israelow B, Mao T, Klein J, et al. Adaptive immune determinants of viral clearance and protection in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2. Sci Immunol. 2021; https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abl4509
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 160 million infections and more than 3 million deaths worldwide. While effective vaccines are currently being deployed, the adaptive immune determinants that promote viral clearance and confer protection remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate that both humoral and cellular adaptive immunity contribute to viral clearance in the setting of primary infection. Furthermore, we find that either convalescent mice or mice that receive mRNA vaccination are protected from both homologous infection and infection with a variant of concern, B.1.351. Additionally, we find this protection largely mediated by antibody response and not cellular immunity. These results highlight the in vivo protective capacity of antibodies generated to both vaccine and natural infection.

Introduction
------------
The development of adaptive immune responses to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in humans has been well characterized (1-4). Additional studies have reported that vaccine-induced or natural infection-induced immunity in animal models, including non-human primates (5-9), mice (10,11), and hamsters (12), is sufficient for protection from homologous SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Phase III vaccine clinical trials as well as post-marketing vaccine effectiveness studies provide evidence of the development of protective immunity in humans (13,14). Epidemiologic studies of natural infection have also indicated that adaptive immune memory is sufficient to protect against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in most cases (15).

However, few of these studies have identified the essential correlates of protective adaptive immunity. The relative contributions of cellular and humoral immunity in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and protection from reinfection remain poorly defined in both vaccine-induced immunity and natural infection-induced immunity. Importantly, questions regarding the degree to which T cell-mediated immune memory may compensate for waning antibody-mediated immunity have become even more critical given the emergence of viral variants of concern (VOC) that evade neutralizing antibody responses from both vaccinated and convalescent individuals (16-19).

Discussion
----------
In conclusion, we provide insights into both the immunologic determinants of viral clearance and protection. While T cells were important in the clearance of primary infection, they were not required for protection against reinfection or vaccine-mediated protection, likely due to sufficient antibody-mediated immunity. These results are reassuring, as they indicate that a robust humoral immune response is sufficient even in the setting of decreased neutralizing capacity. These results also have important public health and vaccine development implications, as they suggest that antibody-mediated immunity may be a sufficient correlate of protection.

"We asked what are the roles of antibodies vs T cells in controlling primary infection, reinfection, and vaccine-mediated protection? ...However, in mice that have neither T cells nor B cells (RAG-/-), SARS-CoV-2 persisted with no sign of clearance. Thus, innate immunity is insufficient, and adaptive immunity is required to control primary infection." - Mod.LK]
