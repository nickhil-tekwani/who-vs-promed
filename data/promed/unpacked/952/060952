An unexpected case of measles diagnosed in one student at a village school in Sammatti, southern Finland has revealed that roughly half of the schools' pupils have not been vaccinated against the disease. Officials have confined about 50 unprotected children to their homes for their own safety. The outbreak was 1st reported by the tabloid daily Ilta Sanomat.

The measles infection was diagnosed on Monday [20 Jan 2014]. The infected child had been at school for one day before the diagnosis was confirmed. Roughly half of the school's 100-odd students have not been inoculated against measles. Similarly, several young children in a nearby daycare centre have no protection against the disease.

Local health care authorities moved fast to ensure that the roughly 50 unprotected children are not exposed to infection -- they have been put into home quarantine. "Children who have received 2 MPR vaccines have been allowed to return to school. The others are at home and have been instructed to avoid public places and visiting other homes," explained Lohja health centre chief medical officer Tanja Nummila. Nummila said she did not recall such a large scale quarantine order during her entire career in Lohja. The unprotected children will now be actively offered the vaccine, and so far, 10 have already been inoculated.

"I'm satisfied if even some of the children have been able to receive the vaccine. Unfortunately, it won't help in this situation, but going forward they will have protection," Nummila added. The chief physician commended the school on its quick action in addressing the outbreak. "The school has given the quarantined children work to do at home, so their studies won't be interrupted," she noted. The children confined to home quarantine will be allowed to return to school on 28 Jan 2014.

A further measles outbreak has been confirmed at the Tycoch campus of Gower College Swansea. A cluster of 4 confirmed cases of measles has been reported at Gower College Swansea. The cases are at the Tycoch Campus and come less than a week after Public Health Wales warned of a community outbreak in the area. It has led to a further plea for unprotected children and young people to receive the MMR vaccine urgently. Five further cases of measles have been confirmed across the Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot, and Carmarthenshire areas.

Public Health Wales has said no connections can be identified between cases associated with the Tycoch Campus and those linked to the 4 schools in Neath and Swansea, or those in the wider community. A vaccination session for staff and students will be held at the Tycoch Campus tomorrow [30 Jan 2014], and anyone else in the area who remains unvaccinated is urged to speak to their GP to arrange to receive the MMR.

Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "We now once again have evidence of community spread in the Neath and Swansea areas, resulting in 2 confirmed outbreaks and a significant number of cases which could not be linked to either of them. This really is a cause for concern. Measles is a potentially nasty infection that can easily be prevented with a safe, effective vaccine, and we would not see measles in Wales if enough children and young people were vaccinated. Uptake of the MMR vaccine in small children is the highest it's ever been in Wales, but we still have a large number of children and teenagers aged 10 to 18 who are not vaccinated. We are also seeing adult cases and would urge anyone born after 1970 to check whether they have either had measles or 2 doses of the MMR vaccination, and speak to their GP urgently if they have not. This age group is most vulnerable to the complications of measles. It simply is not worth the risk for anyone of any age to remain unvaccinated."

Vaccinations will be offered all day on Thursday [30 Jan 2014] to staff and students in the Main Hall at the Tycoch Campus. Three people have needed to be treated in hospital as a result of the recent outbreaks. Although the age group mainly affected is children and young people aged between 10 and 18, adults have also been affected and are more likely to suffer complications of the infection. The current outbreak follows the largest ever outbreak of measles in Wales since the introduction of the MMR vaccination, which saw more than 1200 cases of measles in the same area between November 2012 and July 2013. In that outbreak, 88 people were hospitalised, and one adult died. A 25-year-old man from Swansea was said to have died from pneumonia after contracting measles.

Although more than 70 000 catch up doses of MMR were given across Wales during the last outbreak, Public Health Wales has said 30 000 children and young people in the 10 to 18 age group remain unprotected. The MMR vaccine is the only protection against measles. The 1st dose of MMR is usually given to babies at 12 months of age and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a distinctive red rash.

Anyone who thinks they or their child has the symptoms of measles should contact their GP or NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47.

Health authorities in Guinea are scrambling to contain a measles outbreak that has killed one child, infected 37 others and spread to half of the country's 33 districts. More than 400 suspected cases, nearly all of them in children under 10 years old, have been registered. A vaccination campaign targeting over 1.6 million children is to be launched in the coming weeks.

"We have moved from 3 affected districts in Conakry before the end of last year [2013] to the whole city now being affected. Five more districts out of Conakry are also affected. It means that it could spread throughout the country," said Felix Ackebo, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) deputy representative for Guinea.

"One of the causes is the nature of the disease. The other is the social/political instability. Many bilateral donors stopped support, awaiting the holding of legislative elections. The whole health system has been weakened. The government was restricted on what it could purchase, and this affected [availability of] vaccines and other important drugs. Many of the basic social services have suffered from this pause in investment," Ackebo told IRIN. "In the past, we have been obliged to buy measles vaccines and others because the government could not." Only 37 percent of Guinean children are fully vaccinated, according to the 2012 Demographic Health Survey. The country's last measles epidemic, in 2009, infected 4755 people and killed 10.

Keita Sakoba, head of disease prevention at the Ministry of Health, said that the current stock of measles vaccine, meant for routine immunisation, was insufficient for the vaccination drive. He explained that the outbreak was likely due to the accumulation of unvaccinated children. "We will launch a vaccination campaign in the 15 affected districts and carry out targeted immunizations in districts neighbouring the affected ones," Sakoba said.

Over 100 outbreak alerts, mainly for measles, were reported and investigated in December 2013, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The majority of the measles cases were reported in central Somalia, where immunization coverage is very low. To accelerate child health and improve immunization coverage, Child Health Days were held across southern and central Somalia in December 2013 with support from pooled funds.

The campaign targeted over one million children with pentavalent vaccine and vaccine against measles and polio. Pentavalent is a vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, and haemophilus influenza. About 1.2 million women of childbearing age were targeted with tetanus toxoid vaccination. An increased number of suspected cholera cases were reported in December 2013.

Health partners collected and analysed stool samples, which tested negative for cholera and other diseases like shigella and salmonella. However, about 2/3rds of the cases tested positive for rotavirus. Rotavirus is one of the major causes of acute watery diarrhoea in Somalia, which highlights the importance of hygiene promotion activities to reduce the burden of the disease. The wild polio cases in Somalia stood at 185 as of mid-January 2014, and response activities continue. Incidences of violence have continued in southern Somalia.

Four people have died, and 10 others are being closely monitored after a suspected outbreak of measles in Kakindo and Birembo Sub Counties, Kibaale district. The 4 children died on Sunday [26 Jan 2014] after battling the disease within one week. They are aged between 2 to 8 years. Three additional cases have been reported in Buyaga West County.

According to William Mutesa, a member of the Village Health Team-VHT, before their deaths, 2 presented with high fever, general skin rash, and running nose, which are known signs of measles. Last evening [26 Jan 2014], a team of health workers was dispatched to Kakindo Sub Country to collect blood samples from some of the patients for further scrutiny. Sanyu Suleiman, the Kibaale district surveillance officer (DSO), said they will collect body tissue from the deceased.

The village chairperson, Andrew Nibihurira, said the suspected outbreak was due to a poor response to immunization, adding that most of the children aged between 2-5 years are not immunised. Residents were advised to avoid direct body contact with patients as a basic precautionary measure.

The United Nations Human Rights Agency [UNHRA] started a mass measles immunization campaign on Friday [30 Jan 2014] in northern Uganda to prevent the disease from spreading among South Sudanese refugees. Adrian Edwards, a UNHCR spokesperson, announced the campaign on Friday, which is targeting the more than 59 000 South Sudanese refugees who arrived in the country since clashes began in South Sudan in mid-December 2013. The Ugandan Ministry of Health confirmed the measles outbreak after 5 cases and 3 suspected cases were registered among refugees in the Arua area.

"The immunization campaign will cover all refugee and Ugandan children below 15 years in age in the Arua and Adjumani districts," Edwards said. "We are working on this project with UNICEF, the Ugandan Ministry of Health, Medecins Sans Frontieres-France, and Medical Teams International." Edwards said Uganda is still receiving 250 refugees a day at the Adjumani reception area. He said the UNHCR welcomes the signing of the South Sudan ceasefire agreement and hopes it can be implemented to avoid further displacement.

Since mid-December 2013, more than 100 000 refugees from South Sudan fled to neighboring countries, including Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda. There are approximately 490 000 individuals who are internally displaced within the country. South Sudan was already host to 230 000 refugees itself, most of whom are from Sudan.

Three visits to the Alberta Children's Hospital emergency room by a child with measles earlier this month [January 2014] has left other patients at those times at risk, Alberta Health Services [AHS] said.

AHS has sent out letters warning those who might have been exposed to the disease. Those who were in the ER on 14 Jan 2014 from 1:30-8:34 p.m., 16 Jan 2014 from 6 p.m. to 17 Jan 2014 at 1:53 a.m. and 18 Jan 2014 from 12:41-9:18 p.m. will receive the AHS letter. "Only those who have received a letter from Alberta Health Services have potentially been exposed to measles," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services in Calgary. "There is not a risk to the general public."

The incident at Alberta Children's Hospital follows a Saskatchewan measles case passing through Calgary by plane on 7 Jan 2014, and a student at Western Canada High School confirmed as having the disease on 10 Jan 2014. The previous incidents both involved travel to the Philippines. AHS advises calling Health Link Alberta at 1-866-408-5465 if symptoms develop rather than attending a health care facility.

Health Link Alberta lists symptoms as including fever, cough, acute nasal mucous membrane discharge, inflammation of the lining of the eyelids, a spreading rash, and eruption of small, irregular, bright red spots on the inner cheeks in the mouth with a minute bluish or white speck in the centre of each.

There is one new confirmed cases of measles in the province, bringing the total to 6. The latest case of measles was confirmed on Friday [31 Jan 2014] by the Ministry of Health.

Five of the 6 cases of measles have been reported in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. "There is follow up of rash illness in terms of people who may have been exposed to the various public settings," Dr. Denise Werker, the province's deputy chief medical health officer, told reporters on Friday [31 Jan 2014] morning. The incubation period -- from when someone is exposed to measles to the onset of symptoms -- is about 3 weeks. "We're looking at the 1st block of 21 days and seeing if there are going to be new cases," Werker said. "We're just waiting and watching and putting in measures in case there are additional cases."

The Saskatchewan Health Ministry issued a special public alert about the potentially deadly disease on 17 Jan 2014 after it received confirmation of measles in an unimmunized infant who travelled by air to Saskatchewan in early January 2014. The ministry issued the alert because measles is a highly infectious and potentially serious disease that is easily transmitted through the air. Symptoms include high fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash. The rash often starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. Measles vaccination is usually offered in combination with mumps and rubella in one vaccine at 12 months and again at 18 months. Most people born before 1970 are considered to be immune to the disease, but those born after 1970 should get 2 shots of the MMR vaccine.

People who suspect they have measles should phone their physician or health-care provider in advance so arrangements can be made for them to be examined and get lab tests.

North Coast health officials have warned people travelling to the Philippines to ensure they are immunised against measles because of the ongoing measles outbreak in that country. Greg Bell, North Coast deputy director of public health, said measles was highly contagious among people who were not fully immunised. "Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing and is one of the most contagious infections known," he said. "Complications can range from swelling of the brain and pneumonia to ear infections and diarrhoea. In recent weeks, there have been 10 cases of measles reported in NSW (New South Wales). Seven were associated with travel to the Philippines, including 3 young children who were admitted to hospital. NSW Health urges everyone planning on travelling to the Philippines to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations before they travel."
