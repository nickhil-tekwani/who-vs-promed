Hepatitis E common in Spanish pigs
-----------------------------------
Spanish researchers from Barcelona University say their country's pig
industry is broadly infected by the hepatitis [E] virus. It is even
feared the virus cannot be eradicated.
The veterinary faculty at Barcelona's university recently studied to
what extent pigs in Spain are infected with the hepatitis E virus.
This virus is capable of transferring from pigs to humans and causing
severe liver infections.
The researchers studied a total of 41 Spanish pig-production sites
and used the ELISA test to trace hepatitis E. At 40 sites they found
the animals were carrying antibodies against the virus, meaning that
the virus was present or had been present at 97.6 percent of the
sites.
Especially the older sows appeared to be carrying the virus -- 60.8
percent of the animals proved to be doing so. In young piglets, up to
6-weeks old, 36.2 percent proved to be infected. In older piglets,
the infection ratio was even higher. The outcome of the research is
soon to be published.
The researchers now say that hepatitis E has most probably become
endemic in the Spanish pig industry.

[Background information has been provided in a commentary by Mod. CP,
(included in ProMED-mail's posting Hepatitis E - Chad (Eastern)
20050822.2477):
"Hepatitis E is an important public health concern in many developing
countries. Hepatitis E is caused by a small, single-stranded RNA
calicivirus-like enteric virus, now classified as the separate genus
_Hepevivirus_. The hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral
route and is associated with fecal contamination of water supplies.
The hepatitis E mortality rate can reach 25 percent in pregnant women
in deprived communities, but is generally much lower. Although
hepatitis E disease only occurs rarely in countries with good
health-care systems, the seroprevalence rate in healthy individuals
can be high.
Hepatitis E disease can be controlled to a large extent by provision
of clean water and adequate sewage treatment facilities. However,
there is increasing evidence that hepatitis E virus is also a
zoonotic agent and that animal reservoirs may exist. Many species of
domestic and wild animals have anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies, and
animal hepatitis E viruses closely related to human hepatitis E
viruses have been isolated. Avian hepatitis E viruses appear to be
less closely related to human viruses.
Swine may be an important reservoir of the virus, as pig handlers and
veterinarians appear to be at greater risk of infection, as indicated
by higher antibody levels. Furthermore, cases of acute hepatitis E
have occurred in Japan, in association with consumption of raw pig
and wild boar meat.
Lack of an efficient cell culture system has impeded the development
of vaccines and therapeutic agents".
In an earlier posting (Hepatitis E virus, fatal - Japan (Hokkaido)
20041128.3183), Mod. CP commented:
"Hepatitis E virus infection appears to be common in both farmed and
wild swine in parts of Japan; therefore, all pig meat should be
cooked thoroughly before consumption".
Pigs seem not to be clinically affected by the virus but suspected to
be its reservoir. - Mod.AS]
