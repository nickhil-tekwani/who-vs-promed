One person died and more than 60 required emergency room care after eating
food tainted with salmonella at a meal marking the end of the seven-day
mourning period for a local man in Kiryat Malachi last week.
More than 300 people participated in the gathering of mourners for a member
of the local religious council and a well-known member of the community in
Kiryat Malachi. The deceased man's sister, a mother of five, died from the
food poisoning on Thursday. The meal was catered by a food business that
opened only one month earlier and operated without a license from the Health
Ministry. The catering business was ordered closed on Friday by health
officials.
About a third of those treated at emergency rooms required hospitalization,
including Avikzar's three children.
