The number of Indonesians under observation for bird flu symptoms has risen
to 17, health officials said on Friday, but added that local tests
confirmed a 5 year old girl who died this week did not have the virus.
4 Indonesians are confirmed to have died from the highly pathogenic H5N1
strain of bird flu since July.
But UN health experts have said the growth in possible cases in Indonesia
-- a big producer and consumer of chickens -- did not mean the outbreak was
worsening, and that there was still no sign the virus could be passed
easily among people.
Sardikin Giriputro, deputy head of the government-designated hospital in
Jakarta to treat bird flu, said 9 of his 17 patients had been to Jakarta's
Ragunan zoo, [which had been] shut [down] this week after tests showed some
exotic birds had avian flu.
On Thursday, the government put the number of people under observation at
11. Only one of those patients, an 8 year old boy who was related to a
Jakarta woman who died of bird flu 2 weeks ago, has been confirmed to have
the virus [H5N1]. "The boy's condition is very good. But he will be under
observation for the next 21 days," Giriputro said.
Until now, all deaths and recent suspected cases of bird flu have been in
or around the teeming capital Jakarta. Local media have reported a boy who
died in East Kalimantan province on Borneo island this week had bird flu
symptoms. Officials have not said if he was tested for the virus.
Bird flu has killed a total of 64 people in four Asian nations since late
2003 and has been found in birds in Russia and Europe. Most of the people
who died caught it from infected birds.
Indonesia's recent cases have heightened global concerns. The WHO's chief
said last week that bird flu was moving toward becoming transmissible
[among] humans and that the world had no time to waste to prevent a pandemic.
The United States military was planning for a possible bird flu pandemic to
ensure its forces could respond quickly, Admiral William Fallon, the US
Pacific military commander, told reporters in Canberra on Friday. Fallon
said he had discussed bird flu with military chiefs throughout the region,
and said the issue would be high on the agenda at a meeting of US defense
chiefs in Hawaii next month. "It has been the subject of a serious planning
effort by one of my component commanders, to make sure we better understand
it, and to have some understanding of the magnitude of a potential problem
and how we might respond to it," Fallon said.
I Nyoman Kandun, head of disease control at Indonesia's Health Ministry,
said tests carried out in Indonesia on the 5 year old girl who died this
week were negative for bird flu. Indonesia was not planning to send her
blood samples to a laboratory in Hong Kong for confirmation, he told
Reuters. No results have yet been announced for another girl, aged 2, who
died in Jakarta this week with bird flu symptoms.
The government has appealed for calm over the outbreak, which has dominated
local media in recent days. On Monday, it imposed a state of high alert,
giving authorities power to order people with symptoms of the disease into
hospitals. The UN health agency is working with Jakarta to bolster stocks
of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir).
The government also plans to enhance hospitals across the world's 4th most
populous country to cope in the event the number of bird flu patients rises.

The World Health Organization (WHO) today confirmed a new human case of
H5N1 avian influenza in Indonesia, but said there is no evidence that the
virus is easily spreading from person to person there.
The agency said the Indonesian government confirmed a case in an 8 year old
boy who is being treated in a hospital. A WHO reference laboratory in Hong
Kong did the confirmatory testing.
But despite a growing number of patients being treated for suspicious
respiratory illnesses in a Jakarta hospital, the agency said, "Current
investigations in Indonesia have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus
is spreading easily from person to person." Consequently WHO has not raised
its level of pandemic alert, though it promised to keep watching the
situation closely.
The newly confirmed case means WHO now recognizes 3 cases in Indonesia,
including a 38 year old man who died in July and a 37 year old woman who
died 10 Sep 2005. The government counts the 38 year old man's 2 young
daughters, who also died in July, as cases, but the WHO has said their test
results did not meet the criteria for H5N1.
The new case increases WHO's avian flu tally since late 2003 to 115 cases
with 59 deaths, of which 91 cases and 41 deaths occurred in Vietnam.
The WHO statement did not say where the 8 year old boy lives or how he
might have been exposed to avian flu. The previous cases have all been in
the Jakarta area.
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that 13 people were being treated for
possible symptoms of avian flu today at Jakarta's Sulianti Saroso Hospital,
4 more than yesterday. A doctor there said the 3 newest patients had
visited Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo Sep 18, just before officials closed it
because 19 birds there had tested positive for the H5N1 virus.
Today's WHO statement suggested that the rash of suspected cases of avian
flu in Indonesia mainly reflects increased vigilance. Because of growing
public and governmental concern, "several patients with respiratory
symptoms and a history of possible exposure to the avian virus are being
evaluated as part of ongoing surveillance efforts," the agency said.
WHO also said today that tests on samples from the 37 year old Indonesian
woman who died of avian flu earlier this month showed that the virus had
not mutated, according to news services.
Georg Petersen, the WHO representative in Jakarta, said the virus that
killed the woman appeared to be the same as viruses circulating in poultry
in Indonesia, according to a report yesterday in the New York Times. The
finding, which he called reassuring, was based on a genetic analysis of the
virus by Malik Peiris at Hong Kong University.
According to the story, Peiris said his analysis, not yet complete,
suggests that the virus had not exchanged genes with human flu viruses, an
event that could enable it to spread more readily from person to person.

Jakarta registers four more bird flu patients
---------------------------------------------
Patients with bird flu symptoms in the Indonesian capital Jakarta were
improving while 4 more people were hospitalised after displaying symptoms
of the virus, doctors said. "Generally their conditions are improving,
except for one person. Unless further tests show otherwise, at least 4 of
them can be discharged today," hospital deputy director Sardikin Giri Putro
said.
Twenty-one people, including the 4 new patients admitted on Friday and
Saturday, were being treated at the Sulianti Saroso infectious diseases
hospital in Jakarta. Sulianti Saroso is one of 44 hospitals nationwide that
have been designated to treat bird flu patients as Indonesia steps up the
fight against the virus following the death of a man and his 2 young
daughters in July.
So far 4 people have been confirmed to have died from avian influenza in
Indonesia. Mr Sardikin said 2 people who visited a Jakarta zoo whose birds
were infected with the virus were admitted to the hospital on Friday night
and Saturday morning. Another two patients, including a 1 year old girl,
were admitted to the same hospital later Saturday, the Detikcom news
website said.
The H5N1 bird flu strain has killed 63 people in South East Asia since
2003, the majority of them in Vietnam. Indonesia's health ministry
confirmed that the country's 4 victims died from H5N1.
On Wednesday a 5 year old girl died in Sulianti Saroso hospital showing
symptoms of bird flu but authorities have yet to confirm bird flu as the
cause of death pending the completion of lab tests in Hong Kong [report
above suggested such confirmatory testing was not being undertaken. - Mod.SH].
The World Health Organisation's (WHO) biggest fear is that H5N1 may mutate,
acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly
infectious and lethal to millions in a global pandemic. But the WHO in
Geneva has urged calm, saying investigations in Indonesia had produced no
evidence that H5N1 was spreading easily from person to person.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday urged the culling of birds in
infected areas but warned against overstating the threat. Foreign donors on
Friday promised to help Indonesia in its battle against bird flu after the
UN warned of a worrying situation and urged the country to improve its
virus control policies.
In addition to the 4 Indonesian deaths, a boy named Firdaus had also tested
positive for bird flu, health officials said. About 100 people who visited
the Jakarta zoo have come to the Sulianti Saroso hospital for health checks
over the past few days, the Jakarta Post said. Authorities closed the zoo
for 21 days starting Monday after tests showed that most exotic birds there
were infected with bird flu.

[The death toll attributed to H5N1 in Indonesia has risen to 4 during the
past 24 hours. The number under observation for suspected avian flu has
obviously increased as well. 9 of the 17 suspected patients [in the first
posting above] have visited Jakarta's Ragunan zoo recently, where some
exotic birds had avian flu. According to WHO's statement of 22 Sep 2005,
there was still no sign indicating that the bird virus could be transmitted
from person to person readily. - Mod.RY]
