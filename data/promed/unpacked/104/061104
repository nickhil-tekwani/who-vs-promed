More than 2400 people travelling on the Interislander over the holidays may have been exposed to measles. A child, whose family had chosen not to vaccinate, likely contracted the measles in Auckland, then crossed Cook Strait on the Interislander's Kaitaki ferry twice during the holiday period.

There were 1219 passengers on the 1st crossing and 1220 passengers on the 2nd. KiwiRail, which runs the Interislander, became aware of the issue after the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) publicly notified the case on Tuesday [7 Jan 2020].

The CDHB urged people who had not been vaccinated and may have come into contact with the child to isolate themselves. "We are contacting all passengers and crew who travelled on the 2 affected sailings to provide health advice from the Canterbury District Health Board," KiwiRail tourism and marketing executive general manager Ahleen Rayner said.

NSW Health is advising people to be alert for symptoms of measles after a 2nd case was diagnosed in as many days. A local woman diagnosed with the infection visited a number of locations in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs and Inner West while infectious. The young woman had not travelled prior to her illness and has no known links to previously identified measles cases.

Dr Christine Selvey, NSW Health Acting Director of Communicable Diseases, said, "This is the 2nd case of measles in 2 days in a person who has not travelled overseas. This is a reminder for everyone to check that they are protected against measles, which is extremely infectious.

"As it's not clear where this woman acquired her infection, it is important that everyone is on the lookout for the early signs of measles, particularly people born during or after 1966 who have not had 2 doses of measles vaccine."

Samoa's Ministry of Health confirmed on Tuesday [7 Jan 2020] 2 more deaths in the island nation's measles epidemic, bringing the death toll to 83 since the measles outbreak in mid-October [2019]. The Samoan Ministry of Health said that the 2 fatalities, an infant and [an] adult, died between 29 Dec last year [2019] and 5 Jan this year [2020].

A total of 5697 measles cases have been reported to the Disease Surveillance Team so far, with 30 new cases recorded during the same period. A total of 16 people with measles are currently hospitalized in the island nation, including 4 critically ill children.

Currently, there are no travel restrictions or vaccination requirement for those travelling to Samoa.

With the latest measles case, the reopening of day-care centers in Samoa has now been delayed until next week, but public schools will resume on Tuesday [7 Jan 2020] as planned.

Death may occur in up to 5-10% of infected young children in developing countries.

Health Protection Agency (HPA) on Thursday [9 Jan 2020] revealed that measles, a highly contagious disease, is suspected to have resurfaced in Maldives.

As per a tweet from the agency's official Twitter handle, tests are being conducted on an individual who is believed to have the disease. No further details were given by the HPA, including details of the individual.

Vaccination against measles commenced in the Maldives in 1983. The 1st recorded case of measles in the archipelago was in 2009.

Maldives was declared measles free by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2017. At that time, Maldives and Bhutan become the first 2 countries to achieve the target of eradicating measles before the year 2020 from the South Asia region.

[5] Gaza Strip
Date: Thu 9 Jan 2020

https://www.who.int/csr/don/08-january-2020-measles-gaza-strip


From 1 Jan through 19 Dec 2019, a total of 124 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles, including 2 deaths, were reported in the Gaza Strip (case fatality ratio, 1.6%). Of the confirmed cases, 49 cases (40%) were hospitalized, 12 were among healthcare workers, and 75 (60%) were males. Gaza Strip has an estimated population of 1.99 million (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics 2019).

In addition, of the confirmed cases, 57 cases (46%) were unvaccinated, of which 28 (23%) were among infants between 6 months to one year old, and 29 (23%) were among age-groups higher than 30 years old. Between 2009 and 2018, the median administrative immunization coverage for the 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) was 97%.

The immunization strategy in Gaza Strip includes measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to children at 12 and 18 months of age (MMR introduced in 1988 as single dose, and 2nd dose introduced at 18 months of age in 2009).

Since the establishment of the indicator-based surveillance in Gaza Strip in 1986, no measles cases were reported in Gaza Strip except one confirmed case in 2000.

Public health response
----------------------
The following response measures have been taken by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Gaza Strip:
- Strengthened surveillance systems for suspect cases with fever and rash;
- Initiated the early notification of suspect cases by the Central Preventive Medicine;
- Continued maintenance of high levels of immunity with 2 doses of MMR vaccination in the community;
- Health authorities in Gaza Strip began MMR vaccination of all healthcare workers in 4 public hospitals where measles cases were admitted and treated. An estimated 900 healthcare workers were vaccinated on 13 Dec 2019.

WHO country office (WCO) is supporting the MOH in Gaza Strip in the following response activities:
- Procured 10 kits (for 9000 tests) for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) after the first 2 confirmed cases in Gaza Strip;
- Measles awareness material for healthcare workers and the public were printed and distributed;
- A measles sensitization meeting was held for 100 healthcare workers on case definition and clinical management in October 2019;
- WCO, with support from Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO), provided a Rubella kit to test the measles-negative cases with measles symptoms;
- Supporting transport of the samples from Gaza Strip to Ramallah referral laboratory;
- Supplementary immunization activities (SIA) has been recommended by WHO EMRO for all affected age-groups and healthcare workers.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Gaza Strip has maintained a high administrative coverage of 97% for MCV2 between 2009 and 2018, with a good reporting rate of 4.5 per 100 000 population. However, with the continuous socioeconomic decline, conflict and closure, Gaza Strip may be challenged with this unusual high number of measles cases in 2019.

WHO recommends that strong surveillance at the district level should be maintained in Gaza Strip to control the transmission of the disease.

Immunization is the most effective preventive measure against measles. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, vitamin A should be administered to all acute cases irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A.

WHO urges all Member States to do the following:
- 2 doses of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV) to ensure immunity: 1st dose, by 9-12 months; 2nd dose, in 2nd year of life. The minimum interval between the 2 doses should not be less than 1 month;
- Maintaining high measles vaccination coverage (95% or higher) in every district;
- Offer vaccination to individuals who do not have proof of vaccination or immunity against measles, and who are at risk of infection and transmission of the virus, such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers;
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance for cases of "fever with rash" for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities;
- Ensure that collected blood samples from suspect measles cases appropriately tested by laboratories within 5 days;
- Recognize complications early and provide comprehensive treatment to reduce the severity of disease and avoid unnecessary deaths;
- Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (2 doses of 50 000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 100 000 IU for children between 6 and 12 months of age or 200 000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day;
- Ensure healthcare workers are vaccinated in order to avoid infections acquired in a healthcare setting;
- Adequate capacity for case management, especially for complicated cases to help mitigate the mortality.

[6] Democratic Republic of the Congo: deaths top 6000
Date: Tue 7 Jan 2020

https://www.afro.who.int/news/deaths-democratic-republic-congo-measles-outbreak-top-6000


With the death toll from the world's worst measles epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) surpassing 6000, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for more funding to stop the outbreak.

Under the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partner aid agencies vaccinated more than 18 million children under 5 across the country in 2019. However, in some areas, routine vaccination coverage remains low, and 25% of the reported measles cases are in children over the age of 5, who are the most vulnerable.

"We are doing our utmost to bring this epidemic under control. Yet to be truly successful we must ensure that no child faces the unnecessary risk of death from a disease that is easily preventable by a vaccine. We urge our donor partners to urgently step up their assistance," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

Since the start of 2019, around 310 000 suspected measles cases have been reported. The epidemic has been aggravated by low vaccination coverage among vulnerable communities, malnutrition, weak public health systems, outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, difficult access by vulnerable populations to health care and insecurity that has hampered response in some areas.

Lack of funding remains a huge impediment to successfully curbing the outbreak. So far, USD 27.6 million have been mobilized. However, a further USD 40 million are required for a 6-month plan to extend the vaccination to children between 6 and 14 years and to reinforce elements of the outbreak response beyond vaccination, including improving treatment, health education, community engagement, health system strengthening, epidemiological surveillance and response coordination.

"We recognize the Government's engagement in the efforts to end the outbreak and we are grateful for the generosity of our donors. But we still need to do more," said Dr. Amedee Prosper Djiguimde, Officer in charge of WHO office in the DRC. "Thousands of Congolese families need our help to lift the burden of this prolonged epidemic from their backs. We cannot achieve this without adequate finances."

The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Medecins du Monde, Medecins Sans Frontieres, United Nations Children's Fund, WHO and other partners have been supporting the Government to bring the long-running epidemic under control. In December 2019, WHO trained 60 health professionals from the Ministry of Health to conduct a range of services, including community engagement, health education and surveillance. These health professionals are being deployed this week as part of the response.
