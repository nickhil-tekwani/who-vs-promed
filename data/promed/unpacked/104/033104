Ontario issues warning against unpasteurized milk
-----------------------------------------------
Dr. Sheela Basrur, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, today,
11 Apr 2005, warned the public not to consume unpasteurized milk.
This warning is based on an investigation that showed that 3 cases of
_E. coli_ O157 in Simcoe County might have resulted from the
consumption of unpasteurized milk. All 3 individuals have been
released from the hospital and are recovering at home.
The sale or distribution of unpasteurized milk is prohibited under
the Health Protection and Promotion Act.
The Simcoe Muskoka Health Unit is leading the investigation.
"Unpasteurized milk may contain harmful bacteria," Dr. Basrur said.
"Anyone with nausea, fever, vomiting or diarrhea who consumed
unpasteurized milk should contact their doctor immediately."
Disease-causing bacteria associated with unpasteurized milk include
_E. coli_ O157 as well as salmonella and campylobacter bacteria.
Symptoms of _E. coli_ O157 include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea
(sometimes bloody). Young children and seniors are also at higher
risk of developing serious complications, which can be fatal.
Dr. Basrur is also asking members of the public to report sales of
unpasteurized milk to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food's
complaint line at 1-888-466-2372 ext. 64391. The Ministry of Health
and Long-Term Care continues to monitor the situation, in
co-operation with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

[_E. coli_ O157:H7 is just one of a number of infections that can be
transmitted to humans from unpasteurized milk or dairy products.
These include _Salmonella sp_ and _Campylobacter sp_, both of which
may be multi-drug resistant, as well as staphylococcal food
poisoning, Q fever, listeriosis, brucellosis as well as bovine
tuberculosis. Additionally, Brainerd diarrhea, a chronic diarrheal
process of unknown etiology is also associated with raw milk
ingestion. - Mod.LL]
