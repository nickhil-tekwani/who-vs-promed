[1] Origin of SARS-CoV-2
Date: Fri 27 Nov 2020
Source: SCMP [edited]
https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3111691/where-did-covid-19-originate-these-virus-sleuths-are-assessing


The origins of COVID-19 remain unknown, and a gamut of hypotheses, conspiracy theories, and studies have raised more questions than answers about how the virus that causes the disease emerged and spread around the world.

Now, a group of battle-tested disease detectives, led by a US-based scientist with a history researching bat viruses in China, are stepping up to evaluate "every hypothesis" for the source of this virus, 1st identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan nearly a year ago.

The task force was announced earlier this week under an interdisciplinary initiative backed by medical journal The Lancet to find solutions to the pandemic. The formation of the Lancet Covid-19 Commission's task force on the origins of the virus came just as another international effort to uncover the origins of the disease -- the World Health Organization's (WHO's) scientific mission -- was getting to work.

But unlike that inquiry, in which an international team will conduct research with Chinese scientists at the request of the WHO's governing body, the Lancet task force is a public-facing group that does not expect to run its work on the ground in China, according to its leader, Peter Daszak, the bat virus researcher and president of US-based research organisation EcoHealth Alliance.

"We are scientists reviewing what's known and saying, 'Where does the evidence fall on the different hypotheses that are out there?'" said Daszak, who is in the unique position of being part of both the WHO international team and the Lancet task force.

"In one sense, [the Lancet team] will be freer to speak about our findings straight away and make them public."

He said any public perception that an "international pathogen police force" was going to sweep in and find the equivalent of a smoking gun was unrealistic.

In any such outbreak, finding out which animals the virus jumped from to get to humans could take years, and would require international scientists working together, something Daszak aims for the Lancet task force to promote.

"What we can do is bring people together who really know what happens in an outbreak, what happens in a biosafety lab, what happens with viral sequences and evolution ... what happens in a wildlife market," said the disease ecologist, known for his research on viral zoonosis.

Daszak, who declined to comment about the WHO mission for this story, is joined on the Lancet team by 11 other scientists who he says are well poised to take on the task.

Among them is Danielle Anderson, scientific director of the Duke-NUS Medical School's biosafety level-3 laboratory, who has worked in the Wuhan Institute of Virology's (WIV's) high-containment lab.

There are also veterans of other outbreaks, including Sai Kit Lam of Universiti Malaya, who headed the team that discovered the deadly Nipah virus that emerged in Malaysia in 1998, as well as Hume Field of Australia's University of Queensland and Hong Kong University's Malik Peiris, who were both involved in key breakthroughs in China's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic nearly 2 decades ago.

The team will step into a complicated landscape, because the origins of the virus have become the object of intense global interest, prompting the flood of research and conflicting theories about where it came from but few solid conclusions.

The scientific community generally agrees that the virus probably originated in a bat before passing to humans, perhaps via an intermediary host. Although many of the 1st known cases were linked to a Wuhan wet market, it is unknown whether the virus originated there -- such as through infected animals sold in the wildlife trade -- or was brought into the city from elsewhere.

The scientific question has turned into a political one, as Washington sought to pin blame for the subsequent pandemic on China. For a time, US officials pushed the idea, dismissed by most scientists, that the virus could have escaped in Wuhan from the WIV, which studies bat coronaviruses.

Daszak, who collaborated with the institute, had his own work caught up in the claims, as funding for his organisation's research in China was cut by the US National Institutes of Health earlier this year [2020].

The Chinese government has countered this message with its own line that even if the virus was identified in Wuhan, it did not necessarily originate there, although it has yet to release full findings from investigations in the city. A top Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention official has also suggested that the virus could have originally arrived in China via imported seafood, without providing evidence.

Several controversial studies have also pointed to the possibility that the virus was circulating in Europe earlier than was originally known, adding another question about the timeline of the outbreak.

Daszak said that part of the Lancet task force's work was to "look at every hypothesis, whether that this virus was circulating a year earlier in Europe, whether it's that it came from a biosafety lab or the wildlife trade."

For Daszak, who was part of a team along with WIV researchers who identified bats as reservoirs for SARS-like coronaviruses after the 2002-03 outbreak of that disease, the known evolutionary history of this lineage of coronaviruses points to a scenario in which this new and related coronavirus originated in the same region.

Although the closest known relative to the novel coronavirus was found in a cave in southwest China's Yunnan province, the horseshoe bat species that carries it has a range across Southeast Asia. Less sampling of coronaviruses in bats has been done in China's neighbouring countries of Myanmar, Viet Nam and Laos, according to Daszak.

"It's quite possible that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is outside China in that sense, that it's in a bat or a colony of bats or a species, and it evolved somewhere in a neighbouring country in Southeast Asia," he said. "But to say that it may have evolved in Italy or Spain, I don't think that's plausible. But we are going to keep an open mind on the task force, and look at the evidence," he said, adding that what the Lancet team finds could help guide ongoing research.

Apart from analysing the available evidence, the task force will seek to interview researchers in China. There are no mainland Chinese scientists on the Lancet team.

"The only question is whether it's too sensitive to talk about, but I'm hoping that over time, it will become a lot more straightforward and open and less political," he said. "I think the politics really mess this up; that's one of the problems."

The stakes are high for finding answers. Daszak's own research shows disease outbreaks are happening with increasing frequency, a symptom of land use changes, wildlife trade, and global trade and consumption patterns, he said.

"If we don't understand better what's happened, and use that to prevent what's going to happen," he said, "we're never going to dig our way out of the pandemic era."

[The important message here is that this is not the 1st pandemic nor will it be the last. Nearly every pandemic has had a zoonotic (animal to human) source, and closer interactions, global trade, and climatic factors increase the risk in manifold ways. Therefore, understanding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV2's origin species and its closer relatives in these animal reservoirs across countries and continents will be certainly helpful to plan for future events. All the pieces of this puzzle can be figured out using a scientific approach and data sharing. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Rethinking testing regimens
Date: Fri 27 Nov 2020
Source: National Public Radio (NPR) [edited]
https://brief19.com/2020/11/27/brief


Whether it's a PCR, a LAMP assay, antigen detection, or viral culture, the 1st question experts ask is how sensitive (which describes how many truly positive cases a test fails to detect) and specific (which describes how many positive tests are misleading) a new SARS-CoV-2 test is. Fears have promulgated around the idea that some tests miss up to 30 percent of cases.

That's the wrong way to look at it, argues a new Perspective published Thursday [26 Nov 2020] in The New England Journal of Medicine. In a compelling essay, the authors state that we have to rethink testing entirely in order to get around these fears while not missing contagious cases. The insight: stop thinking of tests as one-offs, and stop performing tests as one-offs. Instead, testing regimens should be evaluated.

If a particular at-home test fails to detect an active case 20 percent of the time, then an alternative testing regime for that same product must be evaluated to see how often it would miss cases when, for example, 3 consecutive tests are performed (perhaps in a short window, or perhaps over several hours). In this example, if one in 5 tests were falsely negative (i.e., the person has COVID-19 but the test is negative) simply due to chance -- owing, say, to inexpensively engineered disposable home test kits -- the odds of 3 negative tests in a row in a person who is actually infected would be under one percent. Suddenly an inexpensive test that might have been criticized for being too inaccurate ("missing 20 percent of infections") might instead be celebrated. Therefore, such tests should be vetted not based on their one-time performance but instead as a well-defined regimen.

None of this should be that foreign a concept. A similar approach is already used by physicians, researchers, and scientists in other areas of public health and medicine, argue the authors. We do not judge an antibiotic by how well it works after one dose. We evaluate the therapy based on multiple doses, regimens which were developed with this exact framework in mind.

To achieve this vision, the idea of one-and-done testing must be discarded. Instead, we need massive investments in technologies that will allow us to implement testing regimens at home and in medical settings. The beauty of this approach is that different tests can be used in different situations, once the performance accuracy of various regimens have been determined. For example, many people test positive for SARS-CoV-2 after they have already passed their contagious period (perhaps half of all infections, it has been suggested). For these people, a 10-14 day isolation period would be excessive, if it could be confidently shown that they are outside the contagious period. Conversely, testing too early misses cases that are on the verge of becoming contagious.

A validated test regimen that addresses this (using a regimen of inexpensive, repeated home testing, for example) could save many lives. The problem is that individual tests have been approved by regulatory agencies, not testing regimes. As we have learned, individual tests that are inadequately sensitive (or used at the wrong time) can be very dangerous. In contrast, a multi-step well-defined testing regimen using some of the same tests already on the market could both detect the early contagious window in some infected individuals and reassure those well beyond that phase.

[The ongoing pandemic has brought to light many gaps in health systems and emergency preparedness capacity globally. Availability of diagnostic capacities in conventional laboratories as well as in the field and point-of-care options are key areas that require ongoing investment at present to rapidly detect new cases, and also when disease activity goes down, to ensure ongoing surveillance. There are quite a few test kits available on the market and more on the way; the way forward is to have a stepwise approach for testing and identifying infectious individuals and ruling out those that are past the contagious phase. Quarantine and isolation protocols can be reduced further based on this approach. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 28 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov28_1606644724.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 54.2% of daily case numbers and 42.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 25.9 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, Peru and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Honduras, El Salvador, Paraguay, and Dominican Republic.

- The European region reported 31.5% of daily case numbers and 44.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 18.2 million. Countries not reporting cases today (28 Nov 2020) include Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Poland, Germany, UK, and Ukraine. There are 23 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.0% of daily case numbers and 5.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.01 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Djibouti, Sudan,Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.48 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ethiopia, Botswana, Uganda, Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, and Mali.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.91% of daily case numbers and 0.35% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.86 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, French Polynesia, Guam, Mongolia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 7.1% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Malaysia has overtaken Japan as the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy maintains dominance in the European region, although France has the highest cumulative case count. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (156 103), Brazil (51 922), and India (39 567) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9161 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (27-28 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Turkey (30 103), Russia (27 100), Italy (26 315), Ukraine (16 294), UK (15 871), Poland (15 177), Germany (14 645), Iran (13 402), France (12 580), and Mexico (10 008). A total of 59 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 59 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 5.09%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with almost 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.UBA]
