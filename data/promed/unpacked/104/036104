The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [9 Mar 2013] investigating a fatal case of confirmed infection due to _Streptococcus suis_ (a kind of bacteria isolated from pigs).

The patient is an 85 year old man with an underlying medical condition. He developed fever and vomiting on 2 Mar 2013 and was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital on 3 Mar 2013. He was diagnosed to have septicaemia. His condition deteriorated on 4 Mar 2013. He was transferred to an intensive care unit on the same day and passed away a few hours later. His blood culture grew _S. suis_.

A CHP spokesman said the patient had no recent travel history. His home contact did not have any symptoms. This is the 1st case of _S. suis_ infection reported this year [2013].

The spokesman said _S. suis_ infection may present as meningitis (inflammation of the membrane enclosing the brain), septicaemia (bloodstream infection), and, less commonly, endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers), arthritis, and bronchopneumonia (a kind of lung infection involving the bronchioles). _S. suis_ infection can be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

To prevent the disease, members of the public are advised to always practice personal and environmental hygiene. They should avoid contact with pigs that are sick or dead from diseases and their excreta or body fluids. If contact with pigs or raw pork is necessary, one should: Use protective gloves; Wash hands after handling pigs or raw pork; and Clean and cover all wounds properly.

Members of the public with suspected symptoms should consult their doctors as soon as possible and report their relevant exposure histories.

[The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post "Streptococcus suis - Viet Nam: (QM, QG) human 20130123.1510728:"

_Streptococcus suis_ is sub-divided into at least 34 serotypes that vary in pathogenicity. Serotype 2 is the most frequently isolated serotype from diseased animals. _S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis).

_S. suis_ can cause potentially fatal zoonotic infection in humans, namely meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97186/). Toxic shock may also occur if the strain produces the appropriate toxins.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

The viral infection porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
