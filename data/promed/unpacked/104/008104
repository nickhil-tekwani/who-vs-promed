All cattle on properties infected with the _Mycoplasma bovis_ disease will be culled, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has confirmed. "The de-population of entire herds on all 28 Infected Properties (IPs) in New Zealand is a critical measure to control the spread of the disease and we will be working closely with those farmers to plan how this will happen," said MPI's response director Geoff Gwyn.

"This will be a big job and won't happen overnight, but we'll be meeting with the affected farmers in the coming days to discuss the operation, develop the plans and talk through compensation."

Farmers would be compensated for their verifiable losses "as quickly as possible", MPI said.

After the cull, and once farms were cleaned, these farmers could then start re-building a disease-free herd from scratch.

Today's decision follows estimates that_ Mycoplasma bovis_ could cost the country $400 million [USD 307 million] in economic impact over the next decade.

MPI has confirmed "losses to individual farmers would be a big part of that".

The figures were included in documents released to NZME [New Zealand Media and Entertainment] under the Official Information Act.

New Zealand was one of the last nations in the world without the highly contagious cattle disease until the Ministry for Primary Industries was notified about infected cattle in South Canterbury in July last year [2017].

The latest update from MPI stated there were 28 properties in New Zealand where cattle have tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_.

Signs of _Mycoplasma bovis_ included mastitis, polyarthritis (infection of several joints), pneumonia, abortions and meningitis and the disease primarily spread by close contact between animals. However, there were no known food safety risks for humans consuming food from infected animals.

One of the documents released under the OIA, dated 30 Oct 2017, stated: "Initial assessments put the economic impacts of _Mycoplasma bovis_ in the range of $60 million [USD 45 million] to $400 million [USD 307 million] over the next 10 years, due to uncertainty about how international markets would respond to New Zealand confirming it has the disease,".

When asked whether economic impacts meant losses or gains, an MPI spokeswoman said in a statement: "Losses to individual farmers would be a big part of that - but economic impacts go much broader. For example the flow-on effects to affected communities, the impact of changing farm practices to reduce disease risk, effects on wider industry (meat and dairy companies), and even potential impacts (if any) to the wider economy."

When asked whether the impact estimates had changed since October, MPI response director Geoff Gwyn said: "We continue to work on assessing the economic impact of _Mycoplasma bovis_. The extent of the spread of the disease is critical to understanding potential economic impacts and ascertaining the spread is our key focus right now."

Funding of $85 million [USD 65 million] for operational and compensation costs for the outbreak response was approved by Cabinet this month [March 2018].

The funds would be used until a decision was made on whether or not to attempt eradicating the disease.

On 17 July 2017, MPI was informed a herd on a farm owned by the Van Leeuwen Group had severe health problems.

Samples taken from the herd were confirmed positive for _Mycoplasma bovis on 21 Jul 2017.

MPI immediately initiated a biosecurity response to contain the disease.

On 12 Oct 2017, MPI decided to cull 4700 animals on 7 infected properties.

Since then, MPI has deferred a decision on further culling "until a more thorough picture of the disease's distribution in New Zealand is built".

MPI response director Geoff Gwyn said the decision to cull further animals on affected properties would be made between now and early April [2018].

The documents released under the OIA show "a full eradication would include 14 of the 16 Van Leeuwen Dairy Group farms and could involve up to 18 000 animals".

This month [March 2018], Minister of Agriculture and Biosecurity Damien O'Connor said a significant piece of work was underway "to look at the technical feasibility of eradication and cost-benefit or eradication versus long-term management".

All but one of the infected properties so far were in the South Island so officials were considering focusing on making the North Island _Mycoplasma bovis_ free.

Last week [week of Sun 18 Mar 2018], O'Connor announced an intensive programme to track cattle movements across Cook Strait.

"Operation Cook Strait will be based where trucks stop in the upper South Island and will be run by the Ministry for Primary Industries. It will check that farmers moving cattle from the South to the North Island comply with their legal obligations under the NAIT Act.

"Non-compliance will result in fines. It begins today and is likely to be extended to other parts of the country."

O'Connor said he remained hopeful _Mycoplasma bovis_ could be eradicated from New Zealand.

"Eradication is what everybody would like but it has to be technically possible, practically achievable and affordable for all. If we can't improve NAIT [National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme] compliance, we cannot get past go."

Gwyn said a small number of beef units were affected but so far "the majority of the infected properties are dairy farms or dairy calf raising businesses".

The dairy industry was New Zealand's largest export earner.

It generated $14.6 billion [USD 11.2 billion] in export revenue for the year ended June 2017.

Properties infected with Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand so far:
Canterbury - 2 (1 active)
Hawkes' Bay (near Hastings) - 1
Mid-Canterbury (Ashburton) - 4
South Canterbury/North Otago - 11 (10 active)
Otago (Middlemarch) - 2
Southland (Winton, Lumsden, Invercargill, Gore) - 10

More than 22 000 cattle will be slaughtered at all properties infected by _Mycoplasma bovis_ in a dramatic effort underway to stop the spread of the devastating cow disease.

It's the biggest cull of its type in New Zealand's history and officials say it's the only way to fully eradicate the disease from the 28 properties.

The decision to slaughter over 22 000 cows hasn't been an easy one.

"This is a very significant cull. It's the 1st time it's happened in New Zealand agriculture. We hope we don't have to do this again," said Damien O'Connor, Agriculture and Biosecurity Minister.

It's hoped the cull will completely eradicate _Mycoplasma bovis_.

The Ministry for Primary Industries says it has been left with little choice after 113 000 tests showed the disease wasn't widespread yet.

"It couldn't have happened any earlier as we needed to understand how widespread the disease was. If it was endemic in New Zealand we'd be looking at other options," said Geoff Gwynn of MPI.

Up to 6 infected properties have already been cleared of nearly 5000 stock after the disease was identified in July last year (2017).

And all farmers on the 22 remaining properties, mainly in the South Island, will be compensated.

"They are compensated for any verifiable loss as a result of MPI exercising powers. And clearly we're using Biosecurity Act powers to order the cull of the animals," Mr Gwynn said.

Dairy New Zealand was quick to voice its support for the decision to cull, saying it gives certainty for dairy farmers and it's extremely positive the disease isn't widespread.

But Mr O'Connor says the financial damage has already been done.

"The potential cost to the industry either way - is in controlling this or eradicating or leaving it go - is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. What we've got to do is try and prevent this happening again and get onto it more quickly," he said.

Mr O'Connor says there needs to be a major shake-up when it comes to farm biosecurity, with farmers needing to keep better records when stock are moved.

"This will be a wakeup call for everyone at every level in the dairy and livestock industry."

Nobody wants to see a cull of this scale happen again.

[This is heartbreaking news for the dairy industry of New Zealand, and even more so for the affected producers. As I read these news stories I was reminded of how I felt for each producer in the UK who lost animals to a strain of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. While the PMI seems to have done due diligence, it is certainly hoped this will eradicate this disease. The cost to the people of NZ will be expensive and hopefully will not involve any others.

Keeping the North Island free seems important. Certainly we hope the plan works.

While not to be negative, one wonders what the MPI intends to do if it became obvious this cull has not worked? We would appreciate hearing from someone in the NZ MPI regarding future plans.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), arthritis, mastitis (infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue), and a variety of other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments. Also it sometimes works in conjunction with other pathogenic organisms. - Mod.TG
