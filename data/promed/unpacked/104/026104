In this 24-hour period Belgium has reported its 1st confirmed case in a repatriated Belgian citizen who was evacuated from Wuhan (see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-belgium/repatriated-belgian-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN1ZY0OK for details).

[3] China, fatalities, research agenda - National Health Services press conference 4 Feb 2020
Date: 4 Feb 2020
Source: China National Health Commission press conference, 4 Feb 2020 [in Chinese, mach. trans. edited/excerpted]
http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202002/35990d56cfcb43f4a70d7f9703b113c0.shtml


Key points:
As of 24:00 3 Feb 2020, the cumulative number of cases nationwide was 20 438, with cumulative deaths at 425. National mortality rate calculated at 2.1%.

In Hubei, there were 414 reported deaths, representing 97% of the country's fatalities. Calculated mortality rate in Hubei Province is 3.1%.

In Wuhan, there were 313 reported deaths, representing 74% of the country's fatalities. Calculated mortality rate in Wuhan is 4.9%.

The calculated fatality rate in other provinces is 0.16%. While the number of cases is not small in other provinces, the case fatality rate is quite low. This may reflect that most cases have mild presentations.

Most fatal cases are male (2/3), with females representing 1/3. Most cases are elderly with more than 80% over 60 years old. More than 75% have one or more pre-existing co-morbidities including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and malignancies in some of the patients. [It was emphasized that elderly individuals [defined as 60 years of age or older] with pre-existing disease are at high risk from any type of pneumonia, not just the 2019-nCoV pneumonia.]

In explaining why there was a higher fatality rate in Wuhan, it was mentioned that, early on, there were insufficient critical care beds to cover the more serious presentations, and patients were admitted to 3 designated hospitals with a total of 110 critical care beds. Other critical cases were admitted to 20 other medical institutions, not all with tertiary level care. Now, independent hospitals with tertiary level care are part of the network presently used. A shortage of well-trained critical care physicians and management was also mentioned. This is currently being addressed locally as well as nationally.

In response to query on ongoing research: A research team with 12 departments has been established along with a team of 14 academicians and experts with academician Zhong Nanshan as team leader. 16 research projects have been identified with a focus on virus traceability, drug research and development, vaccine development, and testing. Reagents and experimental animal models have been deployed. Aiming at scientific and technological innovations, 2 major projects include testing new drugs and the prevention and treatment of major infectious diseases.

There's an integration of scientific research with clinical needs and prevention and control practices. There was the rapid isolation and identification of the novel coronavirus, with whole genome sequencing and rapid sharing with the international community. They have developed nucleic acid diagnostic reagents and are actively engaged in the development of serologic testing. With respect to drug research, selection of drugs with potential anti-nCoV effects are under study along with curative effect of these drugs. They are also working on vaccine development against the nCoV.

There was a discussion on the cited "cure" [surely this should be "recovery". - Mod.SH] rate. At present, there isn't a clear formula for calculating the cure rate. The average time for hospitalization to discharge nationwide is a little more than 9 days. The range is 5 days (Hainan province) to 12.75 days (Guangdong province). An outlier is Hubei where the average time to discharge is 20 days. Explanation for outlying Hubei: 1st, more severe patients; 2nd, more stringent discharge criteria set by Wuhan City; a patient must have 2 negative nucleic acid tests with an interval of 24 hours after clinical symptoms disappear.

[4] Selected media reports of transmission outside of China:
A: Malaysia ex Singapore
Date: 4 Feb 2020
Source: Malay Mail [edited]
https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/02/04/selangor-man-is-first-malaysian-to-test-positive-for-wuhan-virus/1834350


A Malaysian man has tested positive for the Wuhan virus, the 1st local to date, said health minister Datuk Seri Dzulkefly Ahmad at a press conference today [4 Feb 2020].

Dzulkefly said the man traveled to Singapore from [16 to 23 Jan 2020] to attend a meeting which had several foreign delegates, including from China. "He returned to Malaysia on [23 Jan 2020], and on [29 Jan 2020], he received treatment at a private hospital because of fever and cough. "Then, he was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on [2 Feb 2020], and was admitted to the isolation ward. He was confirmed for the 2019-nCoV yesterday [3 Feb 2020]," Dzulkefly said. He said the 41 year old patient was stable, and the Health Ministry has contacted its Singaporean counterpart, which confirmed that it has begun tracing those who had been in contact with him.

The minister also disclosed another confirmed infection, a 63 year old Chinese national from Wuhan who landed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on [18 Jan 2020]. Dzulkefly said he initially had light fever and received outpatient treatment at a private hospital in Kuala Lumpur. His case was flagged to the ministry, which then sequestered him at his home for a 2-week observation period. "On [2 Feb 2020], his fever continued, and he was then admitted to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) for further treatment. The lab test result showed him to be positive for 2019-nCov on [3 Feb 2020]. "The patient is currently in the isolation ward and is in stable condition," Dzulkefly added.

The 2 newest cases bring Malaysia's total 2019-nCoV infections to 10, 5 of whom had been patients-under-investigation, and the rest were those who had been in close contact. Of the latter 5, 4 are in Hospital Sungai Buloh and one is in Johor's Hospital Permai. Aside from the Malaysian, all the confirmed cases involve Chinese nationals.

The minister said 213 PUIs [persons under investigation?] were screened between [10 Jan 2020] and the evening of [3 Feb 2020], involving 122 Malaysians, 8 Chinese nationals, and one each from Australia, South Korea, Jordan, Brazil and Thailand. Health authorities have cleared 188, while 20 PUIs are awaiting results of their laboratory tests. Of the 36 individuals located through contact tracing, 27 were negative, and 4 are pending test results.

C. Cruise ship off coast of Japan

Source: CNBC [edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/princess-cruises-quarantines-3700-after-10-passengers-test-positive-for-virus.html


Princess Cruises said it has placed 3700 passengers and crew under mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks after 10 passengers aboard a cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan tested positive for the new coronavirus. The company said Monday [3 Feb 2020] that a previous guest, who didn't have any symptoms while aboard the ship, tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday [1 Feb 2020], 6 days after leaving the ship. The ship was being held in Japan for 24 hours while Japanese health authorities assessed the 3700 passengers and crew on board.

"These 10 persons, who have been notified, will be taken ashore by Japanese Coast Guard watercraft and transported to local hospitals for care by shoreside Japanese medical professionals," the company said. The ship will be quarantined for at least 14 days, the company said, as is required by the Japanese Ministry of Health.

The 1st phase of health screening of all guests and crew onboard Diamond Princess, by the Japanese Ministry of Health, has been completed," the company said in a statement. "We were notified that amongst the samples that have completed testing,10 people have tested positive for coronavirus."

The company said it will continue to provide guests with complimentary internet and phone service. The ship will go out to sea to "perform normal marine operations," the company said, such as "the production of fresh water and ballast operations before proceeding alongside in Yokohama where food, provisions, and other supplies will be brought onboard."

Princess Cruises said it will cancel its next 2 cruises leaving from Yokohama, which were scheduled to depart on [4 Feb 2020] and [12 Feb 2020].

The new coronavirus has now infected more than 24 300 people in more than 2 dozen countries, killing 490 people in China as well as one person in the Philippines and one person in Hong Kong.

[Information on the nationalities and travel histories of these 10 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection was not available at the time of preparation of this post (none of the more than 10 media reports available at the time had this information). One suspects that the only exposure may well have been presence on the boat where someone on a previous cruise on this same boat tested positive upon return to Hong Kong (gotten from a media report). According to the information, this individual was stated to have been asymptomatic until after the cruise. What is not clear is the actual definition of asymptomatic for this individual. In yesterday's [3 Feb 2020] update, we reported on another cruise ship with 3 2019-nCoV positive individuals (see Novel coronavirus (32): China, global, management, research 20200204.6950903, section [3]).

If no other high-risk exposure is identified, then it is likely there may have been transmission through fomites contaminating parts of the ship. We await further details surrounding this event. - Mod.MPP]

[5] WHO interview re: status of outbreak
Date: 4 Feb 2020
Source: CNN [edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/04/health/who-coronavirus-not-pandemic/index.html


The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is not a pandemic, World Health Organization officials said on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020], adding that they're hopeful that transmission of the virus can be contained. The agency acknowledges that it is challenging to contain the virus because of global mass movement.

"We are not in a pandemic," Dr Sylvie Briand, director of WHO's Infectious Hazards Management Department said in a press conference on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020], explaining that the virus is currently considered to be an epidemic with multiple locations. "We will try to extinguish the transmission in each of these," she said, adding that the agency believes this "can be done with containment measures currently in place."

Current control measures in place include early case detection, early isolation and treatment of cases, contact tracing and social detention measures in places where there is risk of transmission, Briand said. These are the core elements of any outbreak response and might be enough to stop an infection from spreading.

A pandemic is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease, but it's not quite as simple as that. The finer details are debated, as many factors -- including population immunity and disease severity -- need to be taken into account. An epidemic is more than a normal number cases of an illness, specific health-related behavior, or other health-related events in a community or region. A disease outbreak is the occurrence of disease cases in excess of what's normally expected, according to WHO.

The last pandemic reported was the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, which killed hundreds of thousand worldwide. WHO last week declared the novel coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, which it calls "an extraordinary event" that constitutes a "public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease" and "to potentially require a coordinated international response." Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1 [and polio].

The new virus has infected more than 20 000 people across 26 countries and territories and killed more than 420, but the majority of cases -- currently an estimated 78% -- are coming from Hubei province in China, Briand explained. "This is the epicentre of the outbreak," she said during Tuesday's [4 Feb 2020] press conference.

Briand described cases outside of Hubei as "spillover cases," people who were mostly infected in Hubei before there was a lockdown there and moved to other places with the disease, causing clusters of cases in other regions. The same can be said of the cases reported in other countries. Briand believes that in Hubei and places that have spillover, "we can stop transmission," which will prevent the situation from becoming a pandemic.

Many experts believe we've not yet reached pandemic levels, due to the current spread of the outbreak but also because we don't yet know enough about the coronavirus. "The virus has traveled across multiple continents, but these instances of long-range travel seem to have only resulted in very local outbreaks," Paul Digard, chair of virology of The Roslin Institute at University of Edinburgh, said in an email. "Unless/until it has been shown to have set up widespread onward transmission chains in other countries, I think it's reasonable to remain calling it an outbreak."

A pandemic "typically refers to sustained transmission of a new infectious disease across numerous countries," added Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at University of Southampton. "Here, we have the coronavirus that has been imported into numerous countries, and we have seen some very limited amount of human transmission outside of China, but not really enough yet for WHO to declare a pandemic."

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the United States, believes we could be heading toward a pandemic. "My bottom line is the way this is continuing to evolve every day; it looks like it's heading towards what we would call a pandemic," Fauci said. But Fauci also said the term itself comes down to semantics; it "means different things to different people," and that we're in a "gray zone".

[According to the information in Table 2, there are now 10 countries that have reported confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV with transmission occurring outside China (Japan, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain and the UK). Section [3] above, provides information on additional newly confirmed cases in Singapore and Malaysia that involved transmission outside China as well, and possibly 10 individuals who were exposed on a cruise ship off the coast of Japan. All of this is adding to the challenges of interrupting transmission of a virus with person-to-person transmission capabilities and possibly transmitted by fomites as well. - Mod.MPP
