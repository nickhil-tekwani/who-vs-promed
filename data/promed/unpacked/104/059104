Several cases of chikungunya [virus infection] were detected in the
Seychelles and in Madagascar. In Grand Isle, tests have confirmed the
presence of the virus among 4 people, and 102 cases are believed to be
suspicious. The risks that chikungunya [virus] transmitted by the
mosquito _Adedes abopictus_ will come back are real, particularly
during this season, which is favorable to tropical diseases. The
growing number of people who have been bitten and have contracted the
disease in Seychelles the past few weeks have put the population and
the people in charge of public health on high alert.

Vigilance is in order. Since the virus came back, the inter-regional
cell of the epidemiology of the Indian Ocean (CIRE) considers that the
return of chikungunya [virus] in the department is possible. The
climatic conditions of the past weeks have promoted multiplication of
the mosquitoes.

Travelers going to the islands in the Indian Ocean are warned and
should take precautions. Local populations are advised to get rid of
stagnant water around the house after downpours at least once a week.
In case of signs or symptoms such as headaches, muscular pains, nausea
and rash, people are strongly advised to go and see their doctor.

[Madagascar has had periodic cases of chikungunya virus infection for
several years (see archives below), so it is not surprising that cases
are occurring again in 2011. The Seychelles, however, have not
reported a major chikungunya outbreak since 2006, when nearly 2000
cases occurred.
