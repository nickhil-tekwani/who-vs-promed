38 people die from bootlegged vodka poisoning in Belgorod region
BELGOROD, - One more resident of Russia's Belgorod region died on Monday
from bootlegged vodka poisoning, bringing the total number of victims to
38, sources from the regional department of the Russian Ministry for
Emergency Situations told Tass on Monday.
All in all, 855 people have been poisoned since the start of "an alcohol
epidemic," including 779 people in the city of Stary Oskol. However, the
number of patients hospitalized with alcohol poisoning has declined over
the past few days. Only 2 patients diagnosed with "toxic hepatitis" have
been hospitalized over the past 24 hours. The number of patients has
increased by 6 people in the city of Gubkin, where 76 people have been
hospitalized, and 2 of them died.
Sergei Savotin, a top official from the local security council believes a
positive tendency is obvious, as several days ago hospitals received at
least 15 patients daily. Medics are of the same opinion.
