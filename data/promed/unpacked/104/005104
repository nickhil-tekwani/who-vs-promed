There is potential for outbreaks of measles in Qatar given the large
number of unvaccinated children, especially expatriates, in the 1-14
years age group, a study has revealed.

As many as 82.9 percent of measles cases reported in 2007 to the
National Health Authority's Department of Public Health had either
not received the vaccine or did not know their vaccination status.
The study conducted by Dr Mohamed Ghaith al-Kuwari, Dr Zaher Nazzal,
and Dr Abdulhameed al-Khenji from the Primary Health Care Department
recommended that measles control and vaccination awareness should be
continued and improved at all levels. "Maintaining a high coverage of
MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine 2nd dose among the 1-14
years age group is critical to [the] control of measles in Qatar," it
was suggested.

Qatar has committed to the WHO-Eastern Mediterranean Region
initiative to eliminate measles virus transmission by 2010 through
strengthening routine infant immunisation and surveillance and giving
2nd opportunity for measles immunisation. "Qatar has achieved a
significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of measles since
adopting the measles elimination programme in 1997 but has
experienced recurrent, small scale outbreaks in 2007, driving the
incidence significantly above the 100 cases per million," the study
has pointed out.

The study was based on a retrospective review for all 362 measles
cases reported in Qatar in 2007 and laboratory confirmed (114 or 34.3
percent), epidemiologically linked (13 or 3.6 percent) or clinically
diagnosed (224 or 61.9 percent). As many as 192 (53 percent) of the
patients were males, and 72.4 percent of the total cases were
expatriates, with Pakistanis accounting for 143 cases (39.5 percent),
Qataris for 100 cases (26.7 percent), Indians for 30 cases (8.3
percent) and others for 68 cases (18.8 percent).

The largest proportion, 34.3 percent, of measles cases was in 5-14
years age group, followed by the 1-4 years age group (33.4 percent),
together accounting for 67.7 percent of the cases spread over the
1-14 years age group. The peak of the outbreaks happened during May
and June 2007, accounting for 207 cases (57.2 percent).

"The large proportion of unknown immunisation status among cases
points out the importance of improving the quality of vaccination
registry," the study stated.

[As of 2007, oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain
the highest per capita income in the world. Nonetheless, the large
number of non-resident workers in the population present the health
authorities with formidable problems in achieving immunisation
coverage sufficient to prevent measles virus transmission and to
achieve the World Health Organisation target of elimination of
indigenous measles by the year 2010.
