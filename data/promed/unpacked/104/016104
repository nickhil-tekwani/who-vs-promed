Hendra virus has killed a horse in northern NSW [New South Wales state], causing authorities to quarantine a property.

Hendra virus has killed a horse in northern NSW, causing authorities to quarantine a property as they run tests on its stablemates and the 5 people who handled the animal.

It's the 1st case of Hendra discovered in NSW this year [2014].

"The 31-year-old stockhorse gelding died overnight on Thursday [19 Jun 2014] after being found in a dam earlier that day and receiving treatment from a private veterinarian for very low body temperature," NSW deputy chief vet Therese Wright said in a statement.

"Three people who handled the horse plus the veterinarian and an assistant are being assessed and monitored by NSW Health."

In recent weeks, no horses have moved off the property, west of Murwillumbah, and there are no dogs or cats about, Ms Wright added.

The paddock where the horse was kept "has regular flying fox activity," she said.

Horses are believed to contract the Hendra virus from feed contaminated by urine, saliva or birthing fluids from flying foxes.

"Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above," Ms Wright said.

Hendra virus was found in 4 horses and a dog across 4 separate mid-north coast properties last year [2013].

"Winter is the season when horses have been infected with Hendra in NSW in the past, so now is the time to get a vaccine booster for your horse," Ms Wright said.

In Queensland, 4 people have been killed by Hendra virus since 1994.

And in December, councils across the state were given permission to trim trees and use smoke, lights and loud noises to drive flying fox colonies away from urban areas without needing a permit.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately," Ms Wright warned.

[Perhaps the word of the day for any equine owner in Australia is vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. It is one of the best ways to protect your equine friends and your equine investment.

The deputy chief vet has provided sound advice about building a shed or lean-to to protect the feed and water stations from flying foxes (a type of bat). While trees are very nice and desirable, fruit trees and fruit from the trees should not be near horses or their paddocks.

Flying foxes are very messy fruit eaters and salivate profusely when eating. Furthermore, the virus may be in saliva, feces or urine from these animals.

So vaccinating your horse and providing your horse with a safe way to eat and drink as well as having shade not near a fruit tree is great advice.
