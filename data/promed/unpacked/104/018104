[As can be seen by the reports from the Saudi MOH, September 2019 has been a very slow month for reports of newly confirmed cases, with only one case reported since the 1st of this month [September 2019]. August 2019 was also fairly slow with only 6 cases reported during the entire month, including 2 fatalities. Since the beginning of 2019 (1 Jan 2019), there have been a total of 173 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, including 45 deaths, bringing the case fatality ratio to 26.0 percent.

Regions reporting cases during August 2019 through today (22 Sep 2019) include: Al Qasim (2 cases), Riyadh (2 cases) and 1 case each from Makkah, Al Jawf, and Najran.

Highlights:
- At the end of August 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 850 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (2073 cases, including 772 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 37.2%).

- During the month of August [2019], a total of 6 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally. All the 6 cases were reported from Saudi Arabia with 1 associated death. Two of the cases reported had their symptom onset in the previous month of July 2019, and one of the reported cases in July [2019] died. One household cluster of 2 cases was reported this month [September 2019]. All the reported cases were between 49 and 71 years of age, and 4 them were male. No healthcare workers were affected this month.

- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2014 to 2019, do not show any significant difference or change. The number of cases reported in this period was similar to 2018, but significantly less than the 2014-2017 corresponding period. The age group 50-59 years continues to be at the highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[It's noteworthy to highlight that while the global reported case fatality rate is 37.2 percent, Since 1 Jan 2019 to the present, the reported case fatality rate has dropped to 26.0 percent, possibly reflecting confirmation of milder infections in individuals and asymptomatic infections in known contacts of clinically ill cases, whereas in earlier years of experience with this virus, milder and asymptomatic infections were not, as a rule, tested for the MERS-CoV (and thereby confirmed), as the case definition and indications for testing precluded milder illnesses. - Mod.MPP]
