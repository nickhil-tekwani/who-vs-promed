HANTAVIRUSES, MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS: RELEVANT?
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: 30 September 1997
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>
C. McCown (Editor, ESP Tech Writers <cmccown@maxinet.com>) has written an
amusing and informative anecdote regarding the long-distance movement of
mice and other rodents. That message stimulated this one.
When I said, tongue-in-cheek, that it wasn't likely mice would be invading
Ecuador from Chile, I meant that they would have to cross Peru, which is
not something mice do on a regular basis. I did not mean that it was
impossible for mice to travel long distances. Indeed, it likely was the
movement of infected rats that carried plague from its origins to the New
World and elsewhere. All one need do is go to the docks of a salt water
port city and hang out after dark. If you do not get arrested, you might
be enlightened to see the number (and sizes) of rats. It is not at all
strange that the great Swedish taxonomist, Linnaeus, called the brown rat
_Rattus norvegicus_, the Norway rat. As rodent movement pertains to
hantaviruses -- _Rattus_ sp. are the vertebrate host of Seoul virus, first
isolated in Korea and now known to occur in various seaports around the
world, wherever there are rats of the genus _Rattus_.
Complete cross-susceptibility studies have not been done but the molecular
data being accrued by Brian Hjelle, Stu Nichol and many others indicate
that hantaviruses are associated with a single (or, perhaps 2-3 closed
related) rodent species.
Seems to me the problem may be one of taxonomy, of the viruses. Whenever
you hear someone say "the" hantavirus, rather than "a" hantavirus, you may
be sure they haven't a clue what they are talking about or that they are
very careless. One more time: Family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Hantavirus_.
The generic term for any virus in the genus is "a hantavirus". That is,
Hantaan virus is a hantavirus, Sin Nombre virus is a hantavirus, etc.
There is no such thing as "the hantavirus".
It is quite common for the unknowing to wonder why one cannot simply wipe
out "mosquitoes" to eliminate the problems caused by arboviruses. Which
mosquitoes? Not all species share the same ecosystems. Spraying nonvector
species with insecticide will not kill vector species. Likewise, it
becomes illogical to think that excluding rats (wharf rats, brown rats,
black rats, a
member of any _Rattus_ sp.) from of a country will prevent the transmission
of a hantavirus that is not transmitted by a member of the genus _Rattus_.
As reagents for antibody testing become more available and education about
hantaviruses becomes more widespread, infections with hantaviruses will
become more widely recognized. That's the easy part. The next step is
detection and characterization of the particular hantavirus, elucidating
its natural cycle (determination of the rodent host), and reduction of
human contact with excreta from that host.
Rodents live in fairly well-defined econiches, even if those econiches are
expansive. For example, the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) is
probably the most common mammal in North America. However, it does not
naturally occur in Europe, Africa, Australia, or Asia, although one or two
might get to those places in the backpacks of tourists or in with cargo
shipped from a place where they do occur. If one could exclude deer mice
from a Latin American country, one could then be reasonably assured that
Sin Nombre virus would likewise
be excluded. Alternatively, if one could exclude Sin Nombre virus from
that country, one could reasonably be assured that rodents in that country
would not become infected with that particular hantavirus.
If, per the current Chilean experience and the responses to it, Ecuador
makes a concerted effort to exclude Argentinean and Chilean rats from
Ecuador by inspecting, and certifying as inspected, ships from Argentina
and Chile, there is no reason to believe that Ecuador will then be free
from hantaviruses that arrive Fourth Class. Besides, a certificate of
"rat-free" means about as much to me as a certificate of vaccination means
the vaccinee is immune and safe.
Rodents may very well be transported over great distances in backpacks,
planes, trains, and automobiles. However, in addition to impracticality,
exclusion of "foreign" rodents from one's country may make good politics
but not likely good epidemiology. As Henry Adams said, "Practical politics
consists of ignoring the facts."
