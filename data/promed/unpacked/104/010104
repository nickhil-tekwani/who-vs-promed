[The initial laboratory diagnosis of the FMD epizootic in Tunisia was carried out on 26 Apr 2014 by Tunisia's Veterinary Research Institute (IRVT) (National laboratory), applying reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the cattle-derived sample. This test was repeated in the same laboratory on 29 Apr 2014, similarly applying RT-PCR. On 28 May 2014, the OIE reference laboratory in Brescia (IZSLER) confirmed Tunisia's diagnosis and serotyped the cattle-derived isolate, as reported in follow-up report No. 6, submitted on 1 Jul 2014. In all subsequent follow-up reports (Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10 and the current No. 11), the same diagnostic details (and date) are repeated. Does this mean that all outbreaks reported from Tunisia are diagnosed clinically without laboratory confirmations? - Mod.AS]

[2] Algeria: Polemic, further spread

While Eid al-Adha [Muslim Festival of Sacrifice] is approaching in a context marked by a continuous spread of the FMD [foot and mouth disease] epizootic, many Algerians are wondering whether they are going to buy a healthy sheep to sacrifice.

A 53-year-old at the cattle market of Oran says: "I'm here to find out if I will be able to purchase a healthy sheep. I'm afraid of this disease, as so much has been said about it."

This market has reopened upon the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture, despite the spread of FMD in the west of the country: Oran, Relizane, Tiaret, and Chlef. Two new foci have been recently [date not mentioned - Mod.AB] confirmed in 2 cattle farms in Mers El Kebir and Misserghin.

"The decision to reopen livestock markets for sheep is contrary to all sanitary logic. It is a decision based more on political and religious considerations," said a veterinarian practicing in Oran, under the condition of anonymity. He added: "The livestock markets should definitely be closed. This is one of the key preventive measures that should be strictly enforced to limit the spread of the disease. Cattle and sheep release into the air up to a million viruses every 48 hours. In addition, the FMD virus is present in all secretions and excretions of infected animals. In livestock markets, it can be easily and quickly spread, thanks to the close contact among animals. Furthermore, since the disease may go unnoticed in sheep, you might buy an infected sheep without knowing it."

Another veterinarian pointed out the sloppiness surrounding animal movements: "Livestock movements must be strictly prohibited to avoid contamination. But it is dismaying to note that this is far from being respected," he laments. Another weak point identified by him concerns disinfection: "We do not have the capacity to achieve standards for a careful disinfection of infected livestock buildings and other contaminated materials (equipment, vehicles, clothing, etc.)," he said, adding that "fortunately, not only is human contamination rare, but FMD virus is not dangerous to humans."

[Although FMD is medically benign and very rarely transmissible to humans, it is a very serious economic scourge because of the extraordinary infectiousness of FMDV.

The decision to reopen livestock markets does not seem to meet with the agreement of some veterinarians, especially those working in areas that are still experiencing new FMD outbreaks. According to this source, western Algeria is among the latter, and this should induce Moroccan veterinary authorities to increase their vigilance and enhance the activation of the contingency plan (see ProMED-MENA 20140815.2692614). This should be done both along the border with Algeria and beyond it, as trucks transporting possibly infected livestock, if not readily stopped, may rapidly bring their loading to livestock markets and farms located hundreds of kilometers away from the Algerian border.
