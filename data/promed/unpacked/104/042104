---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kidney involvement is common in patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and subclinical inflammation and injury may persist for many months, resulting in a progressive decline in kidney function that leads to chronic kidney disease. Continued research is imperative to understand these long-term sequelae and identify interventions to mitigate them.

More than 180 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and approximately 4 million have died worldwide. The short-term survival of these patients will improve as evidence-based therapies continue to be adopted and new treatments become available. Thus, the number of individuals who are at risk of poor long-term outcomes, known as long COVID, will continue to increase.

Approximately 28% of patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and 9% receive kidney replacement therapy (1). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has both direct and indirect effects that can lead to AKI (2). Potential direct effects on the kidney include endothelial damage from viral entry, complement activation, local inflammation and collapsing glomerulopathy. However, indirect mechanisms that injure the kidney, such as sepsis, use of nephrotoxic medications, systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability and thromboembolic disease, might be more common than these direct effects. Although it is well known that AKI can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), little is known about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the kidney.

Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a long-term impact even on patients who have not been infected by the virus, owing to delays in care for chronic diseases, such as CKD, diabetes and hypertension (3). This area is understudied but might have the largest impact at the population level and disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals, particularly those with low socioeconomic status and poor access to health care. Studies are urgently needed to investigate this area and confirm the importance of measures to catch up on preventive care for at-risk individuals.

What are the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the kidney? Three issues warrant consideration before we examine the current evidence. First, COVID-19 might affect the kidney in multiple ways and the contribution of these factors might vary over time. Many of the direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus might persist during recovery after hospital discharge and could lead to repeat episodes of sepsis, recurrent AKI, and increased risk of CKD (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and worsening of cardiovascular disease due to COVID-19 might delay recovery of AKI. Second, the relationship between COVID-19 and CKD is likely to be bidirectional. Mild CKD might increase the risk of COVID-19 and associated AKI, whereas increased severity of AKI might be associated with persistent kidney dysfunction, delayed recovery, and/or need for long-term dialysis.

Thus, understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the kidney will require use of study designs that account for this complex relationship and access to datasets in which kidney function is well characterized before and after diagnosis of COVID-19. Finally, whether the effects of COVID-19 are unique or similar to those seen in patients with other infections and sepsis is unclear. Initial reports suggest that many sequelae of COVID-19 are similar to those reported in survivors of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Patients with a high burden of frailty, chronic diseases, disability and immunosenescence are at increased risk of kidney disease and progression to kidney failure, and infection with SARS-CoV-2 can further increase this risk. Kidney function declines gradually over time even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1), but patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 might experience a rapid loss of kidney function resulting in acute kidney injury during the acute phase of the disease (2). Post-infection kidney function trajectories can vary and might include complete recovery (3), as indicated by no change in trajectory compared with patients who are not infected, slow progressive decline owing to subclinical inflammation (4), relapsing or recurrent acute kidney injury and hospitalizations (5) or incomplete recovery and rapidly progressive kidney disease (6).

[2] Ventilation: virus spread
Date: Wed 8 Sep 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/08/covid-german-super-spreader-event-created-by-poor-ventilation-study-finds


Airborne viruses recycled through a low-grade ventilation system likely created Germany's 1st super-spreader event of the COVID-19 pandemic, a CSI-style analysis of a carnival celebration has found [see citation below].

The event at the town hall of Gangelt, a municipality on the border with the Netherlands, was labelled "Germany's Wuhan" after it was found to be the driver of a major outbreak in the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia last year [2020].

Of 411 partygoers who were later tested by the scientists, almost half were found to have been infected with the virus. A 47-year-old man who performed in the "male ballet" at the carnival was the 1st person in the country admitted to intensive care with the coronavirus infection.

After spending months analysing the location and movements at the carnival party, researchers from the University of Bonn now say the town hall's poor ventilation system, which brought only 25% of fresh air into the air flow, was a key factor in spreading the virus among the crowd.

Individuals sat close to the air outlets had the highest risk of infection, the researchers write in a pre-print of a scientific paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed [see comment].

"Once again everything points towards aerosols and ventilation playing a crucial role in deciding whether there will be an infection or not," said virologist Hendrik Streeck, one of the paper's authors.

Streeck and his co-authors were criticised last year [2020] for going public with some of their findings at an early stage of the investigation, drawing accusations that the project was designed to lend scientific support for politicians pushing for a lockdown exit.

The government of North Rhine-Westphalia financially supported the study with EUR 65 000 [USD 76 797].

The researchers said they could find no proof for the theories that partygoers sharing drinks or getting less socially inhibited when inebriated were leading drivers of super-spreader events.

"We determined the level of alcohol consumption as number of drinks (high-proof liquor or beer) and did not observe any influence for the amount of alcohol consumption on the risk of becoming infected," the paper said.

The amount of time guests spent inside the town hall proved a more significant indicator of whether they would catch the virus than whether they sat close to each other. "There was no evidence for increased risk of infection from greater proximity to other infected persons," the paper says.

Older people were more likely to have caught the virus at the carnival session than children, with the average infection risk increasing 28% for every 10 years of age difference.

The researchers found one unexpected common factor among those who left the event without an infection. Regular smokers at the carnival session had a reduced risk of catching COVID-19, even when accounting for the amount of time they had spent outside the hall on cigarette breaks.

The scientists point out that current or formers smokers are known to suffer disproportionately from severe COVID-19 symptoms and "strongly advise" against taking up smoking as a protective habit to prevent risk of infection.

Abstract
---------
"Added value of this study: Our report analyzes the 1st COVID-19 superspreading event in Germany in detail, which was not only a unique setting but also included children and adults in the same room. We demonstrate that nearly half of the participants were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the proximity of the seating to the ventilation system was an important risk factor for infection. The data showed that low physical distance including singing and duration of attendance at this event increased the risk of infection, while regular smoking and spending the break of the event outside lowered the risk of infection. This underlines the benefit of airing to lower the amount of both droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, we found lower infection in children than adults despite being in the same room suggesting differences in infectability in children. Indeed, we observed that an additional 10 years of age is on average associated with 28% increased risk of infection."

It also would be good to know how many vaccinated individuals became infected. - Mod.LK]

[3] USA (Florida): deaths
Date: Wed 8 Sep 2021

At least 13 employees of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools have died from complications of COVID-19 since 16 Aug [2021], according to district officials.

Those who died include teachers, school bus drivers, a security worker, and a cafeteria manager.

"It is a big number. It is a bruising statistic that we need to absolutely internalize," Miami-Dade school Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho told NPR's Here & Now.

According to the president of United Teachers of Dade, Karla Hernandez-Mats, all of those who died were African American and unvaccinated.

Carvalho said that while the district is blocked by law from requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or even asking whether they are vaccinated, he is urging people to get the shot.

"This sad statistic underscores the impact of misinformation and disinformation efforts through some vocal entities, who quite frankly profess anything but scientific reality," Carvalho said. "The outcome, the consequence, is the death of individuals, and that's just not acceptable."

The school system -- which is the 4th-largest district in the country -- will try to increase the vaccination rate among staffers by offering USD 275 to any employee who shows proof of vaccination.

Carvalho said that among the 13 deaths, the majority of people contracted COVID-19 and died before the beginning of the school year. One person had direct contact with students, he said.

Miami-Dade students returned to the classroom on 23 Aug [2021] with a requirement that they wear masks as a spike in infections and deaths has continued to plague Florida.

The mask mandate was a violation of an order signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis barring schools from requiring that students wear face coverings and leaving that decision to their parents.

DeSantis has withheld funding from 2 school districts that violated his order, but Carvalho said that Miami-Dade had not yet lost any money.

The district has an online portal that tracks COVID-19 cases among its employees and staff, and it is continuing to urge all of those who are eligible to get vaccinated.

[This is truly a travesty when an effective vaccine is available. It is nonsensical that a governor can override a public health need.

"COVID-related child deaths in Florida more than doubled in just over a month, according to data from the Florida Department of Health.

"A Florida Department of Health weekly report showed 7 children under the age of 16 died from coronavirus complications from the start of the pandemic to 30 Jul 2021, a 15-month period. Per the department's latest report from 3 Sep 2021, the number has jumped to 17 deaths since 30 Jul 2021.

"Though the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Florida chapter said most of these deaths were aligned with underlying health conditions, this sharp climb has pediatric experts worried and uncertain about the COVID delta variant in the coming months."

GOP governors like Florida's Ron Desantis continue to fight individual school districts over mask mandates in school settings. A judge ruled in August [2021] that Desantis could not issue a mask ban, which was upheld in a court decision on Wednesday [8 Sep 2021], allowing school districts to continue imposing a mask mandate. However, the decision was overruled when an appeals court ruled in favor of the governor's ban on Friday [10 Sep 2021]. The US Department of Education opened a civil rights investigation into mask bans in 6 states, including Florida."

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries including the USA (74 975), India (31 291), UK (28 856), Philippines (26 251), Turkey (22 923), Malaysia (19 550), Russia (18 891), Iran (16 654), Brazil (14 314), Thailand (14 029), Mexico (12 511), Viet Nam (11 932), and Israel (11 396) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7731 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 9 Sep 2021 to late 10 Sep 2021). There appears to be the customary weekend-related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 9.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 9.9% decrease in daily reported cases and 5.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approximately 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 225.09 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.63 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
