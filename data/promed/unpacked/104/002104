Update on the number of British tourists with Cryptosporidia infection
-----------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed and reported cases in British tourists, mainly
children, returning from Alcudia is 188. The majority are associated with
one hotel, but there are a few cases associated with other hotels and with
no history of having visited the main outbreak hotel. 2 possibilities that
need to be considered are contamination of the drinking water supply or
contamination of a water theme park used as a popular excursion venue.
Reports are being received of a small number of cases associated with other
resorts in Mallorca and Menorca.

The management of swimming pools associated with Cryptosporidiosis or
contaminated by Cryptosporidium oocysts; Pilot Guidance for the U.K.
Federation of Tour Operators Prepared by Prof. Rodney Cartwright August 2003
These notes have been prepared for guidance on the actions to be taken when
cryptosporidium infection is associated with a swimming pool. They do not
cover action for prevention of contamination such as a faecal accident
policy. Many of the procedures recommended should be undertaken only by an
operative with the appropriate training. The use of high chlorine levels
is hazardous and the appropriate health and safety precautions must be
followed.
1. I am unaware of any published procedure for the decontamination of a
swimming pool contaminated with cryptosporidium oocysts. There are no
published studies on the efficacy of any procedures on the disinfection of
swimming pools against cryptosporidium, although there is anecdotal
evidence that certain actions have been associated with the cessation of
further cases of cryptosporidiosis.
2. There are recommendations for a response to a faecal accident. US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their weekly publication
(MMWR) of 25 May 2001 includes advice for contamination by a liquid stool.
a. Raise the free available chlorine concentration to 20 mg/L and maintain
the pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Ensure this concentration is found throughout
all co-circulating pools by sampling at least 3 widely spaced locations
away from return water outlets. This chlorine and pH level should be
sufficient to inactivate Cryptosporidium and should be maintained for at
least 8 hours, equivalent to a CT inactivation value of 9600. A higher or
lower free available chlorine level/inactivation time can be used as long
as a CT inactivation value equalling 9600 is maintained for Cryptosporidium
inactivation. State or local regulators may require higher free available
chlorine levels in the presence of chlorine stabilizers such as chlorinated
isocyanurates. If necessary, consult an aquatics professional to determine
and identify the feasibility, practical methods, and safety considerations
before attempting the hyperchlorination of any pool.
b. Ensure that the filtration system is operating while the pool reaches
and maintains the proper free available chlorine concentration during
disinfection.
c. Backwash the filter thoroughly after reaching the CT value. Be sure the
effluent is discharged directly to waste and in accordance with state or
local regulations. Do not return the backwash through the filter. Where
appropriate, replace the filter media.
d. Swimmers may be allowed into the pool after the required CT value has
been achieved and the free available chlorine level has been returned to
the normal operating range allowed by the state or local regulatory
authority. Maintain the free available chlorine concentration and pH at
standard operating levels based on state or local regulations. If
necessary, consult state or local regulatory authorities for
recommendations on bringing the free available chlorine levels back to an
acceptable operating range.
This guidance assumes a correctly installed and maintained water treatment
system.
3. The UK Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group (PWTAG) Swimming Pool Water
-treatment and Quality Standards (1999) following a faecal accident where
there is a possibility of cryptosporidium contamination it states and
recommends that:
The appropriate procedure relies on the fact that the cysts are, in
principle, large enough to be filtered out.
- The pool is cleared of people immediately.
- Disinfectant levels are maintained at the top of the recommended range.
- The pool is vacuumed and swept.
- Using a coagulant, the water is filtered for 6 turnover cycles (which
could well take up to a day, and so might mean closing the pool until the
next day).
- The filter is backwashed.
- The pool can then be reopened.
Clearly this is a fairly drastic course of action that any pool operator
would want to avoid if possible. But if there is a good reason to suspect
that Cryptosporidium or Giardia is responsible (certainly if the person
involved has had diarrhoea for some days), it would be the safest
procedure. The local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC)
should be notified. A copy of such emergency measures can usefully be
included in the operation and maintenance manual.
4. In the PWTAG technical guidance note of February 2001 on Cryptosporidium
concentrates on coagulation and filtration but does not deal directly with
decontamination of a known contaminated pool. They mention chlorine at a
level of 30mg/L for 4 hours as being necessary to kill cryptosporidium
oocysts but make no recommendations on the use of chlorine. Further
detailed advice is given on the use of coagulants and filters.
5. In the UK there is concern on relying on high chlorine levels alone as a
means of disinfection because
a. There are no published data on the effect of chlorine on cryptosporidium
oocysts in a swimming pool. It is understood that the studies that have
been undertaken are in a laboratory setting.
b. Chlorine is inactivated by organic material and there may be high levels
of such material in parts of a pool and especially in filters.
c. It would be necessary for the chlorine to be evenly distributed
throughout the pool.
d. For chlorine to be effective the pH must be carefully controlled (CDC
recommend 7.2 - 7.5)
e. Other chemicals may interfere with the action of the chlorine.
6. Concerns with filtration include
a. The need for the filters to be operated at the correct pressure and
water flow. The optimum operating conditions should be provided by the
filter suppliers
b. The use of sand of the correct particle size in the filters.
c. Proper maintenance and back washing of the filters.
d. The time taken for all the pool water to be filtered. Water equivalent
to the pool volume may pass through in a given time, but the structure of
the pool may be such that all the water has not passed through. That is
there may be areas of poor circulation in the pool.
7. Water can be tested for the presence of cryptosporidium
oocysts. Normally 10L grab samples are tested but larger volumes can be
examined by the use of a cartridge filter. The volume of water and
collection method should be discussed with the test laboratory. Before
considering the appropriate action, an understanding of the water test
results is necessary so that misunderstandings do not occur.
a. Cryptosporidium oocysts are not evenly distributed in the
water. Therefore the numbers in a sample do not on their own have any
significance. If oocysts are present, that water is contaminated and poses
a potential risk to bathers.
b. The absence of oocysts in a sample does not mean that there are no
oocysts elsewhere in the pool that could be a hazard to bathers.
c. All laboratory tests should be undertaken in a laboratory with
accreditation for cryptosporidium testing in water. The test method should
be based on the US EPA Analytical Method 1662 "Cryptosporidium in Water by
Filtraion/IMS/FA"
d. The tests undertaken do not distinguish between live and dead
oocysts. As a rule of thumb they should all be regarded as alive and
potentially infectious.
e. If a suspect pool has negative test results for oocysts, further samples
-- including a backwash and a sample of sand from the top 30cm of the
filter -- should be examined.
f. Examining the deposit from the pump strainer is also worth considering.
8. The following scenarios are being met associated with hotel pools.
a. 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families using a
swimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses with
diarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool users. Pool water
samples containing cryptosporidium oocysts
b. As for (a) with no oocysts demonstrated in water samples.
c. Oocysts demonstrated in pool water samples but no associated cases of
unexplained diarrhoea.
9. Scenario 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families
using a swimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses
with diarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool
users. Oocysts found in water tests
a. Empty the pool
b. Thoroughly clean all pipe work and associated tanks
c. Replace the sand in the filters
d. Refill the pool and chlorinate to 20 mg/L at pH 7.2 - 7.5 for 8 hours
10. Scenario 3 or more cases of cryptosporidiosis from different families
using a swimming pool. This may be accompanied by an increase in illnesses
with diarrhoea, and no other obvious cause, among other pool users. No
oocysts found in water tests
a. Test further water samples and especially backwash samples. Test
samples of sand taken from the top 30 cm of the sand filters. If negative
and further cases do not occur, no further action need be taken and another
source of infection should be sought.
b. Look for non-pool source(s) of infection. This should involve the local
public health authorities and the Water Company or companies.
c. If further cases occur and the pool is the probable source of infection,
follow the scenario below, even if oocyst are not found in the pool water
tests.
11. Scenario
Oocysts demonstrated in pool water samples but no associated cases of
unexplained diarrhoea
a. Take further samples including sand from the filters.
b. Close the pool and any other pools whose water treatment is linked to
the fouled pool.
c. Maintaining disinfectant levels at the top of the operating range,
vacuum and sweep the pool.
d. Using optimised coagulation, filter for 6 turnover cycles (which may
mean closing the pool for a day). This assumes good hydraulics and filters
that have been correctly installed and maintained.
e. Backwash the filters individually, NOT through other filters.
f. Check free chlorine residuals and pH and if they are satisfactory reopen
the pool.
12. General Considerations in all scenarios
a. Ensure that any water used to fill or top up the pool is free from
Cryptosporidium
b. Ensure that the pool operation is in accordance with sound water
treatment principles as for example in the PWTAG Swimming Pool Water
-Treatment and Quality Standards (1999)
c. Consider other pools or water features that may be contaminated.
d. Do not move guests from a pool with a contaminated pool to another
hotel. This may spread any infection.
e. Ensure that all test results are made available to the local public
health authorities
