Residents of The Tharaka Nithi County have been put on notice and asked to be cautious when consuming meat this Christmas season if it has not been checked and certified. This happens after cases of an anthrax outbreak were reported following the death of 15 heads of cattle and 14 sheep, that prompted the County Government to embark on a 15-day vaccination campaign.

The county's Ministry of Agriculture has also warned against an outbreak of rabies, asking residents to have their cats and dogs vaccinated.

Speaking while launching the vaccination drive in Mukuthuku village in Kambandi area, Chuka, area Governor Muthomi Njuki said most farmers risk of losing their cattle if the disease is not checked. He warned residents against assuming that their animals are fit for consumption before consulting veterinary officers. The governor, accompanied by his deputy, Francis Kagwima, asked farmers to go to designated areas to make sure their livestock are vaccinated. The County Government has reduced the vaccination prices so as to enable farmers' access the services.

In addition to lowering the prices for vaccination, Muthomi announced a reduction in prices for artificial insemination from Ksh.1200 [approx. 11.6 USD] to Ksh.600 [approx. 5.8 USD].

[Governor Muthomi Njuki is to be congratulated for reducing the vaccination cost. This will positively encourage farmer participation and result in more livestock being vaccinated.
