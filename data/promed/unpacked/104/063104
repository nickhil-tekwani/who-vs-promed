[Cases continue to occur at a low level but steady rate. Since the beginning of October 2012, there have been a total of 8 new laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 4 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia. Today's (14 Oct 2014) newly confirmed case in an 82-year-old Saudi male from Alkarj (in Riyadh province, 77 km south of Riyadh city) has 2 potential risk factors for disease, exposure to camels with ingestion of camel's milk, and the history of pre-existing disease that may have increased this individual's exposure to the health system and potential encounters with other MERS-CoV infected individuals. A case control study of MERS-CoV infected individuals with no identified risk factors (no history contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals and no history of exposure to camels) might well address this issue as part of the continued search for identification of risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission.

[2] Haj Healthcare - media report

Nearly half a million pilgrims made use of medical facilities that were available in Makkah and Madinah during Haj this year [2014].

19 open heart surgeries were performed, Mansour Al-Hawasi, Deputy Health Minister for Health Affairs, said. Al-Hawasi was addressing health officials here during an Eid party hosted by the Ministry of Health to thank health officials who were affiliated with the Haj program in both cities, Arab News reported.

Some 22 000 health officials were deployed in the holy cities this year [2014], as well as at 14 ports of entry. Offering his congratulations to Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah and Crown Prince Salman, Deputy Premier and Minister of Defense, for their unwavering cooperation in making the health program a success, the Deputy Minister said health officials did their part to offer the very best of services to pilgrims. He also expressed gratitude to the World Health Organization (WHO) for its assistance in the prevention of infectious diseases. Shoura Council member Abdul Rahman Al-Sweilem was present during the function.

Al-Hawasi said some 472 000 pilgrims availed themselves of the medical facilities at the holy sites and at the ports of entry.

He said that 329 000 pilgrims had visited medical centers in the holy sites, and 111 000 had sought outpatient treatment at these clinics.

"A total of 28 000 pilgrims have sought emergency treatment, while 3700 were admitted to various hospitals in Makkah and Madinah," he added. Al-Hawasi pointed out that 19 000 units of blood were used to treat patients at the holy sites so far.

Some 19 000 pilgrims were given on-the-spot medical treatment at various points throughout the holy city. According to statistics provided by the deputy minister, 988 pilgrims received dialysis treatment, while 330 underwent catheterization, and 55 were given endoscopic treatment.

A comprehensive Haj health program was implemented under the leadership of the acting Health Minister Adel Fakeih this year (2014) in cooperation with the WHO. The Health Ministry took preventive measures to combat the spread of Ebola and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with the help of local and international medical experts, including officials from the WHO.

[The amount of contact between the Hajis and the health sector during the Hajj this year (2014) as stated in the above media report is impressive. While we do not know whether the number of individuals visiting medical centers (329 000) and the number seeking outpatient treatment (111 000) are cumulative unique individual visits (each visit cited was a unique individual, and individuals are not counted more than once if they sought medical assistance more than one time), taking as a low, 111 000 (5.6 percent of the 2 million haj attendees) to a high of 444 000 (adding the 329 000 and 111 000) individuals (22 percent) demonstrates the enormity of the potential impact on the health infrastructure (both clinical management as well as public health). While there were no cases of MERS-CoV infection identified among the Haj attendees that sought medical assistance during their pilgrimage, a full incubation period (14-16 days) has not passed since the Haj has ended to permit the final collective sigh of relief. Accepting that exposure to camels has been identified as a risk factor for disease, can one be sure that all attendees avoided such contact while in Saudi Arabia? The human factor can present challenges to the best of public health recommendations and guidance. - Mod.MPP
