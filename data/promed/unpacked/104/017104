Officials with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services' [NCDHHS'] Division of Public Health have confirmed a 2nd death in the outbreak of _Legionella_ bacteria, which has now infected dozens of Mountain State Fair attendees with the potentially life-threatening Legionnaires' disease.

On 10 Oct [2019], NCDHHS officials confirmed 134 cases of Legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever among people who attended the 2019 NC Mountain State Fair, which took place 6-15 Sep [2019] at the WNC Ag Center in Fletcher. Those diagnosed live in in multiple states and several North Carolina counties, according to a news release.

Two people have died, and 88 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak. Personal information of those who have died is not being released, NCDHHS said, to protect privacy of the families. "We send our sincerest condolences to the families of the 2 people who have died and to all those who have been affected by this outbreak," said Dr. Zack Moore, state epidemiologist. "Legionnaires' disease is a serious illness that can lead to complications and death, especially in older individuals or those with underlying conditions."

Seven [8, according to the NCDHHS; see below. - Mod.ML] of the confirmed cases are actually Pontiac fever, a milder illness also caused by the _Legionella_ bacteria. Symptoms are the eponymous fever, muscle aches, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, according to the NCDHHS.

While officials have not yet confirmed a source for the deadly bacteria, officials have pointed to a hot tub display as the most likely culprit. "The preliminary epidemiologic and environmental findings suggest that exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria occurred in the Davis Event Center of the WNC Ag Center, particularly near the hot tubs and during the last 5 days of the fair," the NCDHHS release stated. Hot tubs are a well-established source of aerosolized water exposure and have been associated with previous Legionnaires' disease outbreaks nationally and internationally.

"These results highlight the importance of caring for and maintaining equipment that can aerosolize water," according to the release. "There were no other significant sources of aerosolized water at the WNC Ag Center and no other ongoing potential sources of exposure identified."

The _Legionella_ bacteria enters the body via contaminated water, but it has to reach the lungs to be dangerous. The culprit is usually aerosolized water -- tiny water droplets suspended in the air by something like a misting station, an air conditioner, or steam -- that people unknowingly breathe in.

To report possible cases, call the local health department or the NCDHHS Division of Public Health at (919) 733-3419. In Buncombe County, call BCHHS Communicable Disease at 828-250-5109. In Henderson County, call 828-694-6019.

[The latest status, as of 9 Oct 2019, of the legionellosis outbreak associated with the Mountain State Fair that was held in western North Carolina between 6 and 15 Sep 2019 at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center (WNC Ag Center) in Fletcher, a town in Henderson County, can be found at https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/legionellosis/outbreak.html.

The number of confirmed cases of legionellosis by county are as follows: Buncombe, 49; Burke, 1; Caswell, 1; Cherokee, 1; Gaston, 1; Granville, 1; Haywood, 12; Henderson, 33; Jackson, 1; Madison, 6; McDowell, 3; Mecklenburg, 4; Mitchell, 2; Polk, 1; Rutherford, 3; Transylvania, 3; Union, 1; Watauga, 1; and Yancey, 1. Nine cases occurred out of state (in South Carolina). Total cases: 134.

Male, 75 (56%)**; female, 57 (44%)**. Median age in years (range): 61 (24-91). Hospitalizations: 88 (68%); deaths 2.
**Some cases reported with unknown gender.

A total of 126 (94%) have Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the infection, and 8 (6%) have Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of the infection.

The source of the outbreak has still not been identified. However, hot tub displays in one of the buildings (Davis Event Center) has been linked to the outbreak, and _Legionella_ was found in a women's restroom in this building. A site map of the WNC Ag Center that shows the location of the Davis Event Center building can be found at https://www.wncagcenter.org/p/mountainstatefair/competitions/map.

Although 97 of the 134 (72.4%) cases reside in 4 adjacent counties (Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, and Transylvania) near the WNC AG Center, the infection now involves cases in a total of 19 of the 100 North Carolina counties plus counties in the neighboring state of South Carolina. A map showing the location of the North Carolina counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.

The species of _Legionella_ detected in patients or in the environmental isolate from the Davis Event Center is not specified; however, the usual pathogen in the US is _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Genotyping clinical and environmental isolates will help identify clusters of cases with a common source and identify the source responsible for infection in these clusters. - Mod.ML
