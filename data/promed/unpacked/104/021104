Continued high influenza activity in the WHO European Region
------------------------------------------------------------
This issue is based on data reported in week 5/2011 by 48 member
states in the WHO European Region.

Summary
-------
-- Clinical consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI)
and/or acute respiratory infections (ARI) are increasing in 27
countries, while 9 others have passed peaks in clinical activity.
-- 46 per cent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI and/or
ARI, and 54 per cent of specimens from sentinel severe acute
respiratory infection (SARI) patients were positive for influenza in
week 5/2011.
-- 98 per cent of antigenically characterized viruses from the
2010/2011 influenza season are similar to the viruses included in the
2010/2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Current situation -- week 5/2011
--------------------------------
During week 5/2011, 2 countries (Georgia and Luxembourg) and 3
regions of the Russian Federation reported very high intensity of
influenza activity; 6 countries reported high intensity and 25
reported medium intensity. 21 countries reported widespread activity.
Of the 25 countries reporting on the impact of influenza on health
care systems, 1 (Georgia) reported severe impact; 11 countries
reported moderate impact and 13, low impact.

Clinical data also indicated increasing influenza activity in much of
the WHO European Region, as 27 countries reported increasing trends in
consultation rates for ILI and/or ARI. Some countries in the central,
south-eastern and eastern parts of the region have reported pronounced
increases in clinical ILI or ARI activity. In general, the highest
consultation rates were reported for children aged 5-14 and 0-4
years.

WHO/Europe received sentinel surveillance data on hospitalized SARI
from 9 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania,
the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine).
These data indicate that, between weeks 3 and 5/2011, sentinel SARI
hospitalizations in general reached their highest levels of the season
to date in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Russian
Federation and Serbia. Each of these countries also reported
concurrent increases in clinical consultation rates for ILI or ARI.

Virological situation -- week 5/2011
------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 17
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 12 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 5 countries. During the past few weeks, the
predominance of influenza B viruses has increased in countries in
western Europe, which had predominantly pandemic A(H1N1) viruses
circulating at the start of their season. In a number of eastern
European countries, the earlier predominance of influenza B viruses
has now shifted to a predominance of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009
viruses. Sentinel physicians collected 3125 respiratory specimens, of
which 1428 (46 per cent) were positive for influenza virus: 824 (58
per cent) were influenza A and 604 (42 per cent) were influenza B. Of
the influenza A viruses, 705 were subtyped: 687 (97 per cent) as
pandemic A(H1) and 18 (3 per cent) as A(H3). In the 26 countries
testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged
from 8 per cent to 80 per cent, with a median of 49 per cent (mean: 50
per cent). In addition, 6128 non-sentinel specimens were reported
positive for influenza: 4532 (74 per cent) influenza A and 1596 (26
per cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 3792 were subtyped:
3697 (97 per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 95 (3 per cent) as A(H3). Out
of 241 sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 5/2011, 129 (54
per cent) tested positive for influenza: 94 (73 per cent) were
influenza A; 35 (27 per cent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 60 were subtyped: 59 (98 per cent) as pandemic A(H1), and 1
(2 per cent) as A(H3). Of the countries testing 10 or more sentinel
SARI specimens, the percentage of specimens testing positive for
influenza ranged from 36 per cent (the Republic of Moldova) to 71 per
cent (Kyrgyzstan) with a median of 56 per cent (mean: 54 per cent).

Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were detected in 16 countries; 14
of these reported fewer RSV detections during week 5/2011 than week
4/2011.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010 - 5/2011
-------------------------------------------------------
A total of 46 613 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 33 489 (72 per cent) were influenza A and 13 124
(28 per cent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 24 098
were subtyped: 23 072 (96 per cent) as pandemic influenza A(H1), 1025
(4 per cent) as influenza A(H3) and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 to week 5/2011, 566 out of 2484 sentinel SARI
specimens (23 per cent) tested positive for influenza. Of these
influenza viruses: 250 (44 per cent) were influenza A and 316 (56 per
cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 183 were subtyped: 168
(92 per cent) as pandemic influenza A(H1) and 15 (8 per cent) as
influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 1420 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 834 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 470 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 84 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 31 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage), and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 194 influenza viruses, 103 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 5 belonged to the pandemic
A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 23 belonged to the pandemic A/Hong
Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 25 were reported as A(H1) pandemic not
attributed to group category but belonging to the recently emerged
A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T substitution in the
HA; 9 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 1
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Brisbane/10/2007; 5
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 16
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 6 belonged to the
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage), and 1 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 5 countries (Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain and
the United Kingdom) reported screening 783 viruses for susceptibility
to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. 667 of
these viruses were screened by the United Kingdom. Of 720 isolates of
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were tested, 697 were
sensitive to both inhibitors and 23 viruses (3.2 per cent) were
resistant to oseltamivir, as determined by the presence of the H275Y
mutation. These 23 remained sensitive to zanamivir. 1 influenza
A(H3N2) virus was tested and found to be sensitive to both inhibitors.
All of the 61 influenza B viruses tested for susceptibility to
oseltamivir and the 62 tested for susceptibility to zanamivir were
found to be sensitive. All 35 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses
and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for susceptibility to
adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to increase in the WHO
European Region, particularly in the central, eastern and south
eastern parts, and the percentage of sentinel specimens positive for
influenza remains high. Influenza activity is progressing in a
west-to-east manner across the region, with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
2009 circulation generally decreasing in the western part of the
region and increasing in the eastern. Influenza B is becoming
relatively more predominant in countries where the prevalence of
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 is decreasing. This shift, with
relatively more A(H1N1) 2009 viruses circulating in the eastern part
of the region, may explain the notable difference in the proportion of
influenza A to influenza B viruses among SARI patients in week 5/2011,
when compared to all SARI viruses for the cumulative 2010/2011
influenza season. This is because most of the countries conducting
sentinel SARI surveillance are in the central and eastern part of the
WHO European Region. 98% of antigenically characterized viruses from
the 2010/2011 influenza season are similar to the viruses recommended
for inclusion in the 2010/2011 northern hemisphere influenza
vaccines.

[In brief; influenza continues to spread west-east across the
European region. Some countries in the central, south-eastern and
eastern parts of the Region have reported pronounced increases in
clinical ILI or ARI activity. In general, the highest consultation
rates were reported for children aged 5-14 and 0-4 years.

98 per cent of antigenically characterized viruses from the 2010/2011
influenza season are similar to the viruses included in the 2010/2011
northern hemisphere influenza vaccines. Influenza B is becoming
relatively more predominant in countries where the prevalence of
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 is decreasing.

The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus infection is beginning
to decline. - Mod.CP]
