EU Proposes Tighter Beef Regulations After Mad Cow Scare
------------------------------------
European agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels have agreed to recommend
a complete ban on the sale of beef products using any part of the animal's
spinal cord. If adopted, the ban spells the end of the sale of popular cuts
of meat such as T-bone and rib eye steaks, which are already heavily
regulated. Sales have slumped by 27 per cent across Europe, which has led
to difficulties in disposing of thousands of tons of unwanted meat.
The Finnish agriculture minister, Carlavy Hemmiler, hopes the new measures
will be introduced across the European Union (EU). "Our conclusions
[results? are very good, we are going to continue this message," the
minister said. "Now the most important thing is that all the member states
must implement all these measures."

The Cantabria case [of suspected bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
that produced intense controversy, since the affected animal was only 30
months of age, has finally been declared inconclusive by the Laboratorio
Nacional de Referencia in Zaragoza.
So far 9 cases of BSE have been diagnosed in Spain. Dates and details taken
from the press are:
1- 23 Nov 2000, 5 years old, Rubia Gallega/Friesian breed. Galicia
2- 18 Dec 2000 a 5 years old, Heckviech breed. Galicia
3- 3 Jan 2001, 6 years old, Friesian breed. (Fed on concentrates and milk
substitutes until 4 months of age and after that age only on grain and
hay). Zamora
4- 3 Jan 2001, 5 years old, Friesian breed. Zamora
5- 6 Jan 2001, 5 years old, Friesian breed. Galicia
6- 15 Jan 2001, 5 years old, Friesian breed. Asturias
7- 16 Jan 2001, 5 years old, Mixed breed. Asturias
8- 17 Jan 2001, 4 years old, Friesian breed. Avila
9- 25 Jan 2001, 6 years old, Friesian breed. Zamora
In all cases the whole herd has been destroyed.
All cases but one have been detected in the northwest of Spain. Portugal is
tied with Ireland as the country in Europe with [the highest number of
positive cases (503), 80 per cent of them concentrated along the northwest
of the country. The Portuguese-Spanish border has traditionally been known
for its permeability. Animals graze both sides of the border along its 1250
km [length. Concentrates are 600 pesetas per bag (around US $3.50) cheaper
in Portugal, and since both countries are members of the EU there are no
controls in their borders.
So far only the Regional Basque Government has arranged the cremation of
the concentrates in the ovens of some cement plants. The medium term
implications are still unknown. The Ministry of Agriculture is dedicating
53 000 million pesetas (around US $300 million) this year to control the
disease.
The ban on feeding ruminants animal protein would impose some changes in
the beef sector. Veal, the most consumed meat in Spain, comes from animals
younger than 24 months, and will be difficult to produce in the future as
the growth of animals fed on vegetarian proteins will be slower.
The implications for the bullfighting sector are still being analyzed. To
preserve the breed there is discussion of avoiding the destruction of the
whole herd in case a positive animal is found. As most of the wounds in
bullfighting are made along the bull's spinal region, there is also
discussion about safety issues concerning the bullfighter and other
personnel involved in the spectacle.
No cases of [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human variant of BSE have been
reported in Spain.

Germany to Slaughter Cattle
-----------------------------------
BERLIN: The German government announced [on Wednesday [31 Jan 2001 [that
it would slaughter an estimated 400 000 cattle in an attempt to curb mad
cow disease, a spokesman said. Agriculture minister Renate Kuenast had
estimated it would cost the country about $166 million to buy the cattle
from farmers, properly slaughter them, and dispose of the corpses. After
the animals are killed, they are to be tested for BSE.
German ministers had claimed their country was free of the disease until
the first case was discovered in November [2000. Since then, several cases
have been discovered every week, bringing the overall number of infected
cattle to more than 20. BSE has been linked with new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human version of the fatal brain-wasting
ailment that has killed some 80 Europeans since the mid-1990s, mostly in
Britain. Cattle parts ground back into feed are suspected of spreading the
disease.

Feed Contamination Issue Resolved by FDA
--------------------------------------
Although many of you may have heard the latest regarding the resolution of
the cattle feed contamination situation in Texas, I wanted to ensure that
you received this statement issued by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), the agency in charge of regulating feed components. The FDA has said
the cattle involved are to be rendered and the material will not enter
ruminant or human food channels. The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC)
will provide assistance to the FDA as requested and needed.
FDA ANNOUNCES TEST RESULTS FROM TEXAS FEED LOT
----------------------------------
Today (Tue 30 Jan 2000) the Food and Drug Administration [FDA announced
the results of tests taken on feed used at a Texas feedlot that was
suspected of containing meat and bone meal from other domestic cattle -- a
violation of FDA's 1997 prohibition on using ruminant material in feed for
other ruminants. Results indicate that a very low level of prohibited
material was found in the feed fed to cattle.
FDA has determined that each animal could have consumed, at most and in
total, 5.5 grams -- approximately a quarter ounce -- of prohibited
material. These animals weigh approximately 600 pounds. It is important to
note that the prohibited material was domestic in origin (therefore not
likely to contain infected material because there is no evidence of BSE in
US cattle), fed at a very low level, and fed only once. The potential risk
of BSE to such cattle is therefore exceedingly low, even if the feed were
contaminated.
According to Dr. Bernard Schwetz, FDA's acting principal deputy
commissioner, "The challenge to regulators and industry is to keep this
disease out of the United States. One important defense is to prohibit the
use of any ruminant animal materials in feed for other ruminant animals.
Combined with other steps, like USDA's [US Department of Agriculture ban
on the importation of live ruminant animals from affected countries, these
steps represent a series of protections, to keep American cattle free of BSE."
Despite this negligible risk, Purina Mills, Inc., is nonetheless announcing
that it is voluntarily purchasing all 1222 of the animals held in Texas and
mistakenly fed the animal feed containing the prohibited material.
Therefore, meat from those animals will not enter the human food supply.
FDA believes any cattle that did not consume feed containing the prohibited
material are unaffected by this incident, and should be handled in the beef
supply clearance process as usual. FDA believes that Purina Mills has
behaved responsibly by first reporting the human error that resulted in the
misformulation of the animal feed supplement and then by working closely
with state and federal authorities.
This episode indicates that the multi-layered safeguard system put into
place is essential for protecting the food supply and that continued
vigilance needs to be taken, by all concerned, to ensure these rules are
followed routinely. FDA will continue working with USDA as well as state
and local officials to ensure that companies and individuals comply with
all laws and regulations designed to protect the US food supply.

[Purina and FDA are to be commended for their high public responsibility
and proactive planning and response in this matter where public perceptions
override reality. Rendering is the process by which carcasses, viscera, and
other unwanted bits and pieces at abattoirs are cooked under pressure to
provide safe by-products such as fat, tallow, protein sources for
monogastric animals, and bones. As yet there is no evidence for BSE in
North America, other than in imported stock. The risk is if mink
encephalopathy (ME) should resurface and be recycled; in the original
description of this disease by Richard Marsh the source was given as local
dead cattle that were fed to the mink that later came down with a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy/ME. There are also concerns about
chronic wasting disease and scrapie, and if such tissues were fed to
cattle. - Mod.MHJ
