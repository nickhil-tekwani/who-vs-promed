[Information obtained from Zambia's last 6-monthly report sent to the OIE (Jan-Jun 2013) indicates that the country reported African swine fever (ASF) as being restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s) (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).

Data found in the OIE's WAHID database, disease incidence section, shows that in September 2012, Zambia reported one outbreak of ASF in the Northern Province, and from January to June 2013, 13 outbreaks of ASF were reported: 11 in the Eastern province, 1 in the North-western Province, and 1 in the Northern Province. For further details on these outbreaks, select the disease, region/country and year at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

Lusaka is located in the south-central part of Zambia. It borders with the Central Province, the Southern Province, and the Eastern Province (where most outbreaks have been reported during 2013). Lusaka also borders with the countries of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

In Zimbabwe ASF has been reported as absent since March 1992 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist), whereas in Mozambique, the disease is reported as present. In 2012 Mozambique reported 6 outbreaks of ASF to the OIE (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail).
