A new nidus of African swine fever in Stavrapol
-----------------------------------------------
A new nidus [focus] of African swine fever [ASF] has been registered
in Divnoe village, Apanasenskoe region in Stavropol krai [region].
About 15 swine died in a private yard, and preliminary tests confirmed
the diagnosis.

The regional ministry of agriculture has informed ITAR-TASS that the
current outbreak may necessitate quarantine at the regional level,
because there is an ongoing ASF outbreak investigation in another
nearby village called Kievka.

Swine die-off in the Apanasenskoe region started in the collective
farm at Kievka village on 16 Mar 2009. About 190 animals have already
been culled at this location. This outbreak is the 2nd in Stavropol
krai this year. The 1st outbreak occurred in the Rostovanskoe
collective farm in Kursk region, which led to destruction of more than
6500 animals. This infection, also known as Montgomery disease, is not
dangerous for humans but is fatal for swine. There are no vaccines and
treatment available yet.

[The 2nd outbreak in the region indicates that quarantine measures
failed after being imposed at village level and regional quarantine
will be imposed. This outbreak is limited to one location currently,
but continuous monitoring may reveal more locations. After the 1st
outbreak in Kursk region residents of the affected village conducted a
mass protest action against the culling of swine. However, there were
no alternatives other than quarantine and forced culling of animals. -

[This disease problem is getting drawn out and it might be useful to
revisit the campaign in Georgia and specifically ProMED report:
African swine fever - Georgia (11): SDC mission report 20070920.3131
in which many of the Georgian eradication & surveillance problems were
identified, some or all of which may be occurring in the various
Russian regions, and may predate the 1st outbreaks in and around the
Georgian port of Poti. - Mod.MHJ]
