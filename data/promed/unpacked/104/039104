Sheep of British origin slaughtered in France tested positive for
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), France's Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany
said. Glavany said the test results showed the slaughtered livestock had
been in contact with animals having had FMD, but did not in themselves
prove the French sheep were affected with the disease.
"The suspicions about FMD not be confirmed because the animals were
slaughtered and burned after the tests were taken," said Glavany.
"This does not mean the animals were sick," he added, noting French
authorities had taken action, however, "as though the animals actually had
FMD."

The French government on Monday banned the export and movement of cattle,
sheep and pigs for 15 days in a bid to prevent the spread of FMD.
Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany said the ban was part of a series of
measures aimed at protecting the country from the highly contagious
disease. He said the export ban also concerns horses.
Strict sanitary measures would also be introduced at abattoirs where the
testing of animals will be stepped up, Glavany said.
He said farmers would be compensated for their losses.

The Foot-and-Mouth Disease that has swept the United Kingdom was detected
in France on Sunday [4 Mar 2001, where the agricultural minister said some
sheep imported from Britain tested positive for the highly contagious ailment.
The disease was also found at a huge national park in southwest England,
officials said Sunday, while Belgium shut down its 2 largest zoos and
Denmark quarantined 7 farms in a bid to ward off the livestock disease.
Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany, speaking in an interview with
France-Info radio from Montreal, said tests of slaughtered sheep in France
"show that these animals were in contact with the malady but were not
necessarily carriers of the malady."
The Agriculture Ministry said 9 herds were involved in the testing,
including 3 in the Oise region just north of Paris and one in suburban
Seine-Saint-Denis. 3 herds in the Cher region in central France also were
among those tested.
