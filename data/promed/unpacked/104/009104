[translated & summarized from the Portuguese by Mod.JW

Today, 24 Nov 2000, Germany reported its first case of BSE, from the
northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Today, also, the European Commission confirmed the first case of BSE from
the Azores [islands in the Atlantic belonging to Portugal, which had up to
now been free of BSE because they had never fed their cattle on bone meal.
The cow had been slaughtered on 2 Oct 2000, & was imported from Germany 2
years
ago. Since Germany was reportedly free of BSE at that time, there is some
suspicion that the animal originated in Portugal, which has the highest
rate of BSE in its cattle after the UK.
