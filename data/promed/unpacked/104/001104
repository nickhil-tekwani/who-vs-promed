China Discovers Genetic Makeup of Fatal Prawn Virus
------------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists said today they became the first in the world to
determine the genetic makeup of a fatal prawn virus responsible for a
drastic reduction in prawn production in China and other parts of Asia over
the past few years.
They said the sequencing of the virus's genome, or its genetic material,
will help scientists develop diagnostic tools and drugs against the
leukodermal bacilliform virus, the largest known animal virus.
The virus has been responsible for outbreaks of a contagious disease in the
past few years, resulting in devastating losses in Asia's prawn farms.
Xu Xun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said he and his
colleagues with the No. 3 Institute under the State Oceanic Administration,
determined for the first time in the world some of the genetic material of
the virus, and sequenced 90 percent of the virus' genetic code in 1997.
They finished the sequencing work last June 1999, saying that information
available to them has shown they are far ahead of their international
counterparts, who have sequenced only one percent of the virus' genome.
The research began in 1994 with funding from the State Oceanic
Administration, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Fujian
Provincial Government and the State Human Genome Northern Center.
The scientists said they are in the process of applying for a patent for
the sequencing.
