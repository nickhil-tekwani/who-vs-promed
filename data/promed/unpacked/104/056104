I would like to question the statement made in this posting that I
believe was made by a ProMED-mail moderator. Infants exposed to active
tuberculosis receive window therapy regardless of their skin test
result not only "if infected" as stated in this posting. Their
treatment continues for treatment of LTBI [latent TB infection] if
they have converted to positive during the window period according to
the CDC guidelines. The IGRA [interferon gamma release assay] is not
recommended for children under the age of 5 years, which I think was
mentioned in the previous posting.

As of today [31 Aug 2011], there were 22 new cases [of latent TB
infection in infants born at Rome's Gemelli Hospital]. The families of
the children concerned have already been informed. There are 17 males
and 5 females. Of these [22], one child was born in January, 10 in
February, 4 in March, 3 in April, 2 in May, 1 in June, and 1 in July
[2011]. Overall, as of today 1197 infants have been seen and tested,
and results are available for 996, of which 79 were positive (7.9 per
cent).

The Coordination Unit would also point out that of the babies tested
positive to date none were ill.

[The comment and news release above concern an outbreak of latent
tuberculosis (TB) infection among infants born at Rome's Gemelli
Hospital after exposure to a nurse with TB who worked at Gemelli's
neonatal ward (see ProMED-mail Tuberculosis, latent, nosocomial,
infants - Italy: (Rome) 20110825.2587). It was stated in the initial
news release that infants born at the hospital between March and July
2011 would be tested for TB. However, the news release above (item
[2]) states that there are infants with positive tests for
tuberculosis who were born in January and February 2011, which would
mean that the dates of employment in the neonatal ward for the nurse
with contagious TB extend before March 2011 or that there are
additional sources of exposure to active pulmonary TB for these
infants.

The Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic is a large general hospital
of 1850 beds in Rome. It serves as the teaching hospital for the
medical school of the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (the
largest privately owned university in Italy;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostino_Gemelli_University_Polyclinic).

ProMED-mail's Mod.ML agrees with Linda Latelle above concerning prompt
initiation of chemotherapy for latent TB infection for infants exposed
to active pulmonary tuberculosis regardless of their initial
tuberculin skin test [TST] result. The TST is then repeated in 3
months and if positive, chemotherapy is continued and if negative,
stopped. Mod.ML also agrees that the US CDC recommends use of the
tuberculin skin test rather that interferon gamma release assays
(IGRAs) for these children and apologizes for any error in translation
from Italian in the new releases that may have occurred.

Please note the following for Mod.ML's comments concerning exposure to
contagious TB in children that can be found the initial ProMED-mail
post on this outbreak, Tuberculosis, latent, nosocomial, infants -
Italy: (Rome) 20110825.2587:

"The diagnosis of perinatal tuberculosis is difficult because of its
nonspecific presentation, the difficulty of obtaining microbiological
confirmation, and the unreliability of the tuberculin skin test. The
CDC recommends that if the chest radiograph is normal, LTBI treatment
should be initiated in TST-negative children 5 years of age and
younger. Treatment should be continued until the results of the 2nd
TST 3 months later and other medical evaluation are known (see
http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm). If the 2nd
TST result is negative, treatment may be stopped
(http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm). TST is the
preferred method for testing of children under the age of 5 years
(http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm), because of
limited data on the use of IGRAs in this age group
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf)."
