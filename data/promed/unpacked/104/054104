Subject: Emergency Management Warning 105: Exotic Newcastle Disease
in the United States
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the
State of California and is now in the final phase of total
eradication. No new positive premises have been detected since 31
May 2003. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has
also recently taken the following significant regulatory actions:
1. A prohibition on the interstate and international movement of
animals for fighting, which directly addressed gamefowl movements for
fighting, was published in the Federal Register on 12 May 2003.
2. With the complete eradication of END in the States of Nevada and
Arizona, effective 14 May 2003, APHIS lifted federal quarantines on
the 5 counties affected in Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, all
Federal/State emergency response incident command posts in the 2
States have been closed.
3. With the successful eradication of END in the single index
premises in Texas, the Federal/State incident command post in
Socorro, TX, has also been closed and the quarantine lifted on the 5
counties affected in Texas and New Mexico.
APHIS is currently conducting END strategy meetings planning for
final eradication and surveillance activities. Although all
indicators show that END is nearing total eradication in the United
States, APHIS is still conducting an enhanced national END
surveillance program throughout the United States.
