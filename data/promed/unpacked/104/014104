As many as 1900 Queens residents were unknowingly infected with the West
Nile virus last fall, New York City health officials have concluded in the
aftermath of the outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus that killed 7 people
and sickened at least 62 in the New York area.
Extrapolating from a survey in October across a three-square-mile swath of
northern Queens, the epicenter of last year's outbreak, officials concluded
that 533 to 1903 people, or about 2.6 percent of the area's 46 000
residents, had been infected with the virus, according to survey results
released yesterday.
But only a fraction of those infected with the virus -- 9 cases, 3 of them
fatal, were confirmed in the northern Queens hot spot -- contracted
encephalitis, which often mimics the flu, but infrequently leads to deadly
brain swelling.
Illness caused by the West Nile virus is typically short-lived and can lead
to lifelong immunity, Health Department officials said, although they were
unable to say definitively that exposure guarantees lifelong immunity.
There is no vaccine to protect against the disease.
Health Department officials said yesterday that the survey did not examine
the rate of infection for the other boroughs because the virus was most
prevalent among birds and mosquitoes in the northern Queens epicenter,
where the outbreak was first detected last August.
Officials said the average percentage of the population found to be
infected, through anonymous blood sampling, was similar to the rate of
infection among residents of Bucharest, Romania, where there was an
outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1996.
The survey involved 677 people who gave blood last fall at mobile health
vans parked in the northern Queens neighborhoods of Whitestone, Auburndale,
Linden Hill and Murray Hill. 19 of them tested positive for antibodies to
the West Nile virus. That led officials to estimate that 1.2 percent to 4.1
percent of the population in that three-square-mile section had been
infected.
John Gadd, a spokesman for the Health Department, said none of the 19
people who tested positive for the virus had become seriously ill,
reporting either no symptoms or mild illness, like a low-grade fever.
West Nile virus is endemic in Africa, the Middle East and western Asia and
has periodically emerged in Europe, but the outbreak in New York City and
its suburbs last summer was the first time it had struck the Western
Hemisphere. The results of the survey were announced as the city and other
towns and counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are bracing for
this year's mosquito season, which begins next month.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this
month that the disease would probably recur this year. Health officials in
many municipalities are planning programs to kill mosquito larvae before
they hatch, in an attempt to avoid a repetition of the aerial insecticide
spraying used to control adult mosquito populations last year.
