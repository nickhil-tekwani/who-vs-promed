17 workers were transported Wednesday (17 Jan 2018) to area hospitals, after falling ill at a meat packing plant in the Back of the Yards neighborhood.

Chicago officials responded to the Chicago Meat Authority, 1120 W 47th Pl., to a call for employees complaining of feeling dizzy, with some experiencing chest pain. Upon arrival officials found several workers suffering from breathing related issues. The incident looked to be related to a carbon dioxide leak caused from a malfunctioning fan.

According to CFD (Chicago Fire Department), when carbon dioxide mixes with water vapor, it turns into carbonic acid and can cause irritation.

Multiple ambulances were called to the scene around 8:45 a.m. Wednesday [17 Jan 2018]. The Chicago Fire Media tweeted there have been a total of 17 transports to area hospitals and one refusal. Eight of the transports were in good condition, 5 in fair-to-serious condition, and 4 in serious condition, according to CFD.

[Carbon dioxide, a colorless odorless gas at atmospheric temperatures and pressures, is relatively nontoxic and noncombustible. It is heavier than air and may asphyxiate by the displacement of air. It is also soluble in water. If a fan failed to work, then it may have allowed the carbon dioxide to build up. As it is colorless and odorless, the workers may not have noticed it until they started to feel ill from lack of oxygen.

At low concentrations, gaseous carbon dioxide appears to have little toxicological effect. At higher concentrations it leads to an increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and impaired consciousness. Concentrations greater than 10 percent may cause convulsions, coma and death.

Although the article does not specify what clinical signs the individuals had, it is likely many of the clinical signs mentioned in the paragraph above are reasons the affected individuals were transported to the hospital. Hopefully, all will recover.
