In the past few weeks, many hospitals have been seeing several cases of undiagnosed fever with patients showing symptoms similar to those of malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid. However, physicians are in a spot as the infectious diseases test results turn out to be negative, making it difficult for them to understand the ailment and prescribe medicines.

Doctors said the symptoms could not be brushed aside as common flu, as most antibiotics proved ineffective [sic, antibiotics are ineffective against viral illnesses], but said the disease was self-limiting. The fever takes a week to 10 days to disappear and has the patient running high temperature, cold, sore throat and body pain.

"It seems to target the gastric area, causing nausea and vomiting. This results in severe dehydration and weakness, and patients need to be admitted without delay for IV fluid administration," said a senior gastroenterologist at the GH, adding that he saw about 5 patients daily with symptoms of typhoid.

[The etiology of these cases has not been determined. Although some pathogens have apparently been ruled out, the limited information provided does not permit reasonable speculation concerning which agents might be involved in these cases. An earlier series of cases of undiagnosed febrile disease were reported in Tamil Nadu state in December 2012. No further reports indicating the etiology of the disease in that outbreak were received. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more details, and especially any additional laboratory results for the current outbreak, as they become available.
