West Nile Virus: First Human Case in Suffolk County, New York
-------------------------------------------------------------
HAUPPAUGE: Commissioner of Health Services, Clare B. Bradley, M.D., M.P.H.,
announced today that a 49-year-old female who resides in Nesconset has been
presumptively diagnosed with West Nile virus infection. The patient became
ill with symptoms of fever, stiff neck, headache and a rash on 23 Aug 2001
and was hospitalized on 27 Aug 2001. She was discharged from the hospital
on 31 Aug 2001, and is recovering.
The Nesconset area was sprayed to control the spread of West Nile virus on
9 Aug 2001 after the identification of the virus in bird and mosquito
specimens. Three (3) more pools of mosquitoes collected in Suffolk County
have also tested positive for West Nile virus. The mosquitoes were
collected on 21 and 22 Aug 2001 in Huntington, Lake Ronkonkoma and
Connetquot River State Park. This brings the total number of mosquito pools
that have tested positive for West Nile virus from Suffolk County in 2001
to 41. Mosquito counts continue to remain at low levels.
West Nile virus was also detected in three (3) more crows found in
Huntington, Lake Ronkonkoma and Shoreham, bringing the number of West Nile
virus-positive birds found in Suffolk County in 2001 to 164.
