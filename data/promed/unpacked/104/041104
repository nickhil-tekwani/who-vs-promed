Since the end of May 2005, an increase in the number of viral meningitis
cases has been observed, unevenly distributed throughout mainland France,
with the following regions affected the most: Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur
(south east France), Ile de France (Paris and surrounding area),
Rhone-Alpes (south east France), Midi-Pyrenees (south west France), et
Haute-Normandie (north west France) (1).
Information has been collected from virology laboratories participating in
the enterovirus surveillance network and, although biased, they do not
indicate an epidemic on the scale of the 2000 outbreak [illustrated by a
figure in the original text]. However, the increase in case numbers is
greater than that seen in 2001-2004.
Numbers peaked in week 27, and a decrease has been seen since then. [The
enteroviruses] identified were mainly echovirus 30, coxsackievirus group B
type 5, and to a lesser extent, echoviruses 13 and 6. At the beginning of
May (week 18), 11 per cent of samples tested by ligase chain reaction (LCR)
were positive for enterovirus, and this reached 60 per cent in week 29
(18-24 July).
The activity registered by the virology laboratories reflects only a small
part of the admissions to hospital emergency departments for viral
meningitis, as not all patients are sampled for enterovirus testing. In
Ile-de-France, admissions are monitored in 23 emergency departments. Weekly
admissions from 1 May to 24 Jul 2005 (weekly 18 to 29) for viral
meningitis: cases increased until week 26, then decreased [illustrated by a
figure in the original text].
A paper on the past 5 years of enterovirus surveillance in France will be
published in the Bulletin Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire in October 2005, and
a detailed report of the year 2005 is planned for publication in 2006
(<http://www.invs.sante.fr/beh/default.htm>).
Increases in incidence of echoviruses 13 and 30 in Europe were last
mentioned in Eurosurveillance in 2002 [2].

[Viral meningitis in childhood can be associated with infection by certain
enteroviruses or with mumps virus, whereas in adulthood other viruses such
as herpes simplex type 2 may be involved. Headache, neck rigidity, fever
and occasionally vomiting are indicative of viral meningitis. Illness
usually resolves quickly without serious consequence. Viral meningitis is
sometimes described as aseptic or lymphocytic meningitis due to the
predominance of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. The members of the
genus _Enterovirus_ (family _Picornaviridae_) associated with meningitis
include various echoviruses, the polioviruses, and A and B type
coxsackieviruses. The predominance of echovirus 30 and coxsackievirus B 5
in France in the current season may reflect the relative prevalence of
these enteroviruses in Northern Europe at the present time. - Mod.CP]
