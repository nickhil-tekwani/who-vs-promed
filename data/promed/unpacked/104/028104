Andalusia's provincial government confirms one case of bluetongue virus,
serotype 8, in a sheep farm in Tarifa
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Animal Health Services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have
identified the circulation of serotype 8 of bluetongue virus in an
extensive sheep ranch in the municipality of Tarifa (Cadiz). Nonetheless,
the Ministry has indicated that this situation is within the normal limits
because animals infected by bluetongue virus may still register in
vaccinated holdings.

[During 2010, BTV serotypes 1 and 4 were reported to continue their
circulation in Spain or were reintroduced (from Morocco). BTV-8 has not
been reported from Spain since 2009 (in 2008, 30 outbreaks; during 2009 --
one single outbreak). Its disappearance was attributed to mass
vaccinations. The alleged current identification of a (live-active?) BTV-8
virus in southern Spain, combined with its alleged absence in northern
parts of Spain as well as in Morocco, is puzzling; confirmation and
explanation are requested.

Subscribers may find interesting data in Spain's last presentation to EU's
SCOFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, UK),
"Updates 2009-2010 and Disease Future: Perspective in Spain", presented
during the meeting of 11-12 Oct in Brussels. The presentation is available
at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112102010_bt_spain.pdf>.
According to its data (see maps), no case of BTV-8 has been reported from
Cadiz earlier during 2010; Cadiz, Malaga, Huelva, and the southern part of
Sevilla are not included in the Spanish restricted BTV 1,8 area, which
covers all other territories north to Andalusia. - Mod.AS
