California health officials are investigating a bacterial outbreak after at least 93 people were sickened. An outbreak of shigellosis occurred at the Mariscos San Juan Restaurant on 4th Street in San Jose, California, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said. Individuals started to report symptoms including fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea last Saturday, 17 Oct 2015, health officials said. Currently, at least 24 of those sickened have been diagnosed with shigellosis, according to the health department.

The restaurant was closed on Sunday, 18 Oct 2015, and health department officials are asking anyone who has eaten at the restaurant and developed symptoms, including fever or sudden onset of diarrhea, to see a doctor immediately. No specific source of contamination has been identified, according to the health department.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said officials would be especially concerned about improper food handling or if the produce was contaminated with polluted water. "If produce comes in from the developing world, on occasion fresh produce has been irrigated or freshened with polluted water," he explained.

"This is serious business. It is a highly infectious agent," Schaffner said. "It usually takes very [few bacteria] to make people sick. ... That may account in part for the large number of [patients in] the outbreak."

Every year, 500 000 Americans are sickened with shigellosis, according to the CDC.

Mariscos San Juan Restaurant did not immediately respond to ABC News' calls seeking comment.

[From the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Bad Bug Book http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

Shigellosis accounts for less than 10 percent of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in this country. _Shigella_ rarely occurs in animals; principally, it is a disease of humans except for other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

Associated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers are the most common causes of contamination."

Clearly, unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_ (except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_, shigellosis is associated with food contaminated by human, not animal, feces. - Mod.LL
