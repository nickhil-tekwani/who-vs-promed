Different Cells Targeted by Avian and Human influenza Viruses
-------------------------------------------------
[The following abstract is reproduced from a paper published in the 30 Mar
2004 edition of PNAS. The data and conclusions are relevant to estimation
of the risk of generation of new pandemic strains of influenza virus in
East Asia and elsewhere where outbreaks of human and avian influenza have
occurred in proximity. In the past, it was believed that pandemic
influenza was most likely to result from reassortment of genome subunits
between avian and human influenza viruses, possibly as a result of
co-infection of an intermediate host. However, recently there have been
instances of direct infection of humans by avian influenza viruses of types
H5N1, H9N2, H7N7, and H7N3. Severe disease and fatalities have accompanied
the outbreaks of H5N1 infection in East Asia, whereas the disease
associated with the outbreaks of H9N2, H7N7, and H7N3 has generally been
mild. Person-to-person transmission of disease has been absent or dubious.
It is clear that the evolution of a novel pandemic influenza virus remains
a rare event, and that several restrictions have to be overcome before a
virulent and transmissible virus makes its appearance. The following
abstract defines one of these restrictions.
The paper is entitled: "Human and avian influenza viruses target different
cell types in cultures of human airway epithelium", and the authors are
Mikhail N. Matrosovich, Tatyana Y. Matrosovich, Thomas Gray, Noel A.
Roberts, and Hans-Dieter Klenk.

"The recent human infections caused by H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 avian influenza
viruses highlighted the continuous threat of new pathogenic influenza
viruses emerging from a natural reservoir in birds. It is generally
believed that replication of avian influenza viruses in humans is
restricted by a poor fit of these viruses to cellular receptors and
extracellular inhibitors in the human respiratory tract. However, detailed
mechanisms of this restriction remain obscure. Using cultures of
differentiated human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated that
influenza viruses enter the airway epithelium through specific target cells
and that there were striking differences in this respect between human and
avian viruses. During the course of a single-cycle infection, human viruses
preferentially infected non-ciliated cells, whereas avian viruses, as well
as the egg-adapted human virus variant with an avian virus-like receptor
specificity, mainly infected ciliated cells. This pattern correlated with
the predominant localization of receptors for human viruses (2-6-linked
sialic acids) on non-ciliated cells and of receptors for avian viruses
(2-3-linked sialic acids) on ciliated cells. These findings suggest that
although avian influenza viruses can infect human airway epithelium, their
replication may be limited by a non-optimal cellular tropism. Our data
throw light on the mechanisms of generation of pandemic viruses from their
avian progenitors and open avenues for cell level-oriented studies on the
replication and pathogenicity of influenza virus in humans."
