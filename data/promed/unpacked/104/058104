Fast-acting Ebola Vaccine Protects Monkeys
------------------------------------------
A single shot of a fast-acting, experimental Ebola vaccine successfully
protects monkeys from the deadly virus after only one month. If this
vaccine proves similarly effective in humans, it may one day allow
scientists to quickly contain Ebola outbreaks with ring vaccination -- the
same strategy successfully used in the past against smallpox, according to
a study published in this week's issue of Nature.
This finding is the result of collaboration between scientists at the Dale
and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC), part of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and scientists at the
United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
(USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, MD. "This research has enormous public health
implications not only because it might be used to limit the spread of Ebola
virus, which continues to emerge in central Africa, but also because this
vaccine strategy may be applied to other highly lethal viruses, such as
Marburg virus, Lassa fever virus, and the SARS coronavirus, that cause
acute disease outbreaks and require a rapid response," says NIAID Director
Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.
Under the directorship of Gary Nabel, M.D., Ph.D., scientists at the VRC
have been pursuing the so-called "prime-boost" vaccine strategy against a
variety of infectious diseases. Prime-boost is a 2-part process: First, an
injection of non-infectious genetic material from the disease-causing
microbe primes the immune system to respond. Second, several weeks later,
an injection of attenuated carrier viruses containing key genes from the
microbe substantially boosts the immune response.
The VRC scientists found that the boost alone produces a quicker but weaker
immune response as compared with the prime-boost strategy. Knowing that
time is critical when fighting Ebola, the scientists decided to test
whether the boost's fast response was strong enough on its own to protect
against the disease. To perform this test, they collaborated with
colleagues at USAMRIID, who had the necessary facilities and expertise and
who had developed good animal models for the experiment.
The VRC scientists immunized 8 monkeys with a single boost injection,
consisting of attenuated carrier viruses containing genes for important
Ebola antigens. The monkeys were then delivered to USAMRIID, where they
were injected with an Ebola virus strain obtained from a fatally infected
person from the former Zaire in 1995. The single vaccine injection
completely protected all 8 animals against Ebola infection, even those who
received high doses of the virus.
"I am proud that our research team at USAMRIID was able to form an
effective partnership with our colleagues at NIAID to develop and evaluate
this Ebola vaccine," comments Peter B. Jahrling, Ph.D., senior research
scientist at USAMRIID. "After years of developing candidate Ebola vaccines
that protected rodents but failed in primates, it is gratifying to have a
vaccine that holds great promise for protection of humans. Eventually, this
vaccine may reduce the hazard of working with Ebola virus in the
laboratory, as well as provide protection to populations at risk of natural
exposure."
Ebola virus spreads easily from person to person, causes illness quickly,
and kills a significant number of the people it infects. There is no
treatment for the disease, so preventing the spread of the virus is key to
containing outbreaks. If the results of this animal study hold true for
humans, the new vaccine may be just the Ebola-fighting tool that public
health officials need during epidemic outbreaks, Dr. Nabel explains.
"Ring vaccination might be used to stop the spread of the Ebola virus
during acute outbreaks, just as this strategy was used to contain smallpox
in the past," Dr. Nabel says. With ring vaccination, everyone who has been
in contact with a patient, as well as all members of the patient's
household, are vaccinated. The ring strategy, which requires a fast-acting
vaccine, not only protects people who may have been exposed to the virus
but also creates an added barrier of immunity around them, thereby
protecting the entire community.
Even though the boost alone appears to be effective, the prime-boost
strategy, which requires 4 shots over 6 months, will still be important to
pursue as well, Dr. Nabel says. "The prime-boost strategy elicits a
stronger immune response," he explains, "and it may be useful for
preventive vaccines intended for hospital workers at high risk of exposure
to the virus, for example."

Haemorrhagic Fever In Non-human Primates, by Nancy J. Sullivan, Thomas W.

The abstract of the paper reads as follows:
"Containment of highly lethal Ebola virus outbreaks poses a serious public
health challenge. Although an experimental vaccine has successfully
protected non-human primates against disease, more than 6 months was
required to complete the immunizations, making it impractical to limit an
acute epidemic. Here, we report the development of accelerated vaccination
against Ebola virus in non-human primates. The antibody response to
immunization with an adenoviral (ADV) vector encoding the Ebola
glycoprotein (GP) was induced more rapidly than with DNA priming and ADV
boosting, but it was of lower magnitude. To determine whether this earlier
immune response could nonetheless protect against disease, cynomolgus
macaques were challenged with Ebola virus after vaccination with ADVGP and
nucleoprotein (NP) vectors. Protection was highly effective and correlated
with the generation of Ebola-specific CD8+ T-cell and antibody responses.
Even when animals were immunized once with ADVGP/NP and challenged 28 days
later, they remained resistant to challenge with either low or high doses
of virus. This accelerated vaccine provides an intervention that may help
to limit the epidemic spread of Ebola, and is applicable to other viruses."
