The latest testing at the Prospect filtration plant on Friday night found
the water was clear of giardia and cryptosporidium. But the expert panel
managing the crisis will not clear the city's tap water for drinking until
three consecutive tests in 36 hours show the water to be clear. The tests
were clear on Thursday night but crypto was detected at the plant on Friday
morning.
Authorities believe it will be difficult to obtain three clear test results
in a row until late this week after cleaning has been completed at the
Prospect plant.
Health Department chief health officer Dr Andrew Wilson said the expert
panel would be "very cautious" about lifting the water-boil alert: "We
don't want to stop and start these things." He said health officials feared
Sydneysiders were becoming complacent about boiling their water as the
contamination crisis entered its second week.
Dr Wilson played down speculation that what appeared to be the
cryptosporidia and giardia could in fact be nothing more than harmless
algae. "I am very concerned about that. The best evidence available to me
is that this is Cryptosporidium that we are seeing in the water," he said.
"Based on the information we have, we don't believe it is algae. It's very
difficult for Sydneysiders. They are getting mixed advice about what's
going on, they are looking to see if there is any illness around. We have
to keep up the boiled water alert."
Yesterday international experts called in to help solve Sydney's water
crisis were tight-lipped about their progress. A spokeswoman for Planning
Minister Craig Knowles said: "At the moment they are examining and
analysing the records of this plant so they actually haven't formed any
conclusions."
The latest testing also reveals extremely high levels of cryptosporidia
remain at the Warragamba plant, which only serves the Warragamba township.

[The algal dimension was discussed by another Australian journalist who
claimed:
that ... experts disagreed today over whether microscopic bugs that have
infested Sydney's water supply for the second time in a month are harmless
algae or dangerous parasites.
Dr. Jerry Ongerth of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University
of New South Wales questions the results of tests that have concluded the
city's tap water was highly contaminated. Ongerth said the tests seemed to
exaggerate the problem, claiming the water was as contaminated as raw
sewage, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Such results, he said, were
"not believable at face value." He is quoted as saying his own tests showed
the water contained different types of harmless algae that look very
similar to giardia and cryptosporidia.
Sydney Water today rejected Ongerth's analysis, saying its researchers are
confident the water contained the harmful parasites. "We're certainly aware
of incidents in the past with some dispute over algae cells," Sydney Water
spokesman Rod Metcalfe said.
However, there has been no statistically significant increase in illness
during the two recent outbreaks in Sydney.
An inquiry, assisted by water experts from the United States, is underway
to determine the source of the outbreak. Authorities have blamed heavy
rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent weeks.
