With reference to the ProMED-mail comments on WNV in Japan, moderator MS
stated that "West Nile virus in Asia seems to be restricted to Western Asia,
such as the Indian subcontinent". I seem to recall that WNV has been isolated
from vast areas of Russia (reported in ProMED), including the far-eastern
coast of Russia, i.e., not that far from Japan. Moreover, there is plenty of
serological evidence for the presence of WNV in southeast Asia, and of course
Kunjin virus (the Australian word for West Nile virus!) is known to circulate
in Australia.
Therefore, whilst the Japanese human case probably was an imported one from
North America, WNV could be introduced into Japan through infected birds from
Asia/Australasia if immunity to JEV doesn't prevent it.

[ProMED is grateful to Professor Gould for his reminder of the geographical
coverage of WNV prevalence that has been reported in ProMED (see archive
number: 20050124.0260). The report described that WNV was detected in frozen
samples from dead birds, including 4 positive samples from cinereous vultures
(_Aegypius monachus_), 2 positive samples from the cattle egret (_Bubulcus
ibis_), 4 positive samples from other species of birds (_Ixobrychus
eurhytmus_, _Pica pica_, _Corvus macrorhynchos_, _Falco tunnuncules_),
collected in the Far Eastern Region of Russia during 2003-2004, by means of
ELISA and RT-PCR.
These results confirm that WNV is indeed circulating in the Far Eastern region
of Russia. It is well understood that migratory birds can travel long
distances. I am interested in soliciting further expert information pertaining
to the transmission cycle of WNV between birds and mosquitoes in this
particular region (Far Eastern Asia, South East Asia, and Australia). - Mod.RY]
[In the Seventh Report of the ICTV (published in 2000), West Nile virus is
included as a distinct virus species in the Japanese encephalitis virus (sero)
group and Kunjin virus is ranked as a strain of West Nile virus. An 8th Report
has been published in August of this year [2005], but I haven't received my
copy yet. I do not think that the status of Kunjin virus will have been
changed. - Mod.CP]
