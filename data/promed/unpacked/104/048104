West Nile Virus Found in Georgia Bird
-------------------------------------
A crow infected with West Nile virus was found in Lowndes County, Georgia.
This bird was found by a citizen on Fri 6 Jul and died on Sat 7 Jul 2001.
The infection was confirmed today by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention laboratory. This discovery is not unexpected, since Lowndes
County is near Jefferson County, Florida where another infected crow was
discovered in June [2001. No West Nile virus infections in humans have
been identified in Georgia.
The Georgia Public Health Laboratory provides testing for hospitalized
patients with encephalitis. Physicians may arrange for testing by calling
the Notifiable Disease Section of the Georgia Department of Human
Resources, Division of Public Health at 404-657-2588.
Many birds infected with West Nile virus die, so public health officials
are using dead bird reports as one way to watch for the virus. People who
find dead birds in their yard should report them to their county health
department. The reports will be used to map bird deaths throughout Georgia.
Some of the reported birds will also be collected by health authorities and
tested for West Nile virus. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test all
reported birds.
Kathleen E. Toomey, M.D., M.P.H., Director of the Georgia Department of
Human Resources, Division of Public Health, recommends the following
actions to reduce the risk of acquiring a mosquito-transmitted disease:
- Minimize outdoor activities between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are
most active;
- Wear long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and shoes and socks, and use
mosquito repellent on exposed skin when you go outdoors while mosquitoes
are present;
- Keep mosquitoes from entering your home by repairing screens on windows,
doors, patios, and porches;
- Because mosquitoes require stagnant water to breed, eliminate standing
water around your home by disposing of old cans, barrels, tires, or other
objects that can collect surface water. Store wheelbarrows and boats upside
down (or cover them), and empty pet watering dishes, birdbaths, pools, and
ornamental ponds at least once a week.
"The most effective action we can take against West Nile virus -- or any
other disease transmitted by mosquito bites -- is to reduce standing water
where mosquitoes breed," says Dr. Toomey, "Also, make sure that you and
your children use mosquito repellent on exposed skin and spray it on
clothing when you go outdoors during times when mosquitoes are active."
For more information about mosquito control around your home or to report a
dead bird, call your county health department. For more information about

[This is the first report of West Nile virus from Georgia. So far this year
West Nile virus-positive birds have been reported from Connecticut,
Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. In the preceding
year West Nile virus-positive test results were reported from 12 states
(Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
Virginia) plus the District of Columbia. The appearance of West Nile virus
in Georgia and Florida leaves Maine and South Carolina as the only eastern
seaboard states that have not so far reported the presence of West Nile
virus. - Mod.CP
