In the context of the work of epidemiological investigation and ongoing follow-up carried out by the Ministry of Health for the MERS-CoV, the Ministry announces the confirmation of 7 new cases of MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah.

The 1st is a 72-year-old male citizen who has passed away.
The 2nd is a 70-year-old male citizen receiving intensive care treatment.
The 3rd is a 60-year-old male citizen receiving intensive care treatment.
The 4th is a 54-year-old male resident healthcare worker who is in stable condition.
The 5th is a 63-year-old citizen in stable condition.
The 6th is a 40-year-old "for citizenship" [applying for citizenship?] in stable condition.
The 7th is a 31-year-old resident in stable condition.

180 samples have been checked, and all but the above 7 were negative.

[This now brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 212 including 72 deaths (case fatality rate 34 percent) and brings the total number of cases in Jeddah confirmed since mid-March 2013 to 44 including 8 deaths (case fatality rate in the Jeddah outbreak 18 percent).

On [17 Apr 2014], the Ministries of Health of Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported an additional 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The following details were provided to WHO by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia on [17 Apr 2014]:

- The patient is a 54-year-old man with underlying health conditions. He travelled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with a pilgrimage group of 18 people from [15 to 28 Mar 2014] and became ill on [4 Apr 2014]. He sought treatment in a private clinic in Johor, Malaysia on [7 Apr 2014] and went to a hospital on [9 Apr 2014]. The patient died on [13 Apr 2014]. The patient visited a camel farm on [26 Mar 2014], during which he consumed camel milk.

This is the 1st case with MERS-CoV infection in the country. The Ministry of Health reported that so far no human-to-human transmission has been observed amongst close contacts and in health-care facilities in Malaysia.

The following details were provided to WHO by the Ministry of Health, UAE on 17 Apr 2014:
- A cluster of 4 health-care workers were identified through screening of contacts of a previously laboratory-confirmed case from Abu Dhabi who died on [10 Apr 2014]. These include:

- A 44-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened on [13 Apr 2014]. He had no illness and is reported to have no underlying medical condition.
- A 30-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened on [13 Apr 2014]. He had no illness and is reported to have no underlying medical condition.
- A 34-year-old man from the Philippines who resides in Abu Dhabi. He was screened on [13 Apr 2014] without any illness and is reported not to have any underlying medical condition.
- A 28-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who became ill on [14 Apr 2014]. He is reported to have no underlying medical condition.

All the above mentioned cases are known to have exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case. They have no reported history of recent travel and no contact with animals. Three cases are in isolation in a hospital and are in a stable condition. One case returned to his home country, although he was advised not to before the laboratory results were received. Screening of other health care contacts and of family members is ongoing.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 243 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths.

[The global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV continues to increase on a daily basis. According to today's (17 Apr 2014) report, there are now 243 cases including 93 deaths (case fatality rate 38.3 percent). These tallies do not include a number of the cases reported on the Saudi MOH website over the recent past, so one should expect to see continued increases in the numbers of cases.

Watching the "progression" in the MERS-CoV transmission and identification of cases, the initial cases identified tended to have overwhelmingly more serious clinical presentations, with an observed earlier high case fatality rate (well over 60 percent). To date, the earliest documented MERS-CoV cases occurred in Jordan in 2012. Throughout 2013, there were periodic reports of cases and then nosocomial transmission associated outbreak(s) in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This year (2014), there has been increased reporting of cases and now 2 nosocomial transmission associated outbreaks that are ongoing, one in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and another in Abu Dhabi, UAE. So, it appears as though, to date, our evidence is pointing to an early nosocomial outbreak, followed by sporadic cases (exact transmission speculated to be possibly linked to contact with infected camels) over several months, followed by significant outbreak(s) involving nosocomial transmission, continued sporadic cases, and now 2 ongoing outbreaks with nosocomial transmission.

Reflecting back on the SARS outbreak, while retrospective studies did identify sporadic cases dating back to November 2002 in Guangdong Province of China, recognition of outbreak(s) in Guangdong occurred after/during an outbreak associated with nosocomial transmission, followed by an apparent "lull" and then clusters of transmission globally related to a "super spreader" who himself had been infected through nosocomial transmission. This sequence of events occurred over the course of 4 months, significantly shorter than presently observed with the MERS-CoV, food for thought regarding similarities and differences between the 2 viruses and for the possibility of perhaps longer "under the radar" transmission of the SARS-CoV before it was identified.

The epidemiologic information provided on the case reported by Malaysia mentions that the case had direct contact with camels and specifically mentions that the case had ingested camel milk. It would be interesting to see whether the virus can be identified in the camel's milk at the farm where the case was known to have visited. It might well provide additional information as to possible routes of transmission of the MERS-CoV to humans.

The number of health care workers with MERS-CoV infection associated with contact with a single infected individual in the UAE does raise the query as to whether that individual would classify as a "super spreader," having attended a social function when already clinically ill.

Human nature plays a significant role in the transmission of diseases. In the above report, the discussions show how easily microbial organisms can travel worldwide, and simple requests for behavioral modification that might reduce transmission or serious disease can be overlooked. In the case of the Malaysian travelling to Saudi Arabia, public health notices have focused on getting individuals with potential high risk pre-disposing illness to avoid making the pilgrimage this year (2014), especially while the body of knowledge surrounding MERS-CoV transmission still has significant holes. Messages also recommend that individuals should avoid contact with camels. In the case of the Filipino nurse, the individual knew he had had direct contact with a known laboratory confirmed fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and was requested not to travel until results of testing were back. Yes, we do live in a global village, and microbial organisms thrive on their ability to hitch rides to new locations and expand their geographic reach.

[3] Malaysia, contact tracing and quarantine

As many as 64 residents in Kampung Bintang in Johor will be quarantined for a week after some showed symptoms of the MERS-CoV.

Some 100 villagers from the village where the 1st Malaysian victim who succumbed to the virus came from underwent a special screening to detect the virus here on Thursday [17 Apr 2014].

Johor Health and Environment executive committee chairman Datuk Ayub Rahmat said a special centre has been set up in the village to screen the villagers for the virus.

"This is the 1st such case in Malaysia, and we take this matter seriously. That is why we are taking steps to screen the villagers to prevent the virus from spreading," he said at a press conference.

[We await further information on results of testing of contacts in Malaysia prior to concluding that there has been spread of the MERS-CoV locally. More information on the results of the contact tracing would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
