Hundreds of pigs have died in this city and surrounding in the past few
days due to a swine fever, severely affecting the sale of pork.
State veterinary department officials said that the [deaths were] caused by
the swine fever that had occasionally struck state during the past years
and it had nothing to do with bird flu.
Saingura Sailo, joint director of the AH and Veterinary department said
that the swine were infected by the fever mainly due to the fact that the
owners failed to vaccinate them.
Shortage of vaccination drugs was the main concern, according to Veterinary
minister Lalrinchhana, who informed the state assembly that 10 000 vaccine
[doses] were arriving from Guwahati.
In another alarming incident, hundreds of chickens died in Mizoram-Myanmar
border Cherhlun village during the past 3 months, causing panic that it
might be caused by Avian Influenza.
The veterinary doctors, however, said that the chickens were killed by
rodent poison used by the villagers to prevent the population explosion of
rats always triggered off by gregarious flowering of bamboo, locally known
as 'Mautam' which had begun this year.

[Mizoram state (2001 provisional pop. 891 058), c. 8000 sq mi (20 720 sq
km), NE India, in the Mizo Hills, is bordered on the east and south by
Myanmar, on the west by Bangladesh and Tripura, on the northeast by
Manipur, and on the north by Assam. The capital is Aizawl. Mizoram is
governed by a chief minister and a cabinet responsible to a unicameral
elected legislature and by a governor appointed by the president of India
(Information from Columbia University Press). See map at

While clinical diagnosis of Classic swine fever is generally feasible
(though laboratory confirmation desirable), ruling out avian influenza
should be based upon laboratory investigations. The course of the disease
(in some cases peracute) and the gross pathology changes might lead to
confusion with other conditions and aetiological factors, toxicological
agents included. For some recent clinical observations, see "HPAI (H5N1),
1st Outbreak In A Broiler Flock In Israel" in 20060322.0892. - Mod.AS]
