A death of a rabid cow in Khothiline village in Pasakha has sent the
residents of Pasakha to Phuentsholing hospital in droves for
anti-rabies vaccination.

The rabid cow belonging to a farmer in Khothiline village in Pasakha
died on 19 Aug 2010. Since then, the Pasakha residents who have
consumed milk and other products from the cow have been rushing to
Phuentsholing hospital to get vaccinated against rabies.

"I came to get my children vaccinated against rabies. They have
consumed milk from the cow in Khotiline that had died of rabies,"
said Surjaman Rai, a local resident, in Pasakha.

90 people including children received anti-rabies vaccination today
[31 Aug 2010] alone. So far, the hospital has administered
anti-rabies vaccine to 197 people.

This morning [31 Aug 2010], the hospital ran out of its anti-rabies
vaccine stock and had to get 200 doses of vaccines from the Medical
Supply Depot.

Meanwhile, a calf was found dead near Dhoti River Bridge in
Phuentsholing last Wednesday [25 Aug 2010]. Over in Peljoring village
under Sipsoo Geog in Samtse, a heifer has died of rabies. The rapid
tests conducted at Samtse District Veterinary Laboratory and
Satellite Veterinary laboratory in Phuentshoilng confirmed that the
animals died of rabies. Further tests carried out at the National
Centre for Animal Health in Serbithang, Thimphu also showed the
animals died of rabies.

Veterinary and livestock officials say the sporadic rabies outbreak
is under control. However, the people in the affected areas are being
advised to remain vigilant.

[CDC's website
<http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/news/2005-12-23.html> includes
the following commentary:

"There are no published studies that have demonstrated the presence
of rabies virus in cows' milk. Although transmission of rabies virus
from consuming unpasteurized milk from an infected animal is
theoretically possible, no human has ever been reported to develop
rabies via this route. Milk that has been heat pasteurized presents
no risk for rabies virus transmission."

The rabies vaccine has been applied, in the current case, more as an
anti-hysteria medication than as a truly required post-exposure
treatment. The only people who might have been exposed to the rabies
virus were those who handled the rabid cows, or participated in their
possible slaughtering if this, indeed, took place.

Rabies is endemic in Bhutan, affecting animal vectors such as dogs as
well as dead-end farm animals. During 2009, 10 outbreaks were
reported, cases confirmed in 8 canines, 16 bovines, 2 each in
caprines and porcines. Four cases were reported in humans. - Mod.AS]
