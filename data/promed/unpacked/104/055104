For years, researchers have kept deer with chronic wasting disease in the
same
pens with healthy cattle and have not found one case in which the disease
has
jumped species. Those involved in the studies acknowledge they do not fully
understand CWD's potential to spread, but they are encouraged by what they
have
seen so far.
"The good news today is that there is no evidence that CWD can be contracted
by
any other species than deer or elk" in a natural setting, said Gary Wolfe,
project leader for the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance, a Montana-based
group
of 8 organizations formed earlier this year to disseminate scientific
information about the disease.
Experts from the alliance are at the epicenter of chronic wasting disease
research. They include Beth Williams, a professor of veterinary science at
the
University of Wyoming in Laramie. She first identified chronic wasting
disease
as a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in 1978.
This month, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists in Ames, Iowa, are
injecting brain tissue from whitetail deer with chronic wasting disease into
cattle to answer 2 questions: How easily will the disease cross species in
controlled conditions and if it does, what form does the infection take?
Janice Miller, a veterinarian in charge of the experiment, said she believes
previous research shows it is hard for the disease to be transmitted
naturally
from whitetail deer to dairy cattle. "Our study says nothing of how it could
be
transmitted in natural surroundings," she said.
Miller has been studying the transmission of CWD from mule deer to cattle
since
1997. Since then, chronic wasting disease was transmitted to 4 out of 13
cattle
injected with brain tissue from naturally infected mule deer, she said.
In Wyoming, Williams has been studying cattle that were given a concoction
of
diseased brain tissue orally, and 5 years into the study the animals remain
healthy, Miller said.
No one knows if chronic wasting disease could ever spread to another species
through natural surroundings. "Our experience is that it's pretty hard to
predict," Miller said. "But experiments are showing that it's pretty low
risk."
How chronic wasting disease is transmitted, within a species and to others,
is
one of many unanswered questions, said Kerry Beheler, a wildlife biologist
with
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Scientists are working to
find
the answers, she said. "The more we know," Beheler said, "the more we can
manage and eliminate the disease."

[The absence of transmission -- so far -- in Beth Williams' oral challenge
trial is promising news, though optimism might be still premature. Genetic
profiling might be another issue to tackle. TSE's -- rightly -- maintain
their
established image as very prolific providers of research subjects. - Mod.AS]
