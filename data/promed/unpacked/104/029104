----------------------------------------------------------------------
England and Wales
-----------------
288 [human, we suppose] cases were reported through laboratory testing during 1989 to 2002, with decreasing incidence since the 1990's (see graph at http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/EW-Toxocara.bmp)

The annual disease rate [in humans, we suppose] is estimated at 0.2 per 100 000

Prevalence surveys:
16 percent of healthy kittens (2009 publication)
2 percent to 4 percent of dogs associated with a charity for deaf persons. (2007 publication)
1.4 percent of dogs with gastrointestinal disease (2003 to 2005)
25 percent of dog hair samples (2003 publication)
55.9 percent to 61.6 percent of foxes (2003 publication)
6.3 of soil samples from London parks and gardens (1991 publication)
91 percent of farm cats (1989)
66 percent of London parks (1984 to 1985)
53.3 percent of feral cats in London and Sheffield (1981 publication)
11.5 percent of domestic cats in London (1981 publication)
34.8 percent of stray urban cats (1978 to 1980)
7.2 percent of suburban dogs (1977 publication)
13.3 percent of soil samples in Leeds (1976)
5.2 percent of public parks and private gardens in London (1975)

Seroprevalence surveys:
47 percent of cull ewes in Powys and Gwent (2006 publication)
7 percent to 47 percent of sheep in Wales (2006 publication)
2.0 percent to 2.6 percent; 15.7 percent of dog breeders (1978)

Scotland
--------
The reported incidence of toxocariasis varies from 0 to 4 cases per year (1992 to 2012).

Prevalence surveys:
12 percent of parks in Glasgow (1980)
33 percent of stray cats (1980)
20.9 percent of stray dogs in Glasgow (1975 to 1977)

_Toxocara cati_ has also been identified in wild cats in northeastern Scotland.

Northern Ireland
----------------
Although no cases of toxocariasis were reported during 2001 to 2012, the disease is relatively common among both humans and animals in neighboring Republic of Ireland.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for sending us this summary of the different studies of toxocariasis in animals and environment. Even though the infection is common in dogs and cats and in the environment, human cases are rarely reported. Even if exposed to _Toxocara_ eggs the risk of infection is probably low, but the disease is most probably underreported. - Mod.EP
