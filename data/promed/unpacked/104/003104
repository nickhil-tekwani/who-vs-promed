According to Police, a man was bitten by a fox [Sun 8 Jul 2018] in Robertsdale. Officers were called to a home on Mattingly Street around 1 pm. The victim said he was sitting on his porch when a fox bit his foot. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.

About 2 hours later, police were called to East Chicago Street where a group of people said a fox was charging at them. Officers were able to capture the fox. It will be tested for rabies tomorrow.

Robertsdale Police Department posted the following statement on its Facebook page: "The Robertsdale Police Department urges citizens to report any animals which are behaving in a manner which raises alarm. If any wild animal approaches a person, that person should take protective measures and leave the area, or seek shelter if the animal is aggressive, and notify the City."

The incident is the latest in a series of fox attacks in Baldwin County. The first 2 attacks occurred at the Rock Creek golf course in Fairhope in May [2018]. A golfer and grounds crew member were bitten by the fox. That animal was killed and tested positive for rabies.

The next 2 attacks were reported in Spanish Fort Estates. In one attack, a fox bit a man while he was working in his yard. The next victim was a Jack Russell Terrier who was attacked in her owner's backyard.

And in June [2018], a wildlife trapper was bitten by a rabid fox as he attempted to catch the animal in Fairhope. The man was wearing protective boots and was not injured.

[If confirmed, this is the 6th case of fox rabies in Balwin County in the past few months. For a map of wildlife rabies in the US, go to: https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/wild_animals.html.

Baldwin County is the largest county in Alabama by area and is located on the eastern side of Mobile Bay. Part of its western border with Mobile County is formed by the Spanish River, a brackish distributary river. See, Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama.

There is a plethora of recent rabies reports:

It would be very wise if dog and cat owners, especially in SE Alabama, checked the rabies vaccination status of their domestic pets. Ditto clinical veterinarians and wildlife officers. It won't be long before you yourself are exposed. - Mod.MHJ
