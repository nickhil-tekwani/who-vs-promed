Regarding the report, it is mentioned that vaccination of the
population is being conducted, but to my knowledge no such vaccine
exists, or am I mistaken?

[The vaccine mentioned may be the LVS strain discussed below.
The following discussion is taken from "Developing New Tularemia
Vaccines", written by Mary Beth Nierengarten and myself, Larry I.
Lutwick, in Medscape Infectious Diseases
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/431539>. (Unfortunately, the
references are not given in this URL).
At present, a "live vaccine strain" (LVS) tularemia vaccine is under
Investigational New Drug (IND) status in a protocol at the US Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort
Detrick, Maryland, and is available only for at-risk U.S. military
personnel. It is administered by scarification (that is, use of a
bifurcated needle to produce multiple inoculations in the skin,
similar to vaccinia inoculation for smallpox).
The availability of this vaccine in the USA for use beyond selected
at-risk groups has been hampered by several obstacles. According to
Colonel David L. Danley, Project Manager, Joint Vaccine Acquisition
Program (JVAP) at Fort Detrick, data now required for licensure were
not adequately documented during its development, prohibiting plans
to license the current vaccine. Because the "old method of growth
using shaker culture does not meet current good manufacturing
processes required for FDA licensure," the manufacturing processes
and potency of the current LVS vaccine are being re-evaluated, and "a
new process using fermentation technology will be used," explained
David T. Dennis, MD, MPH, Chief, Bacterial Zoonoses Branch, Centers
for Disease Control (CDC).
Despite the increased risk of a bioweapons threat felt after
"September 11th", further vaccine development for tularemia remains
slow. The projected date of a new licensed vaccine in the USA is not
until 2009.
The current LVS vaccine is based on research that goes back to the
1960s. It is a descendant of strain 15 developed by the former Soviet
Union's Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Gamalcia
Institute, in Moscow, and sold to the US military in 1956 (10). In
the early 1960s, USAMRIID had isolated the LVS strain for preventive
use in at-risk US military personnel (11,12). Efficacy studies in
civilian laboratory employees at Fort Detrick revealed that the
vaccine was safe and significantly reduced the incidence of typhoidal
tularemia from 5.70 to 0.27 cases per 1000 at-risk employee-years
(13). Although the incidence of ulceroglandular tularemia was
unchanged by the vaccines, the disease was found to be milder in the
vaccine cohort. Worldwide, LVS has since been used as seed stock for
tularemia vaccines (12).
Several limitations of the current LVS tularemia vaccine indicate a
need to move forward on developing an improved vaccine. One
limitation is the current mode of administration, which requires
scarification that is both cumbersome and difficult to standardize.
Further limitations deal with gaps in understanding the factors
responsible for the virulence and genetic stability of _Francisella
tularensis_, as well as which antigens are needed to produce an
effective cell-mediated immunity. Current research shows that only
one of the 2 phenotypes of LVS, the blue colony type, appears to be
immunogenic (11,12).
A 2nd limitation is confusion over which arm of the immune system
should be targeted. Although it has been thought that the humoral
immune response is not important in protection against tularemia, a
relatively recent report from the Fort Detrick group has suggested
that this may not be the case (14). Pooled sera from humans immunized
with LVS were found to fully protect mice against a large lethal
challenge of LVS organisms. New lots of LVS produced in the USA
clearly show immunogenicity in human volunteers, producing both brisk
cell-mediated and humoral immune responses (15). In the future,
techniques to optimize the appropriate humoral response may be available.
New generation tularemia vaccines
---------------------------------
Strategies for development of a new generation of vaccines include
identification of individual components of _F. tularensis_, such as
the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or various other outer surface proteins,
as potential vaccine components (either native or recombinant). After
identification, these components would then be used as immunogens,
instead of using the entire organism. In laboratory studies, some of
these cell components have been tested and found to have variable
protection in mice.
For instance, one of the membrane proteins of the _F. tularensis_
that has been studied as a potential immunogen is a 17-kilodalton
lipoprotein, TUL4. The gene for this antigen has been cloned into a
_Salmonella typhimurium_ mutant (16). In mice immunized with this
recombinant vector, both humoral and cell-mediated immune response to
the antigen developed, and mice were protected from an LVS challenge.
The development of monoclonal antibodies for use as passively
protective agents is another possible strategy for new vaccine
development, according to Dr. Dennis of the CDC.
A number of investigators are conducting basic research into
tularemia, particularly molecular and sequencing studies aimed at
identifying proteins and antigens for use as vaccine candidates. Most
of this research is being conducted at military research
institutions, including USAMRIID.
As one would expect, since "September 11th", information on
manufacturers actively working on a new vaccine is scarce. In the
USA, DynPort Vaccine Company LLC was awarded a contract to develop,
manufacture, test, and license an LVS vaccine from the current
vaccine material, according to both Dr. Dennis and Col. Danley at
Fort Detrick. DynPort has been under contract to the USA Department
of Defense's (DoD's) JVAP since 1997 and acts as its executive arm,
says Terry Irgens, President of DynPort. Basic researchers from
institutes such as USAMRIID work closely with DynPort, which employs
over 100 scientists, physicians, and veterinarians to conduct
preclinical and clinical testing of vaccines. Production and
licensure are also managed by DynPort, whose contract with JVAP was
recently extended to 2012. A proposed licensure date is June 2009, as
previously mentioned (17).
Internationally, several efforts are under way to develop new
tularemia vaccines, but with similar limited information on
manufacture and licensure dates. In the UK, 2 approaches to a new
vaccine, use of defined attenuated mutants and a subunit vaccine, are
in their earliest stages and are not anticipated for licensure in the
UK for more than a decade, says Col. Danley.
Other development efforts are being conducted in Sweden at the
National Defense Research Establishment, University of Umea, which
recently received a 5-year grant from the US National Institutes of
Health to develop a subunit vaccine against aerosolized forms of _F.
tularensis_. In collaboration with Canadian researchers, under the
direction of Dr. Wayne Conlan, Medical Research Council, Ottawa,
Canada, the grant will also compare the efficacy of these candidate
vaccines to those of attenuated vaccines, said Dr. Anders Sjostedt,
who heads the research group at Umea University.
In Moscow, a project is under way at the Institute of Immunological
Engineering to develop a chemical tularemia vaccine based on
preparations of outer-membrane components of _F. tularensis_. This
group is also working on a project to develop a molecular vaccine
based on LPS-protein complexes. (18) - Mod.LL]
