An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier who was being sought by authorities after bringing a rabies infected puppy to a veterinary clinic, checked in at a Health Ministry regional office along with 7 of his comrades after reports he was being searched for.

One of the group has already been tested for the deadly virus [see comment] and the rest will be tested later on Tuesday [10 Sep 2013], Ynet reported. None of the soldiers appeared to show any symptoms of rabies.

The Health Ministry and the IDF desperately searched for the soldier throughout Monday [9 Sep 2013] amid concerns that he may have been exposed to rabies and could have been infected by the virus.

According to the IDF, the soldier dropped off an injured black puppy on 28 Aug 2013 at a veterinary clinic in the Golan Heights town of Katzrin, then presumably returned to an army base in the area.

The puppy was later found to have contracted rabies.

Following the diagnosis, the Health Ministry immediately notified the IDF, requesting that the army track down the soldier, who authorities believed may have been in need of critical treatment.

Once the rabies virus penetrates a subject's body, he or she must be vaccinated as soon as possible before the virus can make its way to the nervous system. If the subject is not vaccinated in time, symptoms will begin to develop, ultimately leading to the subject's death, as there is currently no effective treatment for the disease once it has [started].

[The information above on "testing" of the exposed person(s) for rabies is rather misleading. Unfortunately, the virus can be identified only after the onset of clinical disease or following autopsy. No tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease.

Reportedly, the soldier has been interviewed by the public health authorities about the timetable and the intensity of his contact with the puppy before delivering it to a veterinary clinic on 28 Aug 2013, and immediately received the prescribed post-exposure treatment, namely a combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and (HDCV) vaccine.

Procedures undertaken in relation to the other contacts were in line with the prevailing guidelines for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies in humans. - Mod.AS
