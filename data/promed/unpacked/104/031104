When talking about threats in the banana industry, little is said about moko, a devastating disease which has silently established itself. Infectious foci have already been reported in plantations in 12 provinces. Its spread over time has been evident. Agrocalidad, the agency for the country's phytosanitary control, does not mention its incidence levels. They report constant monitoring to detect the disease, carried out under a national plan created in 2015. To this is added training of banana producers on this and other crop problems.

However, the Association of Banana Exporters of Ecuador say that, in the field, that plan of action is not evident. They urge the government to design a policy that includes a budget and comprehensive measures. Farmers believe that any measures taken so far have been insufficient for a bacterium that is everywhere. The Minister of Agriculture agrees that the issue requires attention. The necessary knowledge has been available, but nothing had been done before due to lack of resources.

[Moko, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related, causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), while the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70%, but all 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, as well as mechanical means (including human and insect activities). Suckers for propagation pose a high risk of spreading the diseases. Ornamental and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers, depending on host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example, soil treatments), and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures, or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

Moko is present in the region and seems to have been reported officially in Ecuador for the 1st time in 2014 on plantain (ProMED post 20141126.2990348). However, anecdotal reports of suspected moko symptoms have been made as early as the 1970s. Colombia, where the pathogen had been recognised since the 1960s, was considered a likely source for moko in Ecuador.

Members of the _R. solanacearum_ complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
