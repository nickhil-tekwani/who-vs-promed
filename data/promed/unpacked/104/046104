A comment
---------
In the past history of the National Immunization Program in Japan, MMR [measles mumps, rubella] vaccine was introduced for all children (including males) aged between 1 and 4 years old in April 1989, however the program was terminated in April 1993 due to a high frequency of reports of aseptic meningitis, a suspected side effect of the mumps vaccine (Urabe strain). So it is not true that male children were not administered rubella vaccine prior to 1995 in Japan.

Although MMR vaccine was unfortunately discontinued in 1993, Japan had adopted the policy of vaccinating schoolgirls between 1977 and 1995, as several countries also did. As examples, United Kingdom (between 1970 and 1988), Australia (until 1983), Italy (until 1990), and The Netherlands (until 1987) had adopted a selective vaccination policy for girls.

Since the beginning of 2013, a total of 1656 rubella cases have been reported predominantly among males aged between 20 and 40 years old in Japan. This number is still rapidly increasing and becoming close to last year's (2012) number of reported rubella cases (2353). A report mentioned that vaccination strategies that focused on women and children in Brazil were associated with a 5.5-fold greater incidence of rubella in men leading to new outbreaks and CRS [congenital rubella syndrome]. A combined vaccination strategy with a universal approach that included routine vaccination for boys, girls, women, and men should be globally promoted for preventing rubella outbreaks.
