Hemorrhagic disease - Russia (02) NOT YET ARCHIVED]

It is the information about hemorrhagic disease in the Novosibirsk Region
(not, of course, Ovosibirsk), according to the exact data from Novosibirsk
Regional State Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection (I visited them on
Tuesday, but not because of this message) and our own.
The disease with name Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever has been known for years in
the eastern part of Omsk Region and western part of Novosibirsk Region. As
for Novosibirsk Region: the cases of this disease usually occur in the
Ust-Tarka, Vengerovo, Chani districts and Tatarsk town. More than 50% of
all the cases are engaged with hunting for musk-rats or operating with
their fresh skins.
The incidence of cases (hospitalized only) during the last 10 years at
Novosibirsk Region only is presented here: [case-fatality rate? - Mod.CHC]
1989    22
1990    29 (there were 20 hospitalized patients)
1991    41
1992    7
1993    19
1994    11
1995    5
1996    2
There were registered 7 cases (one death) of the hemorrhagic disease in the
spring this year (1998) in Novosibirsk Region (Ust-Tarka district) which is
not unusual. There is one more patient now, a hunter, from the same district.
There are usually two peaks of this disease per year: one in April-June,
and another in September-November. [Typical seasonal case distribution,
same as the ticks. - Mod CHC]
Earlier, by the specialists from Omsk Institute of Natural Foci Infections
(Ministry of Health), it had been stated that the agent which causes the
disease is the virus of Omsk hemorrhagic fever, a relative of tick-borne
encephalitis virus.
This year our institute (State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology Vector) became involved into investigation of six cases. It
seems to us now that, probably, there are a few different agents causing
the diseases with similar symptoms. The investigation continues with joint
efforts of Novosibirsk
Regional State Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection, Vector and Omsk
Institute of Natural Foci Infections.
Vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis virus in Ust-Tarka had been
initiated this autumn by Novosibirsk Regional State
Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection. It had not been done earlier because
this district is not endemic with tick-borne encephalitis virus.

[We are most indebted to Professor Netesov for this detailed report.
Obviously he did not see Hemorrhagic disease - Russia (02) because I posted
it only a few hours ago.
Two statements by Professor Netesov are intriguing. First, that multiple
etiologies (same disease, more than one etiologic agent) are suspected.
Second, that vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis has been
initiated. Tick-borne encephalitis is generally thought of as a disease
caused by either Central European encephalitis (CEE) virus (transmitted by
_Ixodes ricinus_ ticks) or Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis (RSSE) virus
(transmitted by _Ix. persulcatus_ ticks). There is an excellent vaccine
prepared with CEE virus but I do not known whether it has been shown to
protect against infection with the very closely related RSSE and Omsk
hemorrhagic fever (OHF) viruses. OHF virus is within the same antigenic
and genetic complex as CEE and RSSE viruses; all are flaviviruses. I am
certain that at least some of ProMED-mail's subscribers would be interested
in knowing whether "TBE" vaccine, ostensibly prepared with either CEE virus
or RSSE virus, has already been shown to protect against OHF or, if not,
what the results of this experiment will be. There being no vaccine
prepared directly with OHF virus, as far as I know, use of a "TBE" vaccine
would seem to be the next best approach. - Mod.CHC]
