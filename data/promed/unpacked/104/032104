Three horses at the World Equestrian Center (WEC) in Wilmington, Ohio, have tested positive for equine influenza, the site's management said in a [Tue 12 Feb 2019] statement.

Show veterinarian Holly Helbig, DVM, informed management of the positive tests. All 3 horses have tested negative for _Streptococcus equi_ (which causes strangles) and for equine herpesvirus-1 and -4.

When the affected horses exhibited signs of equine influenza, Helbig isolated them at the WEC Veterinary Clinic, where they've been under her care and supervision since Sunday (10 Feb 2019).

The WEC management said the center will continue to observe all recommended biosecurity measures and be vigilant in its effort to avoid the spread of the virus by continuing to disinfect and sterilize stabling, wash racks, walkways, and common areas on the show grounds.

Helbig will continue to test any horse demonstrating clinical signs of disease, and horse show management will remain proactive in communicating with exhibitors. Individuals with questions or concerns are asked to contact horse show manager Brandon Saxton at 216/554-2049 or Helbig at 330/807-2643.

In the meantime, the World Equestrian Center recommends horse owners and caregivers observe biosecurity recommendations and adhere to vaccination schedules as recommended by their veterinarians.

Influenza 101
Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that affects horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; humans that pick up the virus on their hands, shoes, or clothes; tack, buckets, or other equipment; and aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing.

Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106 deg F / 41 deg C); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse's health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early, and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread.

Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from.

In addition to vaccination, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse's chance of developing disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

[Hopefully these horses will recover. Owners of horses should vaccinate their animals prior to shows or if they are housed in a public barn. It is a good idea to keep your horse current on all vaccinations at all times.

Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among naive horses. Horses one to 5 years old are the most susceptible to infection. Orthomyxovirus A/equine-2 was 1st recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries, except for New Zealand and Iceland. China, Japan, and Australia experienced devastating epidemics of equine influenza affecting 10s of thousands of horses in 2007. Before that, equine influenza had not been reported in China since 1993 and in Japan since 1972, and it had never been reported in Australia.

Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild, inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift seen with specific strains of A/equine-2 virus in some parts of the world.
