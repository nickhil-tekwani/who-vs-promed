Health officials in Seychelles have confirmed that 3 people have tested positive for plague. According to Today in Seychelles, a Seychellois basketball coach died from the disease in September 2017 in a hospital in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, where 42 people have died from the "Black Death."

The coach was assisting the Seychelles men's reigning champion of the Beau Vallon Heat in Madagascar during the Indian Ocean Club Championship. The government of Madagascar over the weekend [7-8 Oct 2017] confirmed that the death was due to the pneumonic plague. The other members of the Seychellois basketball delegation, who were in close contact with [the coach], have been under observation since they returned to the country, [Jude Gedeon, Seychelles' public health commissioner] said. They are now at the military academy at Perseverance, a reclaimed island on the outskirts of Victoria.

According to the Seychelles News Agency, the Seychelles' Ministry of Health on [Wed 3 Oct 2017] advised all airlines and travel agents to discourage people from traveling to Madagascar due to the plague outbreak. Additional health measures at Seychelles' main airport have also been put in place.

Gedeon said that officials have put in place walk-through and temperature scanners at the international airport to detect cases. A form is also being given to disembarked passengers to state if they have any symptoms similar to those brought on by the plague. Additionally, as a precaution, all schools in Seychelles are closed for the next 6 days as it is not yet confirmed that contact was made with any of the teachers.

[This report claims that 3 individuals in the Seychelles have tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_. Yesterday's posting (Plague - Seychelles: ex Madagascar, RFI 20171010.5371382) reported on an imported case of plague (from Madagascar) as well as an ill contact. It is not clear if the contact had been in Madagascar.

ProMED would appreciate more information in this regard. The Seychelles Ministry of Health has denied that other cases existed on its Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/mohseychellesofficial/posts/747073488827118). The Ministry of Health did confirm that the case imported from Madagascar was pneumonic plague.

Seychelles, officially the Republic of Seychelles, is an archipelago and country in the Indian Ocean. The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies 1500 km (approx 932 mi) east of mainland East Africa. Other nearby island countries and territories include Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, RÃ©union (region of France), and Mauritius to the south. With a population of roughly 94 228, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country.
