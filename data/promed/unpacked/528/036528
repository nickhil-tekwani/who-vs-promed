Dirty water downs 39 in Pasay
-------------------------------
Contaminated water sickened 39 residents of a barangay in Pasay City over
the weekend, triggering a probable outbreak of typhoid fever in the area,
the Department of Health (DOH) said on Mon 31 Jan 2005. A team from the DOH
National Epidemiology Center (NEC) and the Pasay City health office made
the rounds of barangay 123 on 29 Jan 2005 and found 39 people showing
symptoms of typhoid fever.
Dr. Tony San Juan of the DOH-NEC said rectal swabs from 39 residents of El
Facundo, Medina and Alfonso Isidro streets were sent to the Research
Institute for Tropical Medicine for culture. "The culprit is most probably
the water, because residents have complained of foul-smelling water from
their faucets," San Juan told the Inquirer on Mon 31 Jan 2005.
A spot examination of the water source of barangay 123 and its neighboring
barangays showed that the residual chlorine level in the water supply was
zero. The normal residual chlorine level is .2 to .5 mg/liter, San Juan
said. San Juan said that nearby Barangay 124, which has the same water
source, has had a history of typhoid outbreaks in the past 2 years. If all
39 cases are confirmed, this would be the 1st typhoid outbreak in Barangay
123, which had less than 10 cases of typhoid last year [2004].
San Juan said the water company had reported that it had chlorinated the
water source of the concerned barangays after the DOH and Pasay City health
officials called the problem to the company's attention.
The DOH was still verifying whether or not the residual chlorine level had
reached the normal level as reported by Maynilad, but San Juan confirmed
that Maynilad had set up a water rationing station in the affected
barangay. Meanwhile, tests made by the city's sanitation office said that
human waste had found its way to the faucets in Barangay 123 in Pasay City.
"6 samples taken from different households showed coliform organism and
zero chlorine," said Neil Sabino of the Pasay City sanitation office. The
organism is found in the feces of humans and other warm blooded animals, he
added.
According to Jess Matubis, Maynilad Water Company vice president for
corporate communications, old pipes and illegal connections could have
added to the contamination. Since August 2004, service connections and pipe
replacements have started in Barangays 124 and 123, he said, adding that
service connections for 122 houses in the area had already been completed.
The DOH, meanwhile, advised residents to boil water used for drinking,
cooking and washing kitchen utensils.

[Pasay City is one of the cities and municipalities that comprise
metropolitan Manila. A barangay is a type of settlement; the word is
derived from balangay, the name for the sailboats that originally brought
settlers of Malay stock to the Philippines from Borneo.
This presumptive outbreak of infection with _S. typhi_ seems to be clearly
spread through the water supply and emphasizes the need for up to date
systems that do not contaminate drinking water with human waste. Unlike
almost all the other salmonellae, _S. typhi_ is not zoonotic. - Mod.LL]

Typhoid fever downs 133 residents of Negros village
-----------------------------------------------
Local officials reported an outbreak of typhoid fever in Sibulan, Negros
Oriental, where 133 residents had fallen ill since mid-January 2005.
Sibulan Mayor Antonio Renacia, on Wed 2 Feb 2005, sent a letter to the
Department of Health (DOH), requesting that experts be sent to his town to
determine the cause of the outbreak. "We have to determine 1st the cause of
this outbreak for us to know what must be done to address this problem. The
trouble is we don't have experts in the region; that's why we are
requesting the DOH Manila to send experts here," Renacia told the Inquirer.
16 typhoid cases were reported by 29 Jan 2005. The number rose to 133
within a span of 4 days. Most of the patients came from Barangays Looc,
Poblacion and Ajong. Other cases were from Barangays Cangmating, Balugo,
Maslog and Magatas.
The mayor said health and town officials suspected that a leak in the main
pipeline of the Sibulan Water District might have caused the typhoid fever
outbreak. Renacia said a resident reported that workers of the Department
of Public Works and Highways had accidentally hit the pipeline.
