FERAL CAT CONTROL
==================
Subject: Feral cat resolution
In part because feral cats are a vector for the transmission of
zoonotic disease from wildlife to humans, the American Association of
Wildlife Veterinarians has proposed a resolution opposing the maintenance of
neutered and vaccinated feral cat colonies -- a technique for reducing feral
cat numbers which has proved effective in South Africa, England, and the
United States, because it enables humane authorities to bring persons who
feed cats, often in lieu of human social contacts, into a supervised
"loop." Such persons tend to be elderly and socially isolated; often they
live in apartments where keeping pets is forbidden. Psychological research
has established that the primary reason why cat feeders traditionally do not
cooperate with humane authorities is fear that their charges will be
euthanized. As ANIMAL PEOPLE demonstrated with a highly successful model
neuter/release project in northern Fairfield County, Connecticut, in
1991-1992, undertaken with the cooperation of Monroe and Shelton animal
control, neuter/release gets around this fear, enabling humane authorities
to not only insure that feral cats are neutered and vaccinated, but also to
take in any cats showing potential to be socialized for adoption, and to
remove for treatment or euthanasia those cats who actually are injured or
diseased. In our extensive experience, it is relatively easy to persuade
cat-feeders to part with cats who are clearly suffering, once one gains
their trust by demonstrating that healthy but non-adoptable cats will not be
killed just because they exist.
It is important to note that our demonstration project was
undertaken almost at Ground Zero for raccoon rabies in the state of
Connecticut. To date, most likely because we insured that the feral cat
populations were both vaccinated and reduced, there have been no rabid feral
cats found in any of the demonstration project neuter/release zones. (The
volunteers who initially captured these cats were themselves vaccinated
against rabies.)
The American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians resolution
contends that there are no standard guidelines for neuter/release, and that
neuter/release has not been demonstrated to be effective. Both contentions
are incorrect.
ANIMAL PEOPLE will be pleased to send to any interested PROMED-AHEAD
participants copies of the information packet we prepared for the 1995
National Animal Control Association annual conference, by request of NACA.
Included are the findings from our own neuter/release project; the findings
from our 1992 survey of nearly 200 cat-feeders from around the U.S.; and
appended will be our just-published findings from a follow-up survey of the
same group, which found that while relatively few of the cat-feeders were
practicing neuter/release in 1992, the technique has now caught on, and in
consequence the populations of cats they are feeding have stabilized, as
compared to growth of about 18% per year prior to the use of neuter/release.
We are by no means uncritical of neuter/release. Our research
indicates that it is an appropriate feral cat population control technique in
only about 12% of the situations in which feral cats are found. Nonetheless,
in those situations it is demonstrably the most cost-effective and
efficacious approach. Study data to that effect compiled by Karen Johnson
and Laura Lewellyan of the National Pet Alliance in Santa Clara County and
San Diego County, California, will also be included in the packet.

[- This technique for controlling feral cats was developed some 20 years
ago in the UK, actually in Hyde Park. The community of cats is identified;
all members are trapped, neutered, vaccinated, ear-tipped for identification,
and released. Any later "new-comer" is trapped and similarly treated. When
successful, there are not only no pregnant cats but the health of the colony
is much improved. Populations stabilise probably because any later arrivals,
eg dumped unwanted pets, are driven out into lower survival niches and die.
