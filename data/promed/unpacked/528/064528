[1] Sierra Leone: Freetown, NOT
Date: 31 May 2014
Source: a reliable source well-known to ProMED [edited]


[In Ebola update [52] posted yesterday, 30 May 2014, ReliefWeb quoted government spokesman Abdulai Bayratay "Of the 26 suspected cases, 23 were registered in the eastern region of Kailahun, where Sierra Leone's 1st fatality from Ebola was confirmed on Monday [26 May 2014]. Another case was in the diamond region of Kono, also in the east, and 2 in the capital Freetown, said Bayratay." - ProMED]

The 2 patients from Freetown were from Connaught Hospital and the Emergency Hospital. Samples were received at MOHS/MB Kenema lab earlier this week from the 2 suspected cases. Real time RT-PCR tests were performed on Thursday [29 May 2014], and the results were negative, so there were no Ebola cases in Freetown.

[2] Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium report
Date: 31 May 2014
From: Pardis Sabeti <pardis@broadinstitute.org> [edited]


I am sending the below update on behalf of Dr. Robert Garry, who is currently in Sierra Leone, and the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortirum. Thank you for your attention and efforts.

The Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) is very concerned about the recent deaths from ebolavirus disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone but is pleased to report on the exemplary response by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) and its partners.

The new EVD cases occurred in the Koindu, Kailahun District, bordering the current EVD epicenter of Gueckedou, Guinea; 14 samples from that area have since been confirmed to be positive for Zaire ebolavirus at the Lassa Laboratory at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). All 14 PCR positive cases are females who attended the burial of a traditional medicine practitioner (herbalist), who treated individuals with EVD from neighboring Guinea. Three positive patients have been referred to KGH, with 2 deaths.

The efforts are being led by Physician In-Charge Dr. S. Humarr Khan and the Director of the Lassa Laboratory Mr. Augustine Goba under a mandate and with support from the Sierra Leone MOHS [Ministry of Health & Sanitation] in collaboration with Tulane University, Metabiota, Harvard University, and the Broad Institute. Other partners and international response teams, including those from MSF and WHO, are currently engaging in the response to this outbreak.

In response to these confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone, the VHFC mobilized a response team for rapid arrival at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). The team is comprised of Dr. Robert Garry, PhD, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, and Principal Investigator of the Consortium, as well as Dr. Lina Moses, PhD, Field Sites Manager. Their goals are to support clinical diagnoses at KGH, provide support for case investigations, as well as to re-supply needed protective equipment for the continued biosafety of all personnel.

Task forces were mobilized and met in less than 12 hours after the 1st diagnosis [on 26 May 2014]. On Thu 29 May 2014, Minister of Health Hon. Miatta Kargbo led a meeting with Paramount Chiefs in Kenema, including Chiefs from Eastern districts in Sierra Leone. The major message was that Sierra Leone is well-prepared for this outbreak and is responding quickly and decisively to a real and serious public health threat. Dr. S. Humarr Khan (Director KGH VHF Program), Dr. Brima Kargbo (Chief Medical Officer), Dr. Mohamed Vandi (KGH District Medical Officer), Bernadette Lahai (Member of Parliament), Dr. Garry (Tulane), and others participated in this informational meeting. (An irresponsible and unfortunate media report about Minister Kargbo's response to the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone should be ignored and discredited.)

It should be noted that all samples from suspected EVD patients have been referred to the Lassa Laboratory at KGH for diagnosis through Sierra Leone's district health network managed effectively by the MOHS. KGH is a crucial clinical and diagnostic center for VHFs and is one of only 2 permanent sites in West Africa focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of VHFs [the other is Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Nigeria].

Following the Guinean Ebola outbreak of March 2014, the VHFC established a field team comprising Dr. Kristian Andersen (Harvard/Broad), Dr. Lina Moses (Tulane) and Stephen Gire (Harvard/Broad) to provide technical and field support for combating the possible threat of EDV spreading to Sierra Leone. At that time, 2 separate Ebola virus assays were optimized for rapid field deployment. Simultaneously and in close collaboration, a team from Metabiota led by Dr. Nadia Wauquier initiated qPCR assays employing primers developed by the USAMRIID Critical Reagents Program; 6 days ago, these diagnostic tools helped Sierra Leonean researchers and their partners (VHFC and Metabiota) at KGH detect Zaire ebolavirus in a patient for the 1st time in Sierra Leone. Samples have been sent to the Broad Institute (Stephen Gire, Kristian Andersen, Pardis Sabeti) and USAMRIID (Randall Schoepp) for sequencing.

Speculation that the KGH-MOHS outreach team (supported by VHFC (Lansana Kannah and Michael Gbakie) and Metabiota (James Bangura) may have incited the violence at Koindu by attempting to collect samples from contacts without properly engaging community elders has absolutely no basis in fact. The KGH Outreach team is highly experienced in engaging Sierra Leonean communities affected by Lassa fever. Community leaders from Koindu were extensively engaged and cooperative. It was a small faction, principally aggrieved family members of victims, who attacked the outreach team. Sierra Leonean military escorted the outreach team from the site. There were no injuries. As of today [31 May 2014], Koindu has effectively sealed its perimeter on its own initiative. However, the outreach team along with high-level MOHS officials are continuing to engage the community.

Yesterday [31 May 2014] (5 days after the 1st confirmed case), an MOHS team engaged approximately 120 community health workers (CHW) from Kailahun district in a day-long training on EVD. All participants in this "training of trainers" session received instruction on proper use of PPE, VHF case identification, and sample shipping to KGH via the well-established District Medical Officer (DMO) networks. Ms. Simbirie Jalloh (VHFC program manager), Mr. Kannah, Mr. Gbakie, Mr. Bangura, Drs. Khan and Garry, and the KGH Nursing Deputy Matron participated in the training. The outreach was lead by Dr. S. Humarr Khan for the MOHS.

[Freetown seems to have dodged the bullet once again -- but how long will its luck last?

ProMED would appreciate further information on the 2 suspected cases in Freetown. Were they suspected because they were contacts of cases upcountry who were traced to the capital and hospitalized symptom-free, or patients presenting at those hospitals with suggestive symptoms and travel history? Besides testing negative for ebolavirus, we presume they were also negative for Lassa virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever. Has there been a final diagnosis? This would be of interest to clinicians looking for a differential diagnosis in suspect cases.

ProMED thanks the Broad Institute for their report. It is good to see such acknowledgement of collaborative efforts in helping the MOHS combat this emergency. - Mod.JW
