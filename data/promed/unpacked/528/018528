Outbreak of wound botulism in injecting drug users in Germany, October -
December 2005
-----------------------------------------------
A cluster of 14 cases of wound botulism (including 6 laboratory-confirmed
cases) in injecting drug users has been reported from the federal state of
Nordrhein-Westfalen in the west of Germany. The 1st cases were reported in
November 2005.
The earliest disease onset date recorded so far is 14 Oct 2005, and the
latest is 5 Dec 2005. To date, it remains unclear whether or not the
outbreak has ended. A common source of infection has not yet been
identified, but it is suspected that the vehicle of infection is
contaminated heroin. Nearly all patients that investigators have so far
been able to question have reported subcutaneous ("skin popping") or
intramuscular ("muscle popping") injection of the drug, and presented with
wound infections.
The Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) issued alerts through the European Early
Warning System (EWRS) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA) on 14 Nov 2005. 2 notices on the outbreak have been
published in the national epidemiological bulletin [1,2].
If the vehicle of infection is contaminated heroin, it is possible that
similar cases may be occurring elsewhere in Europe, and Dr. Katharina
Alpers <AlpersK@rki.de> at RKI would be grateful to receive any related
information.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,
germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound
botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who
intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may
be particularly vulnerable to infection.
Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a febrile,
descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing
the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in
the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of
microbiological testing.
In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement
are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin
treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.
Toxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of both
foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin
type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a
higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin
types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynapic
motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the
neuromuscular junction. - Mod.LL]
