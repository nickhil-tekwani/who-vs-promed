Authorities in New Zealand are looking into 3 recent _Listeria_ cases to see if they are linked and to find a source of the infections.

While investigations are underway to find the vehicle of infection for the reported cases in Tauranga, a city in the Bay of Plenty region, officials cautioned that often a source cannot be identified for individual cases.

The 3 cases, aged in their late 70s to 90s, were notified to Toi Te Ora Public Health between [12 and 20 Jul 2020]. All 3 were hospitalized and one person with a previously diagnosed terminal condition has died.

Toi Te Ora Public Health and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) reminded the public of recommended food safety measures to reduce risk from _Listeria_.

"Our investigations include determining what the cases may have eaten in order to identify any common risk factors or food that may be the source of infection," said Dr Neil de Wet, medical officer of health for Toi Te Ora Public Health. MPI compliance director Gary Orr said that if there was a link identified between cases and the food supply chain, immediate action would be taken to ensure public safety.

People at risk of more serious illness from _Listeria_ include pregnant women and their unborn babies, newborn babies, those with weakened immune systems, and elderly people, especially if they have poor health. The Bay of Plenty typically sees 1 to 5 cases each year.

MPI advised people in an at-risk group to avoid uncooked, smoked or ready-to-eat fish or seafood, including oysters, prawns, sashimi, or sushi; pat√©, hummus, and tahini-based dips and spreads; cold pre-cooked chicken; processed meats and chilled pre-cooked meats including chicken, salami, and other fermented or dried sausages; pre-prepared, pre-packed, or stored salads including fruit salads and coleslaws; raw milk and any food containing unpasteurized milk; soft-serve ice creams and soft, semi-soft, or surface-ripened soft cheese such as brie, camembert, feta, ricotta, or Roquefort.

Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, septicemia (blood poisoning), and meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to 2 weeks but can vary between a few and 70 days.

[The Bay of Plenty is a region of New Zealand, situated around a bight of the same name in the northern coast of the North Island, stretching 260 km (about 161 mi) from the Coromandel Peninsula in the west to Cape Runaway in the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty). Tauranga is a western coastal city in the Bay of Plenty region and the 5th most populous city of New Zealand, with an urban population of 135 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauranga). A HealthMap/ProMED map of New Zealand can be seen at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7614443,5630 and a map showing the location of Tauranga at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tauranga,+New+Zealand.

The news report above describes 3 people with listeriosis, aged in their late 70s to 90s, in the city of Tauranga, in the Bay of Plenty region, between 12 and 20 Jul 2020. All 3 were hospitalized and one with a previously diagnosed terminal condition died.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a Gram-positive, facultative, intracellular, foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, which can be fatal, particularly in elderly populations, people with weakened immune systems, and newborns.

Confirmation of a cluster of cases is based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). A food history from patients in the cluster will then attempt to identify a possible common source. Isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, if found in the suspected food, can then undergo WGS to confirm if the suspected food is the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_ include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold-cut meats that do not require further cooking before eating, refrigerated pates or meat spreads, unpasteurized (raw) milk and dairy products, such as soft cheeses, and raw fruits and vegetables (such as sprouts). Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease. - Mod.ML]
