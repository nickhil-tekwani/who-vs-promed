A mold found in more than a 3rd of the soil samples from New York State apple orchards is causing a new disease, spoiling apples, even after heat pasteurization. The state is the top producer of processed apple products and they all rely on pasteurization.

Cornell's Kathie Hodge and Megan Biango-Daniels investigated the origins of a newly discovered apple disease called Paecilomyces Rot, caused by the common fungus found in 34 per cent of state orchards. Previously, scientists believed the fungus was coming from soil contamination, but Hodge and Biango-Daniels believe other infected apples are the primary source.

Since this new apple disease appears similar in appearance to others, the scientists suggest apple producers isolate any of the fruit with wounds or bruising in order to avoid the spread of Paecilomyces Rot.

[The fungus causing this new disease has been identified as _Byssochlamys lagunculariae_ (previously _Paecilomyces niveus_; see source link below). The external fruit rot develops mainly in storage after harvest and symptoms appear to be similar to fruit rots due to other fungi. Susceptibility may vary somewhat between apple cultivars. The fungus survives in orchard soils and on decaying plant material.

The significance of this report is stated as (1) the production of a mycotoxin, and (2) the fungus remaining infectious after commercial pasteurisation. Spores are reported to be tolerant of temperatures of up to 90 degrees Celsius [194 F] and are suspected to be the cause of spoilage of canned products, leading to severe economic losses for the affected apple producers. This pathogen also appears to facilitate secondary infections by other fungi.

Other species in the genus _Byssochlamys_ are also known to produce mycotoxins and form heat resistant ascospores. They have been reported from soils in many areas and can cause problems, for example, in grapevine and tomato products.
