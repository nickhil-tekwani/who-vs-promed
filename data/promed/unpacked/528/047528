Tomatoes infected with a newly-described virus, tomato chlorosis,
should now be easier to diagnose, according to virologists with
Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The virologists developed a
test that determines within 24 hours whether a plant has the
virus. The virus is transmitted by four species of sap-sucking
whiteflies, which are major pests of tomatoes and other crops.
[Dr. Gail Wisler of the USDA has written that there are two
viruses which have emerged in greenhouse tomato production:
tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV) which we posted on
previously, and tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) which this posting
refers to. TICV is only transmitted by the greenhouse whitefly
_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_. ToCV is transmitted by the whitefly
species noted below - MOD PKA]
The University of Florida's plant disease clinic in Gainesville
is now using the ARS test on leaf specimens sent by growers.
Florida produces more than a third of the nation's $460 million
tomato crop. The Florida clinic's researchers will also use the
new test to identify weed species that are vulnerable to the
virus. Whiteflies may be carrying virus from those weeds to
nearby tomato fields.
The test relies on molecules, called nucleic acid probes, that
detect the virus' genetic material. These are the first such
probes for this virus.
ARS scientists and their clinic colleagues were the first to
describe and name the tomato chlorosis virus. It causes leaves to
yellow and thicken, and plants to produce fewer and smaller
fruit. The ARS tests indicate that the greenhouse whitefly
[_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_], the banded-wing whitefly
[_Trialeurodes abutiloneus_], the sweetpotato whitefly [_Bemisia
tabaci_, biotype A] and the silverleaf whitefly [_Bemisia
tabaci_, biotype B] can all transmit the virus.
