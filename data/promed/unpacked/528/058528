Thanh Hoa: 12-year-old girl died of swine flu
---------------------------------------------
A little girl from the central province of Thanh Hoa died of the H1N1 influenza strain known as swine flu at the Hanoi-based Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases this morning, 23 Apr 2013, reported the hospital's deputy director Nguyen Hong Ha. It is suspected that the girl caught the flu from her brother-in-law, who is living in Hanoi. About 2 weeks ago, he paid a visit to the home of his parents-in-law in Thanh Hoa. He had influenza at that time and communicated flu to 3 others in the family. 2 people were free from the disease while the girl's flu got worse. On 16 April 2013, she had fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The family took her to the hospital of Vinh Loc district in Thanh Hoa. After one day of treatment, the patient got critical breathing problems and was transferred to the Hospital of Thanh Hoa province.

Only a day later, the respiratory problem became more serious. The X-ray scan showed lesions in her lung. The patient was transferred to the Central Hospital for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases in Hanoi, where the X-ray scan detected that her lung lesions developed very quickly. She was again transferred to another hospital -- the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

Deputy Director Nguyen Hong Ha of the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases said the patient was brought to the hospital in the state of severe respiratory distress. Testing results showed that she was positive for type A/H1N1 flu virus. Upon admission, the patient was treated with antiretroviral drugs but she died on the morning of 23 Apr 2013.

On 22 Apr 2013, the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases also received an 83-year-old man who was transferred from the Agriculture Hospital with symptoms of flu. Dr. Nguyen Van Kinh, Director of the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases, said that flu patients died because they were brought to the hospital very late, after having complications such as respiratory failure and heavy pneumonia.

A/H1N1 influenza is the same as the other seasonal flu, with certain mortality. In Viet Nam, the fatality rate from A/H1N1 influenza is very low, only about 0.7 percent.

H1N1 (2009) death in Viet Nam 23 April -- Cytokine storm?
---------------------------------------------------------
This report is of concern because the WHO is adamant that this virus is now merely a 'seasonal influenza' and even the situation developing in Northern India this year has warranted less than one sentence in its 8-page surveillance on influenza activity -- the 2 research papers on the D222G haemagglutinin mutation published in January 2013 [see ProMED-mail references below] do not seem to have been taken on board.

The 12 year old girl who died today of acute respiratory illness involving 'lesions appearing in her lungs' suggests a cytokine storm --- it is to be hoped that tests will be done to see whether this was an instance of the 'D222G' mutation appearing in Viet Nam.

At first I wondered if this was a typo for H5N1 but it would seem not. Swine 'Flu was last reported in August 2011 and 3 deaths of young people (not elderly as in China for variant H7N9 or indeed in the middle east for 'Saudi SARS') have all occurred this month.
