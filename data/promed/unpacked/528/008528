The Walloon Minister of Agriculture, Ren√© Collin (CDH), proposes to halve the wild boar population in Wallonia within 2 years, writes L'Avenir today. He [Collin] is going to propose a series of measures that will soon completely change the wild boar hunt policy.

"In 2 years' time, we will reduce the wild boar population by 50% in Wallonia. And for this season, outside the area affected by swine fever, we will increase the hunting target by 30%, the minister announced on [Tue 27 Nov 2018] evening in Longlier, during a meeting with hunters from the area affected by the swine fever. In this zone the wild boar population "is strived for zero", so no wild boar should be allowed. In August [2019], the measure will be reviewed, to see if adjustments are needed.

The Walloon minister complained: "In our supermarkets, there is mainly meat from Polish wild boars. That is absurd!"

Minister Collin wants to take all these measures, so that "there are no more wild boars to the north of the Sambre and Meuse [rivers]". Night hunting should also be allowed, so that hunters "reach their quota". He does not intend to impose rules on decoy food that hunters use for game, but wants to organize a roundtable meeting to reach an agreement on this. All these measures will be presented to the Walloon government on [Thu 29 Nov 2018].

[The most recent (Wed 28 Nov 2018) ASF update of Belgium's Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) follows:

"As of 28 Nov 2018, the total number 0f ASF-infected wild boar, discovered in the region of Etalle in the province of Luxembourg, is 184.

"The activities of the various competent authorities have been coordinated to prevent the possible spread of the virus by wild boar and into pig farms. The responsibility for wildlife-related issues is borne by the Regions; for farmed/kept pigs, by the FASFC.

"An infected zone was delineated on 14 Sep 2018 around the infection loci by the FASFC and the Walloon Region. In this zone measures were taken, addressing both wild boars and farmed pigs. All domestic pigs were culled between 29 Sep and 2 Oct 2018 as a result of a decision by the Federal Minister of Agriculture Mr. Denis Ducarme. Repopulation of the farms in this zone is prohibited until further notice.

"In order to respect European legislation, the contaminated zone was revised in consultation with the European Commission and replaced by 2 separate zones: a zone I and a zone II. Zone II, the zone where the infected wild boars are located, is entirely within the old infected zone.(map at https://tinyurl.com/y7uusrgh). Zone I is a buffer zone that surrounds zone II completely and contains a part of the old infected zone (= zone I south) and a new zone north of the infected zone (= zone I north). (map at https://tinyurl.com/y7rz4ej2). In these zones I and II, measures apply to both wild boar and domestic pigs, in accordance with European legislation.

"The measures related to wild boar and to all other activities in the forests within the Walloon region can be consulted at the following link: http://www.wallonie.be/fr/actualites/mesures-de-lutte-contre-la-peste -porcine-africaine.

"As regards the domestic pigs, in fact the published measures apply only in zone I north, since the pigs in zone II and zone I south (old infected zone) have already been culled while repopulation is prohibited. In the current situation, there is no culling of domestic pigs in zone I north."

Detailed measures for the domestic pigs are available under the heading "Measures and prevention" (In Dutch, http://www.afsca.be/avp/maatregelen/; In French, http://www.afsca.be/ppa/mesures/). - Mod.AS
