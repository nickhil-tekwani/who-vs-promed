An estimated 900 vegetable farmers in Lamwo district [Northern region] have lost several acres of vegetable crops to a strange disease. The vegetables most affected are cabbages, eggplants, and tomatoes. The disease, which was first detected in April 2020, attacks the roots or fruits of the crops, causing wilting of the whole plant when still young. According to [a farmer], they alerted their district agricultural officer about the strange disease in April last year [2020], but they are yet to be given a solution.

The Agoro Cooperative Society says the group's 32 members lost 10 acres of crops to the disease. All members and individual farmers who use [the] Agoro Irrigation Scheme to water their plants have been affected. "All the vegetables planted dried up before or immediately after sprouting or bearing fruits", they said. "Even after spraying the crops, there was no improvement."

The Lamwo district agricultural officer says he has not yet received any report, adding that he will visit the affected farmers to ascertain the kind of disease affecting their crops.

[From the description above, it is not possible to determine the diseases or disorders referred to. Both brassica (cabbages) and solanaceous (tomato, aubergine) crops, which belong to unrelated families, are reported to be affected. This would suggest that either any pathogens potentially involved would have to have a very wide host range, different pathogens affect the different crop families, or the problem may be due to external factors or chemical contamination.

A range of fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens are known to occur in the region on vegetable crops. Some of the pathogens may be spread in irrigation water (such as _Ralstonia_ bacterial rots; for example, see ProMED-mail post 20201222.8037126), as seems to be suggested in the report above. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) would be paramount to providing solutions for the farmers.
