CAPRINE ARTHRITIS/ENCEPHALITIS - PHILIPPINES: DAVAO REGION

Davao region's goat-raising industry is now threatened by the spread
of caprine arthritis/encephalitis [CAE] virus.

Rafael T. Mercado, head of the regional livestock division of the
Agriculture department, told local journalists that field reports
have shown the virus has infected up to 30 percent of goat farms.

Mr. Mercado noted that many goat raisers are still not aware of the
outbreak, thus are not separating sick goats from the rest. He said
there is currently no cure and that the only available remedy is to
isolate infected animals in order to prevent further spread of the disease.

"The presence of this virus is alarming, because it can slowly lower
the production of milk and, worse, it can destroy all infected
animals," he explained.

The virus causes arthritis in adult goats and encephalitis in kids
that are 6 months old or younger.

He said his office believes the virus entered the region through
imported goats, particularly those coming from Mexico.

Noting that goat meat has a huge market in the United States and the
Middle East, the government had included goat-raising in the
Comprehensive Livelihood Emergency Employment Program for farmers.

[Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE), a persistent lentivirus
infection of goats, is often grouped together with Maedi-Visna (MV),
a lentivirus infection of sheep, as the small ruminant lentiviruses
(SRLVs); both share the same chapter 2.7.3/4 in OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals.

Phylogenetic analyses comparing nucleotide sequences of MV virus
(MVV) and CAE virus (CAEV) have demonstrated that these are closely
related lentiviruses. One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is
colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the
absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces and lung fluids
are known to harbour infectious virus.

Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing
countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and
New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised
countries, and seems to have coincided with the international
movement of European breeds of dairy goats.

Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive,
mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder and
central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both
species, and its economic significance may be underestimated.

Polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most
lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic but
remain persistent carriers of virus and are capable of transmitting
infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions.

The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of
MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation.
Although serology represents the most cost-effective method of
diagnosing persistently infected, clinically normal animals, it
should be understood that testing errors occur. The frequency of
error depends on several factors including but not limited to: 1) the
assay format, 2) the homology between the strain of virus used in the
assay and the strains of virus present in the testing populations,
and 3) the viral antigen used in the assay.

The Philippines have not included any information on CAE in the
semi-annual and annual OIE reports until the end of 2009. 56
OIE-member countries claim CAE to have "never occurred," but Finland
and New Caledonia are the only ones whose claim can be regarded as
having a high degree of accuracy, being the only countries whose
claim is based upon "targeted surveillance."

According to Mexico's 2009 report to the OIE, the disease is not
included in the list of diseases which have "never occurred," though
not reported during 2009.

the member-countries' reports, can be downloaded at
