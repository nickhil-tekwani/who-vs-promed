Rabies has been confirmed in a horse in Bandera county [Texas, USA]; more
cases are feared. It is the 1st known case of a horse infected with rabies
in Bandera county in nearly 40 years.

Sunday [21 Feb 2010] night, the Modglings noticed one of their horses was
acting odd and, at times, even violent. "It was just not a good sight to
see," said Beverly Modgling.

Modgling said she knew something was seriously wrong but just didn't know
what, so she called Conrad Nightingale, DVM, to come take a look. "I
suspected that we had something unusual going on here," said Nightingale.
In his 37 years of veterinarian practice, Nightingale had never seen a case
of rabies in a horse. However, as soon as the tests came back positive,
Nightingale put every veterinarian in the county on alert. He said he urged
the veterinarians to vaccinate every unprotected animal and give booster
shots to those who live close to the Modgling's home in Medina. Nightingale
said: "The concern is that there's a source of rabies in this area."

Six months ago, a raccoon less than a mile from the Modgling's home tested
positive for rabies. Nightingale said he's worried more domestic animals
may have already been infected and fears humans may be next. "Of course, I
was scared to death," said Modgling.

Since Modgling was exposed to the disease, she will have to undergo a
series of shots [post exposure prophylaxis - a series of shots given over
about 2 months time in a muscle mass - Mod.TG]. "We're going to be like a
sprinkler system when this is over," she joked.

Modgling, however, said she'll do whatever it takes to keep this rare
disease just that, rare.

[Horses are curious creatures. It is not uncommon for a skunk or a raccoon
to come through a pasture. The curious horse investigates with its nose and
gets a sharp bite. If the animal being investigated is a rabid animal, then
likely the virus will be transmitted to the horse.

Rabies is a virus that is transmitted through the saliva of the infected
animal. Although the virus may have entered the horse, clinical signs may
not be apparent for some time, even as long as 6 months. The virus must
find its way to the nervous system, which produces the aggression or
withdrawal and timidity that we see in some animals.

Whether or not there is rabies in the area, the safest protection against
this fatal disease is vaccination. Vaccination against rabies is available
for companion animals and equines, bovines, and other animals. While it may
seem excessive to vaccinate your horses or cattle, if you are handling
these animals, this vaccine could save your life and your animals, which is
a protection for your investment.

Hopefully, Dr Nightingale will be successful in spreading the word of this
rabies case, and people will have their animals, cats, dogs, horses, and
especially any of the show animals, vaccinated against this disease. - Mod.TG
