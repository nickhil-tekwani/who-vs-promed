Farmers' hopes that the ban on exports of English pigs could be lifted next
week were dashed yesterday as it emerged 36 farms rather than 5 farms may
be contaminated with classical swine fever (CSF). The European Union (EU)
veterinary committee will hold a crucial meeting on Tuesday to decide
whether the disease has been successfully contained on the 5 farms in East
Anglia found to have the virus.
But Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) scientists are
awaiting test results from the other 31, scattered throughout England,
where pigs have shown CSF symptoms. If the blood and tissue samples give an
all-clear, MAFF officials will urge the EU to limit the ban to just East
Anglia. The 31 suspected cases are as far-flung as the Isle of Wight,
Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Sussex, Cheshire and Dorset.
One senior MAFF source said the worst-case scenario was the possibility the
European Commission (EC) would ban exports of pork meat from England.
European farmers fear contaminated meat, while not dangerous for humans,
could help to spread the disease on the Continent.
Tests taken from the 31 farms can take up to 8 days to be processed. Each
sample has to be monitored every 24 hours to ensure the virus is not lying
dormant. Jim Scudamore, the Government's Chief Veterinary Officer, said:
"It's quite encouraging we are not getting any positive results yet."
Farms under investigation have been banned from transporting pigs while
tests are carried out.
"It would be very early to get an all-clear for England for swine fever,
but if we can show we haven't got the disease spreading they might take a
decision on whether the ban needs to cover England or a smaller area," Mr
Scudamore said.
The EC announced the CSF outbreak in East Anglia was similar to a strain
found in wild boar illegally exported from Asia to Europe in 1998.
Researchers at the European Union's laboratory in Germany linked the strain
found in Norfolk, Sussex and Essex to one that already exists on their
files. The discovery has raised the possibility that the latest emergence
of the disease, last seen in Britain 14 years ago, could be a new strain.
Andrea Dahmen, an EC spokesman, said that it was not clear in which Asian
country the virus had originated. "It is a new strain, but it is similar
to the one that came from Asia. It could be a mutation but it's too early
to tell," she said. It is not the same strain as the virus that sparked a
swine fever outbreak wreaking havoc in The Netherlands, Germany, Italy and
Spain.

Swine Fever Virus in UK since June
----------------------------------
Epidemiological investigations by the Ministry of Agriculture have revealed
the classical swine fever (CSF) virus responsible for 5 outbreaks this
month, has probably been in the United Kingdom since mid-June.
The first farm infected was an outdoor "multiplier" breeding unit with 1685
sows and piglets, but the first case of obvious illness was in a nursery
unit of 3500 young pigs supplied by the breeding farm. The Nursery pig
rearing unit reported signs of illness on 4 Aug 2000 and was confirmed as
infected on 8 Aug 2000. The 3500 weaned pigs were kept in 7 houses. There
had been illness on the farm since 11 Jul 2000 when weaned pigs introduced
from the breeding farm. Infection had spread to 4 houses, 1110 pigs were
ill or unthrifty and 200 dead when Ministry vets arrived.
Clinical signs seen were: lethargy, yellow diarrhoea, incoordination, fever
and excessive thirst. Skin lesions were present in some pigs, ranging from
cyanotic patches on ears and abdomen to raised scabby lesions mainly on legs.
Necropsies revealed chronic pneumonia, chronic peritonitis, swollen pale
kidneys and enlarged, sometimes hemorrhagic, submaxillary lymph nodes.
Initial study of virus isolates in the UK suggested the virus was related
to other recent European outbreaks, but RNA sequencing of the genome in
Hannover has indicated the virus is of Asian origin.

The European Union Commission said late Friday the recent outbreak of
classical swine fever (CSF) in England was caused by an Asian strain of the
infection from illegal imports into the EU. The Commission said it was
wrong earlier in the day when it blamed the outbreak of CSF in East Anglia
on Asian boars. The spokeswoman said the strain could also have been caused
by illegal imports of Asian pigs. "It is an Asian strain, perhaps from a
wild boar or from pork. In either case its an Asian source, and it is
illegal to import boars or pork into the EU from Asia," said an EU.
spokeswoman.
The E.U. spokeswoman said the reference laboratory for CSF for the EU in
Hannover has established the strain emanated from Asia but hasn't yet
established from which country it orginated.
The 15-member EU provisionally banned English exports of live pigs and pig
semen until 31 Aug 2000 after an outbreak of swine fever was reported in
East Anglia 8 Aug 2000.
