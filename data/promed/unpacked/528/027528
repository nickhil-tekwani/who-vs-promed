The owner of a 16 000 acre [approx 6500 ha] sheep and goat ranch in
Val Verde county submitted a freshly dead ewe for examination. His
veterinarian carried out a necropsy on the ranch and various viscera
were submitted for examination and analysis at College Station TVMDL
[Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratories]. _Bacillus
anthracis_ was cultured and identified.

Over the previous 4 weeks a scattering of dead sheep were found but
all had been dead for some time before discovery (that is, the
vultures had been at them). There is no prior history of anthrax on
this ranch.

[I have spoken with the owner of this ranch and apparently cases only
occurred in his sheep, none in the goats or white tail deer. It is
very late for anthrax cases in Texas. Normally any outbreaks cease in
mid-October. But this [2010] has been a bad year for this disease in
the western half of the Edwards Plateau with a common history of
cases being found on individual affected ranches over some 4 to 6
weeks.

The only reason I can dredge up to explain this late outbreak is that
it has not been raining there and therefore the blow-fly
contamination, in a radius of some 3 m about any affected carcass,
has persisted and not been washed off by rain. We have noted dry
fly-vomit (little black dots around 0.5 mm in diametre) both on
browse and forage. Thus any animal wandering by and tempted to feed
would be at risk.

Obviously there is still much to be learnt. This ranch could well
have been infected by wandering biting flies with contaminated
mouthparts. - Mod.MHJ]
