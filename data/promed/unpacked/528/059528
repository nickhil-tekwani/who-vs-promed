A dangerous new type of e-mail virus emerged on Tuesday, able to destroy
information on computers even when users are careful not to fully open the
messages.
The virus, nicknamed "Bubbleboy'' after an episode of the TV show
"Seinfeld,'' was e-mailed late Monday to researchers at Network Associates,
a computer security company in Santa Clara. The virus appears as a black
screen with the words "The Bubbleboy incident, pictures and sounds'' in
white letters.
The company put a free software patch capable of blocking the attack on
their Web site Tuesday.
"This ushers in the next evolution in viruses. It breaks one of the
long-standing rules that you have to open an e-mail attachment to become
infected,'' said Network Associates spokesman Sal Viveros. "That's all
changed now.''
The company isn't certain who sent the virus, but researchers believed its
threat is so serious that they notified the FBI on Tuesday, said Vincent
Gullotto, director of the company's virus detection team. "It could
basically disable your PC easily,'' Gullotto said. "This could be a
watershed.''
The virus sent Monday night was more playful than destructive as it wormed
its way through a computer's hard drive, renaming the computer's registered
owner as "Bubbleboy'' and making other references to "Seinfeld.'' It also
takes every address in a computer's e-mail program and passes the virus
along.
"Bubbleboy'' only requires that the e-mail be previewed on the Inbox screen
of Microsoft's Outlook Express, a popular e-mail program. As soon as the
e-mail is highlighted, without so much as a click of a mouse, it infects the
computer.
The virus affects computers with Windows 98 and some versions of Windows 95
that also use Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0 and Outlook Express Web
browser and e-mail programs. It apparently does not affect Netscape's
e-mail programs, Gullotto said.
Even without Network Associates' software patch, there is an easy fix.
Enabling Microsoft's highest-security filter will block such e-mails and
keep the virus from entering.
