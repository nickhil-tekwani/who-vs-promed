On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the 5th WMC, it is a
pleasure to invite you to come to Khon Kaen, Thailand to celebrate
again the major scientific gathering on melioidosis that takes place
every 3 years. This provides a unique opportunity for you to update
your knowledge in cutting edges areas of melioidosis and to meet the
internationally renowned leaders in the field of melioidosis and related areas.
It is also an ideal opportunity to use this as a forum to discuss
your own research problems with your old acquaintances and to make
new contacts with leaders in the field. You and your colleagues will
also have a chance to present the original research findings at this
congress. Almost every conceivable aspect of melioidosis is represented.
We look forward to your presence and participation and are waiting to
welcoming you in our typically hospitable Thai fashion.
Surasakdi Wongratanacheewin, Ph.D.
Chair, The organizing committee
