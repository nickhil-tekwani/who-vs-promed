and cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission
season, ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and
human cases in the US states and Canadian provinces for the current
reporting period. Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus
detection in birds, mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines, as
well as a breakdown of human disease cases for 2008, can access that
