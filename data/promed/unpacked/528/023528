[The death of the 15-year-old teenager reported as a confirmed human
case of avian (H5N1) influenza, on the basis of diagnostic tests
carried out locally, has not been confirmed as a case of avian
influenza by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. ProMED-mail regrets
the confusion. No information is available yet regarding the
suspected cluster of avian influenza cases in Sulawesi. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia says teenager tests negative for bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
Tests on an Indonesian girl reported to have died of bird flu proved
negative for the deadly strain of the virus, the health minister said
Thursday [13 Nov 2008]. Siti Fadilah Supari said the 15-year-old
girl, who died in hospital in the Central Java city of Semarang on 7
Nov 2008, was not carrying the H5N1 strain. "Both tests came back
negative," she said.

The girl, who lived near a chicken slaughterhouse, died 10 days after
complaining of flu-like symptoms. Indonesia has been the country
hardest hit by bird flu, with its official toll of 112 deaths
accounting for nearly half of worldwide deaths from the disease. The
H5N1 virus typically spreads from bird to human through direct
contact, but experts fear it could mutate into a form easily
transmissible between humans, with the potential to kill millions in
a pandemic.
