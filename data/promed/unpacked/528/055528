The Illustrious Official College of Veterinarians of Caceres has warned that several farm veterinarians have reported to the Animal Health Service a sudden increase in deaths of cattle and horses in farms in the municipalities of Casas de Don Pedro, Talarrubias, Navalvillar de Pela, and Acedera.

"Initially, and after the clinical performance of a veterinarian in one of the affected farms, it was concluded that the enterotoxemia of the animals had been caused by _Clostridium perfringens_," explains the Official College of Veterinarians of Caceres on its website.

Later, a horse was admitted to the Caceres Veterinary School, where it died. In the 1st laboratory results, a 1st isolation was detected due to the possibility that it was infected by anthrax (an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_). This possibility has yet to be confirmed by the Santa Fe National Reference Laboratory.

On the other hand, before the appearance of symptoms compatible with the disease, vaccination against bacterial carbuncle is recommended in the affected farms.

[We seem to be witnessing a slow realisation that a large series of livestock deaths due to anthrax may be occurring on farms in the multiple municipalities of Casas de Don Pedro, Talarrubias, Navalvillar de Pela, and Acedera. We look forward to a proper clarification following a regional veterinary investigation. For those who may not have ever been involved in such, I'll point out that one should look for bloody soil where carcasses may have laid, and if any skulls remain, to use a cotton swab to swab the nasal turbinates. These thin bone structures in the nasal cavity are rich with capillaries and blood. Being very close to air and oxygen, spores form quickly and in large numbers, and can be readily sampled. Field studies in Texas have shown that these turbinate spores are robust and can be recovered in skulls more than 3 years old and lying on the ground in the sun.

Extremadura is in southern Spain on the Portuguese border. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
