For the 1st time, fireblight has been detected in commercial fruit production in Norway. The infectious plant disease was found on apple trees of Gravenstein [variety].

The trees that were discovered in an orchard in Strand in Rogaland [county], were planted in the autumn of 2019 and the spring of 2020 and are from the Netherlands. There are occurrences of fireblight [and] also beehives [see comments below] in the area, but this is the 1st finding in a [commercial planting since] fireblight was 1st found in Norway in 1986.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority cannot yet determine whether the infection comes from imported plants or from other plants in the immediate area. Measures to map the extent and find out [the source] have been implemented.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the Rosaceae are affected, mainly the sub-family Maloideae (synonym Pomoideae), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and wild species (such as hawthorns) serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections. The pathogen is included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators, such as the bees mentioned above), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers) and with plant material (including budwood).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is fraught with risks (see also ProMED-mail posts 20200629.7519826 & 20190320.6377319).

Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.
