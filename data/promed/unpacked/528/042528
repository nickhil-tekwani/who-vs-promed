Health officials in Uganda have launched a yellow fever [YF]
vaccination drive in the north where an outbreak of the disease has
caused 53 deaths and 224 infections in 10 districts since late 2010.
Almost a million people are expected to be vaccinated in the campaign,
launched by Health Minister Richard Nduhura on 23 Jan [2011]. The
outbreak of yellow fever last year [2010] was so mysterious because
the disease was first thought to be [an] Ebola[virus infection] and
then pneumonic plague, and then later on it was identified by the
Ministry of Health as yellow fever.

The disease first hit Abim and Agago districts, but later on spread
to Kitgum and other 10 districts in northern Uganda. Nathan
Kenya-Mugisha, the acting Director General of Health Services and
experts from the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization,
and the Centers for Disease Control positively confirmed the disease.
A total of 174 people have been affected by yellow fever. Of these, 45
people died in 10 districts of Northern Uganda that include Abim,
Lamwo, Kitgum, Pader, Gulu, Arua, Kaabong, Nebbi, Agago, and Lira
districts.

Yellow fever, which had not been seen in Uganda for about 40 years,
has claimed the lives of 48 individuals in the north of the country,
sending 187 others to hospital.

Doctors and local leaders in northern Uganda worked tirelessly to
find the true cause and prevent the spread of the unknown disease at
the time. Radio announcements and other means of sensitization were
used by the government of Uganda and the World Health Organization.
Residents were advised that anybody who presents suffering high
fevers, muscle and back pain, headache, shivering, loss of appetite
abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, should report to the nearest
health facility for treatment.

Meanwhile, the ministry of health has also disclosed plans to carry
out yellow fever vaccination in northern Uganda. The plans for the
vaccination came out because of the many deaths and continued spread
of infections in the districts of Kitgum, Abim, Agago, Lamwo, Pader,
Gulu, Arua, and Kaabong.

All foreign diplomatic services are advising their citizens to avoid
traveling to northern Uganda unless vaccinated. And today [27 Jan
2011], as the vaccination is going on, local leaders say they fear
there may not be sufficient medicine as people are coming from far and
wide.

John Bosco Ogwok, Kitgum district local council chairman, said they
were vaccinating people from the neighboring country, Sudan, who were
coming for the exercise. Vaccination points, Ogwok said, especially
those near the border with Southern Sudan, have registered large
numbers of Sudanese, while Ugandans from neighboring districts such as
Gulu and Lira have also turned up for vaccination. Grace Ogwang, a
nursing officer in Kitgum district coordinating outpost vaccination
points, said that health officials were vaccinating everyone who
turned up. "Our ethics in the practice of medicine is
non-discrimination; whether you are from Kitgum or not, we don't
discriminate," Ogwang said. "We are vaccinating everybody coming to
the vaccination point, so long as you are above 6 months of age."

Kitgum is one of the 5 districts where the 1st phase of vaccination
is taking place in northern Uganda. The others are Pader, Lamwo,
Agago, and Abim. Health Minister Nduhura said the remaining districts
in the north would begin the programme during a 2nd phase whose start
date depended on resolving funding issues.

In Africa, World Health Organization [WHO] estimates 508 million
people in 32 countries (including Uganda) are at risk. The number of
yellow fever cases has increased over the past 2 decades due to
declining population immunity to infection, deforestation,
urbanization, population movements, and climate change.

In the case of Uganda, the genomic sequencing of the virus strain
responsible for the current yellow fever outbreak is 98 percent
identical to the East African Couma-Ethiopia genotype, according to a
WHO brief. This is an indication that the virus has been circulating
in the region.

Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sudan reported yellow
fever outbreaks in 1992-1993. A recent outbreak occurred in Sudan in
2003.

[The 27 Jan 2011 edition of The Monitor (via AllAfrica.com)
(<http://allafrica.com/stories/201101270025.html>) reported that mass
immunisation against yellow fever in northern Uganda has started. The
exercise, which kicked off on Saturday (22 Jan 2011), is intended to
cover at least one million people in 5 districts of Abim, Arua,
Kitgum, Lamwo, and Pader. The assistant commissioner National Disease
Control, Dr Issa Makumbi, yesterday (26 Jan 2011) said immunisation
would be complete by 29 Jan 2011.

Northern Uganda has been battling the disease since October 2010.
Since the outbreak began, at least 51 people have succumbed to the
disease and 200 others are infected. It has taken the government close
to 2 months to secure half the amount of the vaccine required. The
number of cases and deaths in this report is higher than that of the
report cited in Allvoices above, but less than the total of 226 cases
compatible with the clinical case definition including 53 deaths that
have been reported by 12 districts in northern Uganda in the WHO
Global Alert and Response (GAR)
(<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_01_19/en/index.html>; see
ProMED-mail archive no 20110119.0233). Does that mean that case
reporting in 2 of these 3 reports is incorrect? Or perhaps it reflects
the difficulty in case finding and reporting in this relatively remote
area.
