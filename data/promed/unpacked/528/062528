Report from: Global Polio Eradication Initiative
http://www.polioeradication.org/tabid/488/iid/299/Default.aspx
-----------------
An investigation team is in Dadaab, Kenya following reports of a child paralyzed by wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). This is the 1st WPV case confirmed in Kenya since July 2011. The location is close to the border with Somalia, where a child was paralyzed by polio in the capital Mogadishu on [18 Apr 2013]. Dadaab hosts a major refugee camp, housing nearly 500 000 persons from across the Horn of Africa, including from Somalia.

An initial outbreak response is expected to start next week, following international outbreak response standards. Somalia has already conducted an emergency response in the Banadir region including and around Mogadishu.

Countries across the Horn of Africa are now at significant risk of this outbreak due to large-scale population movements and persistent immunity gaps in some areas. In 2005, polio spread from the Horn of Africa and across the Gulf of Aden to cause a devastating outbreak in Yemen, which left 479 children paralysed for life. The adoption of international outbreak response standards and the development of new vaccines since then -- when fully implemented with high-quality vaccination operations -- have considerably reduced the severity and duration of such outbreaks.

[While one suspects that this newly reported WPV1 case will most likely have a WPV1 virus identified as genetically similar to the WPV1 identified in the 32-month old Somalian child from Banadir (see below and prior ProMED-mail report Poliomyelitis update (04): Somalia, global 20130512.1707335 for details on the Somalian case), the possibility that this case represents another line of transmission remains present.

In 2011 (see prior ProMED-mail report Poliomyelitis - worldwide (13): Kenya, China, Pakistan 20110920.2860), there were 3 cases of WPV1 in the Western Province of Kenya that were identified genetically as related to one found in Uganda's Bugiri in District in 2010. In 2009, there was a case of WPV1 in northern Kenya (near the border with Sudan) genetically related to a WPV1 circulating in Sudan. In 2006, there were 2 cases of WPV1 identified in the Hagadera Refugee Camp in Dadaab Division, Garissa District, North Eastern Province in Somalian refugees (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below).

More information on the epidemiology investigation of this case (age, sex, nationality, history of travel or contact with known travellers) and genetic studies on the WPV1 isolate would be greatly appreciated.

Data in WHO as of 15 May 2012 for 2012 data and 14 May 2013 for 2013 data.

Afghanistan
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 2. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [28 Mar 2013] (WPV1 from Kunar).
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar).

Nigeria
- 4 new WPV cases were reported in the past week (WPV1s from Borno, Kano, Taraba and Yobe), bringing the total number of cases for 2013 to 22. The cases from Borno and Taraba are the most recent WPV cases in the country, both with onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2013].
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [24 Nov 2012] (from Kebbi).

Pakistan
- 2 new WPV cases were reported in the past week (WPV1s from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - KP, and Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2013 to 8. The case from FATA is the most recent WPV case in the country (and the 1st WPV from FATA in 2013), and had onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2013].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [10 Apr 2013] (from FATA).
- 2 new positive environmental samples were confirmed this week, WPV1s from Gadap, Sindh (collected [11 Apr 2013]) and Peshawar, KP (collected [12 Apr 2013]). This year [2013], 16 environmental samples positive for WPV1 have been reported (of which 11 were collected in Peshawar and Hyderabad, Sindh).
- The security situation continues to be monitored closely, in consultation with law enforcement agencies. Immunization activities continue to be implemented, in some areas staggered or postponed, depending on the security situation at the local level.

Chad
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (onset of paralysis on [4 Feb 2013] from Salamat).

Horn of Africa
- One new WPV case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Banadir, Somalia), with onset of paralysis on [18 Apr 2013]. It is the 1st WPV in Somalia since March 2007. It is the 1st outbreak outside of an endemic country in 2013.
- The child is a 32-month-old girl from Banadir region.
- An outbreak response activity is being conducted this week (14-16 May 2013), to reach 350 000 children across Banadir (including Mogadishu). Further campaigns are being planned.
- In large areas of south-central Somalia, immunization campaigns have not been implemented since 2009 due to inaccessibility, affecting more than 500 000 children aged less than 5 years. Populations in this area are at particular risk of this polio outbreak. This is also the area affected by an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak, which has resulted in 18 cases in the country since 2009 (most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [9 Jan 2013]).

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- Multi-country immunization campaigns will be held on 24-27 May 2013, using trivalent OPV, across West Africa. The activity follows a multi-country campaign at end-April 2013 in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone to reach nearly 30 million children under the age of 5 years. Niger will conduct subnational immunization activities on [15-18 Jun 2013].

[According to the latest data available on the Polio Eradication Initiative website, there have been a total of 34 cases of WPV-associated disease confirmed since the beginning of 2013 (this total includes the newly reported case from Kenya and is not included in the table presented above, as the date of report was 17 May 2013, and the table above is current with data as of 14 May 2013).

There are now 2 cases of WPV1 disease reported in 2013 from outside of the 3 known polio endemic countries. The occurrence of these 2 new cases suggests that there is ongoing circulation of WPV in the Horn of Africa.

One of the indicators of pockets of inadequate polio vaccination coverages in a country is the presence of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Since the beginning of 2012, cVDPV2 cases have been identified in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chad, Somalia, Nigeria, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In this same period (since the beginning of January 2012), WPV associated disease has been confirmed in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chad, Somalia, Nigeria and Kenya. One cannot help but wonder whether there is concurrent WPV transmission ongoing (albeit silently at present) in the DRC as well.

In referring to the newly identified case in Kenya, the Polio Eradication Initiative statement "Countries across the Horn of Africa are now at significant risk of this outbreak, due to large-scale population movements and persistent immunity gaps in some areas" is highly appropriate. Unfortunately, the areas with ongoing WPV transmission in the world include areas with civil unrest and security risks for vaccination workers, the latter situation hard to comprehend from the outside looking in. It is a sorry situation when propaganda leads to violence against workers who are trying to provide life saving and morbidity protection to the children in an area.
