The food vendor at the Canadian National Exhibition responsible for 2013's international headline-garnering Cronut Burger was shut down Tuesday night, 20 Aug 2013, after at least a dozen people displayed symptoms of gastrointestinal illness.

While Toronto Public Health has not confirmed the Cronut Burger is behind the outbreak, Epic Burgers and Waffles is the "focus" of their investigation and the only vendor closed for inspection, a spokesperson says.

"Toronto Public Health food safety inspectors are currently there doing our own investigation," spokesperson Kris Scheuer said. "We don't yet know until we do the food samples and talk to staff ... to know if [the Cronut Burger] is the cause of the illness. But that is the focus of the investigation, and that place is still closed, so it is not a further health hazard at the moment."

At least 2 people said they became sick after eating the Cronut Burger, this year's [2013] belly-busting stunt eat, which is a deep-fried doughnut-croissant hybrid stuffed with meat and cheese and topped with maple bacon jam.

"Definitely not feeling sorry for myself, though last night [20 Aug 2013] wasn't pleasant," one person told the Post. "I think I'm going to need to rest up a bit, exhausted from minimal sleep last night." The woman said on Twitter that the only other thing she had at the CNE besides the burger was a Coke. A 2nd person also said they became sick after eating the Cronut Burger.

Jim Chan, manager at Toronto Public Health, said the people affected ate at about noon and reported feeling ill at about 6 pm. It will take about 48 to 72 hours for tests results. Chan said while they are only probing Epic Burgers and Waffles at the moment, they have had reports of those sick eating at other establishments. In order to re-open, all food must be removed from the premises and fresh food brought in to the burger vendor, Public Health says.

CNW Group/Le DolciEpic Burgers and Waffles, known for their heart-stopping burgers, created The Bacon Jam Cronut Burger with Le Dolci, Toronto's fun foodie studio. The Cronut Burger is already being hailed by The Exhibtion as "the star" of the Canadian National Exhibition 2013.

Epic Burgers and Waffles was initially inspected on 16 Aug 2013 and received a full pass with no infractions. The opening weekend of the CNE, Toronto Public Health performed about 200 inspections in total, with 17 conditional passes and one ticket. The CNE was responsible for the initial closure of the vendor Tuesday night, 20 Aug 2013. "The Canadian National Exhibition, in conjunction with Toronto Public Health, took immediate action to determine what caused patrons to fall ill at the fair last evening [20 Aug 2013]. An expert team is onsite at the CNE investigating the situation," the CNE said.

Five people were taken to hospital for further treatment after falling sick Tuesday [20 Aug 2013], EMS spokeswoman Kim McKinnon said. Toronto Public Health, in coordination with Communicable Disease Control, are working to talk to everyone who fell ill and expects the number of people who reported to be ill to rise. Toronto pastry shop Le Dolci, which teamed up with Epic Burgers and Waffles to make the treat, initially said they expected to sell between 500 and 1000 burgers a day. The shop did not immediately return a request for comment.

CNE spokesperson Daniel St. Germaine told the National Post they are aware of the situation and initially referred further questions to Toronto Public Health. The CNE is famous for the eye-opening calorie counts in its quirky food offerings. This year's [2013] trendy treats include the Cronut Burger, Nutella fries, and a bacon and peanut butter milkshake. The CNE runs in Toronto until 2 Sep 2013.

[Although there are, as yet, only a handful of cases reported, it is likely that more may well become recognized despite a rapid response by the CNE. With a short incubation period of about 6 hours, the etiology may be a preformed toxin such as an enterotoxin from _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Clostridium perfringes_ rather than an infection with a bacterium or virus, which generally have longer incubation periods.

The Cronut (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronut) is a croissant-doughnut pastry initially developed by Chef Dominique Ansel for Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City and offered under the same name.
