PNEUMONIA, SNAKE, UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY: REQUEST FOR INFO

We have experienced heavy losses of snakes in our collection this Fall with
emphasis on pythons, especially Boelen's Pythons. Presenting signs have
been either death with hemorrhage from the oral cavity or 24-48 hrs of
rales/oral cavity mucus followed by death, whether antibiotics have been
started or not.
Thus far, gross pathology have been severe hemorrhagic, purulent to
diphtheritic pneumonia and histopathology has seemed more bacterial than
viral, although viral cultures are still pending. Bacterial cultures thus
far have been a mixed bag and no definitive trends have been noted.
In one area of the building with heavier morbidity/mortality, it was noted
that several humidifier vents are directed into the cage areas; one of
these vents had visible "slime" on the interior surface. Environmental
cultures were attempted to find a source or an etiologic agent for the
pneumonias: "slime", inside of a vent, and the mist stream from the
humidifier were cultured with swabs and submitted. No growth was obtained
from any of these sources !?
Does anyone have suggestions for an improved enviromental culture technique
that might help with this pneumonia storm?

[Can anyone provide helpful suggestions for Dr. Gamble in terms of
culturing the air handling systems or possible solutions to her snake
epidemic? We might get help from environmental engineers or swine
veterinarians, stange bedfellows I know, but disciplinary breadth is a
requirement these days. - Mod.PC]
