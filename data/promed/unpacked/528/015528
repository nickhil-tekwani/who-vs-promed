The number of deaths caused due to the Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever; CCHF] has increased to 5 in Sindh. With Eid ul Azha drawing closer, a rise is observed in the number of Congo virus cases, which is mainly caused by ticks that inhabit the skin of different animals.

According to a report released by the Sindh health department, 8 cases of Congo virus have been reported in the province from [1 Jan to 16 Jul 2019]. Of these, 3 were brought to the Aga Khan University Hospital [AKUH] for treatment, 2 to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), 2 to Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital and 1 to Dr. Ziauddin Hospital. All the patients who were being treated at the AKUH and JPMC succumbed to the disease.

The 1st death caused by Congo virus was reported in early June [2019]. [NSK], age 50, a resident of Metroville, was the 1st to be reported of being infected by the virus and was brought to the AKUH for treatment on [3 Jun 2019]. She died on the same day.

The 2nd death reported was of 36-year-old [WKA] who hailed from Quetta. Complaining of high fever and bleeding from the mouth and nose, he had come to Karachi for treatment and was diagnosed with Congo virus.

[WKA] died on [6 Jun 2019], during treatment at the AKUH. About a week after [WKA's] death, [ARAM's] death was reported. The 20-year-old youth was a resident of Taiser Town and died during treatment at the AKUH on [12 Jun 2019].

The other victims, who died during treatment at JPMC, included [TF], age 35, a resident of Orangi Town, and [MR], age 54, a resident of Sehwan Sharif. The deaths occurred in the months of February and March [2019].

The health department report says that the victims of the Congo virus comprised 89% males and 10% females, and those aged between 30 and 39 years were most prone to being infected.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, commonly known as the Congo virus, causes bleeding in the human body. In case of excessive bleeding, death of an individual is likely to occur.

The virus is carried by ticks that inhabit the skin of various animals. When these ticks bite humans or enter the bloodstream, the body gets infected by the Congo virus.

[In absence of an effective vaccine, taking measures to prevent exposure to the virus is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. WHO-recommended measures for prevention and control of CCHF are available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/.

In view of the Eid ul-Azha festival in a few weeks, information on preventive measures targeting those with potential for accidental or occupational exposure is already being disseminated by departments of health through print and electronic media in order to increase public awareness on possible exposure to ticks and CCHF virus. Use of tick repellents, wearing protective clothing and avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock are recommended. Ticks should be safely removed and not crushed with fingers (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/introduction.pdf?ua=1). Strict universal precautions should be taken with hospitalized cases to prevent nosocomial infections.

Individuals with contact with livestock and symptoms of hemorrhagic fever should seek immediate medical care. In absence of any specific treatment, general supportive treatment of symptoms with particular attention to fluid balance and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, oxygenation and hemodynamic support, and appropriate treatment of secondary infection can be provided. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF patients with some benefit (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/treatment/index.html). - Mod.UBA
