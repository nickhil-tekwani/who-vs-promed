In response to Dr. Gamble's inquiry regarding snake pneumonia, I would
strongly encourage her to continue diagnostic attempts including complete
necropsy, histopathology, bacterial culture and virus isolation attempts,
in addition to environmental evaluation.
A (if not the) most common cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in a snake
collection is ophidian paramyxovirus infection, frequently complicated by
secondary bacterial infection. I would suspect underlying virus infection
especially if a consistent bacterial pathogen is not isolated from multiple
snakes. Histopathologic lesions are not always pathognomonic for
paramyxovirus infection in snakes but a pathologist familiar with snake
histopathology should recognize suspicious lesions. Evaluation of organs
other than the lung can be especially revealing (pancreas, liver). In some
cases, pancreatic changes are more specific for this viral disease than
pulmonary changes. Isolation of this virus can be difficult and is best
attempted by those labs with reptile virology experience.
Two that we have worked with successfully are the University of Florida,
College of Veterinary Medicine (Dr. Elliott Jacobson) and the University of
Tennessee, College of Veterinary Medicine (Dr. Melissa Kennedy).

An e-mail was sent to me concerning the recent outbreak of pneumonia which
has been causing a high morbidity and mortality in snakes at the Dallas
Zoo. I understand that attempts for bacterial isolates have been somewhat
unsuccessful.
I have been working for the past 2 years on a reovirus isolated from the
CNS of a rattlesnake suffering from neurological dysfunctions, which was
responsible for about 50% morbidity in a breeding colony in Germany. Even
though the clinical symptoms described in your letter are not related a CNS
infection, they are classical reovirus-like symptoms. A group in Germany
has isolated 7 additional reovirus isolates from reptiles including two
from pythons. I am in the process of obtaining these isolates to further
characterize them with respect to other reoviruses including the
rattlesnake reovirus. The rattlesnake reovirus grows well in Vero Cells
(African green monkey kidney cells, ATCC), so perhaps you may want to
attempt to isolate virus in this cell line. I will be more than glad to
assist you in anyway possible.
