Since posting my comment to the above referenced report, I have had second
thoughts about it. This could be what Tom Monath calls "an erythematous
clupeid", a red herring. Until we hear from an authority in Malaysia, let
us not consider this a valid case report. We would feel worse about the
epidemiologic situation but better about the report if we had some
confirmation of virus isolation, PCR evidence for the presence of Nipah
viral RNA, or the presence of antibody in the patient.
Apparently, there have been other, similar reports, but none has been
confirmed as legitimate.

I think it is very important to remember that "retrovirus" is not
synonymous with "immunodeficiency," especially at a time when the
endogenous pig retrovirus is being discussed in the context of xenograft
safety. A wide variety of mammalian retroviruses have been described to
date, but only a few induce clinical immunodeficiency in the host.
Considering the number of host species in Malaysia that appear to have
shown seroconversion to the Nipah virus, there is no reason to believe that
the virus could not establish an endemic presence in the area, similar to
the behavior of other paramyxoviruses. Persistence
in the population does not require persistence in any one host.
