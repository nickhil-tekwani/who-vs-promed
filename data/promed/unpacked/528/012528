WHY I SUBSCRIBE TO ProMED-mail: CHWAN-CHUEN KING

From: Chwan-Chuen King <a1234567@ccms.ntu.edu.tw>

Dr. Lam from Malaysia and his colleagues have helped us so much in
understanding the enterovirus 71 disaster before we found out we had
the same problem in Taiwan. Although I was out of my country during
the outbreak, I picked it up quite fast from the ProMED-mail updated
information.
Because infectious diseases may transmit very fast and result in high
case fatality like EV71 in Taiwan last year, it is quite important to
share our experiences and knowledge with others and help each other in
this global village to conquer hazardous microorganisms.
I will support ProMED-mail myself and hope everybody enjoys it. A
rewarding system can encourage those enthusiastic persons. Dr. Lam
translates all Chinese newspapers for foreigners. I sincerely
appreciate his efforts.
Could we ask drug or vaccine companies to
donate money? I believe the epidemics can also be important
information for them too.
Happy New Year
