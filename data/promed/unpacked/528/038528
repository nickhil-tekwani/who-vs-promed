New avian flu case confirmed in Quebec poultry
----------------------------------------------
A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was confirmed in Quebec on [28 Jun 2022], making it the 1st HPAI case in a commercial poultry flock in Canada in nearly 3 weeks.

According to information on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website, the presence of the virus was confirmed in a commercial flock in La Jacques-Cartier, but the agency did not specify the type of flock or how many birds were involved.

This marks the 1st case of HPAI in Quebec since [4 May 2022] and the 1st case in a commercial flock in the province since [21 Apr 2022]. It also marks the 1st case in commercial poultry in Canada since [8 Jun 2022] when the virus was found in a commercial flock in Langley Township, British Columbia.

Earlier in the week, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) updated its report on the HPAI situation in Canada. The most recent figures put the total number of commercial poultry in Canada to be affected by the HPAI outbreak at more than 2 million, with the size of 1 flock yet to be reported.

Every province has had at least 1 confirmed HPAI case, whether it has been in a commercial flock, backyard flock, wild birds or a combination of 2 or more of these. However, the only provinces to have positive HPAI detections in commercial poultry are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan.

The current outbreak of HPAI in North America began when the virus was confirmed at an exhibition farm in Newfoundland and Labrador on 21 Dec 2021. However, the CFIA has not confirmed any new cases in that province since [9 Jan 2022].

Washington state leading nation in backyard flocks with bird flu
----------------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, has been detected in a backyard flock in Jefferson County, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Officials said Washington state now leads the nation in the number of backyard flocks with the bird flu.

According to officials, a total of 29 backyard flocks have been impacted.

"We're really facing an unprecedented situation," Dr. Itle, Washington state veterinarian, said. "Our staff has stepped up to the challenge and has done a tremendous job responding to these reports, identifying which flocks are infected, and taking quick action to limit the spread of the disease."

While the number of detections in backyard flocks is high, officials said the bird flu had not been detected in commercial flocks, as eggs are one of the state's top 10 commodities.

"Even though the extra biosecurity measures have put an extra burden on both backyard and commercial flock owners, the good news is that they are working," Itle said.

It has been recommended flock owners keep their birds confined and covered until 30 days after the last detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in the state.

"We could be in this for the long haul," Itle said.

Anyone who is experiencing a sudden death or illness of multiple birds in their flock is asked to call WSDA's Sick Bird Hotline.

Avian flu case reported in Jefferson County
-------------------------------------------
A household flock of domestic poultry in Jefferson County is the latest to be been found infected with avian flu in a state that leads the nation in backyard flocks with the virus.

Of the 28 backyard flocks in the state that have been discovered with avian influenza, or (HPAI) H5N1, one was discovered near Port Ludlow on Friday [1 Jul 2022], according to a map, and 2 were detected in eastern Clallam County in May [2022].

No other infected flocks have been found in either county, said Amber Betts, spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), on Wednesday [6 Jul 2022].

There is no vaccination or cure for the avian flu and it is always fatal, say health authorities, so all flocks in which the virus is detected are culled within 24 hours of test results. The one in Jefferson County was a mixed flock (chickens and/or geese or ducks) of fewer than 100 birds, Betts said; she did not have a more precise number.

Those culled in Clallam County were one flock of 10 chickens and one of 12 geese; those areas are no longer under surveillance.

The rest of the backyard flocks are "literally all over the state," Betts said.

The only good news is that no avian influenza has been detected in commercial flocks, thus protecting the food supply, she said. Eggs are regularly one of Washington's top 10 commodities with a value of over USD 220 million in 2020.

Dr. Allison Berry, health officer for Jefferson and Clallam counties, said that "thankfully, this strain of avian influenza is very unlikely to transmit to humans."

Despite the low risk to humans, Jefferson County Public Health (JCPH) is monitoring all human contacts for disease. JCPH will also follow up with testing and referral to treatment if needed, said Liz Anderson, county public health department spokesperson.

There are no known human cases of avian influenza in Washington state, authorities said.

Domestic flocks are thought to have been infected by wild fowl. Every flock in which avian flu has been found had contact with wild birds, Betts said.

"If there are wild waterfowl in the area, there is probably avian influenza," she said.

Migratory patterns suggest that the wild birds are coming from the south right now, Betts said.

"All of those flyways meet in the north (northern U.S. and Canada), so birds from Asia" and elsewhere across the water "and from our flyways meet and mingle and share their germs and the virus mutates, and then they come back down and spread it," she said.

So the expectation is that another surge of avian influenza is likely in the fall [2022], she said.

The present statewide surge in the virus is unprecedented, according to Dr. Amber Itle, state veterinarian, in a press release.

"Our staff has stepped up to the challenge and have done a tremendous job responding to these reports, identifying which flocks are infected, and taking quick action to limit the spread of the disease," she said.

"Even though the extra biosecurity measures (keeping flocks separate from wild fowl) have put an extra burden on both backyard and commercial flock owners, the good news is that they are working," Itle said. "Those that have kept their flocks isolated and have been careful not to bring the virus in themselves still have healthy flocks."

Itle recommends that flock owners keep their birds confined and covered until 30 days after the last detection of HPAI in the state. The unseasonably cold, wet conditions have caused both migratory birds and the virus to linger in the environment, she said.

"We could be in this for the long haul," Itle said. "In Europe, they have been dealing with this virus continuously for the past 18 months. While we hope that won't be the case here, it is a possibility and we should be prepared for it."

Domestic bird illness and death can be reported to the WSDA Avian Health Program. Report dead or sick wild birds using the state Department of Fish and Wildlife's online reporting tool.

To judge how close an infected flock is to other areas, see the WSDA map at https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5bb22df733ae49b29ac7b3cc3c7fc3e3.

Bird flu detected in Kitsap County, Washington, poultry show and sale suspension recommendation continues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A backyard flock in Kitsap County tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on [29 Jun 2022]. Kitsap is the 11th county with bird flu detected in domestic flocks, with 27 infected flocks statewide. All infected flocks have had contact with wild waterfowl, which are known to transmit the virus without showing signs.

Protecting uninfected flocks includes continuing to avoid fairs, exhibitions, poultry auctions, and on-farm sales until at least 30 days after the last detection.

"It's devastating for owners and our veterinarian alike. A fair or exhibition could be a venue to spread the virus resulting in the death of all birds attending the fair," Dr. Amber Itle, Washington state veterinarian said. "Although it is disappointing, we need to continue to take enhanced steps to protect our domestic flocks as long as we continue to have HPAI detections in the state."

The unseasonably cold, wet conditions have changed migration patterns of migratory birds and because of that, the virus continues to persist in the environment, state veterinarians believe.

If fairs choose to resume before the recommended time, Dr. Itle says enhanced biosecurity is critical to protecting poultry flocks from the accidental introduction of HPAI into your fairs. Please consider these additional biosecurity precautions to prevent infection as you resume exhibitions:
- Stagger show times and days for gallinaceous birds (chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl) and waterfowl (geese, ducks, swans).
- Show the vulnerable species first (gallinaceous) for the 1st few days, send them home, clean and disinfect the cages, and then bring in waterfowl for exhibition the 2nd half.
- Birds should be kept in individual cages and commingling of birds should be avoided at all times.
- Sick birds should be denied entry, sent home, and the state veterinarian should be notified on the sick bird hotline.
- Signage about avian influenza risks and signs should be posted.

WSDA has numerous resources for flock owners to learn about bird flu and protect their flocks, including a bird flu webpage with information about each confirmed flock with HPAI, an interactive map, frequently asked questions, as well as a Facebook group dedicated to updates about bird flu in Washington. The interactive map shows all detections statewide. The gray circle indicates where a detection was, but the monitoring period has passed.

Avian flu cases reported in Marion County
-----------------------------------------
On [30 Jun 2022], the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) reported a hobby/non-poultry flock in Marion County tested positive for the H5 avian influenza virus.

The hobby flock included a goose and a chicken.

They were tested after 2 wild birds in the area tested positive for HPAI.

As a result, local flocks in the surrounding areas need to be tested to ensure the virus has not spread.

BOAH staff said they will be reaching out to poultry owners within the surveillance zone to schedule testing as part of required area surveillance.

The BOAH report listed 9 commercial flocks in surrounding areas, but all their control areas have been lifted. They are cleared to restock poultry at the owners' discretion.

Wild bird surveillance is also working to monitor conditions of non-flock environments. They have sampled nearly 300 wild bird species in the area. So far positive tests have come back from 2 bald eagles, 2 red-tailed hawks, a redhead duck, 2 great-horned owls and a double-crested cormorant.

The wild bird species most likely to carry HPAI are waterbirds and raptors which do not typically visit bird feeders.

The BOAH advises hobby poultry owners should be aware of the signs of avian influenza and report illness and/or death to the USDA Healthy Birds Hotline.

The signs of avian influenza include:
- sudden death without clinical signs
- lack of energy or appetite
- decreased egg production
- soft-shelled or misshapen eggs
- swelling or purple discoloration of head eyelids, comb and hocks
- nasal discharge
- coughing
- sneezing
- lack of coordination
- diarrhea

Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk for people and poultry and eggs are safe to eat. Officials are not aware of any public health significance with this virus and no human cases have been reported.

Bird flu found in Carson City flock, state, federal agencies say
----------------------------------------------------------------
A case of bird flu has been found in Carson City, state and federal agencies said Friday [8 Jul 2022].

The 1st case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been discovered in a backyard flock of domestic birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Nevada Department of Agriculture.

A Friday [8 Jul 2022] news release from the state agency said "the affected premises has been quarantined, and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease in accordance with USDA guidelines."

Both agencies are encouraging bird owners practice health safety measures, including washing hands, limiting contact with birds and using protective coverings for clothing, hands and shoes.

The agencies also ask bird owners to quarantine and report any sick birds to the USDA, or the NDA (Nevada Department of Agriculture) state veterinarian Dr. Amy Mitchell at <amitchell@agri.nv.gov>.

"This detection further emphasizes the importance of domestic bird owners to develop and maintain plans to protect the health of their flock and prevent the transmission and further spread of disease," Mitchell said.

Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. However, sporadic human infections from flu viruses have occurred.

[Avian influenza still rages on in the Americas. I had hoped that with some of our high temperatures in many parts of the USA and Canada, and some migration routes not being as active, this virus might be dying out. However, these postings clearly indicate this nemesis is still plaguing our domestic birds and other animals it spills over into.

Clearly, vigilance to protect your birds cannot be relaxed. Keep your birds inside, and practice biosecurity until it is automatic and always in place.

For the birds, and for those dealing with these tragedies, we hope this situation abates. - Mod.TG
