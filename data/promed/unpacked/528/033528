[This report includes information released by official and other sources up
to Fri 6 Jul 2001, edited for presentation in ProMED-mail.
Since the preceding West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance report of Fri 29 Jun
2001, there have been no new reports of WNV-positive wild birds. Therefore
the tally of WNV-positive birds for 2001 remains at: New Jersey 14,
Maryland 4, New York 2, Rhode Island 2, Connecticut 1.
WNV-positive mosquitoes has been reported now from New Jersey and Delaware.
WNV-infected mosquitoes were not reported from Delaware in 1999 or 2000. -
Mod.CP
[Addendum: WNV has been reported in a crow in Florida. This is the
southernmost detection of WNV in the United States. See item [6, below. -

West Nile Virus-positive Mosquitoes Found at Little Creek, Delaware
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A sample of mosquitoes collected earlier this week in Little Creek, just
east of Dover, tested positive for West Nile virus; the first mosquitoes
carrying the virus found in Delaware. The discovery, announced on Fri 29
Jun 2001, prompted state health officials to recommend precautions to
protect against mosquito bites, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and
long pants outdoors, using insect repellents that contain 10 percent to 30
percent DEET and avoiding mosquito-infested areas. "These precautions,
along with avoiding the outdoors at dawn and dusk, are the best strategies
for preventing exposure," said Dr. Ulder J. Tillman, director of the State
Division of Public Health.
State officials sprayed insecticides in Little Creek, Leipsic, and East
Dover on 14 and 18 Jun 2001, because of nuisance complaints about
mosquitoes, said William Meredith, State Mosquito Control Administrator.
Additional mosquito samples will be tested in the area over the next
several days, and spraying will continue as needed. Meredith said his
agency and the State Department of Agriculture are working to control
mosquitoes and protect a commercial beekeeping operation in the area. The
aerial spray that is used to kill adult mosquitoes can kill honeybees.
In addition, state officials are working with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife
Service and Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge to coordinate spraying
there. Of particular concern are 2000 acres between Little Creek and
Leipsic, where a large population of adult mosquitoes lives. About 450
acres are in Bombay Hook, and spraying is allowed only when an incoming
tide is flooding the marsh. The restrictions sometimes make it hard to
spray the area, Meredith said. "It's created a little mosquito refuge." A
national policy on mosquito control on federal refuges is in the works,
said Michael Higgins, an entomologist and mosquito coordinator with the
U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
Delaware's first positive sample came from a pool of _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
The species has not been determined, but 2 types of _Aedes_ are common in
Delaware; the salt marsh mosquito and the freshwater mosquito that breeds
in standing water. The finding is troubling because both species will
travel 15 to 20 miles for a blood meal and will feed on mammals and birds.
West Nile virus has never been found in salt marsh mosquitoes, Meredith
said. West Nile was found in Delaware last year in 4 horses and a
great-horned owl; 2 of the horses recovered. No human cases have been
reported in the state.

A comment on West Nile Virus Outbreak Prospects
-----------------------------------------------
In West Nile virus Surveillance - USA (10) Mod. CP suggested that the
spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America might be slow until a less
virulent (for birds) strain of the virus evolves.
As far as I am aware, the avian lethality of WNV is more or less confined
to corvid species (crows, especially). Over 70 species of birds have been
reported to be affected, and some, like house sparrows, with moderately
high viremia and little virulence. It is also likely that a wide variety of
vertebrates, including many mammals, can be and have been infected.
Finally, the view that the evolution and adaptation of the host-parasite
relationship always involves a lessening of virulence is not necessarily
the case, as many studies indicate.
With respect to other vertebrates, including mammals, there has been little
surveillance, so we cannot say with any confidence how widespread
infections are in vertebrates. It is arguably common, depending upon the
presence of a bridge vector in the habitat. Because we do not understand
the dynamics I do not take arguments about year-to-year fluctuations
seriously. Moreover, the data cited are exquisitely dependent upon where
and in what we look for infection. My comment is not meant to weigh in on
the side of likely widespread endemicity, but rather to note that birds are
not usually victims or dead-end hosts; and that the evidence that other
vertebrates are dead-end hosts is essentially non-existent.

[My feeling remains that the spread of WNV will be determined by its
interaction with avian hosts, but I accept David Ozonoff 's caution that it
may be unsound to make predictions on the basis of the information
available at present. So far horses and humans have been the animal species
most affected by WNV, and the number of other animals confirmed as
WNV-positive in 2000 has been reduced from 26 to 6 (a skunk in Connecticut,
and 2 bats, a rabbit, a squirrel and another skunk in New York). However,
the picture may change this year now that more extensive surveillance
systems are in place. - Mod.CP

No New West Nile virus-positive Test Results
--------------------------------------------
All bird testing for West Nile virus is currently performed at the New
Hampshire Public Health Laboratories. Some birds are reported as
unsatisfactory for testing because they are decomposed. As of Fri 6 Jul
2001, 139 birds were negative for West Nile virus; 0 birds were positive
for West Nile virus; and 10 birds were unsatisfactory for testing.

been reported. The total number of West Nile virus-positive results for New
York for the year 2001 remains at: 2 dead birds; 1 in Rockland County and 1
in Westchester County.

Queens which is scored as "moderate". [In the previous 7-day period
Rockland and Staten Island were ranked as "moderate" - Mod.CP
