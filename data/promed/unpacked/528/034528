The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) confirmed Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1) in 2 horses in El Paso County [the westernmost county it Texas, sandwiched between Mexico and the US State of New Mexico - CopyEd.PG].

Both horses showed signs of respiratory illness, fever and nasal discharge, when evaluated by a local veterinarian. The horses tested positive for EHV-1 but neither horse showed signs of the neurologic form of the disease. The stable has been placed under movement restriction as a precaution, and all horses are being monitored daily.

To date, 74 horses linked to Sunland Park in New Mexico have been confirmed EHV-1 positive. Only 2 of the 74 horses are stabled near El Paso, Texas.

Direct horse-to-horse contact is a common route of transmission of the virus. Indirect transmission is also possible and occurs when infectious materials (nasal secretions, fluids from abortions, etc.) are carried between infected and non-infected horses by people or inanimate objects such as buckets, tack, trailers etc.

Signs of EHV-1 include fever, which is one of the most common clinical signs and often precedes the development of other signs. Respiratory signs include coughing and nasal discharge. Neurologic signs associated with EHV-1 are highly variable, but often the hindquarters are most severely affected. Horses with EHV-1 may appear weak and uncoordinated. Urine dribbling and loss of tail tone may also be seen. Severely affected horses may become unable to rise.

It is important to remember that none of these signs are specific to EHV-1, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. Many horses exposed to EHV-1 never develop clinical signs. If you suspect your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your veterinarian.

In general, exposed horses should be isolated and have their temperatures monitored twice daily for at least 14 days after last known exposure. If an exposed horse develops a fever or other signs consistent with EHV-1, diagnostic testing may be performed. Owners should work with their veterinary practitioner to establish appropriate monitoring and diagnostic plans for any potentially exposed horse(s).

For more information on protecting your livestock from EHV-1, contact your local TAHC regional office http://www.tahc.texas.gov/agency/TAHC_RegionalOfficeMap.pdf.

The equine herpes virus that affected 8 horses, 2 that were subsequently euthanized in January, affected another horse that was euthanized a little over a week ago. A state-issued 21-day quarantine on the farm now extends into March 2016.

Another horse at Bartlett's Sunset Hill Farm has died and subsequently tested positive for the strain of equine herpes virus that affected 8 horses [during January 2016] 2 of which were euthanized.

A co-owner of the farm, Georgette Litchfield, said the horse "just went down" about a week and a half ago. The Illinois Department of Agriculture received notification that the horse, who was euthanized, had tested positive for the virus Tuesday.

A state-issued 21-day quarantine on the farm would have been lifted this week if no additional horses had tested positive, but the quarantine now extends into March 2016.

Initial news of the virus spread through the suburban equine community [starting] 29 Jan 2016, and several farms issued voluntary quarantines in hopes of keeping the virus from spreading. So far, no cases have been reported at other farms.

EHV-1 can be transmitted through the air, contaminating equipment, clothing and hands, which can then be spread to horses.

The Illinois Department of Agriculture will lift the quarantine only after all signs of the disease have been absent for 21 days, department spokeswoman Rebecca Clark said. Illinois does not require veterinarians and farms to report the virus, but once it is reported, the state controls the issuing and lifting of quarantines.

Incubation for EHV-1 is typically 10 days, and typically signs of the virus are seen within 3 days.

In severe cases of the virus, horses are unable to stand.

The private farm, located at 8N190 Naperville Road in Illinois, houses 35 horses.

Turf Paradise ended its quarantine on 18 Feb 2016, which prevented horses from leaving or entering the stable area since Jan. 28 in response to the presence of equine herpesvirus.

In cooperation with the track, the Arizona Department of Agriculture declared a 21-day quarantine at the stable area after 3 horses were transported from Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino to Turf Paradise. When word broke of an outbreak of EHV-1 at Sunland, the Arizona track immediately had the 3 horses moved to isolated pens a half-mile from the main stable population of 1700 horses. 1 of those 3 horses tested positive and died from the virus. The other 2 horses show no signs of illness.

No other horses at Turf Paradise have shown symptoms of the virus. In addition, any horses that were housed briefly with the infected New Mexico horse have been tested and do not have the virus.

As part of the quarantine, Turf Paradise initiated comprehensive disinfectant protocols facility-wide as an additional measure of protection. Live racing at Turf Paradise continued during the quarantine.

As an extra precaution, Turf Paradise will not be accepting any horses from Texas or New Mexico. In addition, any horses brought to Turf Paradise will be placed in isolation and tested for the virus, and won't be admitted until it's determined they are not infected.

"While our protocols have gone beyond what is required, we feel an abundance of caution is the best approach," said Turf Paradise general manager Vince Francia. "We thank the horsemen and women for their patience and their efforts during the quarantine and moving forward as we ensure the health and safety of our horses."

A New York mare has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 16 Feb 2016.

On 12 Feb 2016, "an aged Quarter Horse mare, from Chemung County, displaying only recurrent fever, inappetance, and nasal discharge was confirmed positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1 on PCR," the EDCC statement read. "The mare and all other horses on the farm are quarantined. Biosecurity measures and twice daily temperature monitoring are in place."

The statement indicated that the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets will continue to monitor the situation.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Update on EHV-1 virus at Sunland Park Racetrack
---------
To simplify our reporting on the rapidly-changing EHV-1 virus outbreak at the Sunland Park Racetrack, we will update the list below regularly with the most current information. While the situation warrants, we will also e-mail blast this information as it is updated.

Number of horses diagnosed positive for the EHV-1 virus to-date: 72 in New Mexico and 2 in Texas
Number of horses released today from the isolation barn: 2
Number of exposed barns that have been returned to non-exposed status to-date: 17
List of facilities within the quarantine perimeter:
Sunland Park Racetrack and Frontera Training Center.

Biosecurity measures among horsemen and women are still necessary, such as taking temperatures twice a day, handwashing, washing/disinfecting anything a horse has touched or could touch, etc.

The article below is from the American Association of Equine Practioners in Q&A format providing lots of useful information regarding the EHV virus. We have also linked to the original press release and a 1 Feb 2016 overview, though the information above may be considered a later update..

[1. What is equine herpesvirus (EHV)?
EHV are viruses that are found in most horses all over the world. Almost all horses have been infected with the virus and have no serious side effects. It is unknown what causes some of the horses to develop the serious neurological forms that may be fatal.

2. EHV stands for equine herpes virus. It is a family of viruses which are named by numbers such as EHV 1, 3, 4. There are more viruses in this family, but EHV 1, 3, 4 pose the most serious health risks.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. 3 of these, EHV-1, EHV-3 and EHV-4, pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is another name for the neurologic disease associated with equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections.

- EHV-1: Can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion and neonatal death.
- EHV-3: Causes a venereal disease called coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.
- EHV-4: Causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurological disease.

EHV is a common DNA virus that occurs in horse populations worldwide. The 2 most common strains are EHV-1, which causes abortion, respiratory disease and neurologic disease; and EHV-4, which usually causes respiratory disease only but can occasionally cause abortion and rarely neurological disease.

Respiratory disease caused by EHV is most common in weaned foals and yearlings, often in autumn and winter. Adult horses are more likely than younger ones to transmit the virus without showing signs of infection.

EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy (EHM) results from widespread vascular or blood vessel injury after damage to the lining of the blood vessels of the blood-brain barrier. Neurologic signs result from inflammation of the blood vessels, blood clots, and death of of neurologic tissue. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) cases occur singly or can affect multiple exposed horses. They may or may not be associated with a previous or ongoing EHV-1 respiratory disease outbreak.

3. How does EHV spread?
EHV-1 is contagious and spread by direct horse-to-horse contact via the respiratory tract through nasal secretions. It is important to know that this disease can also be spread indirectly through contact with physical objects contaminated with the virus:

- Human contaminated hands or clothing
- Contaminated equipment and tack
- Contaminated trailers used for transporting horses
- Contaminated wipe rags or other grooming equipment
- Contaminated feed and water buckets

The air around the horse that is shedding the virus can also be contaminated with infectious virus. Although it is known that the virus can be airborne, it is difficult to establish the distance the virus can spread in this manner under typical horse management and environmental conditions.

4. How long can the virus live outside of the horse's body? This includes on clothing, footwear, walls, buckets, tack, etc.
The virus is estimated to be viable for up to 7 days in the environment under normal circumstances, but remain alive for a maximum of 1 month under perfect environmental conditions. Most important is to 1st clean equipment and horse housing areas. (Please Note: It is really important to wash and rinse where you can prior to applying disinfectants.) By cleaning before that, this allows for removal or organic material which makes the disinfectants more effective. After this cleaning, follow with a disinfection process. The virus is easily killed in the environment by most disinfectants. Conventional disinfectants and detergents are the best. It is important to perform hand hygiene (wash hands with soap and dry thoroughly or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer) when moving between horses that are grouped separately to avoid spreading pathogens that may contaminate your hands.

5.What are some of the signs of EHV?
After infection, the incubation period may be as short as 24 hours, but is typically 4-6 days, but can be longer. EHV-1 typically causes a biphasic (2-phase) fever peaking on day 1 or 2 and again on day 6 or 7. With respiratory infections there is often serous or mucoid nasal and ocular discharge, but not a lot of coughing. There may be some persistent enlargement of submandibular lymph nodes (lymph nodes under the jaw). With the neurologic form there are typically minimal respiratory signs, with fever (rectal temperature greater than 102 degrees F) being the only warning sign. Neurologic disease appears suddenly and is usually rapidly progressing, reaching its peak intensity within 24 to 48 hours from onset of neurologic signs. Clinical signs of the neurologic disease may include:

- Nasal discharge
- Incoordination
- Hind limb weakness
- Loss of tail tone
- Lethargy
- Urine dribbling
- Head tilt
- Leaning against a fence or wall to maintain balance
- Inability to rise

6. How is EHM diagnosed?
Diagnosis of EHM is based on clinical signs and isolation of the virus. Diagnostics performed by your veterinarian may include:
- Nasal swab collection for laboratory examination and detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and/or by virus isolation
- Blood collection to detect virus by PCR assay or by virus isolation.
- Blood samples should be collected 2 to 3 weeks apart for levels of antibodies specific to EHV-1.

7. Is it safe to travel with my horse? (i.e. trail ride, horse show, etc.)
Consult with your local and state/provincial veterinarian's office regarding any newly developed travel restrictions.

Safety and precaution is always recommended, even when an outbreak has not occurred. Biosecurity is important at all times. Please see the AAEP's recommendations for biosecurity.

8. If I'm involved with hosting an equine event or show, should the event/show continue or should it be cancelled or does it depend on the location of the event?
It is advised to seek updates from the event organizer and from State Animal Health Officials.

9. How do I handle horses returning from events where they may have been exposed to EHV?
Infections other than EHV-1 can also spread by horse-to-horse contact, so keeping a horse with a fever isolated is a very good practice in any case. However, any horse returning from any event should be isolated to prevent the spread of any infectious disease whether there is a fever or not.

If you handle a horse with EHV-1 and don't wash your hands or change clothing, the infection may be transmitted to other horses. A solution of 1 part chlorine bleach to 10 parts water is effective for decontaminating equipment and environment. (Washing clothing in hot water with detergent and drying in a dryer is adequate and less damaging to clothing.) Click here for more biosecurity cleaning measures.

If your horse develops fever, respiratory signs or neurological signs, immediately notify your veterinarian and do not move the horse or horses in the immediate area. Alert those who have horses in the adjacent area to cease all movement of horses in and out of the facility until a diagnosis is confirmed by testing and a targeted plan for control of spread of disease is developed in consultation with your veterinarian.

For horses that may have been exposed to the infectious agents and therefore at risk for disease, there are some steps to take to minimize the risk of spread of the disease to their home facility. Even if these horses are returning home from events at which no disease was reported, and even if these horses appear healthy, precautions are needed at this time as these horses could bring it home and spread it at their home farm - this is the classic way this disease spreads:

- These horses should be isolated from any other horses when they return to their home facility. Isolation requires housing them away from other horses (i.e. the horse should be stabled in a barn, turn-out shed, paddock or another area where there is no contact with other horses), using different equipment to feed, clean and work with them that is used with any other horses, and rigorous hygiene procedures for horse handlers (hand hygiene, wearing separate clothes when contacting the horses, etc.). Please discuss this with your veterinarian.
- We strongly advise owners to call their veterinarians to discuss how long to keep the horses isolated at home, but even if they don't develop fevers this should be at least 14-21 days.
- These horses should have their temperature taken twice a day and recorded, as elevation in body temperature is typically the 1st and most common sign of infection -- horses with elevated temperatures (101.5 degrees F or greater) should have nasal swabs and blood drawn by your veterinarian.
- If a horse develops a fever and is found to be shedding EHV-1 then the level of risk to other horses on the premises increases significantly. Those affected farms should work closely with their veterinarian to develop a targeted management plan for situation, if it develops.
- The AAEP EHV Control Guidelines can be used by your veterinarian to assist you in developing a more detailed response plan.

It is essential that the isolation facility have supervised oversight by an individual knowledgeable in disease control and quarantine procedures to avoid the possibility of spread of disease agents. When it comes to biosecurity, compliance with the small details of the plan matter, and all personnel need to be informed of the plan to avoid inadvertent errors that can lead to spread of disease agents. Your veterinarian can assist you with this.

10. What do we do if we already have a potentially exposed horse on a farm?
It still makes sense to isolate this horse from other horses, even though it may have already been in contact with them. Start isolation procedures to stop further exposure. It is very important not to mix horses from different groups to accomplish this. Try and isolate the suspect horse without moving other horses from one group to another; segregation of horse groups is the key, because this will help you reduce spread if an outbreak starts.

Check temperatures of all horses on the farm twice daily (fever spikes can be missed if you check once daily) and keep a log of these recordings. If fevers are detected, then test for EHV-1. The value of starting healthy horses on an anti-viral treatment when there is no evidence of disease on the farm is questionable. Consult with your equine veterinarian for further guidance.

11. What anti-viral treatments can I use against EHM on a farm?
If EHM is present on a farm, then the risk to other horses at that farm is greatly increased. Stringent quarantine and biosecurity procedures must be implemented immediately. Treatments may include anti-inflammatory drugs and some horses may require intravenous fluids. Antibiotics may be used to treat a secondary bacterial infection if that develops; however, antibiotics have no effect on the equine herpesvirus itself.

For horses on the farm that develop fever, test EHV-1 positive, or have a high risk of exposure, anti-viral drugs may decrease the chance of developing EHM and the benefit of antiviral treatment of the horse should be discussed with your veterinarian.

12. Is there any value to using booster vaccination against EHV¬1 at this time?
Unfortunately, none of the current EHV-1 vaccines carry a label claim for prevention of EHM. More research is needed to identify a vaccine that may prevent this form of the disease. Some of the EHV-1 vaccines have been shown to reduce nasal shedding and in some cases reduce viremia. These products may therefore have some theoretical value against EHM (by reducing viremia), and certainly against spread of the virus. For more information regarding these vaccines, consult with your equine veterinarian.

If horses on the farm are previously vaccinated against EHV-1, the booster vaccination should quickly increase immunity, and perhaps reduce spread of EHV-1 if it is present. Vaccination in these circumstances is controversial. The use of vaccination is therefore a risk-based decision.

13. How long can my horse shed the virus? Is it safe for the horse to return to work/show ring when symptoms clear?
The AAEP EHV Control Guidelines suggests to horse owners whose horse(s) were on the premises of an EHV-1 confirmed case to maintain isolation procedures (primary perimeter) for 28 days after last suspected new infection.

In the absence of clinical disease, the risk of exposure decreases with time. A shorter quarantine period maybe justified, such as 21 days. If during this time no horse has had any fever (temperature taken at least 24 hours without treatment with non-steroidal drug), abortion or neurologic signs and all exposed horses are tested and have a negative test result using nasal swabs for EHV-1 by real-Time-PCR. There should be compliance with requirements by state animal health officials for duration of quarantine and testing.

14. What methods of prevention can I implement to avoid EHV outbreak and other disease transmission?
2 main methods of prevention you can establish to help avoid disease outbreak on your premises include vaccination and biosecurity protection.

The goal of vaccination is to induce resistance to infection prior to exposure by producing a strong and durable immune response without inducing clinical signs of disease in the vaccinated animal. While there are several vaccines available for protection against both respiratory disease and abortion as a result of EHV-1 infection, at this time there is no equine licensed vaccine that has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus (EHM). Consult with your veterinarian for further guidance if you are considering the use of EHV-1 vaccines.

Biosecurity means doing everything you can to reduce the chances of an infectious disease being carried onto your farm by people, animals, equipment or vehicles either accidentally or on purpose. Anything that touches an infected horse or sheds secretions from sick horses has the potential to transfer pathogens to other horses. You are the best protection your horses have.

15. At what point will the "All Clear" be posted and can I start attending events again or can events/shows start operating?
The EHV-1 virus is a normally occurring virus found in the equine population. All of the reasons that EHV-1 causes these severe neurological signs in some horses is not fully understood. If you are travelling to an event, contact your veterinarian well in advance of departure date to verify what testing is required. Interstate travel may have different requirements and these requirements may vary to each equine event or venue.

There is never an "ALL CLEAR/ NO RISK" when horses commingle. Basic everyday biosecurity is always recommended. Access information from your State Veterinarian related to situations within your area for updates on equine infectious disease situations in your area as well as updates on the AAEP website.

Please consult with your State/Provincial animal health office, show or other equine venue to confirm if that event is still scheduled and if any further testing or other health requirements are needed before entering the state/facility/grounds.
