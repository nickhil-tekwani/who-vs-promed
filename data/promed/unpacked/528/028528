A bacterial outbreak that struck the UF [University of Florida] Health Shands Hospital's burn unit in March [2013] ultimately infected 8 patients, the hospital's chief medical officer announced Monday [29 Jul 2013], with one patient still in an isolation unit created in the outbreak's aftermath. The hospital would not confirm Monday whether any deaths had occurred.

The bacteria, called _Acinetobacter baumannii_, typically affect very sick patients and live on surfaces and in soil, Dr. Timothy Flynn said. "It can literally be found anywhere," Flynn said. "Because of this, we've moved forward with plans to renovate the burn unit." Flynn said the hospital, which already had planned to revamp the burn unit before the outbreak, closed it down but is still taking burn patients. Renovations on the unit should be complete in 4 to 6 months, he added. Meanwhile, the hospital's infection control department is checking for contamination in other areas of the hospital, Flynn said.

While most patients can resist the bacteria, which cause potentially fatal infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and urinary tract infections, "patients who are highly immunocompromised, such as burn patients, are especially vulnerable," Flynn said.

National problem
----------------
The outbreak of _A. baumannii_ [infection] at Shands mirrors a growing trend across the country and world of antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing deadly infections in hospitals' sickest patients. Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious disease expert at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles], estimates there are roughly 50 000 cases of this bacteria annually in the US, and 20 times that in the world. It is also common in returning troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, many of whom were contaminated through soil. In hospitals, the bacteria often are transmitted from devices such as IVs, urine catheters and blood pressure cuffs, said Dr. Alex Kallen, an infectious disease specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta [Georgia].

Kallen said hospital and hygiene also play a role. For example, health care workers who change the dressings on 2 different patients without 1st washing their hands can transmit it. "Uncleaned medical equipment can play a huge role," Kallen said. "Most places that have a problem with this require a reassessment of cleaning within the rooms. It is a very hearty organism and can survive in an environment for a very long time," he continued.

Once detected, it is very hard to treat, since it resists all but one known antibiotic on the market, and that drug, known as colistin, has serious side effects, namely complications to the kidney, said Dr. Glenn Morris, the director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at UF and the interim epidemiologist at Shands Hospital. "In this case we did use it (colistin) where we had to," Morris said. "We weren't able to successfully treat patients with colistin."

Antibiotics shortage
--------------------
Part of the reason for this problem, Morris continued, is that "no new antibiotics are being developed, and we are starting to see with increasing frequency these resistant bacteria." According to the CDC, more than 70 percent of the bacteria in hospital-associated infections are resistant to antibiotics.

The over-usage of antibiotics is primarily to blame for resistance to them, Morris continued. "For 50, 60 years we had these miracle drugs that could cure any infection, and we got very cavalier about them. What's happened is that we are using a lot of antibiotics for things that don't need them, driving the emergence of resistance." Another problem is that drug companies are not as financially incentivized to create new antibiotics compared to, say, blood pressure medications, where they are guaranteed bigger profits, Morris said. That leaves hospitals struggling to contain infections that invariably enter their doors.

"Periodically, we will admit a patient with _A. baumannii_. The problem is if the patient goes to the ICU, we always worry that other patients might acquire it ... in this case, unfortunately it showed up at the burn unit, which is probably the worst place it can be."

He said the hospital moved quickly to shut down the unit and move the infected patients to an isolation unit. Meanwhile, Morris and colleagues are working on tracing the origin of the bacteria to see how it got inside the burn unit. This involves DNA fingerprinting of the bacteria, which oftentimes have several strains, each with their own fingerprint. They might be able to tell if the various strains have a common source, Morris said, adding, "You are actually able to time when the bacteria entered (the hospital)."

A team of researchers at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] did this as well, to retrace the occurrence of the outbreak of the bacteria KPC [Klebsiella pneumoniae-producing] _Klebsiella_, which in 2011 infected 18 patients at the NIH Clinical Center Hospital, killing 9 of them.

With the recent outbreak at Shands, however, "it's still not clear" whether they will be able to determine the original source of infection and when it entered the hospital, Morris said.

Public health concerns?
-----------------------
Although _A. baumannii_ typically affects only very sick patients, it can be transmitted to other patients who have been exposed to it on a medical device, such as a blood pressure cuff. "If they're in the hospital and they have medical devices, they are potentially at risk," said Kallen of the CDC. These healthier patients might not develop an infection, but if the bacteria live on them -- say on the surface of the skin, or in the GI tract -- they still can be a carrier of the bacteria to other, sicker patients, he added. For that reason, they are working to develop surveillance cultures to test people who might be carriers without being overtly affected themselves, Kallen said.

Meanwhile, Morris said he encourages patients to avoid the hospital if possible. "I don't like to see patients in the hospital -- the fact remains that sometimes we do see these strains in the hospital and unfortunately we don't have good new antibiotics to treat them," he said. "I like to try to get them [patients] out [of the hospital] as quickly as possible."

[_Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB), a gram-negative coccobacillus, has emerged as a significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial pathogen. Burn patients, especially those with severe burn wounds, are highly susceptible to infection with this organism (http://surgery.uthscsa.edu/faculty/pubs/acinetobacter.pdf), which has caused outbreaks in burn units (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/5/1358.2.full and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12781606). The news report above describes such an outbreak due to MDR-AB in a burn unit at a Florida university hospital that started in March 2013. The burn unit was then closed for renovation and the infected patients were moved to isolation units, but the article fails to state when in the course of the outbreak this occurred, the sequence in which patients became infected, the location of each of the infected patients in the burn unit, if any patients shared in common hospital personnel or equipment, if they underwent the same procedures, or if there was environmental contamination with MDR-AB. DNA fingerprinting of the clinical isolates, and of any environmental isolates, is being done; a match of any of the genotypes of the clinical isolates would indicate a common source.

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in the ProMED-mail post Acinetobacter, resistant, fatal - Japan: (Tokyo) RFI 20100907.3203:

"Infection due to multidrug-resistant acinetobacter strains, especially _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MDR-AB), in critically ill, hospitalized patients and the frequency of clonal nosocomial outbreaks due to these microorganisms has increased worldwide in the past several decades (see: Urban C, et al: Considerations in control and treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36(10): 1268-74; available at http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/374847). MDR-AB have also been reported recently to cause infections after natural disasters [e.g., earthquakes] (see [Joly-Guillou ML. Clinical impact and pathogenicity of Acinetobacter. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2005 Nov;11(11):868-73. Abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216100]), and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

During nosocomial outbreaks, MDR-AB have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. MDR-AB has been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from patients who are either infected or colonized with MDR-AB. [In addition, airborne spread of MDR-AB has recently been described in a burn unit (Gao J, Zhao X, Bao Y, et al. Antibiotic resistance and OXA-type carbapenemases-encoding genes in airborne Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from burn wards. Burns. 2013 Jul 22. pii: S0305-4179(13)00185-X. doi: 10.1016/j.burns.2013.06.003. [Epub ahead of print] Abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886986?dopt=Abstract.]

Resistance to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by MDR-AB. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in MDR-AB include various aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes, plasmid-mediated, and/or chromosomal-linked beta-lactamases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, alteration of targets for antimicrobial drugs such as the penicillin-binding proteins, and antibiotic efflux pumps; these mechanisms are at times combined with absent or reduced expression of porin channels that limit penetration of antibiotics to their site of action (see: Dijkshoorn L, et al: An increasing threat in hospitals: multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007; 5(12): 939-51; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18007677).

Some isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins [e.g., colistin] and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et al: Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet North Am Ed. 1994; 344(8933): 1329-32; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. [Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin and thereby to allow ampicillin to kill the bacteria. Versus _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial property.]

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved surveillance, restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced infection control interventions (see: Urban C, et al (2003): reference above)."

Shands Hospital is a 852-bed tertiary care facility with 142 intensive care beds, a Level I trauma center, and a leading organ-transplant center in Gainesville, Florida (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UF_Health_Shands_Hospital). Shands Hospital is a teaching hospital associated with the University of Florida College of Medicine. Gainesville, the largest city in the North Central Florida region with a population in the 2010 Census of 124 354, is home to the University of Florida, the nation's 8th largest university. - Mod.ML
