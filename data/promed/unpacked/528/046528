The [Hong Kong] Department of Health (DH) is today (Mon 3 Nov 2014) closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) reported by the Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning, and hence called on the public to stay alert and maintain good personal, food, and environmental hygiene during travel.

According to the Commission, the patient is a woman aged 58 who visited a market and bought and slaughtered a chicken before onset. She is now hospitalised for treatment and is in critical condition.

To date, 441 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed on the Mainland in Zhejiang (139 cases), Guangdong (109 cases), Jiangsu (57 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (one case) and Hebei (one case).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said. "In view of cases confirmed on the Mainland, members of the public should maintain good personal, food, and environmental hygiene at all times during travel," the spokesman urged.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added. Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are proceeding.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas.

The public may visit the avian influenza page of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH at http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html and its website at http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf for more information on avian influenza-affected areas.

Human cases of avian A/H7N9 influenza are occurring sporadically over a wide area in China, reflecting the extensive breeding and consumption of domestic fowl over a wide area of the country. A localised epidemic does not appear imminent. - Mod.CP
