COVID hospital patients at higher risk of cardiac events, data suggest
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compared with both uninfected people and COVID-19 outpatients, hospitalized COVID-19 patients were at dramatically higher risk for death, a blood clot in a vein, heart failure, and stroke within 30 days, suggests an observational study published yesterday [24 Oct 2022] in Heart. [Raisi-Estabragh Z, Cooper J, Salih A, et al. Cardiovascular disease and mortality sequelae of COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Heart. First Published Online: 24 Oct 2022. doi: 10.1136/heartjnl-2022-321492]

A team led by researchers from the Queen Mary University of London assessed rates of new-onset cardiovascular disease among 17 871 UK Biobank participants who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020 to March 2021 and 35 742 uninfected controls. Of the COVID-19 patients, 2701 were hospitalized for their infection, 866 were admitted for another indication, and 14 304 were outpatients. Follow-up was, on average, 141 days.

118 times greater risk of death
-------------------------------
Heart attack, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism (VTE; blood clot in a vein), pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), or death from cardiovascular causes, ischemic heart disease, or any other cause occurred in 9% of COVID-19 patients and 0.7% of controls.

COVID-19 outpatients were more than 10 times as likely as uninfected controls to die of any cause and nearly 3 times as likely to develop VTE. But the most severe cardiac outcomes occurred among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, who were at 118 times the risk of death as outpatients; in comparison, the risk was 64 times as high among COVID-19 patients hospitalized for other reasons.

Compared with controls, patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were at more than 27 times the risk of VTE, upwards of 21.5 times the risk of heart failure, 17.5 times the risk of a stroke, nearly 15 times the risk of atrial fibrillation (irregular, rapid heart rhythm), 14 times the risk of pericarditis, and 10 times the risk of a heart attack.

The greatest risk of new cardiovascular disease diagnoses, particularly for atrial fibrillation, VTE, pericarditis, and all-cause death, was in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and in the 1st 30 days after infection. The risk, however, especially for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, pericarditis, and all-cause death, remained elevated beyond 30 days but at a lower level.

Role of anti-clotting therapy
-----------------------------
While the researchers didn't consider potential confounding factors such as COVID-19 vaccination, new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, or reinfections, they said that the long-term health effects of previous infection are an important public health issue.

"Our findings highlight the increased cardiovascular risk of individuals with past infection, which are likely to be greater in countries with limited access to vaccination and thus greater population exposure to COVID-19," they wrote.

In a related commentary, Anda Bularga, MBChB; David Newby, MD, PhD, BMSc; and Andrew Chapman, MBChB, PhD; all of the University of Edinburgh, noted that COVID-19 outpatients had lower rates of heart attack but said this finding could be due to selection or reporting bias or to lower rates of physical activity or other lockdown-related risk factors. [Bularga A, Newby DE, Chapman AR. Not to be sneezed at: cardiovascular disease after COVID-19 infection. Heart. First Published Online: 24 Oct 2022. doi: 10.1136/heartjnl-2022-321748]

They said that cardiac imaging and measures to lower the risk of blood clots in hospitalized COVID-19 patients may be needed. "Clearly, duration of therapy is relevant, and these data do question whether 7â€‰days of prophylactic anticoagulation is sufficient for patients with COVID-19," Bularga and colleagues wrote.

They add that the commentary "provides a fuller and more complete appreciation of the breadth and degree of these associations that will inform how we now try to treat and to prevent the cardiovascular events associated with COVID-19 in the years to come."

Highest-density US metro areas had higher COVID-19 death rate in 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Age-adjusted US COVID-19 death rates in 2020 were 30% higher in large, central metropolitan areas than in medium-sized cities, finds a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis.

The researchers examined COVID-19 death rates in 6 different types of areas -- large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, small metropolitan, and micropolitan rural and nonmetropolitan rural -- by sex and age-group.

COVID-19 death rates were highest in large, central metropolitan areas, at 97.7 per 100 000 people, 30% higher than the 75.0-per-100 000 death rate in medium metropolitan areas, where death rates were the lowest. Death rates were 90.6 and 86.5 in noncore and micropolitan rural areas, respectively, and 78.2 and 75.0 in small metropolitan and large fringe metropolitan areas, respectively.

Rates differed by sex, with the greatest proportion of males dying in the most urban areas (129.3 per 100 000), while females' highest rates were in the most urban and most rural areas (72.8 and 73.8, respectively). In all areas, COVID-19 death rates were at least 50% higher among males than females, with the largest gap in large, central metropolitan areas (78% higher).

Among people 65 years and older, male COVID-19 death rates were highest in the most urban areas, while those for females were highest in both the most urban and most rural areas. In the younger age-group, the highest death rate was among males in the most urban areas (41.5 per 100 000), followed by noncore and micropolitan rural (33.7 and 29.8, respectively) and large fringe metropolitan areas (27.7). Among younger females, those in noncore rural areas had the highest death rate (24.2), while those in large fringe metropolitan areas had the lowest (13.6).

"These results show how a more detailed measure of urbanicity can result in a more precise analysis of COVID-19 death rates than is possible with the typical urban-rural dichotomy," the authors wrote.

Physical activity may boost effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines
--------------------------------------------------------------
A new study ties increased physical activity to greater effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, with higher activity levels associated with greater protection. The study was published yesterday [24 Oct 2022] in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. [Collie S, Saggers RT, Bandini R, et al. Association between regular physical activity and the protective effect of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a South African case-control study. British Journal of Sports Medicine. First Published Online: 24 Oct 2022. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2022-105734]

The study was based on the electronic health records and wearable fitness-tracking devices of thousands of vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers in South Africa, including those with low (under 60 minutes per week), medium (at least 60 to 149 minutes per week), and high (more than 150 minutes per week) levels of physical activity.

COVID-19 swab test results were analyzed for 53 771 participants with low levels of physical activity, 62 721 with medium levels, and 79 952 with high levels. Test results were for the time between 16 Feb and 30 Oct 2021.

Vaccine effectiveness against a COVID-19-related hospital admission among vaccinated individuals within the low-activity group was 60.0% (95% [confidence interval] CI, 39.0 to 73.8), 72.1% (95% CI, 55.2 to 82.6) for the moderate-activity group, and 85.8% (95% CI, 74.1 to 92.2) for the high-activity group.

"The reasons for the increased effect of vaccination in active individuals still have to be elucidated but may be a combination of enhanced antibody levels, improved T cell immunosurveillance and psychosocial factors," the authors write. "Public health messaging should encourage physical activity as a simple, cost-effective way of enhancing vaccine effectiveness to mitigate the risk of severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospital admission."

The authors said previous research has shown similar immune-boosting effects of exercise among influenza vaccine recipients.

[3] Fall COVID plans
Date: Tue 25 Oct 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/10/white-house-announces-more-steps-battle-fall-covid-19-activity


White House announces more steps to battle fall COVID-19 activity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In comments ahead of getting his updated COVID vaccine booster today [25 Oct 2022], President Joe Biden urged Americans to get booster doses and make use of other tools to battle COVID-19 ahead of an expected rise in cases before the upcoming holiday season.

A bivalent (2-strain) vaccine that targets the original virus plus BA.4/BA.5 variants launched in early September [2022], and so far, uptake has been lukewarm, with nearly 20 million people receiving it. Less than half of Americans have yet to receive any booster doses, leading to fears that increased activity from a new omicron variant with immune escape properties could once again threaten vulnerable groups and put pressure on hospitals, some of which are already grappling with flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases (see ProMED post Respiratory syncytial virus - USA (02): case surge 20221024.8706346).

Biden said the country is in a good position now to keep cases and deaths low, with easy access to tools to fight the virus: vaccines and treatment. "The bottom line is virtually every death is preventable," he said.

Request for more response funds
-------------------------------
Also, Biden pressed Congress to provide more funding for the COVID response to help the country stay ahead of the virus. "If we really want to put COVID behind us, we have to keep the fight together." Pfizer had said it will charge $110 to $130 for a dose of its vaccine once the US government stops buying the shots, according to the Associated Press. [https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-covid-medicare-1a5d65356ebc7b5bc76524ae99deb55e]

Biden urged Americans to consider getting vaccinated against flu as they get their updated COVID boosters, and he encouraged employers to ease access for workers.

In a statement, the White House also described more new steps, which include targeted communication and education to risk groups, which include not only ethnic groups but also rural communities. For example, football- and country music-themed ads, which position boosters as a way to protect loved ones, are designed to target rural communities in 15 local markets. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-additional-efforts-to-help-americans-get-their-free-updated-covid-19-vaccine-this-fall/]

In other steps, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tomorrow [26 Oct 2022] will launch the #VaxUpAmerica Family Vaccine Tour, which will encourage families to update their protection ahead of the holidays and work with local partners to host vaccine pop-up events. As part of the effort, HHS said it will focus some of the vaccine clinic efforts on regions with lower vaccine uptake.

And to help businesses leaders encourage vaccination and manage COVID this fall [2022], the government has launched a fall playbook that describes steps for protecting employees and keeping businesses open, including improving air quality in their buildings.

During the 1st year of the pandemic, men died from COVID at a much higher rate than women
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Death rates in the United States are higher in rural than urban areas, and the difference has grown over the last 2 decades (1). Death rates for all of the 10 leading causes of death in 2019 were higher in rural than urban areas (1). In 2020, deaths due to COVID-19 became the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States (2). This report presents COVID-19 death rates for rural and urban areas in 2020 by sex and age group (under age 65 and 65 and over). Rates are presented for the 6 categories of urbanicity according to the decedent's county of residence (3). Urban areas include large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, and small metropolitan; rural areas include micropolitan and noncore (nonmetropolitan).

[5] COVID boosters
Date: Fri 21 Oct 2022

FDA's vaccines chief sees possibility of more COVID boosters -- sooner than he'd like
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Marks, who leads the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines operation, is still losing sleep over COVID.

Yes, vaccines for all age groups have been authorized or approved. Yes, an updated vaccine is now available. And, yes, multiple products are in use and hundreds of millions of doses have been given in this country.

But Marks said there are other issues that weigh on him.

Chief among them is the fact that, given the rate at which SARS-CoV-2 viruses mutate, Marks thinks it's conceivable that the booster shot people are getting now may not be the last some will need for the coming year.

"I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn't keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster -- at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals -- before next September, October [2023]," Marks told STAT.

"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but it's what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving."

The messenger RNA vaccines most commonly used in the United States -- the products made by Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership -- can easily be tweaked to update the strains of the virus they target. The speed with which these vaccines can be adapted and produced has revolutionized pandemic response.

But the vaccines as currently designed do not offer long-term protection against infection. Severe disease, hospitalization, and death, yes. But the duration of protection against contracting COVID is short-lived -- which could lead to a vaccination cadence that is impractical to try to maintain.

Marks acknowledged this worries him.

"It does," he said, noting this problem is leading to pressure on the mRNA manufacturers to see if they can improve the durability of their vaccines. "Because there are probably things that can be done to optimize sequences and optimize constructs that would hopefully lead to better mRNA vaccines."

But the long-term answer, Marks said, doesn't just rest with vaccines made using mRNA.

"We need to look at other other types of vaccines. And there are those out there that might provide more durable immunity," he said.

"I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what's best moving forward," Marks said. "Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines, but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth, and duration of immunity against COVID-19."

Some of this work will take time, especially if federal government funding for next-generation vaccines does not come through. (And there's currently no indication it will.)

With each successive booster that has been approved, the percentage of people who've gotten one has dropped. A bivalent booster, which targets both the original strain of SARS-2 and an omicron variant, has been available since early September [2022]. To date only 19.4 million doses have been administered. The public's COVID fatigue could disincentivize vaccine manufacturers from trying to produce better, longer-lasting vaccines, Marks suggested.

In the near term, he said he'd be happy if we could get to the point where an annual shot would suffice. "I would consider it a success at this point," he said.

For the time being, Marks believes COVID vaccines are going to need to be updated on a regular basis, along the lines of what is done with flu vaccines.

Twice a year the World Health Organization convenes influenza experts to study the flu viruses that are circulating and choose strains for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. The goal is to tweak the vaccine formulas so they target the strains that will be causing the most disease several months later. It is a hit-and-miss -- more miss -- endeavor.

The expert panel that advises the WHO on COVID vaccines has suggested eschewing that approach with SARS-2. Instead, the group, known as the Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition, recommended updating COVID vaccines with a strain that is genetically highly distinct from the original strain, to broaden the immune system's experience with SARS-2 viruses, choosing a version of omicron that is no longer spreading.

When the FDA told COVID vaccine manufacturers what it wanted in updated vaccines, it did not follow the WHO advice to the letter, opting for a version of omicron that matched the dominant version of the virus at the time the decision was made. (The virus' rapid evolution means that strain is already being superseded by others.)

Marks said he believes trying to match the virus will be important for the next couple of years.

"What I can say is in ... the short term, the next year or 2, we are pursuing a flu-like chase-the-variant model," he said.

Another near-term change Marks foresees include moving to a bivalent primary vaccine, so that anyone who is being vaccinated -- whether they're getting their 1st shot or their 5th -- will get vaccine targeting the original strain and an omicron strain. At present only booster shots are bivalent.

The FDA is waiting for additional data before making this move, said Marks. "Once we have those data -- which we expect in the next few months -- we will go to a public advisory committee meeting, probably in the 1st part of next year [2023] to have a discussion about moving things over to the bivalent ... primary series."

In the meantime, Marks is hoping to see an improvement in the uptake of COVID vaccine -- primary series and boosters -- for young children, where the acceptance rates remain very low. "It is kind of disappointing that a public health measure that is so clearly beneficial has been way under-utilized," he said.
