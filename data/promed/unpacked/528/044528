[Equine rhinopneumonitis is now referred to as infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2014/).

Recommendations for international trade for infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (equine rhinopneumonitis) are spelled out in chapter 12.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code 2014 at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_equine_rhinopneumonitis.htm.

According the OIE terrestrial Code 2014, equine rhinopneumonitis is a collective term for any one of several highly contagious, clinical disease entities of equids that may occur as a result of infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

Infection with EHV-1 is characterised by a primary respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. Infections with EHV-1 are capable of progression beyond the respiratory mucosa to cause abortion, perinatal foal death, or neurological dysfunction.

Vaccination (EHV-4 and EHV-1) should begin when foals are 4-6 months old. A 2nd dose is given at 4-6 weeks later, and a 3rd dose at 10-12 months of age. Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 6 months through maturity (5 years of age). Vaccination programs against herpesviruses should include all horses that travel to high-risk destinations (racetrack, show grounds) and all other horses on the premises. A high-antigen load, inactivated EHV-1 vaccine is recommended to prevent EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during months 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Mares are often vaccinated with inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 at an interval 4-6 weeks before foaling. A modified-live EHV-1 vaccine is available to help prevent respiratory disease caused by EHV-1.
