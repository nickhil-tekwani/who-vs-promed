Polio experts warn of largest epidemic in recent years, as polio hits
Darfur; Epidemiologists 'alarmed' by continuing spread of virus - warn
thousands of children could be paralyzed across west and central Africa
------------------
Epidemiologists of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative today issued a
stark warning that west and central Africa is on the brink of the largest
polio epidemic in recent years. The warning follows confirmation today that
a child was paralyzed on 20 May 2004 by polio in the Darfur region of the
Sudan, a country which had not seen the disease in more than 3 years. The
virus is closely linked genetically to poliovirus endemic to northern
Nigeria, which has spread through Chad in recent months.
Epidemiological data show that transmission of wild poliovirus continues to
accelerate at an alarming rate in the region. In addition to the
re-infection of the Sudan, 5 times as many children in west and central
Africa have been paralyzed by polio so far in 2004 compared to the same
period in 2003. 197 children have been paralyzed in Nigeria, following the
suspension of polio immunization campaigns in northern Nigeria late last year.
"There is no question that the virus is spreading at an alarming pace,"
said communicable disease expert Dr David Heymann, the World Health
Organization's Representative for Polio Eradication. "The fact that the
Sudan is now re-infected is concrete evidence of the need to support a
massive immunization response right across west and central Africa."
Heymann stressed the re-infection of the Sudan is the latest setback to the
strong progress Africa had achieved in eradicating polio. "At the beginning
of 2003, only 2 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were polio-endemic. Today,
however, Africa accounts for nearly 90 percent of the global polio burden,
with children now paralyzed in 10 previously polio-free countries across
the continent."
Epidemiologists fear that a major epidemic this autumn (during the polio
'high season') would leave thousands of African children paralyzed for
life. Children are particularly vulnerable in west and central African
countries, surrounding Nigeria, as less than half of children in the region
are routinely immunized against a series of diseases, including polio. In
response to this threat, they recommended plans to hold massive,
synchronized immunization campaigns across 22 African countries in October
and November [2004], aiming to reach 74 million children. These campaigns
could avert a public health tragedy.
Recognizing that the northern Nigerian state of Kano remains the epicentre
of the outbreak, federal and state authorities have been working to resolve
a local controversy over the safety of the polio vaccine which had led to
the suspension of campaigns in that area. In May 2004, Kano state
authorities publicly announced to the world's press that polio immunization
activities in the state would soon be restarted.
"These campaigns could avert a public health tragedy," said Carol Bellamy,
UNICEF Executive Director. "But to be effective they must have strong,
grass-roots support. The 1st priority should be to increase community
participation in polio activities throughout the region. Many families
still need re-assurance, in the wake of rumours spreading out of northern
Nigeria, about the safety of the polio vaccine."
"So many Africans in so many corners of this continent have risked -- and
in some tragic cases lost -- their lives to bring polio to the verge of
eradication," said Jonathan Majiyagbe, President of Rotary International,
and himself a native of Nigeria. "All of Africa must now work together to
ensure that every child is immunized and protected forever from this
devastating disease."
With a global investment of US$ 3 billion since 1988 for the eradication
effort, including more than US$ 600 million committed by Rotary
International, responding to this looming epidemic will require an
additional US$ 100 million, of which US$ 25 million is urgently required by
August 2004 for the 1st campaign.
Notes to editors:
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by the World Health
Organization, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and UNICEF. The poliovirus is now endemic in only 6 countries,
down from over 125 when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was
launched in 1988. The 6 remaining polio-endemic countries are: Afghanistan,
Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan.
The polio eradication coalition includes governments of countries affected
by polio; private sector foundations (e.g. United Nations Foundation, Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundation); development banks (e.g. the World Bank); donor
governments (e.g. Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America); the European Commission; humanitarian and
nongovernmental organizations (e.g. the International Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies) and corporate partners (e.g. Aventis Pasteur, De Beers,
Wyeth). Volunteers in developing countries also play a key role; 20 million
have participated in mass immunization campaigns.

[There are now 11 countries in Africa that have had poliomyelitis cases
confirmed -- Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, and Nigeria. Only Niger and
Nigeria were considered to be polio-endemic, where transmission of the wild
poliovirus had not as yet been interrupted. In the remaining 9 countries,
wild poliovirus isolates have been identified and found to be similar to
those circulating in Nigeria -- circumstantial evidence that the ongoing
poliovirus transmission in Nigeria continues to seed other African
countries where poliovirus transmission had been interrupted. In some
instances, the cases and families were shown to have direct contact with
Nigeria either through personal travel or contact with travellers from
Nigeria. In the case of Botswana, a direct link had not been established,
but the wild poliovirus identified was similar to those currently
circulating in Nigeria. The above case in Darfur, Sudan, an area with
significant infrastructural compromise as a result of civil unrest, does
not presently report a direct contact with Nigeria, yet the virus isolated
is also similar to those currently circulating in Nigeria. As mentioned by
the above press release and prior postings on the continuing -- and growing
-- problem of re-emergence of wild poliovirus circulation on the African
continent (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below), Kano State in
Northern Nigeria continues to be the epicenter of this polio epidemic, and
until full-scale resumption of vaccination activities in that area, the
likelihood of more importations of the wild poliovirus into countries with
previously interrupted transmission remains high. - Mod.MPP]
