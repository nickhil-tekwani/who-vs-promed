Influenza virus activity in the world
-------------------------------------
[Source: Laboratory confirmed data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).]

Based on FluNet reporting (as of 18 Jun 2013, 09:10 UTC), during weeks 22 to 23 (26 May to 8 Jun 2013), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 66 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 14 646 specimens. 906 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 615 (67.9 percent) were typed as influenza A and 291 (32.1 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 354 (74.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 122 (25.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 10 (71.4 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 4 (28.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Summary
-------
During weeks 22 and 23 [26 May to 8 Jun 2013], influenza activity remained low globally. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continued to be the predominant circulating subtype, followed by influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses.

In Asia and Oceania, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses co-circulated throughout the region at low levels in general, although Viet Nam reported increased A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity.

In Africa, A(H1N1)pdm09 activity remained high in Madagascar and South Africa. Sporadic influenza detections were reported from elsewhere in the region.

In Central and South America, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continued to circulate although at low levels.

In Europe and North America sporadic detections of influenza B viruses continued to be reported.

[Global influenza activity overall remains at relatively low levels, with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as the dominant strain overall, although Asia and Oceania reported generally low levels of influenza activity, predominantly influenza A(H3N2) and B. Exceptionally Viet Nam has reported a rise in A(H1N1) activity and A(H1N1)pdm09 has predominated in parts of South America and Southern Africa. Where influenza B was recorded most viruses belonged to the Yamagata lineage, which was not recommended for the current Southern Hemisphere vaccine, but has been recommended for inclusion in the new Northern Hemisphere vaccine for the next influenza season. - Mod.CP]
