More than 100 parasite-infested brown pelicans died in Brevard County in the past 2 months. No one knows why.

"The pelicans are emaciated and have heavy parasite counts, and, to our knowledge, other bird species have not been affected," Dan Wolf, a researcher with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission [FWC], said in a release.

Many of the dead pelicans have turned up in Cocoa Beach. But others have been found on Merritt Island, in Melbourne, Indian Harbour Beach, and along the St Sebastian River.

FWC researchers are assessing specimens from the pelican carcasses and the environment to identify a potential cause.

They also sent samples 2 weeks ago to the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin for testing. But biologists have yet to come up with definitive answers.

Researchers are awaiting results from additional samples sent this week that may determine whether the pelicans died of botulism, which sometimes triggers large bird die-offs. But botulism generally kills birds quickly, Wolf said, leaving little time for the pelicans to become emaciated.

Birds get botulism when they eat rotten fish, which concentrate the type E toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Human botulism cases from type E toxin are very rare. Type A or type B botulinum toxin makes humans sick, usually after they eat spoiled canned food.

Botulism commonly kills ducks in western states. The type E toxin can become concentrated in maggots.

Low and fluctuating water levels and warm temperatures can help trigger outbreaks.

"We suspect it may be botulism due to the warmer than average winter," Sue Small, director of the Florida Wildlife Hospital (FWH) and Sanctuary in Palm Shores, said earlier this week.

The hospital has seen at least 15 sick pelicans at the hospital in the past few weeks. All but 2 died.

Around the same time last year [2012], more than a dozen brown pelicans died in Palm Shores, Rockledge, and Indian Harbour Beach within about a month. Tests by FWC found a common bacterium at fault. The bacterium was most likely from eating decomposed fish.

A red tide has been lingering off Southwest Florida since September [2012], killing a record 174 manatees so far this year [2013]. But no other significant fish kills, algae blooms, or other toxic events that could kill birds have been reported here.

[A similar episode involving highly parasitized malnourished pelicans was observed in Peru last year [2012] (ProMED-mail archive no 20120506.1124416).

A deterioration in the condition of the birds might trigger a vicious circle, as host susceptibility and disease can act in synergy. Individuals in poor general physiological condition might be more susceptible to infections, which further weaken their condition, and so on. Populations in poor average condition might exhibit higher prevalences of infection, increasing the risk of further infections, with further deterioration in condition. This escalating polarisation between the sick and the robust could have important implications for the dynamics of disease and its impact on host dynamics (see http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(09)00228-6).
