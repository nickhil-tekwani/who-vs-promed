A mystery disease has claimed the lives of 40 genocide suspects at Rilima
south of the capital Kigali, the Ministry of Justice announced Friday
afternoon.
Some independent sources in Kigali told news reporters that the mystery
disease at the Rilima prison, where some 6,000 genocide suspects are being
held, could be typhoid.
Rwandan Minister of Justice Faustin Nteziryayo, while confirming the death
toll, said the illness was not typhoid. "Typhoid is often linked to
overcrowding and the situation in our prisons are fairly good," he told
reporters.
He said that he has called on the Ministry of Health to help identify the
disease. In the meantime measures have been taken to stop it spreading.
"The disease is spreading quickly," doctors from the International
Committee of the Red Cross told a local news agency. "Apart from the 40
dead, 543 others are affected."
A great quantity of drugs have been ordered by the Ministry of Justice and
calls have been made to donor agencies to help check the epidemic.
