The CDC is in Utah to help investigate that outbreak of tularemia
that occurred on the shores of Utah Lake 2 weeks ago [9-13 Jul 2007].
The disease is sometimes called rabbit fever. While it is endemic to
Utah, only 2 to 4 people a year are diagnosed.
So when a cluster happens, like the one at Utah Lake 2 weeks ago,
epidemiologists want a thorough investigation. That's why State
Health invited the CDC to come and help. State epidemiologist Robert
Rolfs says, "One of the reasons we invited CDC to come is the last
large outbreak where there's a good description of is more than 30
years ago, back in the 1970s. And the risk did go all summer that
time, so we want to stay on top of it. We're looking for more cases.
If we see more, we'll put out more alerts so people do know about this."
In most cases, a deer fly bites an infected rabbit or rodent then
bites a human, passing on the bacteria. It spreads from the site of
the bite to lymph nodes and other parts of the body. People can get
seriously ill, but with treatment few die.
A lot of unanswered questions remain. In addition to deer flies, were
ticks or even mosquitoes involved? Did they get it from rodents as
well as rabbits? Were some campers using repellents? Did they work?
Researchers also hope to find out why some people get really sick
with tularemia, while others don't.
A total of 18 people spread over a wide area in and out of that
campground were symptomatic of tularemia. So far, tests have come
back positive for 4. Even though the military identifies tularemia as
a potential bioterrorism agent, this latest cluster infection was
felt to be all the work of nature.

[More cases of tularemia are being diagnosed in Utah. Minimal
information has come forth on the clinical manifestations of the
disease in these individuals. Many cases of tularemia involve lymph
node infection with (ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a local
skin infection draining to the lymph node. Cases associated with lawn
mowers, as has been described on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts,
are often pneumonic, related to inhalation of bacilli. Unlike human
plague infection, pneumonic tularemia does not spread from person to
person. Bloodstream infection (bacteremia) can be associated with
different forms of disease or may be the only manifestation (typhoidal form).
The pneumonic type is likely the presentation to occur if the
category A bioterrorism agent is spread as a terrorist act. Outbreaks
do occur as on Martha's Vineyard and sporadic cases of pneumonic
tularemia have occurred naturally even in large cities such as New
York City and Washington DC. - Mod.LL]
