New cases of malaria reported
---------------------
A total of 11 new cases of Malaria has been
reported since the beginning of April [2007], the
Ministry of Health said on 30 Apr 2007.
According to a release from the ministry, 2 cases
were reported between 15-21 Apr [2007], 3 the
previous week [15-21 Apr 2007] while a total of 6
cases was reported between 1-7 Apr [2007]. The
ages of the affected persons range from 10 to 59.
Concerning the 2 new cases reported last week
[22-27 Apr 2007], the ministry said they were
found in Denham Town and Greenwich Town -- 2 of
the areas in which the disease was 1st detected
-- and were caused by the _Plasmodium falciparum_
parasite which is transmitted by the female
_Anopheles_ mosquitoe. The dates of onset were
said to be 4 and 9 Apr [2007] respectively.
Yesterday [30 Apr 2007], the ministry said it had
been able to limit the spread of malaria to other
parishes, noting that the 4 cases detected in St.
Elizabeth since January [2007] remained
contained. The health ministry also pointed out
that since the 1st case of malaria was reported
last December [2006], there have been 7 imported
cases originating from Sudan, India, Haiti, Honduras and Uganda.
Additionally, it said the number of positive
samples continues to decline, explaining that the
positivity rate of blood samples submitted to
laboratories over the past weeks range between
0.7 and 1.8 percent from a total of 884 sample
tests conducted between 1-21 Apr [2007].
Meanwhile, the ministry reiterated that it was in
the process of seeking alternative insecticides
to prevent further outbreaks after recent tests
confirmed some resistance of the _Anopheles
albimanus_ mosquito taken from the Duhaney River
to malathion insecticide, which it was hoping to
use to eliminate the parasites. The tests were
conducted by consultants from the United
States-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"The Ministry of Health continues its thrust in
the areas of intense active surveillance, vector
control, public education and inter-sectoral
collaboration in a concerted effort to end this
outbreak, while precautionary measures are being
taken to prevent the spread of malaria to other
parishes," the ministry, however, assured.

[We assume that some patients have had more than
one sample, and the 884 positive samples
therefore represents a lower number of patients.
We reported on 9 Apr 2007 that 340 people had
been infected; and it would be interesting to
know the number of cases and not only the number
of malaria-positive blood films to know whether
the outbreak is under control. ï¿½ Mod. EP]
