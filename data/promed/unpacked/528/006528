An outbreak of measles in South Warwickshire has prompted a warning
to parents to ensure their children get the MMR vaccination. 3 cases
of the virus have been discovered, 2 in young people of secondary
school age and one in a young adult. All 3 are receiving care and
advice has been issued to people who they have come into contact
with.

As the virus is highly infectious health bosses are urging parents to
ensure their school age children have received 2 doses of the measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). According to NHS [National Health
Service] Warwickshire take-up of the 1st dose of the vaccine over the
last 5 years has been high at 95 per cent but for the 2nd dose the
level has dropped to 90 per cent. Both doses are needed to ensure
immunity.

Bronwen Spraggett, NHS Warwickshire's immunisation coordinator, said:
"Children are routinely offered the 1st dose of MMR vaccine at
one-year of age and a booster dose at 3 years, 4 months. Routine
catch-up immunisations are offered with the school-leaver booster at
the age of 15.

"Any parent who is concerned that their child has not been fully
vaccinated with MMR vaccine should contact their GP surgery."

Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, spots on the cheek or in
the mouth, and a red blotchy rash. It is spread through coughing and
sneezing and can be very serious in babies, people with lowered immune
systems, such as cancer patients, and unimmunised people.

The HPA [Health Protection Agency] said a small number of schools in
Sussex and Surrey had reported cases of measles. A number of confirmed
cases of measles across Sussex and Surrey has led to the HPA issuing
an alert to families travelling abroad [see following report. -
Mod.CP]. It said a small number of schools in the counties had
reported cases in the past few weeks.

The HPA urged families going abroad for the Easter [24 Apr 2011]
holidays to ensure they were up to date with their MMR vaccines. It
said the advice followed a large outbreak of measles in France and
cases in Italy, Germany, and Bulgaria. Measles can be caught at any
age, but it is most common among children, teenagers, and young adults
who have not been immunised.

The HPA said complications affected one in every 15 children and
could include eye and ear infections, pneumonia, seizures, and rarely
encephalitis.

Symptoms of measles include fever, coughing, and red-brown spots on
the skin. Families flying off to European destinations over Easter [24
Apr 2011] have been urged to vaccinate their children against measles
before they go. Several countries, including Denmark, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, and Turkey have all seen sharp increases in cases of
the virus this year [2011].

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) says overseas travel is a major
factor in the international spread of the virus. It recommends
children be fully immunised with 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, and
rubella] vaccine. Adults who have only had one dose of MMR should
consider being vaccinated again to protect themselves, the HPA says.

"The HPA is issuing advice to schools and health professionals on
measles and recommends that children are fully immunised with 2 doses
of MMR before travelling to Europe for holidays," a spokeswoman said.
Measles is highly contagious and causes a range of symptoms, including
fever, coughing, and spots on the skin. The virus is contained in the
millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an
infected person coughs or sneezes.

France reported more than 1500 cases of measles in 2009, more than
4500 in 2010, and nearly 1000 cases in January 2011 alone.

Turkey recently reported an outbreak in Istanbul, as well as cases
linked to a large outbreak in Bulgaria in 2010.

There is another confirmed case of the measles in Minnesota. The
Minnesota Department of Health is now reporting 15 cases of measles.
12 of the cases have been linked to a person who contracted the
measles in Kenya. One case was contracted in Florida and the latest in
India.

Those who have come down with the measles range in age from 4 months
to 51 years old. In 5 of the cases the person was too young to receive
vaccine. 6 were old enough, but were not vaccinated. At least one was
vaccinated. For the other 3 it is unclear whether they received the
vaccination or not.

So far, 8 people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been
reported.

Measles outbreak in Hennepin County, Minnesota, February-March 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 Mar 2011, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) confirmed
measles in a Hennepin County resident aged 9 months. As of 1 Apr 2011,
investigation of contacts and heightened surveillance had revealed a
total of 13 epidemiologically linked cases in Hennepin County
residents. Of those cases, 11 were laboratory confirmed, and 2 were in
household contacts of confirmed cases and met the clinical case
definition for measles.

The patients included children aged 4 months to 4 years and one adult
aged 51 years; 7 of the 13 were of Somali decent. 8 patients were
hospitalized. Vaccination status was known for 11 patients: 5 were too
young to have been vaccinated, and 6 (all of Somali descent) had not
been vaccinated because of parental concerns about the safety of the
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine [see [15] below for
background. - Mod.CP]. The most recent rash onset was 28 Mar 2011. An
additional, unrelated case of measles was confirmed in a Hennepin
County resident aged 34 years who was exposed in Orlando, Florida,
sometime during 1-10 Mar 2011.

The investigation determined that the index patient was a US-born
child of Somali descent, aged 30 months, who developed a rash 15 Feb
2011, 14 days after returning from a trip to Kenya. The patient
attended a drop-in child care center one day before rash onset;
measles developed in 3 contacts at the center and in one household
contact. Secondary and tertiary exposures occurred in 2 congregate
living facilities for homeless persons (4 patients), an emergency
department (2 patients), and households (2 patients). A virus isolate
from the index patient was genotyped at CDC as B3, which is endemic in
sub-Saharan Africa.

Outbreak control efforts have included following up with potentially
exposed persons, providing immune globulin to persons without evidence
of immunity, and recommending that persons without evidence of
immunity who have been exposed to measles not leave their residence
while potentially infectious (21 days). Multiple vaccination clinics
have been held or scheduled at community venues and in the congregate
living facilities.

In the United States, MMR vaccine normally is given as a 2-dose
series, with the 1st dose at age 12-15 months and a 2nd dose at age 4
to 6 years. However, this series may be accelerated during outbreaks.
In response to the current outbreak, MDH has recommended that children
aged 6 to 11 months living in selected congregate living facilities
receive a dose of MMR vaccine, and that older children and adults in
these facilities receive vaccine if they are susceptible and have had
less than 2 doses of MMR vaccine. MDH also has recommended an
accelerated vaccination schedule (a total of 2 doses of MMR vaccine
separated by at least 28 days) for all children aged 12 months or
older living in Hennepin County and all children of Somali descent
living in the wider Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. [see (15)
below for discussion of the reasons for poor vaccine uptake in
Somalia. - Mod.CP]

Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000.
However, importations of measles from other countries still occur, and
low vaccination coverage associated with parental concerns regarding
the MMR vaccine puts persons and communities at risk for measles.
Public health and health-care providers should work with parents and
community leaders to address concerns about the MMR vaccine to ensure
high vaccination coverage and prevent measles.

Additional information is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/mmwr-child-schedule.pdf.

Because serologic response to the measles vaccine is variable among
infants aged 6 to 11 months, infants vaccinated before age 12 months
should be revaccinated on or after the 1st birthday with one dose of
MMR vaccine followed by a 2nd at least 28 days later.

State health officials said Tuesday [5 Apr 2011] that 3 travelers
from Minnesota, Michigan, and Texas likely got their cases of the
measles while in the Orlando area. The cases have been confirmed by
laboratory tests, officials said. It's likely that an undiagnosed
infected person visiting or living in Orange County was the source,
officials said.

Health officials advised health care providers to watch out for rash
illnesses until 13 Apr 2011, which is 21 days after the onset of the
latest case. However, they also asked them to remain vigilant after
that.

Tarrant County, Texas, health officials said they were investigating
2 confirmed cases of measles. The 1st case involved a woman in her
30s. The 2nd case, involving a man, was a household contact. They were
the 1st confirmed cases of measles in Tarrant County in 17 years.

Chief epidemiologist Dr Anita Kurian said early indications were that
the 1st confirmed victim was likely exposed during a trip to Orlando
in early March [2011].

The symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough, and a
reddish rash all over the body, health officials said. Measles is
transmitted through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. It is
so contagious that any person who is exposed to it, and is not immune,
will probably get the disease.

Anyone with symptoms of measles should call their doctor as soon as
possible and make special arrangements to prevent contact with others.
Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease. Children should get 2 doses
of the vaccine. Adults who may not have been immunized should contact
their doctor to see if they need the vaccine.

A Holladay-area teenager has the state's 1st confirmed case of the
measles since 2005. The teen is a student at Olympus High, a school
district spokesman confirmed. The student is under a voluntary
quarantine, according to the Salt Lake Valley Health Department.

On the health department's orders, another 30 Olympus students were
sent home from school Thursday [7 Apr 2011] because they had not been
fully immunized. They will be excluded from school until 18 Apr 2011,
according to Ben Horsley, Granite District spokesman. That's when the
disease will have run its course, assuming no new cases pop up.

Because measles is so contagious -- 90 percent of people who come
into contact with an infected person will develop measles if they
haven't been immunized -- one case makes it an outbreak.

"Measles remains a significant infectious disease," said Gary
Edwards, the health department's executive director. "We take
significant efforts whenever there is a measles case." The health
department did not disclose the age of the measles patient or his
school. But the school posted a notice on its website.

The health department's efforts include trying to track down where
the teen got the measles, contacting anyone the teen came in contact
with while he was contagious, and telling hospitals and doctors to be
on the lookout for patients with measles symptoms.

The Salt Lake Valley Health Department has identified 2 more
individuals who probably have measles. Both individuals had apparently
traveled out of the country, and both are linked to the Olympus High
School teen who has the state's 1st confirmed measles case since 2005,
according to the health department. They are the county's 1st cases
since 1997. "It means that we need to be vigilant," said the health
department's executive director Gary Edwards. "We know that it is now
in the community."

Edwards did not release the ages of the 2 new probable cases. The
health department hasn't yet contacted them, but Edwards doesn't
believe they were hospitalized. Their physician, who reported the
cases to the health department based on news reports of the 1st case,
said they are connected to the teen and had traveled out of the
country. Most measles cases in the US are linked to foreign travel.

Edwards encourages people who believe they or their children have the
measles to call ahead before going to a doctor's office or emergency
room. Facilities need to take precautions so others aren't exposed.
The health department is also urging residents to determine whether
family members are up-to-date on vaccinations.

Also on Friday [8 Apr 2011], 2 students at William Penn Elementary
were sent home from school because they may have been exposed to
measles virus during a visit to Olympus High and have not been
immunized. They will be excluded from school activities through 18 Apr
2011.

There has been a big surge in the number of cases of measles being
reported in Belgium. The Public Health Scientific Institute has
registered 95 cases so far this year [2011]. In 2010 as a whole there
were only 40 reported cases.

Earlier France and Germany also reported more cases. [The disease
first occurred in Belgium this year [2011] in the Ghent area] but
cases have also been reported from Brussels, Tournai, and Namur.

Patrick Goubau of the UCL University [University of Louvain] points
to the mixed uptake of the vaccine in recent years. There are also
regional differences to the way immunisations are carried out. Not all
groups of children are immunised in the same way across the country.
Measles targets children and young people. Usually the virus causes no
damage, but complications may occur. The Flemish Children's Agency
recommends immunisation at the age of 1 plus a booster between 9 and
12 years of age.

Some 20 million people come down with measles annually. The World
Health Organisation says that 164 000 children died of the disease
last year [2010]. It is particularly in Africa and Asia where children
may be underfed that fatalities occur.

http://www.abcdesevilla.es/20110405/provincia/sevi-sanitario-menos-contagia-tras-201104042202.html


The outbreak of measles [in Andalusia], as reported last Friday [31
Mar 2011] by the Provincial Health Delegation, now involves 432 cases
in Seville, of whom 277 are directly related to the outbreak, not all
of whom are children. It was confirmed yesterday [4 Apr 2011] that a
doctor at Valmey Hospital had contracted measles as a direct
consequence of this outbreak.

The outbreak is affecting several provinces of Andalusia and, in the
case of Seville, the Ministry of Health has recommended that all
parents with children between 6 and 15 months in Seville, Alcala de
Guadaira, Dos Hermanas, and Mairena del Aljarafe, and Tomares should
attend a health centre to receive measles vaccination as "an
exceptional and temporary measure for the duration of the current
situation."

The Andalusian Autonomous Government pointed out, moreover, that
those under the age of 12 months who had already been vaccinated
should receive a booster dose at 15 months and 3 years, whereas
infants between 12 and 15 months who had been vaccinated already, need
only be revaccinated at 3 years.

The Health Department also requested that parents check their
children's vaccination records to ensure that they had received 2
doses of MMR vaccine at 15 months and 3 years as required by the
childhood vaccination schedule.

The Andalusian government stressed last week [week of 28 Mar 2011]
that "the only way to prevent this disease is through vaccination."
Measles presents as a rash of red sots and may include, among its
symptoms, otitis media, croup, pneumonia, diarrhea, seizure, or
febrile convulsions.

Children under 6 months are immunized naturally (both from their
mother during pregnancy and subsequently through breastfeeding), thus
that "it is not necessary vaccinate at this age."

The increased mobility of people and consequent disruption of
vaccination campaigns for diseases such as measles, which was
considered eradicated decades ago, are identified as one cause of the
outbreak of the disease in Andalusia.

The present outbreak had its 1st episode late last year [2010] in
Granada, a province where more than 50 cases were recorded in a school
where parents had declined to have their children vaccinated until
required to ultimately by a judicial decree.

Canariasaldia.com has been told that the University Hospital Nuestra
Senora de La Candelaria (Hunsc) [in Santa Cruz de Tenerife] has begun
vaccinating their staff following an outbreak of measles virus
infection in the hospital. The 1s case, a nurse in the recovery ward,
was recorded 15 days ago. Shortly afterwards an anesthesiologist and
several nurses in the Emergency Unit fell with similar symptoms.
Doctors believe that the emergence of this disease, which was believed
to have been nearly eradicated in Western Europe, is a consequence of
deficiencies in vaccine coverage.

For the present health authorities are providing measles vaccination
for people aged between 25 and 35 years, the age group most at risk of
infection. The outbreak in the Canary Islands, for the moment limited
to a very concrete zone, joins those reported in Seville (where there
have been more than 400 cases) and in Granada.

Vaccination is being implemented by Hunsc healthcare providers with
commendable urgency and medical workers are being trained to identify
case of measles and apply appropriate treatment.

Measles begins with viral conjunctivitis and continues with a rash,
sore throat, and high fever. In addition, the patient usually has
small white spots on the palate, which are known as "Koplik spots". In
severe cases, onset of pneumonia is possible, causing a serious health
risk to the patient. Rarely encephalitis can occur.

The disease is highly contagious and is spread through direct contact
with the patient or when saliva droplets expelled to the outside after
sneezing or coughing.

In just the 1st 3 months of the year (January-19 Mar 2011), over 2000
cases of measles have already been recorded in the country. 5 of these
resulted in death.

The majority of the cases are in the National Capital Region [NCR]
(311 cases). The rest are in Central Luzon (298), Bicol region (277),
Calabarzon (238), Davao region (197), Ilocos region (174), and
Zamboanga peninsula (163). In NCR, most of the cases are in Manila
(101). Quezon City, meanwhile, had 50 cases, while Caloocan had 36.

To address this problem, the Department of Health (DOH) launched
yesterday [4 Apr 2011] a month-long nationwide campaign "Iligtas sa
Tigdas ang Pinas", a [measles-rubella] vaccination campaign targeting
children aged 9 months up to 8 years old. The campaign hopes to curb
the rising incidence of measles cases, which reached 6000 in 2010.
Vaccination teams dubbed "bakunadoors" will go door-to-door to
administer free vaccinations.

The DOH asked parents to allow vaccination teams into their homes to
conduct the activity. Measles is a serious illness, according to the
DOH. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as
bronchopneumonia and diarrhea, and even death.

press release [summ., edited]
http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE1104/S00017/measles-outbreak-in-hastings.htm


Parents are urged to make sure their children are up-to-date with
their childhood vaccinations following 6 confirmed cases of measles in
children in Hastings [Hawke's Bay]. Medical officer of health Caroline
McElnay said measles can make people very sick, is highly infectious,
and can be spread by breathing, sneezing, and coughing. Measles
patients can also suffer from complications such as ear infection,
pneumonia, or diarrhoea and although rare it can cause serious
diseases such as brain inflammation.

2 of the cases were linked to confirmed cases in Auckland with the
remaining 4 cases secondary to the Hastings cases. Dr McElnay also
advised adults who were born after 1969 to check with their GP as they
may also not be immune.

Measles is a virus infection which starts with red eyes, runny nose,
cough, and fever. After a few days a skin rash develops. People who
have not been immunised are more likely to catch the disease and pass
it on to others. Anyone over the age of one year, who was born after
1969, and who has not had 2 doses of measles vaccine in the past is
eligible for free measles immunisation.

Dr McElnay said while Hawke's Bay had very good rates of immunisation
amongst pre school children, older children and adults may not be
up-to-date with the measles vaccine.

Somalia: vaccine fears fuel measles outbreak
--------------------------------------------
The cause of a measles outbreak in Somalia has yet to be determined
but doctors say initial suspicions point to "unfounded rumours" that
the vaccine could cause HIV/AIDS in children and interfere with their
reproductive abilities.

"There are false rumours creating fear among parents that the
vaccination causes HIV/AIDS and can affect a child's reproductive
system," said Ismail Isse Roble, head of the Bari Medical Association
in Bosasso, capital of Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland.
Roble said most of the children brought to his clinic had not been
vaccinated.

"The irony is that most of the affected children are those whose
parents can afford medical care," he said. "Children in IDP
[internally displaced persons] camps [in Bosasso] are least affected
because they took advantage of the free vaccinations provided."

According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO) Somalia, 83
cases, including 5 deaths, were reported in Mogadishu in the past 5
weeks. Some 127 cases were reported in Puntland, WHO said.

The agency said the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), WHO and their
partners conducted outbreak response campaigns in the last week of
March [2011], vaccinating more than 75 000 children.

Although measles cannot be treated, WHO said, "it can easily be
prevented by taking the measles vaccine that is provided in all MCH
[mother-child health] facilities in Somalia daily for free." Lul
Mahamud Mohamed, head of the pediatric department at Benadir Hospital
in Mogadishu, told IRIN she had been seeing more and more cases in the
past 3 months. "In February [2011], we had 53 cases with 3 deaths; in
March [2011], there were 81 cases with 6 deaths," she said. "In the
1st week of April [2011], we already had 17 cases and 2 deaths. The
increasing numbers point to an upward trend," said Mohamed. She said
90 percent of the patients were younger than 2. Since February, 151
cases of measles have been reported in Benadir hospital alone.

"Already, there are response campaigns going on in the affected areas
but they are being hampered by lack of access to certain areas,"
Mohamed told IRIN. Mohamed said overcrowding in parts of Mogadishu and
in the IDP camps in the Afgoye corridor facilitated the spread of the
virus.

She said vaccines were available but parents had to be convinced to
take their children to be immunized. "We need to mount an awareness
campaign to fight these false rumours and lies that the vaccine will
harm the child." Mohamed appealed to parents with children aged
between 9 months and 5 years who had never received the measles
vaccination to take their children to the nearest immunizing health
facility.

Roble in Bosasso said religious scholars should also inform the
people about the safety of the vaccines. "They are the ones that
ordinary Somalis will listen to; it is sad that in this day and age
our children must die because of ignorance and lies," Roble said.
