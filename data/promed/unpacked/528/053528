Officials at Selfridge Air National Guard Base are scrambling to
determine the cause of a bacterial outbreak that sickened at least 31
people and led to 2 contracting Legionnaires' disease.

On Monday [26 Jul 2010], doctors diagnosed 2 people with Legionnaires'
[disease], an acute respiratory infection that kills 5-30 percent of
patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The 2 were a member of the Michigan Air National Guard and a civilian
for Warren-based TACOM Life Cycle Management Command, one of the U.S.
Army's largest weapons researchers and developers.

During the 12-24 Jul 2010 respiratory outbreak, 6 people were
hospitalized and later released, said Gen. Kurt Stein, commanding
manager of TACOM Life Cycle. Doctors are monitoring those stricken
with the upper respiratory illness to see whether they contract
Legionnaires' [disease], which can be treated with antibiotics.

Two buildings were closed for sanitizing. Results of air and water
tests are expected back within 10 days. Legionnaires' [disease] cannot
be spread from person to person and is mainly passed by inhaling
contaminated airborne water droplets.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that
is less severe than Legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its
name from an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan.

Although not stated specifically in the news release above,
presumably, of the 31 people sickened in the outbreak who were not
diagnosed as having Legionnaires' disease, the remainder presumably
have Pontiac fever, which develops from a few hours to 2 days after
initial infection, with fever, malaise and muscle aches. Symptoms
resolve in 2-5 days without antibiotic treatment. Attack rates of
Pontiac fever are high; up to 95 percent of exposed persons become
ill. Unlike Legionnaires' disease, there appear to be no predisposing
host conditions for Pontiac fever.

The following is extracted from Moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail
post Legionellosis - Spain (03): Barcelona, Pontiac fever 20100718.2405:

"Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Water
temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations
of the organism in water storage tanks of plumbing systems.
Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers,
spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, and cooling towers. Why
some persons exposed to contaminated aerosols develop Legionnaires'
disease and others develop Pontiac fever is unknown.

"The diagnosis of Pontiac fever is usually made on the basis of
epidemiologic, clinical, serological, environmental microbiology
findings, and, in a variable portion of the affected people, the
development of antibodies to the bacterium isolated from the
environment. However, _Legionella_ species are commonly found in the
environment in the absence of illness, and _Legionella_ antibodies can
be non-specific. Urinary antigen for _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is
uncommonly positive, and cultures are rarely positive for _Legionella_
in patients with Pontiac fever. For a discussion of the pathogenesis
and diagnosis of Pontiac fever, see Edelstein PH. Urinary antigen
tests positive for Pontiac fever. Clin Infect Dis 2007; 44:2229-31."

The Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) is located in
Warren, the 3rd largest city (population 138 247 in the year 2000) in
the U.S. state of Michigan, and Metro Detroit's largest suburb. Both
the city of Warren and Selfridge Air National Guard Base are located
in Macomb County, Michigan. Selfridge Air National Guard Base is an
Air National Guard installation
