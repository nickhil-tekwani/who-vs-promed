West Nile virus confirmed in Oakville blue jay
----------------------------------------------
OAKVILLE: A dead blue jay found in Oakville has tested positive on
confirmatory testing for West Nile virus at the Federal Laboratory in
Winnipeg. "Initial testing had shown signs of the virus. Further tests
confirm that the bird was infected with West Nile virus," said Dr Bob
Nosal, medical officer of health, Halton Region Health Department. To date,
2 birds have tested positive for the virus in Southwestern Ontario -- one
in Windsor and one in Oakville. The virus has not been detected in humans.
As a result of the confirmatory tests, mosquito traps will be set up in
Oakville early next week. Residents should continue to protect themselves
against mosquito bites and report dead crow and blue jay sightings to the
Health Department. In addition, it is very important to prevent mosquitoes
from breeding around homes.
