Recently, a driver in Shenzhen [Guangdong] bought a canned drink in a shop and drank directly from the can after opening it. Later, he developed fever and vomiting leading to kidney failure. At the hospital, testing revealed that he had a hemorrhagic fever. The physician explained that this infection pathway is basically connected with rats, with the suspicion that the can cap was contaminated by rat droppings. Through treatment, the patient is gradually recovering.

[The etiology of this reported case of hemorrhagic fever in Shenzhen is not specified but is suspected to be due to exposure to rat excrement. Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China. Although there are few symptoms mentioned in this report, the kidney involvement and subsequent recovery of the patient and possible association with rat excrement are compatible with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome due to Seoul hantavirus infection, common in China, and occurring in localities where the natural host, the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), is found.
