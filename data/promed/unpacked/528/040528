More than 50 cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported since the beginning of the current year [2019] in the wilaya of Tindouf, and all the necessary preventive measures have been taken, it was learned Sun 2 Jun 2019 from the Wilaya's Veterinary Inspectorate.

This number of cases was recorded following the veterinary control operations targeting the livestock of the Tindouf wilaya. The affected livestock (goats), in the commune of Oum-Laassel (170 km north of Tindouf), had been infected by other sick animals acquired from neighboring wilayas as part of the support of small farmers, said veterinary inspector Youssef Mekbal.

To circumscribe this [epizootic] and to avoid the infection of the livestock, the services concerned instructed the farmers to proceed to the slaughter of the infected animals. However, the latter rejected the decision in spite of the sensitization campaign, he explained.

All the necessary human and material resources were mobilized by the inspectorate to circumscribe the foci of the disease, particularly in the enclave and border areas, according to this official, calling for the necessary involvement of the authorities and associations in order to ensure effective control of animal health in the region.

Coordination meetings with livestock keepers were held to discuss the susceptibility and location of herds, ways of organizing vaccination campaigns, preventive measures required in the border area for the protection of animal health, and the needed mobilization of a mixed brigade in coordination with Saharawi refugees for the vaccination of the valuable animals.

[The information above is different from Algeria's follow-up report No. 10, submitted to the OIE on 3 Jun 2019. According to that report (and also to the earlier follow-up report No. 9), no new FMD outbreaks have been recorded in Algeria since 8 May 2019 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30692). However, the report indicates that the event is "continuing."

Links to the immediate notification and the 10 follow-up reports from Algeria, submitted to the OIE since the start of the epizootic on 20 Jun 2018, and a map showing all outbreaks, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30692.

The epizootic's summary, from WAHID's archive (as of 3 Jun 2019), is as follows:

Total outbreaks = 317 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1289 / 580 / 21 / 58 / 819
Sheep / 47 020 / 5804 / 2860 / 2 / 0
Goats / 3837 / 348 / 195 / 5 / 0

The case fatality rate is remarkably high in small ruminants (sheep and goats). Information on the age of the dead animals could provide clarification (juveniles?). In addition, information on the vaccination coverage will be useful.

The virus spread from Algeria to the other Maghreb countries, Tunisia and Morocco, and has recently been reported from Libya. - Mod.AS
