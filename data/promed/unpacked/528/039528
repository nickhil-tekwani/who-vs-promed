Quarterly report on the Surveillance of _Clostridium difficile_
Associated Disease (CDAD) in Scotland, January-March 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ribotype 027 outbreaks
----------------------
During the period from 22 Apr to 6 Jun 2008, outbreaks involving
ribotype 027 were reported from hospitals in Aberdeen, Glasgow, and
Clyde.

A total of 4 cases of 027 were reported from the Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary and 2 cases from Aberdeen Woodend Hospital. A total of 6
cases of 027 were reported from Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow. A total
of 4 cases of 027 were reported from the Vale of Leven Hospital. The
numbers mentioned here only include confirmed and typed cases at the
time of completion of this report.

Discussion
----------
This report covers CDAD [_Clostridium difficile_-associated disease]
surveillance data in persons, aged 65 and over, collected from
January-March 2008. Accumulated typing data is provided covering the
period from November 2007-March 2008. In addition, outbreaks that
occurred in April-May [2008] (outside the reporting period for this
report) are reported here as well due to the high public interest.

The recent outbreaks caused by ribotype 027 have tripled the total
number of 027 cases recorded in Scotland since 2006. Similar trends
have also been observed in Europe, where increased surveillance
activity has led to the identification of ribotype 027 in 16
countries.

Of the Scottish 027-isolates that have been MIC-tested, 100 percent
were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 90 percent to clindamycin, and
more than 50 percent resistant to cephalosporins. Thus, the use of
fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and clindamycin may play an
important role in the spread and persistence of ribotype 027 in
Scotland.

Moreover, isolates of ribotype 078 have been reported in Scotland.
Ribotype 078 is a new emerging type with similar mechanisms for hyper
production of toxins as ribotype 027. Ribotype 078 is increasingly
being reported in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Northern Ireland.
Ribotype 078 is a common ribotype in pigs.

An investigation into cases at the Vale of Leven Hospital in
Alexandria found that 8 of the 54 patients who contracted
_Clostridium difficile_ had died as a direct result. The infection
was a contributory factor in a further 8 deaths and a review of
hygiene procedures and the use of antibiotics -- which can harm the
body's defences against infection -- is now underway. A further 6
patients who contracted _C. diff[icile]_ later died although the
infection was not responsible.

The investigation by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde revealed that of
the 54 patients treated for the superbug, 13 had it when they were
admitted to the hospital. It launched the inquiry in May [2008] amid
fears that the infection had been passed between the Vale of Leven
Hospital and the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.

Dr Syed Ahmed, of the outbreak control team, said: "The overall
number of _C. difficile_ cases within the 6-month period is higher on
average than we would expect, but we are particularly concerned about
the number of deaths due to this infection. This may not be due to
any specific strain of _C. difficile_ but more to do with the type of
patients treated at the Vale of Leven, which has a high proportion of
elderly patients who are more likely to develop symptoms of the
infection. Older people have a far greater natural occurrence of _C.
difficile_. One in 5 older people carry the bug in their gut compared
to only one in 50 young adults."

Ross Finnie, the Lib Dem health spokesman, said the death of 8
patients suggested a "complete failure" by the health board to keep
on top of virus control. The hospital is to be given improved hand
washing facilities, with greater emphasis placed on hygiene
protocols. The latest techniques for treating and managing _C.
difficile_ will also be introduced.

Prof John Coia, director of the National _C. difficile_ Reference
Service, said one of the most significant measures taken would
involve changing the way antibiotics were used. He added: "Recent
reports from elsewhere in the UK and North America show that
significant reductions in _C. difficile_ rates can be achieved when
this measure is used to supplement existing infection control
techniques."

There are currently only 3 patients in the hospital with the
infection and all are being treated in isolation, the health board
said. _C. difficile_ is a bacterium that causes diarrhoea and more
serious intestinal conditions such as colitis.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is investigating a potential outbreak
of 3 cases of the 027 strain of _Clostridium difficile_ (C-diff)
involving 3 patients in the Clyde area. Two of the Clyde patients
were treated in the same ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital earlier
this year [2008]. One patient died in March as a result of the
infection.

The other patient was subsequently admitted to the Royal Alexandra
Hospital (RAH) in Paisley where they came into contact with another
individual who has now also been confirmed as having the type 027
strain of the infection. Both patients are being treated in isolation
at the RAH in line with national infection control standards.

Due to a higher incidence in the number of C-diff cases across the UK
and the creation of a new C-diff testing laboratory for Scotland,
investigations by our infection control teams were able to establish
that these three cases could be linked.

The most recent of the 3 infected patients became ill in April
[2008], it was not known that it was the virulent 027 strain until
last week [18-24 May 2008] when the national laboratory confirmed the
strain. We are unaware of any new linked cases since April.

Tom Walsh, infection control manager, for NHS Greater Glasgow and
Clyde, said: "We have now established a possible link between all 3
cases and are treating this as a potential 027 outbreak.

"We have notified colleagues in Health Protection Scotland and
continue to adhere to our strict infection control procedures. I
would like to reassure patients that we are taking all the necessary
measures required."

A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health
Protection Unit emphasised: "This potential outbreak is not linked to
the 5 cases of the 027 strain reported last week [18-24 May 2008] at
Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. The 4 patients being treated at
Stobhill are recovering well."

[_Clostridium difficile_ ribotype 027 hyper-produces toxin and
infection caused by this ribotype is associated with increased
morbidity, mortality, and poor response to antimicrobial therapy. This
ribotype is characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use
of which is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. difficile_
-associated diarrhea due to ribotype 027.

The above reports document the continued spread of ribotype 027 in
the UK (for a discussion, see ProMED-mail archive numbers
20080302.0859, 20080207.0498, 20070427.1377, and 20070410.1203).

The report from Health Protection Scotland on 2 Jul 2008 indicates one
additional ribotype 027 case at Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital, 2 new
cases at Aberdeen's Woodend hospital and 4 new cases at Vale of Leven
Hospital in Alexandria since the prior ProMED archive number
20080518.1662 on 18 May 2008. The NHS report above further
characterizes the ribotype 027 outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital,
which occurred against a background of an extensive outbreak of _C.
difficile_ associated disease at Vale of Leven Hospital that involved
54 patients, some of whom may have had actually illness due to
ribotype 027 (not all strains were likely ribotyped). We await further
results of their epidemiological and microbiological investigation.

The report from Health Protection Scotland on 2 Jul 2008 also mentions
the recent emergence in Scotland of another toxin hyper-producing
ribotype, 078.
