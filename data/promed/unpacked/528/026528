A new study says flu viruses of swine origin that caused a dozen infections in the United States in the 2nd half of last year [2011] appear to have pandemic potential. And the work, by scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, seems to suggest that the fact the viruses haven't taken off in people may have more to do with human immunity than the viruses themselves. The findings are based on a transmission study in ferrets, work which is somewhat similar to the studies that sparked the ongoing controversy over lab-made H5N1 viruses.

For several months now, Dutch and American researchers have been attempting to publish scientific papers showing how they developed H5N1 -- bird flu virus (avian A/H5N1 influenza virus) -- that transmitted easily among ferrets [considered the best animal for predicting how a flu virus might behave in people]. At a World Health Organization meeting last week, a group of experts -- many of whom were drawn from the world of influenza research -- agreed that the studies should be published in full, despite a U.S. government request that key portions of data be kept out of the public domain.

The new study, published Monday [20 Feb 2012] in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see citation and abstract below] involves work with an H3N2 swine virus -- now called an H3N2 variant [swine influenza A/H3N2v virus] -- that has caused sporadic human cases in the United States [and perhaps a case in Viet Nam, see part [2] below), including some limited person-to-person spread [see previous ProMED-mail references below].

The controversy over the H5N1 work relates to the fact that the research teams pushed the dangerous viruses to evolve to the point where they spread readily among ferrets, which might make the lab-made viruses transmissible among people. Currently, H5N1 viruses rarely infect people, although when they do, the infections are often fatal.

In the H3N2 variant study, the researchers didn't need to force the viruses to mutate so that they were able to infect ferrets. The viruses already seem well-adapted to infecting mammals, senior author Terrence Tumpey said in an interview. The study looked at H3N2 variant viruses from 2009, 2010 and 2011. Over those years, the viruses had changed. In particular, in 2011, the virus picked up [by subunit reassortment] a gene -- an M gene -- from the H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 pandemic. The M gene, when tested in guinea pigs, seems to make [influenza] virus more transmissible. That led flu scientists to hypothesize that the M gene might make it easier for the swine viruses to infect people and might explain what appeared to be an increase in human cases last year [2011].

This study actually questions that finding, noting that H3N2 variant viruses from 2010 were as transmissible in ferrets as the 2011 version. "It is unclear whether the acquisition of the M gene ... enhanced the ability of A(H3N2)v virus to spread in pigs and infect people," the study said. Tumpey, a microbiologist, said these viruses -- which are distant cousins to human [seasonal] H3N2 viruses -- attach to the same cell receptors that human flu viruses attach to. Avian influenza viruses attach to different receptors which aren't common in the human respiratory tract, which is thought to be why H5N1 viruses don't infect humans more frequently.

"Overall, for the more recent ones, the 2010 and 2011 viruses, we are seeing very efficient transmission events, similar to what we see with seasonal H3N2 viruses," Tumpey said of the H3N2 variant viruses. "These viruses have the pandemic potential, but we also need more data to really understand the cross-reactive immunity in the general population to the H3N2 (variant) viruses."

After causing 12 cases from the end of July 2011 through the late fall, there hasn't been a human infection with the H3N2 variant spotted since before Christmas [2011]. Tumpey said some experts felt the cases would drop off after the season for agricultural fairs ended. A number of the cases involved exposure of people to sick pigs at these types of events.

He also noted that just as flu has a season in people, infections in pigs may peak at different points of the year, during which time the risk of transmission to people might be higher. Another possible explanation for why the viruses haven't spread more broadly may relate to how much immunity humans have to them, Tumpey said. The H3N2 viruses moved from humans into the pig population in the early 1990s; since then, the human and pig versions have evolved along separate paths. It's thought that anyone born after the early 1990s would not have antibodies that would recognize and protect against those viruses. But people born before then may. Finding out more about the immunity levels of humans to these viruses is important, the study said, to assessing how big a risk they pose.

A recent small study from Canadian researchers suggested there may be more vulnerability to these viruses in the human population than one might suspect. The work, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, saw no antibodies in children and teens but strong levels in young adults. But by age 40, antibody levels start to tail off sharply, the study suggested.

Title: Pathogenesis and transmission of swine origin A(H3N2)v influenza viruses in ferrets. By: Melissa B. Pearcea and 12 others. Published online before print 21 Feb 2012, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119945109 PNAS http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/13/1119945109.abstract?sid=8e4a34c6-c180-4582-af7d-7800ea8d223b.

Abstract: "Recent isolation of a novel swine-origin influenza A H3N2 variant virus [A(H3N2)v] from humans in the United States has raised concern over the pandemic potential of these viruses. Here, we analyzed the virulence, transmissibility, and receptor-binding preference of 4 A(H3N2)v influenza viruses isolated from humans in 2009, 2010, and 2011. High titers of infectious virus were detected in nasal turbinates and nasal wash samples of A(H3N2)v-inoculated ferrets. All 4 A(H3N2)v viruses possessed the capacity to spread efficiently between co-housed ferrets, and the 2010 and 2011 A(H3N2)v isolates transmitted efficiently to naive ferrets by respiratory droplets. A dose-dependent glycan array analysis of A(H3N2)v showed a predominant binding to alpha2-6-sialylated glycans, similar to human-adapted influenza A viruses. We further tested the viral replication efficiency of A(H3N2)v viruses in a relevant cell line, Calu-3, derived from human bronchial epithelium. The A(H3N2)v viruses replicated in Calu-3 cells to significantly higher titers compared with 5 common seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses. These findings suggest that A(H3N2)v viruses have the capacity for efficient replication and transmission in mammals and underscore the need for continued public health surveillance."

These findings indicate that the determinants of transmissibility and replication of avian and mammalian influenza viruses in the human population are complex and dependent on several factors, including the immune response to past exposures in addition to virus genome mutation and sub-unit reassortment. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam claimed the 1st patient who was infected by swine influenza virus (H3N2) in April 2011 and was re-confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 10 Jan 2012. The news was announced here on Wed [15 Feb 2012] by Dr. Nguyen Thanh Duong, deputy director of the Viet Nam Preventive Medicine Department, under the Ministry of Health (MOH).

According to the report, the patient was a 2-year-old girl from southern Long An province who was treated at the No. 1 Children Hospital in April 2011 and later recovered. She was then confirmed by the southern influenza supervisory network as infected by swine influenza virus H3N2. On 10 Jan 2012, the test result was re-confirmed by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under WHO standard criteria.

The MOH instructed the national influenza supervisory network to closely watch for possible H3N2 as well as closely coordinate with the WHO Viet Nam Office to monitor this type of disease. It was the 1st [swine] H3N2 infected case in Viet Nam, with no signs of human-to-human infection. Since April 2011, there has not been any other case, the MOH reported.

However, due to the current expansion of bird flu outbreaks in many localities across the country, the MOH warned relevant agencies and residents to strictly implement hygienic measures relating to poultry and animal slaughtering, and to go to the hospital as soon as possible for treatment when there is any sign infection.
