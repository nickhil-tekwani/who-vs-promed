7 measles cases spotted in DuPage County
----------------------------------------
The Illinois Department of Public Health has confirmed 7 cases of
measles in DuPage County, making health officials stress again the
importance of vaccination against the disease.

Measles, which infects about 20 million worldwide every year, can be
a severe illness that causes symptoms like rash, high fever, cough,
runny nose, and red, watery eyes. In rare cases, patients face more
serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even
seizure and death. Those who think they may be infected should
contact their doctor.

Authorities believe that none of the children who were found with
measles received adequate vaccinations. The federal officials have
long been stressing the importance of immunizing children against
measles, mumps, and rubella, but many parents refuse to vaccinate
their children for religious reasons or because they think the shots
may cause autism or other health problems.

According to a report by the [US] Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) at the beginning of this month [May 2008], the US
faces the biggest measles outbreak in 7 years with 64 cases from
January throughout 25 Apr 2008, more than in all of 2006 and the
highest number during that 4-month period since 2001 (116 cases).
Officials said the rise can be attributed in part to overseas
travelers catching the virus and bringing it back to the US

Before the measles vaccination program, about 3-4 million persons in
the US were infected each year, of whom 400-500 died, 48 000 were
hospitalized, and another 1000 developed a chronic disability from
measles encephalitis.

[This outbreak appears to have been initiated by a visitor from
Switzerland. A press report of 27 May 2008 stated that: "State health
officials say they've confirmed a case of measles in DuPage County.
It is the 2nd case of measles in Illinois this year (2008). The 1st
was found in a man visiting from Switzerland; the most recent was
found in a school-aged boy. Authorities declined to specify in which
city the strain was found." (See:
