MONTEVIDEO: Uruguayan health authorities reported Saturday that 400 people
had suffered [salmonellosis] from eating contaminated food and warned about
the possibility of new cases. Patients of various ages included a
legislator and several congress officials, but their lives were not at
risk, said Health Ministry epidemiology director Sergio Curto.
The outbreak originated in one of the most popular cafes in Montevideo,
specializing in sandwiches. All the patients had eaten at this cafe, which
was closed down on Wednesday [29 Nov 2000] after the first cases were detected.
