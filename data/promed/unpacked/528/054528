Found this on the wires today. Any information on the economic impact of
this to Malaysia? Is Malaysia a major pig exporter? Will banning the
export of pork impact on possible transmission or have I forgotten basic
epidemiology and entomology. Is JE transmitted in the meat of infected
pigs? (has the _Culex_ suddenly developed a taste for slabs of raw pork
with live virus ingestion from the residual blood in the meat?)

Thailand has imposed an import ban on Malaysian pork in a bid to stop the
spread of pig-born Japanese encephalitis, a statement of the Ministry of
Public Health available Sunday said.
"The livestock department has banned all pork imports and live pigs from
Malaysia and set up an ad-hoc patrol unit along the common border," the
statement said.
Meanwhile, public health experts warned the public not to panic as no cases
of the disease had been detected in Thailand.
Japanese encephalitis, which can cause inflammation of the brain, is spread
to humans from pigs by the _Culex_ mosquito. The disease has been reported
to cause at least 53 deaths in Malaysia.
The Public Health Ministry warned people to avoid mosquitoes and not to
keep live pigs near houses.
Officials manning customs checkpoints on the Thai-Malaysian border had
stepped up vigilance to ensure Malaysian pig-virus epidemic did not spread
to Thailand.
The Malaysian viral outbreak has killed at least 53 people since October,
and troops have begun killing more than 300,000 pigs in a bid to contain
it. Almost all of the 53 victims lived or worked near pig farms.
Neighboring Singapore has also suspended the import of live pigs from
Malaysia and Indonesia.

Perhaps some consideration should be given to possible host species of the
virus - such as bats. A survey of these animals might isolate the offending
organism.
If the Hendra[-like virus is able to be maintained in pigs it should not
be assumed that the routes of transmission will be the same as those found
in horses in Australia. Additionally the infectivity of the organism may
be different - surely serious precautions should be taken in the handling
of potentially infected pigs.

[Correct on both counts. I expect that the epidemiologic studies to be
done by Ken Lam and the international team of consultants will soon
investigate the flying fox roosts and see what's what there. The
appropriate studies cannot all be done in one day or one week. Still, all
questions are good one and should be addressed seriously. The first
problem to solve is how to stop this epizoodemic.
It is frightening to consider that people recently were beating some of
these pigs to death with boards. Surely someone was splattered with blood,
and that couldn't possibly be a good thing. - Mod.CHC

Doctors at the University Hospital are experimenting treating patients
suspected of having contracted the Hendra-like virus with a drug called
ribavirin. UH head of Medical Microbiology Department Prof. Lam Sai Kit
said the doctors investigating the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) outbreak
discovered a Hendra-like virus in laboratory specimens taken from the
victims.
"We know it is a Hendra-like virus and we want to determine how important
its role is in JE," Prof. Lam told a press conference when asked whether
the virus they had found was the Hendra virus. He said the drug, which had
long been available, was an effective anti-viral measure against the
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which causes bronchitis in children.
[RSV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, as is Hendra virus. -

"We do not know enough about the virus but we believe the drug would be
effective. Ribavirin inhibits the growth of the RSV and may work for the
Hendra-like virus," he said. The hospital, Prof. Lam said, started
treating patients with the drug from Friday and would only know whether it
worked if the patients' conditions did not deteriorate.
"The seven-day regime treatment with the drug costs about RM3,000 and the
hospital is currently footing the bill," he said. Prof. Lam also said the
potential side-effects of the drug included anaemia, but the recovery of
the patients outweighed the side-effects. He said since the outbreak, 39
victims from the Bukit Pelanduk area had been admitted into the hospital.
Of this, six had since died but seven had been sent home after treatment
proved successful. [etiology unstated - Mod.CHC
He also said Dr Chua Kaw Bing from the UH, who had isolated the Hendra-like
virus, had gone to the United States to confirm the isolated agent and the
result would be known in a few days.
He said experts from Australia and the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in
the United States would be here next week to help study the virus. The
experts, said Prof. Lam, had also developed a test kit to determine how
common the illness was.
However, he refuted claims that the virus was transmitted from horses,
saying a study in Australia which tested 200 people who handled horses
infected with the virus showed that they did not get infected. [The first
person to die with Hendra virus infection in Queensland had shoved a bolus
of food down the throat of a horse that subsequently died of Hendra virus.

Pork consumption also does not appear to transmit the virus, while
butchers and housewives who handle pork do not get infected, he said [Huh?
- Mod.CHC.
"Culling the pigs is a good way of breaking the chain of transmission.
However, people should continue taking vaccination for JE," he said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Education Minister Datuk Dr Fong Chan Onn said the
ministry was trying its best to help overcome the current crisis. He said
he was grateful that hospital staff were able to identify the new strain of
the virus within a short time. "We will continue to do our best to help the
Health Ministry," he said.
