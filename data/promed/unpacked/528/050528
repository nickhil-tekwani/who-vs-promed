[We know a mite more than before: 12 cattle out of the herd of 69 head were "sick", 8 died, and 4 were butchered. Animals sick with anthrax tend to occur in the 2nd half of the outbreak when the owner is alert to the problem, and they will respond to antibiotic treatment if prompt on noticing the animal(s) is/are sick. The incubation period for anthrax is a function of the dose, thus the 1st deaths would have had maximum exposure with small chance of being noted ill before dying. While they state that the previous outbreak in Iraq was in May, 2016, they do not say where that outbreak was or what relation it might have to this Dohuk outbreak in August, 2021. The good news is that the herd was due to be vaccinated and hopefully the other herds in Kanimas which might have been exposed to a common source and/or haemorrhagic tabanid flies.

Dohuk is the capital of the Kurdish regional government's Dohuk governorate. Dohuk province in the north of the country can be located on the map at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/iraq.pdf.
