Abstract
"In 2018, there was a large West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in northern Italy. We observed 5 atypical cases of WNV infection that were characterised by the presence of WNV RNA and WNV IgG at the time of diagnosis, but no IgM response during follow-up. Neutralisation assays demonstrated pre-existing Usutu virus immunity in all patients. Besides challenging diagnosis, the immunological crosstalk between the 2 viruses warrants further investigation on possible cross-protection or infection enhancement effects."

[WNV and Usutu virus (USUV) are genetically related neurotropic mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which are endemic in several European countries. In their transmission cycle, WNV and USUV share the same mosquito vectors and bird populations as amplifying hosts, and often the 2 viruses co-circulate in the same environment. Most WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic or characterised by influenza-like illness, while less than one percent of cases might evolve to severe and potentially fatal neuro-invasive disease, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. USUV appears to be more pathogenic and lethal than WNV for some bird species, while it rarely causes disease in humans; (J Clin Virol. 2018;107:38-47. DOI: 10.1016/j.jcv.2018.08.007 PMID: 30176404).

According to the paper, the 1st human cases of WNV infection were detected in northern Italy in 2008 with subsequent WNV infection outbreaks reported every year. The 1st human cases of USUV infection were detected in northern Italy in 2009 in immunocompromised patients [Euro Surveill. 2009;14(50):19446.PMID: 20070936]. Seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than WNV infection (estimated to range between 0.3 and 3 percent) in areas where both viruses co-circulate [J Med Virol. 2018;90(10):1666-8. DOI: 10.1002/jmv.25230 PMID: 29797606].

The 2018 transmission season recorded a substantial increase in the number of human WNV infections, with approx. 1500 confirmed cases in European Union countries, with Italy as the most affected country [available from: https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever]. The authors infer that the unprecedented high number of WNV infections recorded in 2018 in the Veneto Region (440 confirmed cases) was perhaps the main factor that led to the identification of the cases of WNV infection with an atypical immune response, which is described in the paper, since the diagnostic process was similar to that of the previous years.

The study concludes: "Further investigation including a larger number of cases is needed to better define the clinical and virological features of WNV infection in individuals with pre-existing flavivirus imunity and to understand if USUV infection provides cross-protection against WNV disease or whether it might increase the risk for more severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement. Infections from closely related flaviviruses, like WNV and USUV, may pose problems not only because of the induction of cross-reactive antibodies that challenge the differential diagnosis, but also because the immunological crosstalk between heterologous viruses may increase the risk of severe disease through a mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection." - Mod.UBA
