Subject: Flooding and Anthrax in Stavropol
For what it might be worth, here is a reply from one of my trusted
colleagues living in Stavropol.

I am surprised it took this long for this announcement. It has been almost
2 weeks since the floods. It is the main story on all Russian TV channels
still, stating it is the worst natural disaster in Russian history. I am
not sure about worst, but it is pretty bad.
The story here is that the engineers at the reservoirs saw the water level
rising too fast and opened the sluice gates and thereby managed to make a
bad situation horrible. The current concerns are anthrax as you noted and
hep-A. The TV stated that livestock would be inoculated for anthrax and
many people are getting hep-A vaccines. The water supply in many areas is
suspect. We have been boiling ours for many days and we live in the capital
city: Stavropol city in Stavropol region. We are not really affected, as
the city is on a hill and we saw no flooding. But I hear stories from
people about going over a car bridge and 15 minutes later the bridge is
gone. The flooding has been unbelievably fast; no warning.
As I am sure you know, there is no insurance here. But the government has
stepped in for token payments. I think 50 000 rubles (approx. US $1500) in
the worst case. I have not heard anything about actual cases of anthrax,
but I believe I will if there are any. What I have heard is that human
vaccinations are only for hep-A, slightly different than below. However, I
cannot judge the veracity of it; it would be easy for me to be mistaken on
this.

There is currently flooding in some districts of Stavropol and Krasnodar
krays (North Caucasus), where many old anthrax sites are located. Surely
there is no need [for] any new vaccination programs, either human or
animal, against anthrax. I think that it will only be necessary to organize
measures to block both human and animal access to the anthrax sites. But
who knows the thoughts of local medical bureaucrats?

[The original report seems to have been the result of distant editors in
Moscow pruning local journalists' reports so that the two vaccines (anthrax
and hepatitis A) were reduced to one. On a lighter note I received a call
from a certain agency stating that there were 13 burial sites (probably
true) and maybe this anthrax vaccination campaign in southern Russia is
....... On the other hand severe flooding has been known to totally erode
contaminated sites (e.g., the Parfuri river in northern Kruger National
Park in South Africa), removing any risks until the disease is
reintroduced. It will be interesting to see what happens in these Russian
krays and in Texas, where a similar situation currently applies. This
thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ]
