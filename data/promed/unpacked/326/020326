The incidence of sclerotinia stem rot in Saskatchewan oilseed crops was up in 2016 [and] the province-wide average estimated at 24 percent, said Matthew Bernard, oilseed crops specialist. Estimates [of] yield loss [are] roughly 12 percent. [In 2015], 11 percent [were] infected; 18 percent in 2014. There were 224 crops surveyed across the province [and] 92 percent had at least trace levels of sclerotinia. This is higher than [2015] (66 percent) and the year before (17 percent in 2014). Wetter conditions in 2016 are evident in these results.

"Blackleg was prevalent in 61 percent of the crops surveyed," Bernard [said]. That compares to 59 percent in 2015 and 55 percent in 2014. While the disease was prevalent in more than half of surveyed fields, the average incidence was only 12 percent, slightly lower than the last 2 years [2014/15] when the incidence has been 15 percent.

[Sclerotinia
-----------
Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mould), is caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. The fungus is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts worldwide, including many crop species. It causes white fungal growth on aerial plant parts which leads to rotting, wilting and death of plants. On oilseed rape (osr; including canola cultivars), infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem lesions showing a typical bleached appearance develop.

The pathogen is primarily soil borne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia for up to 10 years and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means and wind borne spores. It is thought that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of a field as well as weather conditions (as mentioned above).

Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimize inoculum) and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soilborne fungal pathogens.


Blackleg
--------
Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. It can also affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds), which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse (lodging) of the crop. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may also occur.

The fungus is seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides.

Rape cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available and are placed into groups according to which resistance genes they carry (see link below). However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.
