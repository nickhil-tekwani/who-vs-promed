Serum and spinal fluid samples from a 77 year old Ewing man have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV) in the Department's Public Health and
Environmental Laboratories. Final confirmation of this case will be made
through testing by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).
The Mercer County man was admitted to a Hamilton hospital on 21 Aug 2002
with symptoms including fever, stiff neck, and changes in mental state. He
remains in hospital, in a serious, but stable, condition.
Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 73 individuals are in the process of
being tested for the presence of WNV. These individuals had either symptoms
or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria, or exhibited most
of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes
with the virus have been discovered. To date, 32 are negative, 1 is
positive, and 40 results are awaited.
Human testing for WNV is being conducted at the New Jersey Department of
Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory in
Trenton and at public health labs in other states. Test results are sent to
CDC for confirmation.
