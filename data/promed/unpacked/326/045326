As a result of the ongoing 1997 National Karnal Bunt Survey, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture confirmed September 8 the presence of Karnal bunt
in a wheat grain sample taken in central Texas in San Saba county.
"This is part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that our wheat meets the
phytosanitary requirements of importing countries," said Alfred S. Elder,
acting deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine with the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's marketing and
regulatory programs mission area.
Out of nearly 4,100 samples APHIS has tested thus far in the 1997 National
Survey, this is the first sample that has tested positive for Karnal bunt
and the only positive out of 188 samples processed in Texas. APHIS is
determining the extent of the
distribution of the infected wheat and considering appropriate actions to
prevent the spread of Karnal bunt.
The national survey works," said Elder. "If Karnal bunt is present, we'll
detect it."

national survey coordinator, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, on (301) 734-8247. For
