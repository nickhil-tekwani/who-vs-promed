At least 123 new cases of cholera were recorded over the last 4 days
at Lubango's Central Hospital, in Angola's southern Huila province, a
health source announced.
Feliz Januario, head of the Department of Public Health, said this is
because people are ignoring prevention measures. However, he said no
deaths were recorded in the mentioned period. Since the beginning of
the outbreak on 11 Apr 2006, the disease has killed 74 people in the
region, out of 944 cases recorded.

A suspected cholera outbreak has killed at least 80 people and forced
hundreds into hospitals in a far northeastern Nigerian state,
officials said on Sat 2 Sep 2006.
The victims, many of them women and children, died over the last 3
days in 9 districts of Borno state, where the outbreak was 1st
reported on Thursday [31 Aug 2006], officials said.
"An outbreak of ... vomiting and diarrhea has occurred in 9 areas of
Borno state killing more than 80 people so far," Talba Alkali,
permanent secretary in the ministry of health, told reporters in the
state capital Maiduguri. Medical teams have been dispatched to the
affected areas, while more than 1500 people afflicted by the disease
are in hospitals across the state, Alkali said.
"I strongly believe that the outbreak is as a result of drinking
contaminated water from streams and ponds," said Joseph Jatau,
director of disease control in the ministry of health.

[3] Cholera - Sudan (West Darfur)

Eight people -- including a child under 5 -- have died from cholera
in Mornay, western Darfur, in the last 2 weeks. The Doctors Without
Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) team has already treated more
than 60 patients. This occurred after various aid agencies withdrew
assistance to people living in the Darfur displaced persons' camps.
All the conditions contributing to cholera's appearance are present
in Mornay. In 2003, it was a small village of 5000 inhabitants.
Today, more than 75 000 people have taken refuge there, fleeing
killings and violence. For more than 2 years, people have been
crammed into makeshift shelters. The crowding, lack of latrines, poor
waste management, and inadequate drainage combine to make the
displaced persons particularly vulnerable.
MSF set up the water distribution system in 2004. It was later
managed by Oxfam and is now overseen by WES, a local organization
funded by UNICEF. Today, that system is failing, both in terms of
quantity and quality. While a minimum of 20 liters of water per
person per day is required to meet daily needs, the displaced persons
receive only 12. In addition, 2 water boreholes were replaced by a
system that pumped water from a well that proved to be muddy and
contaminated by bacteria (fecal coliform organisms). The muddiness
makes it difficult to chlorinate the water. Several broken water taps
have not been replaced.

Cholera is rampant across Sudan, with nearly 25 000 cases and more
than 700 deaths recorded in 2006, and the epidemic threatens
neighboring Chad, a top expert at WHO said on Tue 29 Aug 2006.
Cholera has broken out in most states of Sudan, including North and
South Darfur, but the toll does not include West Darfur, where
agencies have little access due to insecurity, said Claire-Lise
Chaignat, WHO's global cholera coordinator.
The water-borne disease could easily spread to Chad, where more than
200 000 Sudanese refugees from Darfur are staying in crowded camps
near Abeche, she added. "It is a huge epidemic, and the case fatality
rate in southern Sudan is 3 percent, which is high," Chaignat told
Reuters in an interview. "Chad is only a step away, and this bacteria
doesn't respect borders," she added.
The new WHO figures come on the heels of a warning on Mon 28 Aug 2006
by UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland, who told the Security
Council that Darfur was on the brink of a fresh humanitarian disaster
threatening "massive loss of life."
An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea currently raging in Ethiopia,
which has reached the capital Addis Ababa, is probably linked to
Sudan's cholera epidemic, Chaignat said. "There is probably a link
with the current cholera epidemic in Sudan, especially the 1st cases
in Gambella (western Ethiopia) in April 2006," the Swiss expert said.
Acute watery diarrhea has struck 16 555 people in Ethiopia, killing
200, aid agencies said. They have called for the outbreak to be
declared a national emergency. The ailment is spreading quickly in
Ethiopia's south-central region of Oromiya with "the potential to
spread down into Kenya," they said in an "Emergency Plan for Oromiya
region," a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on Tue 29 Aug 2006.

[5] Cholera - Zambia

[Period covered by this Interim Report: 14 Jan to 12 May 2006]
Cholera outbreaks occur annually in Zambia mainly due to poor
settlement planning in both urban and rural areas, resulting in
limited availability and access to basic services, such as clean and
safe water supply, improved sanitation as well as waste disposal
facilities. Just 4 months after the 2004- 2005 epidemic, the country
started recording new cholera cases in August 2005.
Between 13 Aug 2005 and 31 Jan 2006, a total of 2415 confirmed and
suspected cases, with 21 deaths (10 died at cholera centers and 11
were brought in dead) were reported. By 5 Apr 2006, the total cases
stood at 7615, of which 5991 cases were recorded in Lusaka District
alone. By 7 Mar 2006, the outbreak had affected 6 other provinces as
follows: Central Province (443 cases), Copper Belt Province (233
cases), Eastern Province (221 cases), Luapula Province (31 cases),
North-Western Province (2 cases) and Southern Province (314 cases).

[6] Cholera - Cote d'Ivoire (Abdijan)

A string of cholera outbreaks have spread through Cote d'Ivoire in
2006, with the most recent hitting the country's economic capital,
Abidjan, and leading the minister of health to declare an epidemic.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA) reported that statistics provided by Medecins Sans
Frontieres/Holland showed that there have been 321 cases of cholera
in the western part of the country since the beginning of 2006,
including 2 deaths. Added to this are 40 reported cases and 4 deaths
in Abidjan, in the south of the country, since the beginning of July
2006.
The 1st case of the season in Abidjan occurred in early July 2006,
when a fisherman returned from sea vomiting and suffering from a
severe case of diarrhea. He did not receive medical attention and
died. Tests later confirmed that he had cholera.
Since then, 26 more people were reported infected in the impoverished
neighborhood of Port-Bouet in the south of the city, where another
person died. Within less than 2 months, the disease has spread to 3
other neighborhoods, with 14 new cases being reported and 2 more
deaths in August 2006.

Beijing's health authorities announced on Sun 27 Aug 2006 that there
has been no outbreak of cholera in the city, refuting rumors spread
by cell phone text messages.
There are no cholera cases in Beijing caused by eating freshwater
fish and shrimp, said Zhao Tao, a disease control official with the
city's health authorities.
Aquatic products sold in Beijing are currently under scrutiny from
municipal food supervision authorities and the quarantine department,
Zhao said. Zhao also said the city's disease control and prevention
center has intensified sample checks of aquatic products in
supermarkets, restaurants and other trading places.
The center has detected no cholera bacteria in aquatic products sold
in the city so far in 2006, the official added.
In partnership with mobile telecom operators, the city government, on
Sat 26 Aug 2006, sent out a million short messages to refute scares
about eating freshwater fish.
