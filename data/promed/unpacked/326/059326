Very strong winds hit last week [1st week of November 2009] in the
Valencia region. As a result, besides the 30 million kg of persimmons
lost between August and September 2009 because of the _Mycosphaerella
nawae_ fungus, the wind caused an additional loss of 10 million kg.

The Department of Agriculture has announced aid of one million Euro
[USD 1.5 million] to farmers affected by the fungus, which jeopardized
more than 30 percent of the crop. Nevertheless, the Uni association
calls for stronger actions, urging the central government "not to
ignore the damage caused by this disease, which will result in an
income reduction for persimmon producers."

[Persimmon (_Diospyros kaki_) is an important fruit in Asia and
increasingly worldwide. Major diseases of the crop are mainly due to
fungi. _Mycosphaerella nawae_ causes circular leaf spot (CLS), and the
disease has been reported to be a serious constraint to persimmon
production in Korea and parts of China. Symptoms include expanding
circular spots on leaves surrounded by a halo, leaf necrosis, lesions
on fruit and premature leaf and fruit drop.

The pathogen overwinters on leaf debris, and spores are spread by wind
and mechanical means during the growing season. Disease development is
favoured by humid conditions and poor nutritional state of the host.
Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary measures as
well as fungicides. Resistance breeding in persimmon is restricted by
the lack of male flowers in many commercial cultivars.

In Spain, the main problem in controlling CLS is reported to be a lack
of fungicides whose active ingredients are permitted in the European
Union according to European legislation for the registration of
agrochemicals.

Related species in the genus _Mycosphaerella_ cause serious diseases
of other crops, for example the sigatoka diseases of banana.
