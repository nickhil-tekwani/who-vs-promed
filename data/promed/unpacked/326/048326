The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) reports 76 suspicious
cattle deaths within the past 10 days. Lab tests have confirmed 3
positive cases, with ongoing tests being conducted on other samples.
21 farms have been quarantined in the Rural Municipalities of Willow
Creek and Kinistino, located north and west of Melfort. Another farm
is also quarantined south of Melfort. CFIA veterinarian Dr. Greg
Douglas says the farm is being investigated to see if the environment
is responsible. Heavy runoff and erosion can expose anthrax spores to
livestock.
5000 animals have been vaccinated in the Melfort area. Supplies of
vaccine are being shipped in from other parts of Canada and the
United States. Dr. Douglas recommends that cows, horses, sheep and
goats within a 5-mile radius of a positive case be vaccinated. There
is a booster shot given 3 weeks after the original vaccination. The
animal should also have an annual booster shot for the next 3 years.
The CFIA pays for the original vaccination, if it is on a farm with a
positive anthrax case. Otherwise, the producer is responsible for the
cost. As well, there is a 42-day waiting period between the
vaccination and when the animal can be slaughtered.
Meantime, Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food is warning farmers in wet
areas of the province to be on the lookout for signs of anthrax in
their livestock.
Affected animals are usually found dead without any signs of illness.
Typically, the carcass shows rapid decomposition and there is
bleeding from body openings. [Actually only a small minority of
affected carcasses have blood extravasation, textbooks
notwithstanding. - Mod.MHJ] Affected animals in the herd may show
weakness, laboured breathing, fever, depression and a lack of
co-ordination. [Death is very sudden. - Mod.MHJ] The carcass of any
animal suspected of having anthrax should not be moved or disturbed
to prevent spreading spores in the environment. Any suspicious
livestock deaths should be immediately reported to a veterinarian.

[To prevent recontamination of the soil, carcasses should be
incinerated where they fall. If there is going to be a delay, the
carcass can be sprayed with 5 percent formaldehyde which will
disinfect some of the surface contamination but more importantly it
discourages canine scavengers. The Canadian local authorities are
wisely advising folk to keep their dogs and cats away from affected
carcasses. I would also advise that one extend this advice to small
boys of all ages and -- apropos last year's experiences in Africa --
to tourists with cameras. Stupidity can sometimes be boundless. - Mod.MHJ]

An anthrax outbreak in the Canadian Prairies, caused by spring
flooding that exposed soil bacteria, is believed to have killed 73
cattle, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Thursday. The
CFIA has confirmed anthrax caused 2 of the deaths, and it said the
rest were "suspicious." It has quarantined 22 farms in Saskatchewan,
an agricultural province in Western Canada.
"It's south of a forest reserve that had significant flooding in the
area and likely, it all comes from that particular weather event that
exposed the spores to the suspected population," said Greg Douglas,
CFIA veterinarian.
Anthrax is a fatal disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium that
has been shed by an infected animal. Exposure from contaminated soil
is a natural occurrence in the Prairies [In fact it is fairly
sporadic in the Canadian prairies. - Mod.MHJ] and cattle are the most
common victims, although it can be transmitted to humans.
Douglas said the high number of cattle deaths in this outbreak was
"significant."
The agency quarantined 21 farms within an 8-kilometer (5-mile)
radius, where the bulk of the deaths have occurred since 26 Jun 2006,
and one farm 100 km (60 miles) south of the general area following a
suspicious death. 5000 animals have since been vaccinated against
anthrax and Douglas said the situation appeared to be under control.
The CFIA is tracing the whereabouts of cattle that had been moved
from the quarantined farms 30 days before the outbreak, to ensure
they did not enter the human food chain, but did not have any food
safety concerns on Thursday, Douglas said.

["... it said the rest were suspicious." Reminds me of the Scottish
'foot-test' where dead animals from whatever cause are nudged with
one's foot to check that the gross appearance is the same. Joking
apart, it is worth laboratory checking as many as possible to confirm
that a 2nd disease has not crept in. Also in this day of rapid PCR
tests it is worth fingerprinting as many as you can to check for
genetic consistency. If they are all the same you have a probable
single or limited number of sources; previous epidemics will have
limited the strains in an area. If they are heterogeneous, the
probable cause is contaminated bone meal; bones get collected up and
processed together and thus bones from widely different outbreaks get
mixed together. With a separate case 100 km away from the rest it is
worth checking to see how similar the strains are in the affected
areas. And as usual many thanks to Joe. - Mod.MHJ]
