2000/057 New detection method for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_
A new detection method for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) has been developed in USA. It is based on the use
of BIO-PCR and an automated PCR detection system (TaqMan). The method was
tested on 30 naturally infected ring rot suspect tubers, on other
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subspecies, related Gram-positive bacteria and
150 unknown bacteria isolated from potato tubers. The method was found
highly specific, sensitive, reliable and rapid (3 days for total assay).
This new method can routinely be applied to large numbers of potato tubers.

[_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ is the causal bacterium
of ring rot in potato. Reliable control is achieved only by avoiding
conditions that lead to disease and the use of pathogen-free seed. Zero
tolerance for the pathogen is operative in most countries of North America
and Europe. It is notoriously difficult to detect in soil and symptomless,
infected tubers because the pathogen grows very slowly, is often masked by
overgrowth of saprophytes on agar media, and occurs in very low
concentration. Application of the BIO-PCR procedure is superior to the
current PCR because a larger sample volume (100 vs. 10 microliters),
greater number of target cells resulting from biological amplification,
and elimination of PCR inhibitors present in tubers, and elimination of
false positive results due to dead cells. Based on the results presented,
this new test procedure should allow for significant progress toward better
management of ring rot. - Mod.DH
