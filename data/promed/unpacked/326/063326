Pig Belly disease claims two lives

The "Pig Belly" disease outbreak in Solomon Islands has now claimed two
lives. Medical Superintendent Doctor George Manimu says health authorities
had been alarmed by the discovery of five cases within two weeks, two of
whom have died early this month. They were a four-year old girl and an
elderly man.
Dr Manimu says although no new cases had been reported since, health
authorities are not being complacent about the Pig Belly disease outbreak.
He says investigations are being carried out on where the five people who
have contracted the disease come from and their eating habits. The five
known cases are from around Honiara.
Meanwhile, Dr Manimu says people are advised to ensure their meat meals are
properly cooked, particularly pork before eating them. He says Pig Belly
disease is common in the Highlands region of Papua New Guinea where a lot
of pig is eaten....PNS

Public warned to cook meat well

Solomon Islands health authorities are concerned about a possible "pig
belly" disease epidemic in the country. Medical superintendent, Dr George
Manimu says pig belly disease is uncommon in Solomon Islands, but in the
last two weeks alone one child has already died and five other people have
been operated on.

Dr Manimu says this is a serious concern to health and medical authorities
who are yet to determine the source of the outbreak. He says that pig belly
is caused by a bacteria which infects the intestine and is associated with
meat-eating, particularly pig which is not properly cooked.

Dr Manimu says those who contract the disease would require an operation
and sometimes sections of the infected intestine will have to be removed.
He says as a precautionary measure, he advised the public to be careful
about food preparation and to ensure that their meat meals are well
cooked....PNS
***
Our perception of the story (from the little we know, i.e. the PACNEWS
communiqués) is that a "pig-bell" outbreak around Honiara is (i) an
important case for outbreak investigation activity, (ii) a good opportunity
to show how epidemiology can contribute to public health, (iii) it implies
the launching of an important health education programme well targeted,
(iv) it may call for interesting social research activities, but... it
doesn't sound like a potential threat to the whole Solomon island nation,
nor to the region although it has to be kept in mind by the clinicians.
On the other hand we are more worried by a possible misdiagnosis which
could hide an epidemic problem of a different nature (cholera, E.coli
O-157:H7, typhoid) which conversely would be worrying with regards to the
population of the whole city of Honiara, the Solomons and eventually the
rest of the region, starting with PNG,Vanuatu and Fiji. So, as we think
this might be an important issue, we would appreciate any further
information on the confirmation of this outbreak from the Solomons.
