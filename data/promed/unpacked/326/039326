Medical workers in Haiti on Friday [12 Nov 2010] called the upward trend in
deaths and illnesses in the cholera outbreak "alarming" as the
earthquake-devastated nation's already strained health system overflowed
with the sick.

In the slum of Cite Soleil on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, Medecins San
Frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) had seen 216 cases of cholera at
Choscal Hospital. 5 days ago, that number was only 30. Stefano Zannini, the
head of mission for MSF, said his staff was seeing 7 times the cases they
were seeing 3 days ago. "The trend is extremely, extremely alarming," he said.

The death toll climbed by Thu 12 Nov 2010 to 796, according to Haiti's
Ministry of Public Health and Population. More than 12 000 people have been
sickened. Epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and
say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they
have no immunity to cholera.

Of grave concern now are confirmed cases that originated in the tent cities
of Port-au-Prince, which sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the
earthquake in January 2010. Health officials fear that infection could
spread quickly in congested, unsanitary conditions and in impoverished
neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium.

Cholera has now hit the island of La Gonave, Haiti. The only functioning
hospital on the island is filled to capacity. There is insufficient medical
staff to treat those affected. Newborn babies and their mothers are dying.
The hurricane has destroyed some of the flimsy homes built after the
earthquake.

Day 0 (20 Oct 2010). 1st suspect cholera case reported to MSPP [Ministere
de la sante publique et de la population/Ministry of Public Health and
Population] by MSF (Medecins San Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders).

Day 1 (21 Oct 2010). Haiti Epidemic Advisory System (HEAS) reactivates, as
the 250+ member network has become active with reporting about fatal
diarrheal disease in Artibonite (St Marc and Mirebalais). "Cholera" as a
diagnosis believed to be highly unlikely based on no cholera reported in
Haiti for years. Significant medical facility strain reported in St Marc.
MSPP announces to the press laboratory confirmation of cholera. HEAS
assesses situation to represent IDIS Category 5 conditions. HEAS observes
potential for activation of the International Health Regulations (IHRs).
Single case of cholera reported in Lafito, with possible linkage to a local
market. Direct threat to Cite Soleil identified, with implication for
spread into Port-au-Prince.

Day 2 (22 Oct 2010). 2nd case of cholera reported in Lafito. Direct threat
to Cite Soleil again identified, with implication for spread into
Port-au-Prince. Confirmed cholera reported in Arcahaie. "It is now clear
the coastal highway is a major transit corridor for the potential
introduction of cholera into Port au Prince." Suspect cholera cases
reported in Croix des Bouquets and Port au Prince itself; 2 suspect cases
reported at HUEH (PaP General Hospital). "We do not believe the epidemic is
contained within the Artibonite Valley at this time and are now concerned
the disease is within Port-au-Prince."

Day 4 (24 Oct 2010). Lafito now identified as a new focus of transmission.
"We urge immediate investigation of this site by the Health and WASH
Clusters given the implications for further introductions of cases to Port
au Prince."

Day 6 (26 Oct 2010). 1st report of community outcry blaming Nepalese
MINUSTAH deployment in Mirebalais as the source of the epidemic. HEAS aware
of serovar match with Nepal strains and reports of cholera activity in
Nepal preceding incept of epidemic. HEAS calls for activation of the
International Health Regulations given the implications for regional
spread. "There is no need to close the borders or restrict travel or trade
because a neighboring country has cholera."

Day 7 (27 Oct 2010). Realization that Health Cluster assertions the
epidemic was under control was inaccurate.

Day 8 (28 Oct 2010). Cholera reported in Cite Soleil. Case had no travel
history from Artibonite.

Day 14 (3 Nov 2010). Large outbreak identified in Hinche region. HEAS
joined by partner with meteorological experience; cholera risk assessments
considered with meteorological data for Tropical Storm Tomas.

Day 15 (4 Nov 2010). Alert posted for regionalized transmission of cholera
in the Cap Haitien area with evidence of medical infrastructure strain.
Large outbreak in Gros Morne reported with evidence of medical
infrastructure strain. Warning Forecast issued for post-Tomas cholera
activity levels.

Day 17 (6 Nov 2010). Gonaives reports fatalities. Port de Paix and other
northern areas report high patient loads with medical response strained.
Lafito reports medical response collapse due to supply depletion.

Day 18 (7 Nov 2010). 47 cases of cholera reported in Cite Soleil. "Port au
Prince is directly at risk of epidemic cholera. All assertions that the
situation is "under control" or epidemic surveillance and control
activities "are adequate" should be viewed with skepticism." Large outbreak
reported in St Louis du Nord.

Day 19 (8 Nov 2010). Suspect cases reported in multiple southern peninsula
sites, one confirmed as cholera. Grand and Petit Goave reporting suspect
cases. Confirmed cholera case inside Port au Prince without a travel history.

Today (11 Nov 2010). MSF: "All of the hospitals in Port au Prince are
overflowing."
