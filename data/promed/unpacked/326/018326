Leishmania/HIV co-infection, south-western Europe, 1990-1998
Retrospective analysis of 965 cases
---------------------------------------------------
According to UNAIDS estimates, 30 000 adults and children were newly
infected with HIV in western Europe during 1998, and a total of 500 000
adults and children were living with HIV/AIDS, or 1 in every 400 adults
aged 15-49 years (0.25%). The main modes of transmission for adults
living with HIV/AIDS were sexual transmission among men who have sex
with men and through injecting drug use.
Leishmania/HIV co-infection in south-western Europe Leishmania/HIV
co-infection has emerged in southwestern Europe as a result of the
increasing overlap between visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and AIDS, which
is due to the spread of the AIDS pandemic in rural areas and that of VL
in suburban areas. This has important clinical, diagnostic,
chemotherapeutic and epidemiological implications. Although cases of
co-infection have so far been reported in 28 countries worldwide, most
of the cases have been notified in south-western Europe (France, Italy,
Portugal and Spain). The cases reported in these countries between
January 1996 and June 1998 represent 49.8% of the total number of cases
(1 440) they have reported since 1990.
While Leishmania/HIV co-infection is increasing in eastern Africa and
the Indian subcontinent, owing to the simultaneous spread and
geographical overlap of both diseases as well as periodic epidemics of
VL, cases of co-infection are expected to diminish in south-western
Europe due to the new combinations of anti-HIV drugs. The number
reported to WHO continues to rise however, due to increased awareness
and better case definition...
Population at risk
------------------------
There is a clear predominance (71.1%) among intravenous drug users
(IVDU), who are clearly identified as the main population at risk.
Regarding the proportion of IVDU compared to other risk groups, there is
no significant difference from one country to the other. Globally, the
proportion of homosexuals is almost the same (11.1%) as that of
heterosexuals (11.4%), but at country level there are significant
differences...
Immunological status/opportunistic diseases
------------------------------------------------
AIDS increases the risk of VL by 100-1 000 times in endemic areas.
Moreover, a person with HIV infection whose immune system is suppressed,
and who is bitten by a sandfly infected with _Leishmania_, will develop
severe leishmaniasis. VL, once developed in the HIV-infected person,
accelerates HIV replication and impairs the patientÂ’s condition by
further immunosuppression. As a consequence, most of the patients
(91.5%) have less than 200 CD4/mm3. The subject quickly becomes an AIDS
patient with opportunistic diseases such as tuberculosis, candidiasis,
pneumonia due to _Pneumocystis carinii_ or toxoplasmosis.
Conclusion
---------------
In the future the risk of co-infected patients, as carriers of
_Leishmania_ in the blood, should be carefully taken into consideration as
a source of infection for the sandfly during the blood meal and also, in
the case of intravenous drug users, as a new way of transmission owing
to the sharing of needles with contaminated blood.
