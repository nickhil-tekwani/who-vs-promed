Concern is mounting in the wheat industry about a new strain of leaf rust
that is attacking some of the most commonly grown wheat varieties. The rust
was discovered in South Australia but has now spread to New South Wales,
where [it has] been found in Jantz wheat.
Acting-director of rust research with the University of Sydney, Robert
Park, predicts it could have far-reaching implications for varieties
thought to be rust-resistant. [Based on previous experience with this new
pathotype, and assuming reasonable weather conditions, Park expects that
this new strain of leaf rust will spread over the next 12 months to central
and northern New South Wales and probably into Queensland].
According to Park, this may well have implications for varieties
[containing] the resistance gene, LR 24, [especially the well known variety
Jantz]. Leaf rust under conditions of severe infection [can] cause yield
losses of up to 30 to 40 percent.
