WEST NILE VIRUS, AVIAN HOSTS: CLARIFICATION

A ProMED post

It appears from the Moderator's comments that I need to clarify my recent
post.
As CHC correctly observes, "casual observation, armchair investigations,
and narrow skills" are insufficient to understand WNV. My purpose in
writing was two-fold: (1) to help delineate that which is biologically
plausible (which many epidemiologists will acknowledge has some
importance), and (2) to help suggest new avenues of research for those who
may be in a position to carry out research.
I do not pretend to know how or why WNV is spreading as it is, and my
comments were not intended to suggest that "casual observation" holds the
answer.

[It is not Dudley Harrington who needs to do any clarifying, it is I. I am
a recovering New Yorker and once in a while I have a relapse. I could have
simply written to Dudley and apologized for my poor writing but others
might have interpreted what I said the same way he did, so we are posting
this clarification. I did not at all mean that he was a casual observer,
an armchair investigator, or a person with narrow skills. What I MEANT to
say is that studies of the incursion of West Nile virus into North America
will require more than we have put into them and that this is a "big time"
event, the study of which is best not left to amateurs or to those who
would make the usual and superficial efforts. My comments were not
directed at Dudley Harrington, to whom we are grateful for having provided
background and food for thought. He is also handsome and charming. Please
do not write to me saying that you understood what I originally had said,
you will just embarrass yourself. String cut. - Mod.CHC]
