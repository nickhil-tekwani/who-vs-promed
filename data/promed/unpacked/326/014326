Cholera death toll 115
----------------------
The cholera epidemic that struck Mozambique in the first months of 2004
claimed at least 115 victims, according to Health Minister Francisco
Songane, cited in the Mon 5 Jul 2004 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias."
About 23 000 cases of the disease were diagnosed since this outbreak began
in December 2003. Songane was speaking during a ceremony on Fri 2 Jul 2004
at which Portuguese ambassador Antonio Sennfelt handed over a check for USD
10 000 earmarked for cholera prevention actions in Mozambique.
Songane explained that the number of deaths, most of which were reported in
the cities of Maputo, Beira and Quelimane, corresponds to a lethality rate
of 0.5 percent. Lamenting the situation, he noted, however, that this
lethality rate is below what the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies
as worrying levels. Songane said that, at the moment, the situation is
under control with reports of only between 2 and 3 cases a day
country-wide. But he urged the authorities, and the society at large, to
keep up preventive measures, particularly through improving sanitation
conditions. For his part, Sennfelt said that this money is the contribution
of his government to the fight against the epidemic, particularly in the
central region of the country.
"It is our wish that this money we are granting to the Health Ministry be
used for cholera prevention in Zambezia province, particularly in Quelimane
city," he said. Songane promised that the money will be used for the
intended purpose, and, in the indicated place. He lamented the fact that
cholera is a cyclical epidemic in Mozambique and, again, he insisted that
better sanitation is the solution to the problem.

Food poisoning patients surge to record high in May 2004 in South Korea
-----------------------------------------------
The number of food poisoning patients surged to a record monthly high of
2678 in May 2004, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) reported on
Fri 2 Jul 2004. The health authorities are taking measures to prevent a
massive outbreak of food poisoning ahead of the hot summer season.
According to the KFDA, the previous monthly record was in March 2003 with
2525 patients, followed by 2257 in May 2001, 1938 in June of the same year,
and 1916 in May 2003.
Some 2336 people were found to have contracted the disease in June 2004.
However, the number is likely to rise, as inspections on 23 suspected cases
are currently under way, an administration official said.
A total of 88 food poisoning outbreaks occurred, creating 6074 patients in
the first half of 2004. The number is almost the same as 6242 patients,
from 79 outbreaks, during the same period of 2003.
The food administration officials pointed out the need to improve meal
services at schools, as the ratio of food poisoning patients who
contracted the disease from schools' lunch was 65.9 percent in 2000, 70
percent in 2001, 27 percent in 2002, 58.4 percent in 2003, and 55.6 percent
in the first 5 months of 2004.

Hospital reports 12 diarrheal deaths
------------------------------------
12 patients died of acute gastroenteritis at the Pangasinan Provincial
Hospital (PPH) in a span of 1 month, hospital authorities said. Dr.
Policarpio Manuel, PPH clinic head, said the number of patients admitted to
the hospital from 1 Jun to 1 Jul 2004 reached 748.
San Carlos has the highest number of victims of gastroenteritis with 458
patients, followed by Malasiqui with 128 victims. The other diarrheal
victims are from Basista, 59; Calasiao, 32; Urbiztondo, 22; Sta. Barbara,
20; Lingayen, 7; Binmaley, 6; Mangaldan and Bayambang, 5 each; Bugallon,
3; Mapandan, Aguilar and Labrador, 1 each. Of the fatalities, San Carlos
and Malasiqui have 3 each as of 26 Jun 2004. The Region I Medical Center
also recorded 2 deaths due to gastroenteritis. The casualties were from
Mangaldan town.
The PPH official said there that is no update yet of what had been said
about the result of the swab examination of 9 patients from Malasiqui. 6 of
them had been found to be afflicted with cholera. "As of now, there are no
other figure[s] concerning cholera," he said.
Manuel further disclosed that 90 percent of the patients discharged from
the PPH have fully recovered, except for 10 percent who went out voluntarily
without having fully recovered. "It is the risk of the patients, and their
local officials will be responsible for following them up," he said.
He also said that, in his talk with sanitary engineers and inspectors,
it was discovered that, in the gastroenteritis-affected areas, septic tanks
of the households are less than 10 meters away from deep artesian wells.
"There is a great possibility that the water pump could have been [sucking]
bacteria from the septic tank. So we advise that they should not get their
drinking water there," he said. But Manuel said that if they do not have
other sources of water, then they should boil the water for 5 to 10 minutes.

39 ill in suspected hotel food poisoning in HK
----------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Center for Health Protection is investigating a suspected
food poisoning outbreak involving 39 people who ate at a hotel on 7 Jul
2004. The patients, aged 6 to 80, developed diarrhea, nausea, abdominal
pain, and vomiting after the buffet dinner, but their symptoms were
generally mild.
19 sought medical treatment and are now in stable condition, while a
38-year-old man was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital, according to
government sources. The center believes that this may be a bacterial food
poisoning outbreak, and more affected people may be found as the
investigation proceeds. Officers are interviewing and examining the
victims. Further investigations are in progress to determine the number
affected, and to confirm the outbreak source.

[****Request for information**** It should be noted that the WHO reports
that all 18 cholera patients in Japan died. We would appreciate information
regarding this observation, since cholera does not normally have a high case
fatality rate (it is probably a typo).
All 18 of the cases are apparently infections acquired in Japan. The
following is a review of cholera in Japan:
Cholera in Japan, 1975-1997
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/219/tpc219.html>
Cholera was originally an endemic disease localized within the delta region
of the River Ganges. As the Indian trade with Western European countries
increased from 1817, cholera spread all over the world, bringing as many as
6 pandemics before 1923. No other pandemic of such classical cholera has
ever broken out since.
Indonesia-indigenous cholera (El Tor cholera) -- being distinct from
classical cholera -- however, has spread to neighboring Southeast Asia, the
Indian Subcontinent, the Near East, and Africa, and, more recently, to
South America, beginning in 1961 [sic: actually 1991 - Mod.JW]. This is the
7th cholera pandemic, which is still threatening public health.
1. Incidence of cholera in Japan. The cholera incidence in Japan during the
period from 1975 through 1997 is shown in Fig. 1.
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/219/graph/f2191.gif>
Although cholera cases in Japan used to be restricted to returnees from
cholera-endemic areas, infections among people who never experienced
overseas travel have increased noticeably in recent years.
With cholera being endemic in the country, there was an outbreak in Arida
City, Wakayama Prefecture in 1977, of which the source of infection was
ascribed to a returnee from the Philippines. Another outbreak occurred in
1978, presumably due to consumption of lobsters of Indonesian origin served
at a wedding parlor at Ikenohata, Tokyo. In 1989, there was an outbreak,
which began in Nagoya, involving patients living in 7 different
prefectures, and, in 1991, another outbreak occurred in Tokyo Metropolis
(see IASR, Vol. 15, No. 6, 1994).
As an imported incident worth special mention, many cholera patients
appeared among travelers to Bali Island in 1995. Cases of cholera infection
exploded in as many as 37 different prefectures involving 296 cases (see
IASR, Vol. 17, No. 4, 1996).
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/17/194/tpc194.html>
Cholera cases in 1996 numbered 62, comprising 49 (79 percent) imported
cases and 13 (21 percent) domestic cases without history of overseas
travel; the total number of cases was markedly less than that of 1995 (377)
(see IASR, Vol. 18, No. 8, 1997). The difference may be attributed to the
markedly decreased number of cases (3) of Bali returnees.
Cholera cases numbered 101 in 1997. Out of these cases, 36 -- with no
history of overseas travel -- were living in 17 different prefectures (Fig. 2)
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/219/graph/f2192.gif>
accounting for 36 percent of the total number of cases in 1997. The largest
number of cases was found in August 1997, and the next largest in July
1997, showing an incidence pattern similar to that of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ food poisoning (Fig. 3).
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/219/graph/f2193.gif>
On the other hand, the imported cases numbered largest, at 16, in April
1997. This was due to outbreaks involving 11 patients in 2 groups of
sightseeing tours to Thailand.
The ages of the patients without history of overseas travel ranged from 13
to 86 years (average 60 years), of which those aged over 60 years accounted
for more than half, or about 51 percent. The ages of the patients who had
history of overseas travel ranged from 6 to 72 years (average 46 years),
and those over 60 years accounted for only about 17 percent. The cases
without history of overseas travel were mostly older people, but no case
was found among their family members.
34 strains of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 isolated from cases with no history of
overseas travel in 1997 were analyzed for phage type, drug sensitivity, and
genotype by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after digestion with
NotI restriction enzyme. Identical, or very similar, patterns were obtained
with all strains. The patterns were identical to those of the strains
prevailing recently in Southeast Asia, and different from those of the
strains responsible for the past domestic outbreaks. It was difficult to
identify the route of infection from these analytical results.
2. Incidence of _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 in Japan
_V. cholerae_ O139 was 1st isolated from a traveler to India in Saitama
Prefecture in April 1993 and from a Nepalese visitor to Nagano Prefecture
in July of the same year (Table 1).
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/219/graph/t2191.gif>
These cases both developed severe cholera symptoms, but the case in Tochigi
Prefecture in October 1993, returning from India, showed only mild
diarrhea. The other 4 cases reported during February to April 1994 were
infected in Thailand. _V. cholerae_ O139 was isolated from 2 cases
returning from the Indian subcontinent in August 1993 and also from other 2
cases returning from India and China in October 1994.
There were no reports of cases of _V. cholerae_ O139 infection for some
time following the above-mentioned cases, but, in September 1997, infection
was found in a returnee (a 24-year-old male) from Nepal. - Mod.LL]
