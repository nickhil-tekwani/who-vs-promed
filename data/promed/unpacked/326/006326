Pigs look healthy but test positive for flu at fairs; transmission seen between pigs and humans
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 80 percent of pigs that tested positive for influenza A virus at Ohio county fairs between 2009 and 2011 showed no signs of illness, according to a new study. Ohio State University researchers tested 20 pigs each at 53 fair events over those 3 summers and found at least one flu-positive pig at 12 fairs -- almost a quarter of fairs tested. The influenza strains identified in pigs in this study include H1N2 and H3N2 viruses -- strains that have been circulating in pigs since 1998. In 2011, all of the H3N2 and H1N2 isolates found in pigs at the fairs contained a gene from the 2009 pandemic strain of H1N1, which is similar to the H3N2v strain causing human illness this year.

No cause for panic
------------------
Though this finding alone is no cause for panic, it does show how quickly influenza viruses can change, said Andrew Bowman, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate in veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State. In a 2nd study led by Bowman, researchers compared the genomic sequences of influenza A viruses recovered in July 2012 from pigs and people. The analysis, showing a greater than 99 percent genetic similarity among the viruses, confirms that pigs and humans were infected with the same virus, indicating interspecies transmission.

cases
-----
As of 25 Sep 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed 107 human cases of H3N2v influenza in Ohio since July 2012, with the majority linked to exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. While most of the human illness caused by H3N2v has been mild, one person, who had a compromised immune system, has died. The more often that flu viruses are transmitted, the better their chances are of evolving into a strain which humans are not immune, which is the big-picture concern among scientists monitoring these viral infections. "Pigs can be infected with human-, avian- and swine-origin influenza viruses, making it possible for these viruses to easily swap their genetic material, which could allow for a new strain to emerge," Bowman said. "The potential is there for newly emerged strains to be the next pandemic we never saw coming." Bowman and colleagues will continue to investigate strategies to protect swine and public health.

Risk mitigation strategies
--------------------------
In the meantime, the research group has offered potential risk mitigation strategies for fairs with swine competitions to consider: shortening the pig exhibition period, avoiding movement of pigs from one fair to the next, and vaccinating exhibition swine for appropriate influenza A viruses. In addition, the CDC recommends that people with compromised immune systems avoid pig displays at fairs. Both studies appear online and are scheduled for later print publication.

Publications
------------
The 3-year surveillance at Ohio fairs is published in the journal 'Emerging Infectious Diseases', and the analysis of human and pig viruses appears in 'Emerging Microbes & Infections' [Bowman AS, Sreevatsan S, Illian ML, et al. Molecular evidence for interspecies transmission of H3N2pM/H3N2v influenza A viruses at an Ohio agricultural fair, July 2012. Emerg Microbes Infect 2012].

Human-swine & swine-swine contact
---------------------------------
Each summer, agricultural fairs bring together animal and human populations that normally don't spend much time in the same place. Pigs are susceptible to multiple strains of influenza A viruses, and the 3-year surveillance suggests that the daily visual inspection of pigs at fairs isn't effective at identifying pigs infected with influenza A viruses. This combination of facts adds up to an environment conducive for the transmission of influenza A viruses among pigs and between humans and pigs, potentially in both directions. "The prevalence of flu in market-weight pigs in commercial swine-production settings is pretty low. But finding flu at the fair shouldn't be that surprising. If you bring 200-plus pigs together from multiple locations and house them with new neighbors for a week in a new environment, they are all bound to share pathogens," Bowman said. "But we were surprised to find as much flu as we did subclinically, when pigs weren't showing any signs of illness."

Fair surveillance
-----------------
Bowman and his colleagues, members of the College of Veterinary Medicine's Animal Influenza Ecology and Epidemiology Research Program, tested pigs at 15 Ohio county fairs in 2009, 16 in 2010 and 22 in 2011, using nasal swabs to collect their samples.The scientists found influenza A virus in at least one pig at 12 (22.6 percent) of the 53 fairs. At the fairs where flu was detected in the pigs, the average frequency of virus detection was 63 percent. Pigs showing signs of illness were observed and tested positive for flu at 2 fairs, and pigs without signs of illness but positive for flu were found at 10 (18.9 percent) of the 53 fairs. That means pigs at 10 of 12 fairs with positive flu cases, or 83.3 percent of flu-positive pigs, actually didn't appear to be sick. A total of 1073 pigs was tested over the 3-year period. "This is an explanation of why people were becoming infected in 2012 -- because a high percentage of infected pigs with no clinical symptoms are exhibited at fairs," said Richard Slemons, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State and senior author of both studies. "There is potentially high exposure. Therefore, this is something we hadn't seen before or did not know was going on because no one had systematically examined fairs. "Influenza A virus usually infects the respiratory tract, and pigs can 'shed' the virus into the air. Slemons described flu-positive swine areas as potentially under a 'cloud' of flu particles that would be difficult to avoid. Swine infected with flu typically show clinical signs similar to those in humans: nasal discharge, cough, fever, lethargy and poor appetite.

Confirmed interspecies transmission
-----------------------------------
In the 2nd study, the researchers used swine-origin virus isolates collected during fair surveillance that had continued into the summer of 2012, and obtained the genetic sequences of human-origin influenza A virus isolates from GenBank, the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database. The human viruses had been recovered from people with flu-like illness following exposure to pigs at an Ohio fair in July 2012. The timing of the illnesses and the proximity of humans and pigs suggested the viruses were the same, but it was the higher than 99 percent similarity in the viruses' genetic sequences that confirmed interspecies transmission, Bowman said.

"This study presents clear molecular evidence that pigs and humans were concurrently infected with the same strain of influenza A virus at an Ohio county fair in July 2012," he said. Bowman noted that the results of the 2 studies create new questions: How do these viruses get to the fair, what can be done to lessen the risk to animals and people, and are the infections going in only one direction, from pigs to humans? The research program members are continuing to monitor the antigenic and genomic properties of type A influenza viruses in swine. "It is possible that humans are infecting the pigs. The lineage of the H3N2 strains we see in pigs can be tracked back to the human seasonal flu of the 1990s," Bowman said. "Human-to-swine transmission of influenza viruses has the potential to significantly impact swine health."

No risk to consumers
--------------------
He noted that influenza A virus is not considered a food-safety risk as long as pork is cooked properly.

Fair-related swine and human H3N2 viruses closely match
-------------------------------------------------------
Researchers report that swine and human influenza A/H3N2 viruses associated with an Ohio county fair held in July [2012] make a nearly perfect genetic match, suggesting that there is almost no biological barrier to prevent such viruses from passing between humans and pigs.

The authors sequenced the genomes of H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs that were exhibited at the fair and from several people who were infected with strains of variant H3N2 (H3N2v, the term for the human version) after participating in or visiting the fair. They found that the genomes were more than 99 percent the same, according to their report in 'Emerging Microbes and Infections' [see part 1 above]. The human cases were among 306 H3N2v cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since Jul 12 of this year. The vast majority of these occurred in young people who were involved in agricultural fairs. The cases have mostly been fairly mild, and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been seen. But they have prompted health officials to warn people at risk for flu complications to stay out of swine barns at fairs, and fair visitors and participants have been urged to take special precautions if they have exposure to pigs.

Andrew S. Bowman, DVM, of The Ohio State University (OSU), 1st author of the new study, said it is the 1st study in a peer-reviewed journal to compare the genomes of H3N2 viruses recovered from people and pigs in connection with county fair-related cases. The research team also included scientists from Minnesota and Iowa. The H3N2 viruses in the fair-related cases, both swine and human, carry the M or matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. In the current study, the authors call the swine-origin strain H3N2pM.

In their study, the research team gathered nasal swabs from 34 pigs that were randomly selected on the last day of the fair, 28 Jul 2012, about a week after the pigs arrived there. The fair was not identified. None of the pigs had obvious signs of illness at the time of the sampling, although exhibitors said some pigs had been sick 3 to 5 days earlier and a few had been sent home.

Using polymerase chain reaction, the team found that 31 of the 34 pigs were infected with the H3N2pM virus, and they isolated viruses from 29 of these. The researchers also gathered samples from 5 of 22 people who had H3N2v infections associated with the fair, and they ran several analyses to compare the genomes of the swine and human strains. Analysis of the hemagglutinin genes showed that all the viruses belong to "Cluster IV" H3 viruses circulating in US swine, the report says. Findings for the neuraminidase, polymerase complex, nucleoprotein, and non-structural genes were similar, with near-99 percent similarity between the swine and human isolates. Also, the M genes from the swine and human viruses fit in a clade with the M genes from 2009 H1N1 viruses isolated in 2009 and 2012.

"This study presents clear molecular evidence that pigs and humans were concurrently infected with the same strain of influenza A virus at an Ohio county fair in July 2012," the authors write. "The lack of difference between the genotypes of these isolates suggests that there are virtually no innate species barriers preventing bidirectional interspecies transmission of H3N2pM/H3N2v viruses between humans and pigs," they add.

The report says that H3N2pM and H3N2v viruses are probably the product of reassortment, or gene-swapping, events in pigs, because the most recent ancestors of all the genetic segments of the viruses can be found in triple-reassortant H3N2, H1N2, and H1N1 viruses that have been identified in North American swine. Bowman and his colleagues note that sustained human transmission of the viruses has not been observed, but they say that in view of the growing number of human cases in recent months, "the continuing evolution [of] H3N2v is a concern."

They conclude by calling for "appropriate steps to prevent and/or reduce" flu transmission among pigs and between pigs and humans at fairs, "while considering short- and long-term implications for the cultural value of livestock exhibitions."

According to an OSU press release yesterday [24 Oct 2012], the team has suggested that fairs consider such preventive strategies as shortening the pig exhibition period, avoiding movement of pigs from one fair to the next, and vaccinating exhibition swine for appropriate influenza A viruses.

[These observations are consistent with the long-held hypothesis that swine act as a 'mixing vessel' in the generation of human influenza pathogens, but leave open the question of the factors that determine the ability of reassortant animal influenza viruses to propagate in human hosts. It would seem prudent, however, as suggested, to limit where possible the exposure of humans to groups of pigs where there may be active transmission of influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
