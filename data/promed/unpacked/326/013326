Food-borne parasitic infections increase in China
-----------------------------------------------
The infection rate of food-borne parasitic diseases has climbed
dramatically in the country in the past 10 years, health officials said
yesterday [17 May 2005]. The incidence of liver flukes, the leading
food-borne parasitic worm, has increased by 75 percent over the period,
according to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health throughout
China's 31 provinces and autonomous regions from June 2001 to 2004.
It is estimated that more than 12 million Chinese have been infected with
liver flukes through food, and have gone on to develop hepatic distomiasis,
a liver disorder.
South China's Guangdong Province, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and
Northeast China's Jilin Province have the highest rates of hepatic
distomiasis, recording a 182, 164 and 630 percent growth compared with a
similar survey conducted from 1988 to 1990. Guangdong is home to almost
half of the nation's hepatic distomiasis patients. "Food-borne parasitic
disease is a growing threat to public health and an outstanding issue for
food safety," said Hao Yang, an official with the Disease Control and
Prevention Division of the Ministry of Health. The survey attributed the
increasing incidence of liver fluke-caused disease to people's growing
penchant for raw food. More and more people have developed a taste for raw
seafood, especially those living in coastal regions. For example, raw fish
salad, a kind of sashimi, is a common food for people living on the coast.
Liver fluke found in seafood can cause severe distomiasis in human beings,
said Xu Longqi, a researcher with the National Institute of Parasitic
Disease under the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
Symptoms of the disease include diarrhea, malnutrition and hepatocirrhosis,
he added. Eating raw or semi-raw pork and beef can also trigger parasitic
diseases, proven by the high infection rate in Southwest China's Yunnan
Province, where such food abounds. Local residents in Dali and Simao in
Yunnan, for example, enjoy eating raw pork, which is a source of such
diseases, said Xu.
However, land-borne parasitic diseases that infect human beings are well
under control, said Hao. On a national level, the infection rate of this
kind of parasitic disease is 63.65 percent lower, compared with the 1st
survey. In 1990, there were 536 million patients with verminosis. By the
end of 2004, this figure had dropped to 136 million. Hookworm, roundworm
and whip worm, the most common land-borne parasitic diseases, are in sharp
decline, said Xu. "Rural hygiene campaigns have helped eliminate the worms,
and lower the infection rate," said Hao. He also called for vigilance
against diseases passed to humans through pets, and suggested pregnant
women stay away from domesticated animals.

[Liver flukes include parasites of the species _Fasciola_, _Fasciolopsis_,
_Opisthorchis_ and _Clonorchis_. The life cycle of each one is different,
but they are zoonotic infections, and humans are often infected by
ingesting small water snails living on water cress, water caltrop and other
aquatic plants. The article alludes to other infections, including
hookworms and roundworms, but infection with _Trichinella_ is a major
concern, and increasing rates of Schistosomiasis have been discussed by
ProMED before. If concrete data are available on fluke infections,
especially which species are diagnosed in different regions, ProMED will be
happy to post these. - Mod.EP]
