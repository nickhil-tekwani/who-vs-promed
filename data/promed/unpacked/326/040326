TROUSERED SNAKES THREATEN AUSSIE WILDLIFE
Smuggled green pythons intercepted at Cairns airport in May [1998] were
carrying a new virus that may have had the potential to devastate
Australia's native reptiles, fish and amphibians. The Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) seized the 10 smuggled snakes
as they were being brought into the country hidden in a man's trousers.
Two of the snakes died soon afterward and were sent to the CSIRO
Australian
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong, Victoria, for testing. A
team of
AAHL scientists isolated a virus from both snakes that belongs to a
group of
viruses that cause disease in Australian fish and amphibians. "It's
possible
that this virus, which hasn't been identified in Australia before, could
have seriously affected Australia's valuable aquaculture industry as
well as
our wildlife," says Dr Deborah Middleton of CSIRO Animal Health. "We
know
this type of virus can cause disease across a range of species, and
survives
well in the environment."
AQIS Executive Director Paul Hickey says, "Australia's geographical
isolation protected us in the past, but rapid travel now makes us
terribly
vulnerable to exotic diseases. We should always remember that it's often
difficult to spot any signs of disease until the animals become
seriously
ill -- and that's too late to prevent infection of other animals."
Two people were sentenced in a Cairns court yesterday for their part in
smuggling the diseased snakes into Australia. All the intercepted
snakes
have since been sent to AAHL for testing.

As a followup, an Australian reptile keeper who is already before the
Courts
facing more than 50 unrelated charges involving his dealings with
reptiles
has been charged in connection with the above importations by both the
Australian Customs Service and the Queensland Police Fauna Squad.
The same man had been issued a wildlife demonstrator licence in
Queensland
by a senior DEH law enforcement officer, despite the application having
been
originally rejected by the appropriate licensing officials, and despite
having been previously convicted of wildlife offenses in New South
Wales...
He is due to appear in the Innisfail Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 16
September, 1998.

Here's some information that I received a couple of weeks ago concerning
this issue.
The virus isolated was identified by electron microscopy as an
Iridovirus
(family Iridoviridae) and further characterized as a ranavirus (genus
Ranavirus) which differed from previously described ranaviruses. These
viruses have been previously identified in fish and amphibians, but
infections occur across a range of species.
I understand that the snakes originated out of Irian Jaya and as for the
motive I can only guess that these snakes are in demand and that money
could
be made.

Since these animals came via a dealer in Singapore who sourced them in
Indonesia, the presence of a potentially dangerous virus should be
relevant
to the US and Europe as well as to Australia, especially if
cross-infection
to other captive [reptiles] is a possibility.

[One of the characteristics of the international wild animal trade is
that
the stressed animals & birds readily acquire infections while "in
transit"
as they are frequently held in unnaturally high densities in less than
optimum hygienic conditions. So while this Iridovirus might have
originated
in Irian Jaya, it could just as easily have been, for example, a Thai
virus
rampant in the Singapore facility - Mod.MHJ]
