[RVF in animals has been reported in Sudan, so far, from 2 states, the 1st one in Red Sea (see 20191014.6726088 and OIE immediate notification of 13 Oct 2019, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32098. This notification addressed RVF cases in goats, which had started 25 Sep 2019. The 2nd report of RVF in animals is the above one, in River Nile.

A suspected outbreak in sheep and goats in Gezira is currently under investigation; samples have been submitted to the national laboratory in Sura, Khartoum, results pending (see 20191104.6761594).

According to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 248 RVF cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported since the onset of the disease on 28 Sep 2019 up to 30 Oct 2019. Their locations (states) and numbers, reportedly, were the following:
River Nile (n=145), Red Sea (n=98), Khartoum (n=1), White Nile (n=1), Gedaref (n=1), and Kassala (n=2). The majority of cases (145) are in River Nile. Of all cases reported, 94.8 % affected people over 5 years of age, 83% of which are male. The above data are available at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Situation%20Report%20-%20Sudan%20-%2024%20Oct%202019.pdf; (number of cases per state, derived from the included map).

The report also provided information about activities undertaken: case definition and management training has been provided to 131 medical staff, and an isolation center has been established in Tagadom hospital in Red Sea State. In addition, 2200 mosquito nets have been distributed, 1330 homes have been inspected for breeding sites, and 3542 homes have been fogged in the state. Health promotion activities have been carried out at the household and community levels.

The event has raised regional alarm, in particular in countries importing livestock from Sudan such as Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Egypt (an importer of Sudanese camels with history of spread from Sudan).

The Egyptian veterinary authorities reported that one of the activities undertaken in response to RVF in northeastern Sudan is vaccinating vulnerable animals in the border areas between Egypt and Sudan. - Mod.AS]

[This outbreak is reported to occur in a single village. There is no mention of human cases in this outbreak. However, Mod. AS noted that a total of 248 human RVF cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported in 6 states since the onset of the disease on 28 Sep 2019 up to 30 Oct 2019. The current RVF situation in the Sudan requires a one health approach with human and animal health professionals, along with entomologists, working together for surveillance and responses for control. - Mod.
