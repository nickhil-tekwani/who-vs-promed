New cholera outbreak reported in parts of Uganda
--------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has disclosed that there has been an
outbreak of cholera in 6 districts of the east African country,
killing at least 2 people.
Commissioner for Community Health of the ministry Dr. Okware Sam told
Xinhua on Fri, 11 Feb 2005, that the outbreak was registered in
Kasese, Bundibugyo, Kabarole and Hoima all in western Uganda. Busia
(eastern Uganda) and Gulu (northern Uganda) districts have been also
affected.
He said that in the last 2 weeks, 10 cases with 2 deaths were
reported in Busia, after 6 years of no cases. The 1st case was
reported on 21 Jan 2005 in Buhehe sub-county at Kenyan border. Okware
noted that in Hoima district, 10 cases were reported among Congolese
fleeing the clashes in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the
Congo. In Kasese, the disease is on and off, therefore there are no
constant figures.
In the war-torn district of Gulu, there was an outbreak at Palabong
Internally Displaced Persons' Camp, which registered 6 new cases in
the last few weeks. About 200 cases were recorded in this camp in August
and December 2004.
Uganda experienced a serious cholera outbreak in 1997 and 1998 in
which 55 000 cases and 2000 deaths were reported.

Cholera Hits Gulu Camp
----------------------
A cholera outbreak has again been reported in the district hardly 4
months after the 1st epidemic was contained. The latest outbreak
occurred in Parabongo Internally Displaced People's (IDP) camp,
Lamogi sub-county in Kilak county.
Information from Parabongo says 7 people had caught cholera but the
district health officials confirmed 4 cases. A senior health
assistant at Parabongo Health Centre, Mr Junior Odong, said 3 of the
victims had been transported by the Medicins sans Frontiers to Lacor
Hospital. Odong attributed the outbreak to poor hygiene as a result
of overcrowding.
Meanwhile the councillor for Lamogi sub-county in the district
council, Mr David Penytoo, said the IDPs lack proper water storage
facilities after fire razed the huts in the camp in January 2005. He
told The Monitor cholera could be contained if charitable
organizations provided the IDPs with water containers like jerry
cans. Parabongo camp recently lost at least 400 huts in fire
outbreaks in a week.
About 72 people in Pabbo, Atiak, and Amuru camps suffered from
cholera when it broke out in the district some months ago.
