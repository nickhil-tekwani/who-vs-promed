[The previous LPAI events in the Netherlands were associated with the following subtypes: H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H7N1, H7N4, H7N7. This appears to be the 1st case of LPAI subtype H7N9 identified in a European country.

One of the main concerns regarding LPAI viruses is that they cause subclinical disease in poultry, making it difficult to detect and control them, yet could cause severe disease in humans http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/275646/European-Situation-Update-Avian-influenza-en.pdf?ua=1.

Given the zoonotic potential of this subtype, it would be of interest to know what investigations the Netherlands is conducting and to learn whether the current subtype is related to the LPAI H7N9 identified in China.

The following paragraph was taken from a comment made by ProMED Mod.AS in the posting 20160605.4266649: "The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain responsible for human infections in China has been reported from Eastern China since March 2013, circulating mostly in live poultry markets. This virus strain is of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9), which means the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent -- that is, subclinical. The birds are, in fact, the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals, or -- as seen multiple times -- following human infection, humans playing the unfortunate role of virus sentinels."

OIE's Q&A on LPAI H7N9 is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/. - Mod.CRD
