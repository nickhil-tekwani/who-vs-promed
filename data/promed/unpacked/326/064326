Subject: Scrub Typhus, Nepal

Scrub Typhus continues to spread to other parts of the country, since it was first reported in early July this year (2016) in Nepal [ProMED-mail archive 20160728.4377598]. It was then predicted that Scrub typhus might have been continued to spread to other areas of Nepal. According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD), until today, a total of 76 patients with fever have been found to be associated with Scrub typhus, expanding rapidly into new geographical areas of Nepal. At least 2 patients have died from Scrub typhus related complications. At present, the co-circulation of infectious diseases such as Typhoid fever, Influenza, Leptospirosis, Skin diseases in a given place are making a diagnosis of Scrub typhus difficult. Moreover, diagnostic kits for Scrub typhus are not widely available in local clinics and hospitals, compelling physicians to treat patients solely based on clinical signs and symptoms. There is, however no clear information about where and how the vector (chigger) is transmitting disease from mice/rats to humans. In Nepal, widespread Scrub typhus was first reported in 2015 [ProMED-mail archive 20151006.3693673].

At least 2 children have died of scrub typhus in the eastern region in the last 30 days and 5, of the total 11 cases reported, are undergoing treatment for the disease at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan [Sunsari district].

Scrub typhus is an acute, febrile, infectious illness that is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and if untreated, it could lead to death.

Doctors at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan said 2 children suffering from the disease died while undergoing treatment at the hospital. "11 children admitted at the hospital in the last 30 days were diagnosed with scrub typhus," said Dr Dinesh Dharel of the pediatrics department at the hospital. "Condition of 2 children was critical when they were admitted, and they died of the disease," said Dr Dharel.

The affected children are between the age of 7 months and 14 years. They were brought to the hospital from Sankhuwasabha, Dhankuta, Bhojpur, Morang and Ilam districts.

The children earlier were taken to various health facilities after they suffered from fever, headache and measles-like rash in the neck region. Doctors said lab results of the samples collected from 11 patients tested positive for scrub typhus.

Rodents are the main vectors of the disease. Scrub typhus is transmitted to humans and rodents by some species of trombiculid mites ('chiggers', _Leptotrombidium deliense_ and others). Humans acquire the disease from the bite of an infected chigger. The bite of the mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis.

At least 50 cases of scrub typhus have been reported in Chitwan and neighbouring districts in the last 4 months.

According to the World Health Organisation, the Tarai [Terai?] region of Nepal is a suitable environment for scrub typhus. [The Terai is the savanna and grasslands ecoregion in Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terai).]

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for continued contributions to ProMED-mail on scrub typhus in Nepal.

Prior to September 2015, Nepal was divided into 5 regions, which were subdivided into 14 administrative zones and then 75 districts. Sankhuwasabha, Dhankuta, Bhojpur, and Morang districts are in the Kosi Zone and Ilam district is in the Mechi Zone of the Eastern Region, referred to in the news report above. Chitwan is in the Narayani Zone of the Central Region of Nepal. Maps of Nepal can be seen at http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm (regions, zones, and districts) and http://www.healthmap.org/promed/p/139. Nepal is currently divided into 7 federal provinces, which are formed by grouping together the existing districts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Federal_States).
