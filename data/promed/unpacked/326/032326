A suspected case of anthrax was recorded this Tuesday afternoon [20 Sep 2022] at a SAPU [Servicio de Atención Primaria de Urgencia (Primary Emergency Care Service)] in the Lampa commune, after a man of Haitian nationality arrived at the scene with symptoms that suggested a possible contagion of this disease. A possible case of anthrax led to the closure of an emergency care facility in the Lampa commune.

At 1 pm yesterday [19 Sep 2022], a 78-year-old man of Haitian nationality went to the SAPU Doctor José Bauzá located on Ismael Carmona Street. According to the 1st medical history, the patient had severe abdominal pain, a chest injury and an X-ray where, according to the radiologist's observation, he suggested a presumed suspicion.

With this background, the health seremi was informed who indicated isolation in the 1st instance and then the transfer to the San José Hospital to stabilize the man, who was then referred to the Doctor Lucio Córdoba Infectious Diseases Hospital to refer or rule out the contagion.

Anthrax is a bacterial zoonosis associated with livestock sectors that mainly affects herbivorous animals that graze on contaminated fields, but also other species such as dogs, pigs and humans. The main source of human infection is infected animals, contaminated products or through spores from the latter.

Manuela Pérez, health director of Lampa, indicated that in this case it was treated for the consumption of contaminated animals. Along with the patient who was transferred as a suspected case of anthrax, there was another man as a companion who was also initiated a similar protocol.

The situation that occurred when SAPU was attending, other patients were transferred to other care facilities and firefighters disinfected the facility. This was indicated by Captain Daniel Cerda of the Lampa Fire Department. From the health directorate of the commune, they called for calm in the community, as the bacterium is NOT transmitted from person to person, but by the consumption of an animal contaminated with the disease.

["Lampa is a Chilean commune and city in the Chacabuco province, Santiago Metropolitan Region. Lampa is situated near the Chicauma mountain range, part of which was added to the La Campana National Park. Lampa (in Quechua: Lampa, 'the miner's shovel') is a community located in the rural zone northwest of Santiago, Chile.... According to the census of 2017, Lampa has a population of 201 034 inhabitants, being the community with the greatest growth in comparison with the census before (2002), when it only had 40 228 inhabitants. In the trimester of the year 2016, Lampa was selected as 1st place as the community with the most sales in living area, reaching 28%, with respect to Colina and Puente Alto.The community of Lampa adjoins the communities of Til Til, Colina, Pudahuel, Curacaví, Quilicura and Quilpué" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampa,_Chile).

It is unusual to see single cases of gastroenteric anthrax without prior cutaneous cases resulting from the butchering of dead livestock. The radiologist is to be congratulated, but I hope that abdominal bloody fluid samples were taken before antibiotic treatment was initiated, as _B. anthracis_ is normally very sensitive to antibiotics. It is the toxins that do the damage and are not susceptible to antibiotics.

Anthrax in Chile is barely sporadic it is so infrequent. The disease has been seen more often in Bio-Bio region. So I suspect that, if it is anthrax, the contaminated meat came from a relative in Bio-Bio, and the 2 men shared this meat. The Chilean veterinary service is very competent, so I am confident that they are investigating a possible source and how this case or cases came about. We look forward to seeing their report on their investigation. - Mod.MHJ
