* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN

** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC [further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease
and West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan - 8 Nov 2005
that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health
departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and
other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 2653 cases, 1088 (41 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1397 (53 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 168 (6
percent) were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state
case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that, among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections), less than one
percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F,
Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New
York, 1999: Results of a household-based seroepidemiological survey.

Human:
During week 43, one new West Nile virus (WNV) clinical case was
reported in Ontario, and one old case was removed from Ontario. A
previously reported case in Quebec was also removed this week,
reducing the total case count by one from last week. As of 29 Oct
2005, 226 WNV clinical cases and 13 asymptomatic infections have been
reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Of the 226
clinical cases, 51 (23 percent) were reported as West Nile
Neurological Syndrome, 168 (74 percent) were reported as West Nile
Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 7 (3 percent) were
Unclassified/Unspecified. To date, there have been 12 deaths
[Saskatchewan (2), Manitoba (1), Ontario (8) and Quebec (1)] reported
in patients with WNV infection.
Bird:
During week 43, 10 dead birds were tested and none (0 percent) were
reported positive for WNV (see bird table). A total of 3979 dead
birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 447 (11 percent)
were positive for WNV. Of the 447 positive birds, 331 (74 percent)
were identified as American Crows and 115 (26 percent) were Blue Jays.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 43, 21 horses positive for WNV were reported in Ontario
(5), Manitoba (4), Saskatchewan (10) and Alberta (2).
Mosquito:
As of week 43, 695 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in
Alberta (1), Saskatchewan (110), Manitoba (193), Ontario (291) and
Quebec (100).

Since the 2005 surveillance season started, since wk-27 until the
current week (wk-43), the profile of reported cases of WNV infections
in humans, birds, domestic animals (horses) and mosquito pools has
shown an interesting curve. As you can see, the WNV activities in
Canada are calming down, evidently, as of wk-43, indicating a near
ending of the WNV season. - Mod.RY]
