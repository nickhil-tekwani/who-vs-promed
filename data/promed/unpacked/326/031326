Mohaka Forest pig confirmed with TB
-----------------------------------
Annual tuberculosis (TB) testing for cattle and deer is set to
continue in the Wairoa area after a recent Animal Health Board (AHB)
survey in the Mohaka Forest returned one feral pig diagnosed with
tuberculosis.

AHB Southern North Island regional coordinator Terry Hynes said that
pig surveys and testing for all cattle and deer herds in the area
need to remain in place until there is no further evidence of the
disease in wildlife. Mr Hynes says the AHB carries out feral pig
surveys in the Hawke's Bay region every year to determine whether
there is a presence of TB.

"Pigs are considered a great indicator species as they tend to
scavenge. If possums are infected, it gets passed onto pigs and they,
in turn, can also infect cattle and deer, perpetuating the disease
cycle," Mr Hynes said. "TB lesions are most commonly found in pig
heads. This is why we work closely with local pig hunters in
designated areas and ask them to submit heads for surveying.

"The Mohaka Forest pig survey showed it is timely to remind all
hunters of the dangers of introducing pigs into an area and
subsequently setting up new sites of infection," Mr Hynes said.

The AHB will continue pig surveys in areas such as Mangaorapa, Te
Uri, Owhaoko, Te Pohue-Tarawera and Wairoa districts where wildlife
is suspected of harbouring the disease.

[The feral pig (_Sus scrofa_) is a free ranging animal. Generally
these animals are regarded as game animals. While some people may
view them as being beneficial, others will regard them as destructive
creatures. Since feral pigs like fruit, earthworms and other
invertebrates, they are known to root up large areas of land.

_Dactylanthus_ is an underground parasitic plant and it is found only
in New Zealand. The destruction to this plant by feral pigs, to the
land and to some snails has resulted in the animals being officially
designated as pests with appropriate control measures being
instituted.

Possums in New Zealand have been shown to have a high prevalence of
tuberculosis. Although the feral pigs are considered a spillover
host, possibly from the possum, they typically have an infection rate
of 50 to 90 percent.

The feral pigs have been shown to have harmful effects on crops,
pasture and lambing. As such they meet the Biosecurity Act definition
of a pest. Control methods may involve hunt clubs or other methods
suitable to the land owner.

In other countries, the presence of infected pigs has resulted in
spillover of the disease into other species, including cattle, and
potentially into the lambs and sheep. New Zealand acknowledges
spillover from the pig to deer.

"Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in the Wild Boar (_Sus scrofa_): A
Comparison of Methods Applicable to Hunter-Harvested Animals," by
Nuno Santos et al, indicates combining gross pathology (examination
of the head) with stained smears in parallel increased estimated
sensitivity to 94.4 percent from only 77 percent with gross pathology
alone. If New Zealand authorities increased the type of sample on
each animal, they would find the prevalence rate is higher than
presently believed. - Mod.TG]
