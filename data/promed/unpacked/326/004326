["Hydrogen sulfide has many synonyms, including dihydrogen sulfide, sulfur hydride, sulfurated hydrogen, hydrosulfuric acid, 'sewer gas,' 'swamp gas,' hepatic acid, sour gas, and 'stink damp.'

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless, highly flammable, and explosive gas produced naturally by decaying organic matter and by certain industrial processes. Hydrogen sulfide has a characteristic rotten-egg odor." (Source: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=385&tid=67)

"Symptoms of hydrogen sulfide exposure: low concentration

"At very low concentrations, hydrogen sulfide has a distinctive rotten egg smell. Similarly, hydrogen sulfide trapped in water will have a distinct sulfurous taste. At higher concentrations, from about 20 parts per million (ppm) to 100 ppm, hydrogen sulfide stings the eyes and throat with its corrosive properties. That's why it's important to wear proper safety gear (goggles and respirators) when you suspect the presence of hydrogen sulfide.

"Symptoms of hydrogen sulfide exposure: medium concentration

"Hydrogen sulfide accumulation of 100-250 ppm is where irritation turns to danger. Those caught in a hydrogen sulfide cloud will quickly develop a pounding headache, stomach sickness, and burning eyes and throat. Additionally, the gas stuns the nose, making it seem like the danger is gone.

"At medium-high concentrations, victims can become confused and accidentally stumble further into danger. Breathing becomes difficult. Fluid quickly fills the lungs, making breathing even harder. Many victims vomit and suffer a loss of coordination that sends them uncontrollably staggering.

"Symptoms of hydrogen sulfide exposure: high concentration

"At 500 ppm, staggering turns to a complete loss of balance. Victims caught in the cloud stumble about, blinded and unable to breathe until they fall to the ground. Frightening as this is, it's important to realize hydrogen sulfide will do this to anyone without proper safety measures. Rushing into the scene without proper equipment and oxygen could result in further tragedy.

"In the worst-case scenario, an incredible 750ppm and more, hydrogen sulfide will paralyze the lungs. The body is unable to breathe at all. At these extremely high concentrations, victims can pass away in minutes or even a single second. Worst of all, there's no way to tell how deadly the area is without specialized equipment, such as an H2S detector."

If these individuals are hospitalized, then it is likely the concentration was on the lower end of the scale. Seven people being hospitalized is suggestive of inadequate protective equipment, or perhaps no protective equipment. Perhaps these workers simply chose not to wear it. Without more detail it is difficult to speculate; however, we wish them a complete and speedy recovery. - Mod.TG
