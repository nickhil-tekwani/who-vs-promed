I copied this piece from one of the local dailies. I think it's the original
article which reported the disease here in Ghana:
Last week, 15 people died at Nyongbare, near Sekose, in the Bolgatanga
District of the Upper East Region of suspected anthrax from consuming the
carcasses of dead cattle.Dr. Kingsley Meekey Aryee, the Veterinary Officer
in-charge of the Bolgatanga District, started vaccination of all cattle in
the area last Monday. So far, 430 herds of cattle have been vaccinated
against the disease.Personnel from his department also visited Pelungu and
some other villages which are considered endemic areas to ascertain
whether the disease has resurfaced in those villages.Communities in the
area have been advised against eating carcasses of cattle and sheep.
I suspect that the "430 herds of cattle" in the article should
actually read "430 head of cattle", I have heard nothing further about
this outbreak but shall make a few enquiries.
[Thanks very much for the information and your efforts, Robert. I've
summarized the article because of copyright concerns. It would indeed be
quite interesting to know whether it is truly 430 herds or head as the herd
size when you get up north is Ghana can be quite small and anthrax
outbreaks can involve a fairly large number of herds in a relatively large
geographic area - see the Australia outbreak earlier this year
(ProMED-AHEAD posting: Anthrax - Australia (Victoria) (08) 970228173423).
It is important to the mission of ProMED-mail to get information from
everywhere around the world. We rely on local information and
participation. Actually, some recent analysis of ProMed-mail postings
indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa is very well represented in our posting
in light of the relatively smaller numbers of subscribers. So once again
keep those cards and letters coming with reports of local disease outbreaks
and all of us at ProMED-mail will be happy! -- Mod. pc}
