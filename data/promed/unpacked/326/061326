_E. coli_ outbreak at Lanarkshire primary school as 10 pupils test positive and entire class closed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An entire class has been sent home from a primary school amid an outbreak of _E. coli_. An investigation has been launched at Tinto Primary in Lanarkshire after 10 pupils in the primary one/two class tested positive for the potentially deadly bug.

Public health expert Dr Alison Smith-Palmer is leading the specialist team set up to manage the Biggar incident.

She said: "We appreciate that this will be an anxious time for those who are directly affected by the infection as well as the whole school community. The decision to remove the primary one/two class is one control measure we are taking to prevent further spread. "We have written to parents, carers, and staff to provide the most up-to-date information and ongoing health advice. We have encouraged parents to keep their children away from other children and those at higher risk until their negative results have been received."

_E. coli_is a bacteria commonly found in some foods, including raw and undercooked meats, daily products and faecal contamination of vegetables. Some strains are harmless, however others can cause serious food poisoning. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, diarrhoea, bloody diarrhea or fever. In most cases those infected recover quickly. However, in a small number it can cause serious complications, especially in young children and the elderly.

Dr Smith-Palmer's team is made up of experts from NHS Lanarkshire's health protection team, Public Health Scotland and South Lanarkshire Council. She added: "We are asking people in the local area to be alert for any symptoms they, or a child they look after, may have. Anyone who has developed symptoms of _E.coli_ infection should seek medical attention as specific tests are required to diagnose the infection which can mimic other illnesses. Anyone who develops symptoms should contact their GP practice or NHS24 on 111 when the GP practice is closed. This is crucial to help contain the infection and stop its spread within the community. This recent increase in cases reinforces the importance of washing hands regularly, particularly before eating or preparing food and after going to the toilet."

[Although not specifically stated, given the statements in the post, this is likely an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic _E coli_. There have been some recent outbreaks of O157 EHEC in day care centers in parts of Scotland. With 10 children in 1 class affected, one wonders if they all ate the same food. A time line of cases plotting date against 1st onset of symptoms can help discern how the transmission occurred in the class. - Mod.LL
