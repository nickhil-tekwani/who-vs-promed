Prime Minister Naoto Kan held the 8th meeting of the Headquarters
Against Foot-and-Mouth Disease at the Prime Minister's Office. At the
start of the meeting, the Prime Minister delivered an address, saying:
"What must be done 1st of all is to prevent the disease from
spreading, for which I intend to make the utmost effort. It has been
reported that the slaughtering and burial of infected and suspected
animals which were spreading the disease was completed on 24 June
2010. I have heard there have been no new suspected cases in the past
10 days, which I perceive to be a very good sign. However, we must not
relax our vigilance at this stage. We must swiftly slaughter
vaccinated animals. I ask the relevant ministries to tackle the issue
in a thorough manner."

[From the above information, it may be concluded that the news about a
new outbreak on Sunday (27 Jun 2010?), for which ProMED requested
confirmation, was incorrect (Item 4 in posting 20100629.2160). On the
other hand, it confirms the other information in the same posting,
namely: "no new FMD cases in Miyazaki since 19 Jun 2010 (case 291 in
Miyazaki city)." - Mod.AS]
