An hepatitis A outbreak linked to frozen berries has sickened as many as 56 people in 4 of Europe's Nordic countries, according to health officials. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] that 16 hepatitis A infections arising from the same strain of the virus have been reported in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A further 40 cases are suspected to be part of the outbreak but have not been confirmed by testing.

The 1st illnesses began in October of last year [2012], and the most recent reported illnesses occurred this month [April 2013], according to the ECDC report. Since none of the victims traveled outside the European Union during the time they would have been exposed to the virus, the source of the outbreak is thought to be within the EU, say authorities.

Local investigations within the affected countries "strongly point towards frozen berries as the vehicle of infection," said ECDC in a press release Tuesday [16 Apr 2013]. So far, no samples of frozen berries collected in the 4 affected countries have tested positive for hepatitis A. Among the confirmed cases, 75 percent are female, and 25 percent are male. Victims range in age from 4 to 62 years old, with a median age of 30.5.

Health authorities in the affected countries are advising that consumers boil all frozen or imported berries before consumption. ECDC reports that the strain causing this outbreak is a 99 percent match to strains isolated from people in Canada, France and the Netherlands who had recently traveled to Egypt. In 2012, an outbreak of hepatitis A in Canada was also linked to frozen berries. Two health alerts regarding hepatitis A in frozen strawberries were issued in the European Union last year [2012]. The virus was isolated from strawberry yogurt cake and in frozen strawberry cubes imported from China.

[Hepatitis A virus infection is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. The disease is closely associated with unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

Soft fruits, if not consumed close to their point of production, are usual transported and stored in a frozen state. Enteric viruses such as hepatitis A virus are not inactivated by freezing, and infection can be distributed widely. In the case of this multi-country outbreak, genotyping of samples suggests that berries picked in Egypt have been responsible for outbreaks of hepatitis A in several north European countries. Imported berries of unknown provenance should preferably be boiled before consumption. - Mod.CP
