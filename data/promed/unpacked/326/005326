Facing an alarming surge in syphilis cases, Detroit and [Michigan] state health authorities are launching a campaign alerting the public about the sexually transmitted disease that they say is making a comeback among a much younger crowd than in previous years. "One of the things we're learning is that with adolescents and young adults -- they've not seen it, not experienced it, and they're not seeing the early signs and symptoms," said Karen Krzanowski, manager of the sexually transmitted disease section of the Michigan Department of Community Health. "Many times, these things are cyclical," said Loretta Davis, president and CEO of the Detroit Institute for Population Health. "There's ... prevention fatigue."

On average, about 100 cases of primary- and secondary-stage syphilis are reported for Detroit each year, with the number of cases increasing. Last year [2012], the city logged 123 cases. By 31 May [?2013], 82 cases had been reported, Davis said.

Though the numbers seem small, it's important to raise awareness, she said. "We'd rather overreact than under-react," she said.

Syphilis is caused by a bacterium transmitted by direct contact with syphilis sores mainly found on the external genitals, anus, or in the rectum. The sores can also be found inside the mouth, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website on syphilis. In early stages, the sores are firm, round, and painless. In later stages, syphilis causes a rash, especially on the palms of hands and soles of feet. In its earliest stages, syphilis is treatable with antibiotics. Untreated, late-stage syphilis symptoms can appear 10-30 years after infection and include paralysis, numbness, blindness, dementia, and even death, according to the CDC. Pregnant women with the disease can pass it to the fetuses they are carrying.

Health officials are working on a radio- and billboard-based public awareness campaign. They are also working with community groups to raise awareness about testing and treatment.

Health officials rolled out a similar campaign in 2008 after detecting a syphilis outbreak in Genesee County. Prior to that, the campaign was deployed in 2001-02 when Detroit experienced a similar uptick in cases. In the Detroit outbreak, cases were reported among heterosexual men and women in their 30s, and were reported from a handful of zip codes, Krzanowski said.

But this time around, the cases have been reported among black men in their 20s having sex with other men. [The legend for the graph that accompanies this article (available at the source URL above) says that cases were "predominantly young, black men" and "about half" involved men who have sex with men.] Moreover, the cases have been reported throughout the city. Epidemiologist Liz Shane said interviews have not narrowed the syphilis to a single person. In fact, about one-fourth of those who were infected said they met their sexual partners online -- something that's not surprising, given the age of those who are infected, she said.

Genital sores caused by syphilis increase the risk of HIV transmission by 2 to 5 times, according to the CDC. About half of the people infected with syphilis in Detroit this year [2013] were diagnosed with HIV as well, Shane said.

[Rates of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis (the contagious forms of syphilis) in the USA reached historic lows in 2000, but increased each year during 2001-2009. During 2010, overall rate of Primary & Secondary (P&S) syphilis decreased for the 1st time since 2000 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5953a1.htm), and in 2011, the rate remained unchanged (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm).

The graph that accompanies the article above shows that in 2002 there were 486 and 384 reported cases of syphilis (presumably P&S) respectively in the state of Michigan and the city of Detroit; the numbers fell to a low point for both the state and city in 2005 and subsequently rose for the most part annually since then, to 295 cases in Michigan and 123 in Detroit in 2012. In 2011, Wayne County, for which Detroit is the county seat, ranked 21st among counties and independent cities for the number of reported cases (140 cases) of P&S syphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/32.htm).

The increase in incidence of P&S syphilis in recent years in the US and elsewhere in the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below) has been primarily a result of increases in cases among younger men and among men who have sex with men (MSM). For example, in the US, during the 1990s, P&S syphilis primarily occurred among heterosexual men and women; during the 2000s, however, cases increased among MSM. The estimated proportion of P&S syphilis cases attributable to MSM increased from 7 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2004, and by 2011 MSM accounted for 72 percent of all P&S syphilis cases (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm). In 2002, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 30-39 years old, but by 2011, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 20-29 years old (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis-detailed.htm).

Reported increases in incidence of P&S syphilis among MSM have been characterized at times by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in P&S syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue," that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.

Detroit, with a population of 701 475 in 2012, is the most populous city in the State of Michigan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit).
