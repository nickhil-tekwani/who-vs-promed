Federal and private labs have narrowed the source of the
salmonella-contaminated seasonings in the Veggie Booty snacks to 2
New Jersey (NJ) subcontractors that provided some of its ingredients,
according to the seasoning's producer.
The seasoning is made by Atlantic Quality Spice & Seasonings of
Edison, NJ. Yesterday, 16 Jul 2007, company president Stan Gorski
said the seasoning is a mixture of ingredients purchased from 4
subcontractors, though the contaminant itself probably originated in
China.
Gorski said the ingredients from the subcontractors are blended by
his company into the seasoning, which is then shipped to the Sea
Cliff company, Robert's American Gourmet, which manufactures Veggie
Booty.
The ingredients provided by 2 of the 4 subcontractors have been
cleared of _Salmonella_ contaminants, Gorski said. Laboratory tests
on ingredients from the other 2 subcontractors are continuing, he
added. The contaminated seasonings were found only on batches of
Veggie Booty produced in January 2007, he noted.
The most likely original source of contamination was vegetable
ingredients purchased from China by the subcontractors, according to
several executives at Robert's American Gourmet and Atlantic Quality
Spice, but that has not been definitively established.
In the past, Gorski's company depended on certification from
suppliers that the ingredients were free of bacterial contamination.
From now on both the seasoning company and Robert's American Gourmet
have announced that they will do independent testing of their
products to ensure that they are not contaminated.
Gorski declined to name the 2 subcontractors or say which ingredients
in the seasoning are the suspected contaminants. The Veggie Booty
label says it contains spinach, kale, broccoli, and carrots.
In a news release on Friday [13 Jul 2007], Robert's American Gourmet
also said it believed the contaminated ingredients originated in
China. "Over the past decade, China has continuously undercut all
other suppliers of spices, dried fruits, and vegetables, as well as
other commodities, and, as a result, has eliminated any and all
competition in those industries," the release said.

[There have been no additional CDC reports related to this outbreak
since 11 Jul 2007. The results of testing ingredients from the other 2
subcontractors are not yet available, which could be interpreted as
meaning that salmonellae have been isolated and are being serotyped
(or that this testing began later). The report does not specifically
state that the suspected lots were certified to be free of
contamination.
Independent testing by both the seasoning company and the manufacturer
of the snacks, which is to be started, would likely have prevented the
outbreak. - Mod.LL]
