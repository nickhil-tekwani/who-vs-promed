Thailand: Avian Influenza Human Death Toll Rises to 8
--------------------------------------------------
The avian influenza outbreak has claimed its 8th victim in Thailand
-- a 39-year-old factory worker who contracted the deadly virus from
a neighbor's sick fighting cocks, the health ministry said on Tue 16
Mar 2004. The woman died last Friday, 12 days after she was initially
treated for diarrhea, the ministry said in a statement. About 20
infected fighting cocks raised by a neighbor had died in mid-February
2004, it said. 15 people have died in Viet Nam.
The Thai government has threatened to take criminal action against
owners of fighting cocks -- often valuable birds which some breeders
were accused of hiding as the epidemic grew -- if they refuse to
report an infection. Thailand has culled about 35 million chickens in
the battle against the H5N1 avian influenza strain. The country, the
world's 4th-largest poultry producer and one of the worst-hit
nations, had hoped to declare the epidemic over by this week.
Officials now say that may not happen until April 2004.
4 more Thais confirmed to have contracted bird flu since the outbreak
began had fully recovered and been discharged from hospitals, the
ministry said. Another 114 people reported ill with lung infections
and influenza remained under observation to ensure they were free of
the virus, it said.
