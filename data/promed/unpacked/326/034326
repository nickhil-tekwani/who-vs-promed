The Secretary of Health of the Federal District [Brasilia] confirmed on
Thursday 4 deaths occurring since early Sunday morning [late Saturday
night] caused by an as-yet-unidentified illness.
The latest death was in a 24-year-old male who whas admitted [to the
hospital] with difficulties breathing. 3 of the 4 deaths were residents of
the satellite city of Sao Sebastiao [population 70 000 mixed urban/rural
community - Mod.JW], and one was from Paranoa.
In all of the cases, the presentation was similar: headache, fever, muscle
pains, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. Another 3 persons presented
with the same symptoms and have been hospitalized for observation. Of
these 3, 2 are improving, and one is in intensive care.
There is widespread concern in the area, with many persons without symptoms
reporting to the hospitals to be checked. To release the pressure on the
public health units, [health] posts are being set up in the public schools
of Sao Sebastiao. The teams are identifying suspected cases and referring
them to the hospitals in the city.
Health workers are investigating the etiology of the illness, including
interviews, collection of information on habits of the deceased, and
collection of specimens of water, mosquitoes, and rats for analysis. The
investigators have not discarded the diagnoses of hepatitis and dengue
hemorraghic fever [in contrast with the earlier news report, which
mentioned these diagnoses had been excluded - Mod.MPP]. Hantavirus and
leptospirosis are under investigation as well.

[Additional information from an earlier version of this same article
mentioned that the 4th case was a 24-year-old male who had been ill for 4
days before arriving at the Base Hospital, Brasilia, in serious condition,
on Wed 26 May 2004. There was also mention that 15 individuals had been
placed under observation of whom 3 were hospitalized. - Mods.MPP/JW]

I would be interested in learning whether blood cultures or any gram stains
were performed. The prodromal symptoms described (fever, headache, and
weakness) followed fairly quickly by death, is the norm in most cases of
systemic anthrax. In addition, hemorrhagic pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema are usually found at autopsy, even if the case is not considered to
be inhalational anthrax. Other common symptoms of anthrax include upper
abdominal pain, chest pain, cough and dyspnea. Other frequent autopsy
findings in anthrax include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic
meningitis, often with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

[The etiology of this apparent cluster remains unknown. Today's newswire
provides the additional symptoms of diarrhea and muscle pains. Of
interest, using the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network
(GIDEON <http://www.gideononline.com>) software, the 2 leading diagnoses
for consideration with the above symptom complex (fever, headache, muscle
pain, diarrhea and respiratory distress) are leptospirosis and
hantavirus. Of curiosity is that the Brasilia area is at the tail end of
the dry season; hence, the risk of widespread exposure to leptospirosis
would be reduced, unless there were unseasonal heavy rains in the preceding
period that would have led to flooding and general exposure to water
contaminated with rat droppings. Again, more information on this apparent
cluster from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
