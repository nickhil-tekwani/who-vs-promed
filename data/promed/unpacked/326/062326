Study Finds Chimps Die From Simian AIDS, Dispelling Widely Held Belief
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 1st time, scientists have shown that chimpanzees in the wild
become sick and die from the simian version of AIDS. The finding
upsets a widely held scientific belief that chimpanzees, the closest
relatives to humans, can get the virus that causes simian AIDS but
without harm.

It also suggests that an outbreak of AIDS is contributing to the
declining chimpanzee population in Africa, said the leader of the
research team, Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. She said that comparisons of the viruses that cause AIDS
in chimpanzees and humans could lead to new insights into the
responses of the immune systems in both species.

"Our findings allow us to look at HIV from a new angle, comparing and
contrasting chimpanzee and human infections," Dr. Hahn said in an
interview. Her team's study is being reported in the journal Nature
on Thursday [23 Jul 2009; see item 2].

As researchers conducted autopsies on the bodies of the dead chimps
they could find, they detected evidence of organ and tissue damage
similar to that in late-stage human AIDS. Infected chimpanzees were
also found to have a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than
uninfected ones. Infected females were less likely to give birth. If
they did, they could pass the virus to their infants, and they had a
higher infant death rate than that of uninfected females.

The scientists made the discovery by testing hundreds of samples of
chimpanzee waste in a 9-year study of 3 small communities of
chimpanzees at the Gombe National Park in Tanzania, which Jane
Goodall made famous. While chimpanzees nested in trees at night, a
field assistant below them caught urine in a plastic bag held between
a forked twig. Researchers also picked up feces from the forest floor.

The simian virus, known as SIVcpz, is considered the precursor of
HIV-1, which crossed the species barrier sometime in the past 100
years.

"We cannot date exactly when chimpanzees 1st got infected, but we
certainly suspect that it was much, much longer than 100 years ago,"
Dr. Hahn said. "Our gut feeling is that the chimp virus infection is
not quite as damaging as HIV-1 is in humans. The difference in the
way the virus damages tissue leads us to speculate that chimps may be
one step ahead in adapting to the virus, and identifying that step
would be important."

More than 40 simian immunodeficiency viruses are known to infect
African primates. African monkeys infected with the virus that causes
simian AIDS have rarely developed AIDS. Only 7 chimpanzees naturally
infected with SIVcpz have been studied in captivity, and 5 of them
died of unknown causes as infants. The only chimpanzee that was
naturally infected with the simian virus and underwent standard
virological and immunological tests showed none of the typical damage
of AIDS, like low CD-4 cell counts and damaged lymph nodes. Two other
chimpanzees injected with SIVcpz in captivity did not show such
changes.

Until now, scientists have known little about SIVcpz's effects on
chimpanzees in the wild, because they lacked the means to identify
and monitor chimp behavior there. Using recently developed molecular
and other tests, Dr. Hahn's team of primatologists, pathologists,
geneticists and virologists studied 3 chimpanzee communities in Gombe
National Park.

The chimpanzee communities have distinct ranges. But the chimpanzees
have territorial fights, and females typically leave their native
group before having their 1st babies.

Starting in 2000, the scientists followed 94 chimpanzees in the park.
Every day, a team of field assistants followed one chimpanzee from
each community from dawn to dusk.

Gene tests of feces identified individual chimpanzees. SIVcpz
infection was found in all 3 chimpanzee communities, and virological
testing indicated that migrating females helped spread SIVcpz. The
scientists found nearly identical SIVcpz viruses in 4 chimpanzees.
That suggested that some of them acquired SIVcpz from mating partners
soon after they had become infected, a period when transmission of
the virus is greatest.

Two baby chimpanzees were infected. In one, transmission presumably
was through breast-feeding because the animal was uninfected at
birth. Of 30 uninfected females, 22 gave birth to 30 infants. Of 9
infected females, 4 gave birth to 4 infants. The difference was
statistically significant. Infected chimpanzees died or disappeared
at a faster rate than uninfected chimpanzees.

Increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild chimpanzees
infected with SIVcpz
--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
African primates are naturally infected with over 40 different simian
immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), 2 of which have crossed the species
barrier and generated human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2
(HIV-1 and HIV-2). Unlike the human viruses, however, SIVs do not
generally cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in their
natural hosts. Here we show that SIVcpz, the immediate precursor of
HIV-1, is pathogenic in free-ranging chimpanzees. By following 94
members of 2 habituated chimpanzee communities in Gombe National
Park, Tanzania, for over 9 years, we found a 10- to 16-fold higher
age-corrected death hazard for SIVcpz-infected (n517) compared to
uninfected (n577) chimpanzees. We also found that SIVcpz-infected
females were less likely to give birth and had a higher infant
mortality rate than uninfected females. Immunohistochemistry and in
situ hybridization of post-mortem spleen and lymph node samples from
3 infected and 2 uninfected chimpanzees revealed significant CD41
T-cell depletion in all infected individuals, with evidence of high
viral replication and extensive follicular dendritic cell virus
trapping in one of them. One female, who died within 3 years of
acquiring SIVcpz, had histopathological findings consistent with
end-stage AIDS. These results indicate that SIVcpz, like HIV-1, is
associated with progressive CD41 T-cell loss, lymphatic tissue
destruction and premature death. These findings challenge the
prevailing view that all natural SIV infections are non-pathogenic
and suggest that SIVcpz has a substantial negative impact on the
health, reproduction and lifespan of chimpanzees in the wild.

[The News and views section of this week's Nature edition included
also a review "An ill wind for wild chimps?" by Robin A. Weiss and
Jonathan L. Heeney. (pages 470-471). Among others, the review
includes the following complementary background commentary:

"Chimpanzees -- humans' closest living relative -- are not only
genetically similar to humans but also share susceptibility to some
infectious diseases. For instance, outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever
caused by relatives of Ebola virus in chimpanzees and gorillas have
resulted in marked mortality in wild populations. However, subtle
chronic diseases like those caused by lentiviruses such as SIV/HIV
are more difficult to document in wild nonhuman primates than are
acute diseases with high mortality rates.

"In studies conducted largely in the 1980s, chimpanzees (mostly of
the subspecies _Pan troglodytes verus_) that were infected with a
particular laboratory strain of HIV-1 controlled the amount of virus
in the blood, and remained healthy, although a human accidentally
exposed to the same strain of HIV-1 developed AIDS. A report of one
case indicated that certain variants of HIV-1 can cause disease in
chimpanzees. However, such experiments are no longer permitted owing
to the endangered status of chimpanzees.

"Keele et al. are the 1st to examine the long-term effects of
naturally transmitted SIVcpz in wild chimpanzee populations in their
natural habitat. The research was made possible because the Gombe
chimpanzees have been studied in their natural setting for many
decades by Jane Goodall and colleagues, and these animals are
accustomed to the presence of humans. Samples of faeces collected
from the forest floor can be used to detect SIVcpz DNA and the
infected individual can be identified by performing genetic
fingerprinting on the same sample. In addition, antibodies directed
against SIVcpz can be detected in urine. Using such techniques, 94
members of social groups of chimpanzees in Gombe were meticulously
followed over a 9-year period without the need to capture them or
take blood samples to determine rates of SIVcpz infection and its
effects.

"SIVcpz in chimpanzees is apparently less virulent than HIV-1 is in
humans. Why? One hypothesis is that SIVcpz and its chimpanzee host
have co-evolved over millions of years. But SIVcpz may in fact be a
relatively recent introduction into chimpanzees -- it seems to be a
recombinant virus with genome components from SIVs of other monkeys,
such as red-capped mangabeys and guenons. A recent report estimates
that the time of the most recent common ancestor of the SIVcpz
strains of all chimpanzee subspecies is 1492, although this
calculation is likely to be hotly debated. Alternative explanations
for differences in virulence between HIV-1 and SIVcpz could be the
immune status or evolved immune genetics of the affected populations,
including differences among species in host factors that restrict
certain types of viral infection.

"In view of Keele and colleagues' results, why was the progression of
SIV infection to AIDS-like illness not more apparent in chimpanzees
in captivity? Much of the pathology of AIDS is linked to a general
hyperactivation of the immune system that occurs before CD4 T-cell
depletion, which is characteristic of AIDS11. Certainly the
parasitic, bacterial and viral burden in _P. t. schweinfurthii_
chimpanzees in their natural habitat might provide the activating
environment to trigger progression to AIDS in a relatively
immunologically naive subspecies.

"General theories of the evolution of virulence, and of the
relationship between virulence and pathogen dispersal, can help in
elucidating why certain infections cause disease whereas others don't
-- the abrupt changes in virulence on cross-host infection are ripe
for modelling, taking into account the burgeoning knowledge of host
genetic variation. Primate lentiviruses would be a promising starting
point for this exercise.

"The study by Keele et al. shows the benefit of multidisciplinary
research, in which primatologists, pathologists, geneticists and
molecular virologists joined forces. Their work indicates that SIVcpz
causes AIDS-like disease in a subspecies of chimpanzee that is
already endangered in the wild. In addition to the threat of AIDS and
Ebola, the great apes may also be at risk of acquiring other
infections that affect humans from their increasingly close contact
with our species. Relatively minor human infections could prove to be
serious pathogens in chimpanzees. We are not alone."
