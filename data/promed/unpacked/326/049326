The patients hospitalized after arriving at John F Kennedy Airport [New York City] in a plane carrying sick passengers and crew have tested positive for influenza, according to a New York City official.

About 100 people aboard Emirates Flight 203 from Dubai complained of illness, citing symptoms like cough and fever. Emirates said [Wed 5 Sep 2018] that 10 passengers "were taken ill."

Eric Phillips, press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, said test results on the 10 patients taken to the hospital found influenza. Some test results came back inconclusive on other viruses, which is a common occurrence, he said. Those tests will be re-administered [Thu 6 Sep 2018].

"All 10 patients will be kept in the hospital as a precaution until we know those final results," Phillips said.

[In response to the major media coverage of this event and global interest towards the possibility of a "major" outbreak of a respiratory pathogen related to airline travel, I've chosen to post on the preliminary findings of the laboratory tests, identifying influenza virus as a primary etiology of this event, but with the caveat that other respiratory viruses were identified (including that of the common cold), but confirmatory testing on those other respiratory viruses is pending and should be available later on today (at GMT -4 / EDT). Note that the serotype of influenza virus has not been mentioned in the preliminary findings.

Additional information in a media report by NBC New York mentioned that 7 crew and 3 passengers were taken to the hospital (https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/emirates-flight-jfk-new-york-dubai-flu-influenza-sick--492592551.html). This is relevant as crew members are working throughout their assigned areas on a plane, and if ill with influenza may well have contributed to transmission while on the plane. It also suggests they may have had a common exposure but we don't have information on the time of onset of their illness to assess estimated exposure. This may serve as a reminder of how crafty the influenza virus is, to guarantee its survival in its search for susceptible populations among a captive audience, in an airplane, for many hours. Of course there will be a major outcry of why these individuals were permitted to board the plane while ill... but how many of us have travelled while ill with an upper respiratory infection when work or personal commitments have created a pressure to travel?... Or how many go to their office, taking public transportation when ill with a respiratory infection?.....

We will post final laboratory results when available.
