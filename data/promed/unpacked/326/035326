_Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes as vectors of Jamestown Canyon virus
---------------------------------------------------
On 5 Aug 2004, ProMED carried a report (reference below) of the isolation
of Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus in Clinton County, NY, and made reference
to unnamed _Aedes_ mosquitoes as being the vectors.

In 2000 the subgenus _Ochlerotatus_ in the genus _Aedes_ was raised to
generic rank. This means that many mosquitoes in the genus _Aedes_
(including quite a few disease vectors) are now in the genus _Ochlerotatus_
(see ref. 1 below). Although some _Aedes_ mosquitoes transmit JC virus,
most are now in the genus _Ochlerotatus_, and I suspect that the _Aedes_
vectors mentioned in the ProMED post may actually refer to _Ochlerotatus_
species. (For those wishing to read about the controversy generated by
raising _Ochlerotatus_ to generic status, see refs 2 and 3 below).

I understand that _Ochlerotatus provocans_ is a vector of JC virus in New
York State. The larval habitats of this species consist primarily of ground
pools, roadside ditches, and pools at the edge of marshy areas. Another
vector is _Oc. triseriatus_, a species that breeds in water-filled tree
holes, and this may be the mosquito that is referred to in the ProMED post
as an _Aedes_ breeding in "standing water found in tree stumps and wooded
areas".

It would be interesting to learn the actual vectors involved in the
transmission of JC virus in Clinton County.

A good account of most aspects of Jamestown Canyon virus can be found in
ref. 4 below.
