JAMA today [2 Sep 2020] published the results of 3 randomized controlled trials spanning 12 countries, a prospective meta-analysis, and a commentary, all but one --which had inconclusive results -- supporting the use of systemic corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients, regardless of age, sex, duration of symptoms before treatment, or the need for mechanical ventilation.

Safe, inexpensive, and widely available, corticosteroids like dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and methylprednisolone are believed to treat COVID-19 by reducing lung inflammation in patients who require supplemental oxygen.

Lower 28-day death rates
------------------------
The meta-analysis of the 3 corticosteroid trials published today, plus 4 other such trials, showed that 28-day rates of death from any cause were lower in COVID-19 patients given corticosteroids than in those given usual care or a placebo. The study, conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) investigators, analyzed data from 1703 patients enrolled in the trials.

A total of 3 trials each in the meta-analysis involved hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, and one focused on methylprednisolone.

Of 678 total patients randomly assigned to receive corticosteroids, 222 died (33%), compared with 425 of 1025 patients (41%) who received usual care or placebo. The summary odds ratio (OR) for death was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.82; P less than .001) among patients receiving dexamethasone versus standard care or placebo. The OR for hydrocortisone was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.43 to 1.12; P = .13), while it was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.29 to 2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone.

Of the 6 studies that reported serious adverse events, 64 occurred among 354 patients (18%) given corticosteroids, while 80 occurred among 342 patients (23%) receiving standard care or placebo.

"These trial results from diverse clinical and geographic settings suggest that in the absence of compelling contraindications, a corticosteroid regimen should be a component of standard care for critically ill patients with COVID-19," the authors wrote. "The optimal dose and duration of treatment could not be assessed in this analysis, but there was no evidence suggesting that a higher dose of corticosteroids was associated with greater benefit than a lower dose of corticosteroids."

Updated corticosteroid guidance
-------------------------------
As a result of these studies, today the WHO updated its guidance for healthcare professionals and decision-makers on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients, according to a WHO press release. The organization recommends the use of systemic corticosteroids for treating patients who have severe or critical coronavirus illness but not for those with non-serious disease.

In collaboration with the nonprofit agency Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation, the WHO said it began creating the guidelines after preliminary RECOVERY trial results on the beneficial effects of dexamethasone were published on [22 Jun 2020]. Final results of the UK trial, also encouraging, were published on [17 Jul 2020]. Most corticosteroid trials in seriously ill COVID-19 patients were stopped after the RECOVERY trial because the evidence it generated was sufficiently strong to warrant offering the drugs.

Survival, need for assisted breathing
-------------------------------------
One of the 3 trials published in JAMA today [Wed 2 Sept 2020], the Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) study, led by researchers in London, found that treating 137 coronavirus patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with 50 or 100 milligrams of hydrocortisone 4 times a day for 7 days led to a 93% chance of survival and less need for extra oxygen than in 101 patients receiving no hydrocortisone.

In comparison, the 146 patients given hydrocortisone only when they went into shock had an 80% chance of a good outcome.

Study coauthor Anthony Gordon, MD, of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said that the corticosteroid trials give doctors more than one choice of therapy for critically ill COVID-19 patients. "Steroids are not a cure, but they help improve outcomes," he said in an Imperial College London press release. "Having a choice of different types of steroids, all of which seem to improve patient recovery, is great as it helps ease the problem of drug supply issues."

A 2nd hydrocortisone study, this one by researchers in France as part of the ongoing Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Evaluation of Corticosteroids (CAPE COD) trial, showed that low-dose hydrocortisone didn't significantly reduce death or continued need for mechanical ventilation of high-flow oxygen support after 21 days compared with placebo. Among the 76 patients in the hydrocortisone group, 32 (42.1%) died, versus 37 of 73 (50.7%) in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported.

However, the authors said that, like other corticosteroid COVID-19 trials, the study was stopped early because of slow enrollment after the 1st wave of the epidemic in France and anticipation of the publication of preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial "and likely was underpowered to find a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary outcome."

The researchers noted that hydrocortisone treatment was not tied to an increase in the rate of 2ary infections, a known risk of corticosteroid treatment--particularly in patients with pneumonia receiving mechanical ventilation.

The 3rd study published today, the Brazilian COVID-19 Dexamethasone (CoDEX) trial, found that patients given dexamethasone didn't require mechanical ventilation for, on average, 6.6 of their first 28 days in the ICU (95% CI, 5.0 to 8.2), versus only 4.0 days (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.4) in the group receiving standard care (difference, 2.6 days; 95% CI, 0.2 to 4.38; P = .04).

Of the dexamethasone group, 33 patients (21.9%) developed secondary infections, compared with 43 (29.1%) in the usual care group. Forty-seven dexamethasone patients (31.1%) required insulin for glucose control, versus 42 (28.3%) of the standard care group. And 5 patients in the dexamethasone group (3.3%) had other serious adverse events, versus 9 (6.1%) in the usual care group.

Evidence and hope
-----------------
In a commentary in the same journal, Hallie Prescott, MD, MSc, of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and Todd Rice, MD, MSci, of Vanderbilt University, said that these clinical trials and meta-analysis will give providers more confidence in prescribing corticosteroids and have shifted standard treatment of severe COVID-19 to include these drugs.

They also lauded the research networks' ability and willingness to collaborate, coordinate, and share data to rapidly complete studies in a time of unprecedented clinical burden from COVID-19.

"With these efforts and with rigorous evidence comes hope," Prescott and Rice wrote. "Despite the widespread morbidity and mortality, and societal disruption caused by this pandemic, the work and collaboration of these networks provide hope for advancing science and humanity through this pandemic and beyond."

Effect of dexamethasone on days alive and ventilator-free in patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19: The CoDEX Randomized Clinical Trial - [published online ahead of print, 2020 Sep 2]. JAMA. 2020; 10.1001/jama.2020.17021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Importance. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with substantial mortality and use of health care resources. Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients.

Objective. To determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.

Design, setting, and participants. Multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in 41 intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil. Patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition, were enrolled from [17 Apr to 23 Jun 2020]. Final follow-up was completed on [21 Jul 2020]. The trial was stopped early following publication of a related study before reaching the planned sample size of 350 patients.
Interventions. 20 mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care (n=151) or standard care alone (n=148).

Main outcomes and measures. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the 1st 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the 1st 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days.

Results. A total of 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [14] years; 37% women) were enrolled and all completed follow-up. Patients randomized to the dexamethasone group had a mean 6.6 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 5.0-8.2) during the first 28 days vs 4 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 2.9-5.4) in the standard care group (difference, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.2-4.38; P = .04). At 7 days, patients in the dexamethasone group had a mean SOFA score of 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5-6.7) vs 7.5 (95% CI, 6.9-8.1) in the standard care group (difference, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.38; P = .004). There was no significant difference in the prespecified 2ary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events.

Conclusions and relevance. Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Importance. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with severe lung damage. Corticosteroids are a possible therapeutic option.

Objective. To determine the effect of hydrocortisone on treatment failure on day 21 in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute respiratory failure.

Design, setting, and participants. Multicenter randomized double-blind sequential trial conducted in France, with interim analyses planned every 50 patients. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure were enrolled from [7 Mar to 1 Jun 2020], with last follow-up on [29 Jun 2020]. The study intended to enroll 290 patients but was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.

Interventions. Patients were randomized to receive low-dose hydrocortisone (n = 76) or placebo (n = 73).

Main outcomes and measures. The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, was defined as death or persistent dependency on mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. Prespecified 2ary outcomes included the need for tracheal intubation (among patients not intubated at baseline); cumulative incidences (until day 21) of prone position sessions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inhaled nitric oxide; PaO2:FIO2 ratio measured daily from day 1 to day 7, then on days 14 and 21; and the proportion of patients with 2ary infections during their ICU stay.

Results. The study was stopped after 149 patients (mean age, 62.2 years; 30.2% women; 81.2% mechanically ventilated) were enrolled. A total of 148 patients (99.3%) completed the study, and there were 69 treatment failure events, including 11 deaths in the hydrocortisone group and 20 deaths in the placebo group. The primary outcome, treatment failure on day 21, occurred in 32 of 76 patients (42.1%) in the hydrocortisone group compared with 37 of 73 (50.7%) in the placebo group (difference of proportions, -8.6% [95.48% CI, -24.9% to 7.7%]; P = .29). Of the 4 prespecified 2ary outcomes, none showed a significant difference. No serious adverse events were related to the study treatment.

Conclusions and relevance. In this study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, low-dose hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce treatment failure (defined as death or persistent respiratory support) at day 21. However, the study was stopped early and likely was underpowered to find a statistically and clinically important difference in the primary outcome.

[2] Iceland: serosurvey results
Date: Tue 1 Sep 2020
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88405


Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection lasted for at least 4 months after initial infection, a large serosurvey in Iceland found. Nearly all people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via quantitative PCR (qPCR) tests also tested positive with 2 pan-immunoglobulin (pan-Ig) SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays and remained seropositive after 120 days, reported Kari Stefansson, MD, PhD, of deCODE Genetics-Amgen in Reykjavik, and colleagues.

Moreover, antibody titers as measured by the 2 assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis, and showed no further decline over the last 2 months, the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, although whether the antibodies were adequate to prevent reinfection was not addressed in the study.

About 56% of COVID-19 infections were diagnosed via qPCR, 14% occurred in quarantine without a qPCR diagnosis and 30% occurred outside quarantine without being detected by qPCR, the researchers found.

"We therefore conclude that, despite extensive screening via qPCR, a substantial fraction of infections were not detected, which indicates many infected persons did not have substantial symptoms," Stefansson and colleagues wrote.

Determining immunity to COVID-19 is an open question, complicated by the wide range of antibody tests providing mixed results, as well as recent media coverage that seems to prove reinfection is possible. Stefansson's group also noted prior research suggesting a "substantial fraction" of patients, especially those with mild or no COVID-19 symptoms, may become "antibody-negative" in the early stages of recovery from infection.

An accompanying editorial by Galit Alter, PhD, of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Robert Seder, MD, of the NIH's Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland, said the study "provides hope that immunity" to COVID-19 "may not be fleeting and may be similar to that elicited by most other viral infections."

"Unlike previous studies, this study suggested stability of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity," the editorialists wrote. "Whether antibodies that persist confer protection and retain neutralizing or other protective effector functions that are required to block reinfection remains unclear." They also praised antibody assays as "highly effective alternatives to PCR testing" in terms of population-level surveillance required for "safe reopening" of cities and schools while the world waits for a vaccine to end the pandemic.

Stefansson and colleagues measured antibodies in serum samples from 30 576 people, including a subset of 1237 people followed for up to 4 months after diagnosis. The qPCR testing identified 1797 COVID-19 cases in Iceland. Of 1215 who had recovered and were tested for antibodies, 91.1% (95% CI 89.4%-92.6%) were seropositive. The authors determined this was the "lower bound of sensitivity of the combined pan-Ig tests "since some of the diagnoses may have been made on the basis of false positive qPCR results."

In addition, 2.3% of 4222 quarantined people were seropositive. In samples from 18 609 other people who had contact with the Icelandic healthcare system for reasons other than COVID-19, 0.3% were seropositive.

Antibody levels were higher in older and hospitalized people. After adjustment, BMI correlated positively with antibody titers, while smoking and use of anti-inflammatory medication had lower titers.

Alter and Seder said the study showed that antibody testing "captured a larger percentage of exposures" than the qPCR testing. They also highlighted the finding that asymptomatic cases accounted for nearly one-3rd of all infections.

Based on this data, and the 10 deaths in Iceland, Stefansson and colleagues calculated a 0.3% infection-fatality risk.

Alter and Seder pointed to the study's focus on "a homogenous population largely from a single ethnic origin and geographic region" as an important limitation. They called for future extended longitudinal studies to "more accurately determine the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."

[A repetitive comment (for those who have read this before): These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 2 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept2_1599144981.pdf

- The Americas region reported 46% of daily case numbers and 49.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.6 million cases. The USA and Brazil are dominant followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 10.7% of daily case numbers and 9.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.3 million. While Spain has been a dominant country in Europe, due to weekend artifact there were no reports submitted to WHO for this summary. In Spain's absence, Russia is the dominant country followed by France, Ukraine, Turkey, the UK, Germany, and Israel.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.8% of daily case numbers and 7.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 2.2% of daily case numbers and 4.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, and Cameroon.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.8% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.5 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 34.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 27% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.3 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Noteworthy is that the regional cumulative case count for South East Asia is closely approaching that of Europe, with daily newly confirmed cases almost 3 times that of Europe.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 6.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.2%.

Impression: Unchanged from recent days. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. The global 7-day averages seem to reflect a small increase in reporting confirmed cases, although deaths are decreasing. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.UBA]
