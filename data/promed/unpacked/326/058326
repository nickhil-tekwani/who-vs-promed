Somalia: [Suspected] Rift Valley fever kills at least 32
-----------------------------------------------
Suspected Rift Valley fever has killed at least 32 people in southern
Somalia, where insecurity bars assessment teams from reaching some
parts of the region, the United Nations has said.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for
Somalia said on Fri 19 Jan 2007 that the dead were among 62 reported
cases, mostly in the south, one of the areas worst hit by recent
flooding in east Africa and the Horn of Africa. OCHA spoke of plans
to boost surveillance in the region, the theatre of recent fighting
between Ethiopia-backed government troops and Islamist forces who
were ousted from their stronghold in the southern town of Kismayo
earlier this month [January 2007].
"Plans to field a medical mission to Kismayo to examine patients and
take blood samples for analysis have so far been unsuccessful due to
a lack of assurance for the safe passage of the team," OCHA said in a
statement released here. In addition, the agency said cholera has
been reported among around 1000 families that have settled along
several Somali-Ethiopia border towns.
"Many of the refugees have settled among the local population and are
receiving some assistance from them as well as obtaining casual work
in the villages," it said. "There are no international agencies
present in the area, and it is not clear to what extent the local
authorities are willing to assist," OCHA added in its daily situation update.
So far, Rift Valley fever has killed at least 95 people in Somalia's
southern neighbor Kenya, where around 300 other people have been
infected since mid-December 2006. Rift Valley fever patients usually
experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness,
vomiting of blood and extreme weight loss at the onset of the
illness. Many patients recover within up to a week after the onset of
illness, according to experts.
Authorities are currently fanning out across the region to vaccinate
at least 2 million animals to prevent a further spread of the
disease, whose virus was 1st isolated in Kenya's Rift Valley region
in the 1930s but has been spotted elsewhere on the continent.
