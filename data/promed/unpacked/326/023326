[Re: ProMED-mail Rabbit hemorrhagic disease - Canada: (MB), OIE 20110514.1475]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Referring to the recent ProMED report on a case of rabbit
haemorrhagic disease in Canada, where the disease has never previously
been reported. This is a most interesting observation, which raises an
important issue. As the result of a similar experience some years ago
and also research on rabbit haemorrhagic disease, I believe there is a
reasonably plausible explanation for the appearance of the disease in
an otherwise healthy pet rabbit that had been kept indoors for more
than one year and therefore is unlikely to have been exposed to rabbit
haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) from an external source.

A simple and plausible explanation is that in this example, the virus
was carried as a persistent infection by the apparently healthy
imported rabbit (or was it born in Canada -- another interesting
possibility?) As argued below, there is significant published evidence
that RHDV can circulate amongst rabbits in a benign (persistent?) form
and possibly be reactivated.

RHDV was first recognized following its isolation from rabbits in
China in 1984. However archival rabbit serum samples, collected from
both domestic and wild rabbits more than 70 years ago, contained
RHDV-specific antibodies demonstrating that the virus had circulated
widely in rabbits in the Old World for many years (Chasey et al, 1997;
Moss et al, 2002; Nagesha et al, 2000; Nowotny et al, 1992; Robinson
et al, 2002; Trout et al, 1997).

The 1st identified epidemic in wild rabbits in the UK was described
in 1994 (Chasey, 1994). However, contrary to the original belief, that
the viruses causing this 1st UK epidemic in wild rabbits were direct
descendants of the strain that caused the Chinese 1984 outbreak, more
recent phylogenetic data show that the UK viruses were already
circulating in the UK rabbits prior to 1984 (Forrester et al, 2006a).
Thus, phylogenetic evidence shows firstly, that in addition to the
Chinese epidemic virus of 1984, several other distinct genetic
lineages also emerged, independently, to produce the disease in
rabbits and secondly, the viruses circulated for years in many regions
of Europe (and Australia) prior to 1984 without producing evident
disease.

The concept of persistent infections by RHDV in rabbits is also
supported by the evidence that highly virulent strains can readily
establish non-lethal infections within rabbits (Forrester et al, 2003;
Gall et al, 2007; Zheng et al, 2002). Moreover, 2 distinct virus
lineages that represent viruses co-circulating amongst wild rabbits on
a single site in Pitroddie, Scotland, have been reported. The
serological findings combined with the age estimates, based on rabbit
weight, show that at the beginning of the year of study all rabbits
were adults, as they weighed more than 1500 g [3.3 lb] and had high
RHDV-specific antibody titres. The detection of seropositivity was
surprising because there had been no evidence of an epidemic outbreak
of RHDV during this time or during the previous 3 years implying that
the rabbits had survived exposure to RHDV, which must have circulated
asymptomatically within the rabbit population. The detection of
RHDV-specific RNA in the livers of healthy older wild rabbits during
March, April, July, and August 2005, when no disease was observed,
also supports this concept. Similarly, we also identified a widely
divergent strain of RHDV circulating asymptomatically on Lambay Island
off the coast of Ireland (Forrester et al, 2007).

One more important piece of evidence favours the concept of
persistent infections in otherwise healthy rabbits. When we tested the
serum of a large number of healthy wild rabbits from different regions
of New Zealand, years after the deliberate and illegal release of the
known virulent Czech strain of RHDV, we isolated RHDV RNA from a
significant proportion of these healthy rabbits. In all but one case,
the sequence of the RNA samples was very similar to the original
highly virulent Czech strain that had been released in New Zealand in
an attempt to decimate the rabbit population. In 2 samples we
determined the complete genome sequence of the virus -- implying that
at least in some of the rabbits the persistent virus was potentially
infectious (Forrester et al, 2003).

Thus, there is significant evidence in support of the concept that
apparently healthy rabbits can carry RHDV in a persistent form.
Whether or not the apparent reactivation of this persistent form of
the virus leads to epidemic outbreaks, remains to be determined.
However, in the context of the identification of RHDV in a rabbit in
Canada, it appears most likely that the rabbit was carrying the virus
as a persistent infection, which (as has been observed previously)
apparently reactivated to cause the overt disease in the host rabbit.
One possible explanation for the sudden reactivation of the virus in
persistently infected rabbits could be stress. It is well known that
wild blue mountain hares (_Lepus timidus_) rarely survive if held in
captivity. They usually die in a manner similar to rabbits infected
with RHDV, within a few days of capture, presumably due to the stress
of captivity -- whether or not this is due to the reactivation of a
persistently infecting and RHDV-related virus (European brown hare
syndrome virus) remains to be determined.
