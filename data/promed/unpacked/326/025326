Meningococcal disease in Chad
-----------------------------
From 3 to 8 Jan 2005, 3 cases of meningococcal disease were reported from
Brejing and Treijing refugee camps in northern Chad, with a population of
about 60 000. The 3 cases were positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ W135
by latex test. Laboratory confirmation will be conducted by the WHO
Collaborating Centre, Institute Medecine Tropicale des Services de Sante
des Armees (IMTSSA).
WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontieres-Holland and the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are coordinating
the response to the outbreak. Emergency control measures to be implemented
are case management and a mass immunization campaign, with surveillance
strengthened in other camps and neighboring districts.

Meningococcemia-like illness in the Philippines
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, Philippines has reported a total of 33 cases and 19
deaths -- case fatality ratio of 58 per cent -- of a meningococcemia-like
illness in Baguio City. A total of 8 cases have been confirmed by blood
culture as _Neisseria meningitidis_ type A. But the clinical presentation
and the high case fatality ratio observed are unusual in epidemic
meningococcal disease. Therefore further epidemiological and laboratory
investigations are needed to better characterize the cause and extent of
the outbreak.
An expert in meningitis from WHO will be assisting the Ministry of Health
in its investigations. He will be joined by a laboratory expert and an
epidemiologist from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.
