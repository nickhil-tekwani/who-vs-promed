40 persons were suspected to have contracted anthrax in West Bengal's Bankura villages following which teams of dermatologists were rushed there, official said on Monday [25 May 2015].

The Chief Medical Officer, Health, Prasun Kumar Das, today [25 May 2015] said that 40 persons were affected in Simplipal block of Bakura district, and 2 teams of dermatologists were being sent to Bamunpal and Ramakunda villages of the block from where villagers have reported deaths of cattle. The teams will collect samples and send them to Kolkata for examination, he said.

Meanwhile, Superintendent of Bankura Sammilani Medical College Hospital, Panchanan Kundu, dismissed media reports about anthrax that had claimed 2 lives in the state-run hospital. 40-year-old LS, who was admitted to the hospital on 19 May 2015, died of complications arising out of convulsions, after which he was admitted on the following day, he said [Presumably, LS had convulsions and was taken to hospital the next day, where he then died. - Mod.MHJ].

Another patient, RS, died of pneumonia and septicaemia on 21 May 2015, Kundu said.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease that normally affects animals such as cattle and horses. It can be contracted by humans through infected animals or products made from their body parts.

[It is noticeable that though this is a zoonotic disease humans catch from exposure to sick or dead animals, there is no mention of a veterinary response. This is not the way to control and manage this disease. Minimally, one should vaccinate the livestock or villages where animals have died to stop further bovine, and sheep and goat cases.

West Bengal is notable for all 3 species being affected. In 2007, there were 16 outbreaks involving just 78 cattle; 2008, 10 cattle outbreaks 43 animals; 2009, 17 cattle outbreaks and 65 head; 2010, 18 cattle outbreaks and 71 head, and 3 outbreaks involving sheep and/or goats with 10 cases; 2011, 21 cattle outbreaks and 64 head, and 2 outbreaks involving sheep and/or goats and 4 cases; 2012, 8 outbreaks and 15 head, and one outbreak involving 2 sheep and/or goats; and 2013, 14 cattle outbreaks and 69 head. In 2010, ProMED reported over 57 human cases in West Bengal with 2 deaths [see 20100706.2252 and 20100508.1493].

There is a problem in diagnosing cutaneous anthrax in humans. They have a tendency to self-treat with antibiotics before getting medical help. As this pathogen is very sensitive to antibiotics, the wound may reveal nothing. However, the best sample is by using a syringe to extract bloody fluid from underneath the lesion, This will be successful in about 30 percent of cases.
