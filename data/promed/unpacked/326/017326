Some members of Canadian teams that trekked the jungles of Borneo in an
adventure race last month [Aug 2000 have been hospitalized for a
potentially fatal illness. Infectious disease experts are treating at least
4 of 20 Canadian participants for leptospirosis, a rare disease that can
kill in its most severe form. 2 are receiving treatment in Toronto, where
most of the 20 Canadian competitors in Eco-Challenge, Sabah 2000 reside.
Preliminary tests from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta suggest
"a diagnosis of leptospirosis" among several U.S. athletes who participated
in the race, which ran from 21 Aug to 2 Sep 2000, and attracted roughly 155
participants from around the world. Since returning to their homes last
week, many racers developed flu-like symptoms.
Dr. John Conly, director of Infection Prevention and Control at the
University Health Network, has sent blood samples to Health Canada's Bureau
of Microbiology in Winnipeg and is awaiting a confirmation of
leptospirosis, but is treating the racers for the disease anyway. "If there
are confirmed cases elsewhere...then it's likely that's the case here too,"
Conly said.
