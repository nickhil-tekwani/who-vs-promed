A 3rd case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in a horse, this time near
Reddick, was reported in Marion County this week [week of 9 Aug 2010]. It
is the 2nd case in less than a month and caused the county health
department to issue a notice to advise residents of the risk.

Though rare in humans, EEE can be transmitted through mosquito bites.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the infection
affects a small number of humans every year, mostly in the Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states. Most of those affected have no symptoms, but in severe
cases headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting are common. Severe cases
can be fatal.

"With the confirmation of the 2nd case of EEE in Marion County this month
[August 2010], the Marion County Health Department is compelled to issue a
mosquitoborne illness advisory alerting the community of the increased risk
of transmission of illness by mosquitoes," said Dr Nathan Grossman,
director of the health department. "Citizens should exercise precautions to
protect themselves and their loved ones."

There is no human vaccine against the disease, but there is one available
for horses, which if administered reduces the likelihood of spreading the
infection to humans.

The department suggests limiting outdoor activities at dusk and dawn,
wearing clothing that covers most of the body, using repellents containing
DEET, and getting rid of any standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
For more information on eastern equine encephalitis or advice on
mosquitoborne illness, contact the Marion County Health Department at (352)
629-0137.

[While EEE may be rare in people, it is deadly. Eastern equine encephalitis
has killed 4 people in Florida this year (2010), including 2 in
Hillsborough County. This makes it all the more critical for people to take
this disease seriously, and to heed warnings of not being out at certain
times, using DEET insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants
[trousers], and generally protecting oneself from the bites of these insects.

It should also highlight the huge need to vaccinate horses. There is a
vaccine available, and it is easy to get and provides protection for your
animal(s).

Even with mosquitoes causing human deaths and equine deaths, it is
difficult to understand why counties may feel the need to cut back on
spraying for mosquitoes. Yet some counties in Florida are financially
pinched and something has to be cut back. This is a very wet season on the
Florida record books and protecting human health is important. However,
there are areas where cutting back on mosquito spraying, a potential effect
on human health, is being discussed.

Clearly, education on how to protect yourself, and to limit mosquito
breeding sites is in order. - Mod.TG
