Anthrax has been confirmed as the cause of death of one cow, and is the suspected cause in 2 other cattle deaths, in an east-central Saskatchewan hamlet. According to Saskatchewan Agriculture, one case was confirmed [5 Dec 2014] in the RM [rural municipality] of Hazel Dell, located approximately 330 kilometres [about 205 miles] east of Saskatoon. The 2 other cases are cattle from the same heard.

The source of anthrax is believed to be soil-contaminated slough hay. Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, which, according to Saskatchewan Agriculture, can survive in spore form in soil for decades.

[The assumption that the cause was contaminated slough hay makes a lot of sense. These areas will collect rainfall and the soil there will be muddy during hay bailing. Spores will survive better there than in dry places. Of course this hay may have been purchased and is not from a pasture in the affected ranch. If Saskatchewan Agriculture can identify the source of the "contaminated" hay, come the spring it would be worth visiting that meadow and looking for standing water, indicative of a depressed slough area and, subject to any history available from the farmer, taking transect soil samples in the hopes of finding the specific contaminated place, possibly an old anthrax grave. And within the epidemiology of cattle anthrax such sloughs collect anthrax cases because the grazing persists there in the middle of a hot dry summer, and thus collect sick and moribund animals. And so it cycles.

The province has been active in encouraging regular spring vaccination and the reduction in outbreaks can be seen in the fewer and fewer outbreaks each year to none in 2013 and in 2014 up until now. [See the posts below.] Unfortunately, spring vaccination will not have provided a persistent level of protection and the usual immunity lasts just 6+ months.
