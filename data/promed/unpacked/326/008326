Dog owners warned of toxic algae in ponds due to heatwave
---------------------------------------------------------
Dog owners have been warned not to let their pets swim in ponds and lakes
because of a deadly poisonous algae which is thriving in the heatwave. In
the West Midlands dead fish were found floating in a park due to oxygen
depletion from the algae and the fountains in Trafalgar Square had to be
closed because of the green slime. It has also caused trouble for gardeners
and fishermen.

Vets have now raised concerns that dogs diving into lakes and ponds are at
risk of being poisoned by ingesting a toxic blue green algae called
Cyanobacteria.

Mark Johnston, of the British Small Animals Veterinary Association, warned
pet owners to keep dogs away from lakes or ponds where the poisonous algae
is growing. He said although blue green algae is usually rare, due to the
successive hot days it has become more commonplace. "If blue green algae is
in still water you should not allow animals to swim," he said.

A resident of Lodsworth, West Sussex [in the south of England], almost lost
her 5 year old collie, Cassie, after the dog went swimming in Petworth Park
National Trust Lake
[<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-petworthhouse>] and drank some of
the algae. "There is a 4 to 5 hour window from ingestion of the poisonous
water to death," she said. "Fortunately we were able to get to a vet who
knew what to do and saved Cassie's life. I certainly wouldn't want anyone
else to go through what we have been through -- so even if your dog is
desperate to cool off in this hot weather, make sure it is in a river or
the sea."

Charles Williams, a vet, gave the dog adrenaline and 2 and a half pints of
fluid to rehydrate it. After his initial life-saving treatment he rang
toxicologists at the Veterinary Poison Information Centre for advice on the
algae and how to treat its effects.

"They described Cassie's case exactly and we were able to build up a
picture of her problem," he said. "At one point I thought we were going to
lose her but within half an hour we began to make inroads. She is a very
lucky dog."

Mr Williams warned other dog owners to steer clear of stagnant ponds
particularly those which looked turgid and green. He said if pets show
symptoms of illness shortly after leaving water, have acute salivation and
pale gums they should be taken to their vet immediately.

"Blue green algae is an extremely poisonous substance and from the 1st
signs dogs can die very quickly," he said. A spokeswoman for the National
Trust at Petworth Park said signs were now being placed around the pond.
She said: "We are aware of the algae and we have put up warning notices
telling people not to let their dogs or their children play in the water."

A recent survey by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust found the biggest
concern of gardeners is algae. The charity said filling ponds with
nutrient-rich tap water often makes the problem worse and urged gardeners
to use to use rainwater butts or wait for the rain.

[Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria can be deadly to a number of animals and
has been responsible for the death of livestock in other parts of the
world. Cyanobacteria can be found in water, soil, on rocks, and even in
symbiotic relationships with some lichen. They can be found as single
cells, colonies, filiments, sheets and sometimes a balls, with a hollow center.

Cyanobacteria have several types of classification, but some produce
cyanotoxins. Some of the toxins are known as anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as,
aplysiatoxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR, nodularin R
(from _Nodularia_), and saxitoxin. These toxins are neurotoxic,
hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and endotoxic.

These toxics have been detrimental to a wide variety of animals, but can
also be dangerous to humans.

Additional information about cyanobacteria, especially at it relates to
human health, can be found at on the Health Canada website:
