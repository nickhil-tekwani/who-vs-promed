Disease name: melioidosis
Address: Kamogawa city
Age / Gender: 75 years old / male
Profession: unemployed
Symptoms: fever, sepsis, shock, pneumonia, lung abscess
Date of onset: 30 May 2019
Notification date: 26 Aug 2019

A 75-year-old man who was admitted to a medical institution in Kamogawa city on 6 Aug 2019 and died on the same day was diagnosed as a melioidosis [case] from the results of the test, and the outbreak was reported to the Awa Health Center on 26 Aug 2019.

In this case, infection in Thailand is presumed, but since April 2007, these infections are classified into 4 types [in the] Act on Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (Act No. 114 of 1998). This was the 1st [occurrence of melioidosis] in this prefecture since being positioned as an infectious disease.

In prefectures, we provide information about this matter to the prefectural medical association or medical institutions in the prefecture.

Background of patient occurrence:

February to March 2019 - stay in Thailand
15 May 2019 to 26 Jun 2019 - stay in Thailand
30 May 2019 - unconscious and hospitalized in a Thai medical institution
23 Jun 2019 - symptoms improved; patient discharged
26 Jun 2019 - returned to Japan
Early August [2019] - presented with poor physical condition such as fever
6 Aug 2019 - Symptoms did not go away, and he visited a medical institution in Kamogawa city and was hospitalized for pneumonia.
The patient died on the same day with sepsis and shock symptoms.
26 Aug 2019 - diagnosed as melioidosis based on test results.

The Awa Health Center received a report from the medical institution.

[This] report of melioidosis in Chiba prefecture is the 1st case since April 2007, when this disease was designated as a class 4 infectious disease.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
