Eleven confirmed cases of St. Louis Encephalitis (including 3 deaths); 65
cases under investigation (including one death)
At a news conference at City Hall this afternoon, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
provided an update on the investigation of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) in
New York City. Yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) confirmed two additional cases of SLE, bringing to 11 the
number of confirmed cases; there are 65 [other cases under investigation.
Mayor Giuliani said, "Yesterday, the CDC provided results on 19 additional
cases under investigation for SLE. Fourteen of these cases were found to be
negative for the virus. However, there are now two additional cases
confirmed: one case is a 15 year-old who is in stable condition; and the
other is of a 38 year-old who has been released from the hospital. Three
other cases are borderline. [see comment below
"The appearance of the SLE virus in a younger population is not unexpected
but the elderly are still much more vulnerable to becoming seriously ill.
Nonetheless, all New Yorkers should take precautions against mosquito
bites. Most people who are infected with the SLE virus will recover. I urge
New Yorkers to be calm and cooperative as we continue our surveillance for
this virus and do whatever is necessary to protect the health of our City,"
the Mayor concluded.
Jerome Hauer, Director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management
(MOEM), said, "We will complete this round of aerial and ground spraying of
the five boroughs by tomorrow evening before resuming these preventive
activities in the next several days, weather permitting."
Health Commissioner Cohen said, "Based on information received yesterday
from the CDC, which confirmed two cases, ruled out 14, and established 3
more borderline cases, we are now investigating 65 possible cases of SLE.
Among these, 7 are probable, 17 are suspect, 38 are of low probability [see
comment below and 3 have not yet been classified. Among the 65 cases being
investigated, 13 are considered to be in the borderline category. This
borderline category characterizes those cases that have to be retested by
the CDC. It should be noted that each of those borderline cases have
varying levels of probability for confirmation.
"The public should be reassured that younger adults are most likely to
fully recover from an SLE infection. These additional confirmed cases of
SLE represent infections that occurred prior to September 3, when our
praying efforts began. However, any individual who experiences a severe
headache with high fever or any other SLE-like symptoms, including stiff
neck or disorientation, should seek medical attention immediately," Dr.
Cohen concluded.
The New York City Department of Health continues to recommend precautions
to reduce the risk of exposure to mosquitoes. [precautions listed - Mod.CHC

[There is no such thing as a "borderline" diagnosis. Exclusive of virus
isolation or detection (i.e., antigen detection assays, PCR or other
detection of SLE viral RNA), which always are either "positive" or
"negative", depending on whether a virus or its RNA is detected or not,
serodiagnosis is (should be) done with paired serum samples. Therefore,
either there is a significant rise or fall in antibody titer or there is
not. As we recently discussed, re: infections with eastern equine and
western equine encephalitis viruses, use of single serum samples for
serodiagnosis can lead to a presumptive diagnosis at best, even under the
pressure that must exist in the political context. Terms such as
"probable", "suspect", "low probability", "borderline", and "varying
levels of probability for confirmation" are nonsensical. Whoever is
interpreting the CDC results is going way out on a limb and is not
communicating well. I assume this is not at the laboratory (CDC) level,
else we will have an even bigger and more confusing epidemiological mess
than we now have. Under the present circumstances, the presence of IgM
antibody in a single serum from a person in NY City could be considered
(even VERY) presumptive, which likely is good enough to make medical,
vector control, and other decisions, but it should not be considered as
confirmatory of a recent infection. - Mod.CHC
