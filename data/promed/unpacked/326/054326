PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (05)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>

[With the continuing decline of the number of
cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.)
in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has
been decided to broaden the scope of the
occasional ProMED mail reports to include other
prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from
any part of the world are now included in these
updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD
(sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are
included also when they have some relevance to
the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 7 Apr 2008
-----------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of
suspect cases of CJD referred to the CJD
surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 3 Mar 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 115
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163

Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new
cases diagnosed during the past month, and the
number of patients alive is unchanged.

These data are still consistent with the view
that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline
(although the incidence curve may be developing a
tail). The peak number of deaths was 28 in the
year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18
in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and so far none in 2008

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 7 Apr 2008 in the UK, so far there have
been 33 referrals, 13 deaths from sporadic CJD,
one death from iatrogenic CJD, none from familial
CJD, 2 from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[2] Suspected cases of vCJD in Spain

Deaths in Castilla y Leon confirmed to be from Mad Cow disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
The death of 2 youngsters in Castilla y Leon has
been confirmed today [7 Apr 2008] to have been
caused by [variant] Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (mad
cow disease). The 2 youngsters have not been
named and they are thought to have eaten infected
meat some 8 years ago. Experts in Spain now
consider that more cases are likely to be
detected here over the next few months.

Juan Jose Badiola, director of the centre which
investigates the disease in Spain, has called for
calm. He said that both the victims probably ate
the infected meat more than 8 years ago. The
deaths follow that of a 26-year-old woman in Madrid back in 2005.

The exact localities of the new deaths have not
been revealed, but the Castilla y Leon health
department say that one death was a month ago and
the other some time earlier. Neither of those to die was a farmer.

Two die in Spain from human form of mad cow disease
---------------------------------------------------
Two people have died in Spain from variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form
of mad cow disease, the health department at the
regional Castilla y Leon government said on Monday [7 Apr 2008].

Mad cow disease, or BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), 1st emerged in Britain in the
1980s and has been found in herds in several
European and other countries. Scientists believe
it is transmitted through infected meat and bone
meal fed to cattle and may cause vCJD in humans.

The health department said these were not the 1st
vCJD deaths in Spain but did not give details.

[This is a disturbing report, which if confirmed
independently represents a significant extension
in the incidence of vCJD. Up to November 2007,
there have been 163 confirmed vCJD cases in the
UK and 39 reported from elsewhere in the world --
almost always with a UK connection: 23 in France,
4 in the Republic of Ireland, 3 in the USA, 2 in
the Netherlands, 2 in Portugal and single cases
in Italy, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Spain.

More precise information is awaited on the ages
["youngsters"] of the patients and their possible
exposure to BSE-contaminated meat, and any links
by travel or occupation with the UK. Information
will be posted on ProMED-mail with the regular
Prion Disease Updates as it becomes available.

The autonomous community of Castile and Leon is
the largest in Spain and one of the largest
administrative subdivisions in the European
Union. The location of Castile and Leon (Castiia y Leon) can be found at

[4] Kuru and sCJD prion probable identity

[The following paper published recently in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
(PNAS) establishes the identity of the
transmission patterns of the prions responsible
for the diseases kuru and classical (sporadic) CJD. - Mod.CP]

Kuru prions and sporadic Creutzfeldt­Jakob
disease prions have equivalent transmission
properties in transgenic and wild-type mice. By

Fox, Sharon Cooper, Sabrina Cronier, Emmanuel A.

Abstract: Kuru provides our principal experience
of an epidemic human prion disease and primarily
affected the Fore linguistic group of the Eastern
Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Kuru was
transmitted by the practice of consuming dead
relatives as a mark of respect and mourning
(transumption). To date, detailed information of
the prion strain type propagated in kuru has been
lacking. Here, we directly compare the
transmission properties of kuru prions with
sporadic, iatrogenic, and variant
Creutzfeldt­Jakob disease (CJD) prions in
Prnp-null transgenic mice expressing human prion
protein and in wild-type mice. Molecular and
neuropathological data from these transmissions
show that kuru prions are distinct from variant
CJD and have transmission properties equivalent
to those of classical (sporadic) CJD prions.
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis
that kuru originated from chance consumption of
an individual with sporadic CJD.
