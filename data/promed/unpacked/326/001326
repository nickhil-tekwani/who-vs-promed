A 30-year-old woman from Mudhan village near Lakhpat [Kutch district, Gujarat] has been admitted to the GK General Hospital in Bhuj as a suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient.

"She was running high fever, bleeding, and had lost appetite when admitted on [30 May 2016]. Doctors attending to her suspected it to be a case of Congo fever and informed the health department. We have collected her samples and sent it to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for tests. The patient is stable now and has no fever," Dr Piyush Pujara, epidemiologist at Kutch, told TOI [Times of India].

"A paramedical staff has been deployed in Mudhan village as part of precautionary measures. They are also conducting health checks on the woman's close family members. A veterinary team is also camping in the village," Pujara said.

The virus, which spreads from animals to humans, is active mostly in parts of Saurashtra [a region of Gujarat] and Kutch.

[This is the 4th report posted on ProMED-mail in 2016 of a suspected CCHF case in Gujarat state. There were reports of cases from Kutch district in Gujarat in 2015.

The report above does not provide details of the possible exposures that led the patient to acquire the CCHF infection. CCHF virus transmission may occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but also with blood and secretions of infected people, usually in a hospital setting. - Mod.UBA]
