The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources has alerted
horse owners, breeders, and veterinarians in this state that 4 horses
here are known to have been exposed to the EHV-1, a contagious virus,
in New Jersey. The horses were subsequently transported to Massachusetts.

One of the horses has since tested positive for the virus and is
exhibiting clinical signs associated with the disease.

Agricultural officials are urging horse owners to take precautions to
curb possible spreading of the virus among the state's horse
population. EHV-1 is a contagious disease of horses which can cause
respiratory illness, spontaneous abortion, neurological disease, and death.

Some protection is offered by vaccination against EHV. State
authorities would like to make it clear that this virus does not pose
a risk to humans.

Farms in New Jersey and Maine have been quarantined to help prevent
the spread of the disease. The affected horses in Massachusetts and
Maine had contact with the New Jersey farms.
