An epidemic of malaria among Chinese migrants to Italy
-------------------------------------------
Case histories
On 5 Jul 2000, a feverish Chinese male aged 20 was admitted with _P.
falciparum_ malaria at the Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases
of the University of Brescia in Italy. The patient, coming from northern
China (Zhe Jing) had entered Italy in mid-June.
On 7 Jul 2000, a second Chinese male, aged 25 yrs was admitted with _P.
falciparum_ at our Institute. He also had entered Italy in mid-June, coming
from northern China (Zhe Jing).
On 27 Jul 2000, a third Chinese male, aged 24, was admitted at our
Institute with _P. falciparum_. He also had entered Italy (date unknown)
from northern China (Zhe Jing).
On 28 Jul 2000, a fourth Chinese male, aged 22, was admitted at our
Institute, with _P. falciparum_. He also had entered Italy a few days
before admission from northern China (Zhe Jing). We are aware of a fifth
case of complicated falciparum malaria in a young Chinese male who was
admitted in another hospital. The patient died of cerebral malaria.
Comment
The detailed histories of all the cases were extremely difficult because no
patient was able to speak Italian, nor English, nor French. Due to their
frequently illegal status, patients were also reluctant to give detailed
explanations of how they get to Italy. The help of a Chinese translator was
then asked and the probable itinerary of their trip to Italy partly
explained. After leaving China, 3 of our patients have been transported to
Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan, East Africa (unknown country) and
finally to Italy. The remaining patient has only mentioned a stop in East
Africa.
Conclusions
The itinerary of Chinese migrant people entering Europe may include
different malaria endemic areas and Chinese are often unable to speak
English or any other European language. Malaria should always be suspected
whenever a Chinese patient, even coming from northern China, presents with
unexplained fever

[The report is intriguing as it suggest exposure in a very high risk area.
The most obvious place of infection is in East Africa which, however, is
difficult to prove. The cases shows that a malaria blood slide examined by
a competent microscopists is part of the routine examination of febrile
patients even in cases where it is not obvious that the patient has been
exposed to malaria. - Mod.EP
