A total of 18 people died from rabies in the 1st 8 months of this year [2018], a senior official of Yangon General Hospital said.

Dr. Khin Theingi Myint, medical superintendent of the hospital, said the number of fatalities due to rabies from January to August [2018] only includes those who were treated at the hospital. That number could increase if other hospitals across the country are included in the total.

If a person is infected with rabies, the chances of survival are slim, as there is no medicine to cure the virus. Anyone who is bitten by a dog should go to the nearest hospital within 24 hours to get vaccinated," she said.

A total of 5328 people who suffered dog bites were vaccinated at the emergency department of the hospital from January to July this year [2018], according to the hospital. Most of the victims were from Dala township.

Dr. Khin Theingi Myint said Yangon residents can get their 1st dose of dog bite [anti-rabies] vaccine at the hospital but can get their 2nd and 3rd doses of the vaccine at the hospital nearest them.

Dr. Khin Maung Lwin, a retired director of the Ministry of Health and Sports, said residents should allow city veterinary officials to vaccinate and treat stray dogs in order to minimise the spread of rabies. "The public should allow the Yangon City Development Committee to eliminate stray dogs, and have their pets vaccinated and treated at veterinary clinics operated by the city," he said.

He urged health authorities and city officials to teach people who protect stray dogs, that the dogs have to be brought to the pound because they could endanger the lives of the public.

Last year [2017], the hospital treated and vaccinated 16 274 people for dog bites. Of those patients, 32 died from rabies.
