------------------------------------------------
[The posting above included the following statement:]
"Excluding the data from Nepal, approximately 99 Asian and 72 African
elephants in Europe, Australia, South Africa, and the US have been
tested using the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and MAPIA [multi-antigen print
immunoassay], including 22 elephants with culture-confirmed TB.
Preliminary data has demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 97
percent specificity for the Elephant TB STAT-PAK and 100 percent
sensitivity and 100 percent specificity for the MAPIA using culture
as the reference standard.
The TB STAT-PAK has recently completed government licensing
procedures in the US and will likely be commercially available later
this year [2007]".
In a paragraph preceding this one, it is stated that it is not known
if latency occurs in elephants. Therefore it is impossible to say if
any test is 100 percent sensitive, surely, but only to say that it
picked up 100 percent of those elephants positive with certain other
test/s, such as gross/microscopic/forensic necropsy, trunk washings
etc., or any combination of other tests?
(If a recent Lancet paper reporting from Pakistan (via Reuters Health
and Medscape Infectious Diseases) is true, and is in any way
indicative of circumstances in Nepal, then, perhaps, the reported 2:1
male:female incidence of TB in the human population in Nepal may
reflect an under-reporting/diagnosis of the disease in the female
population there too? See
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/558007?src=mp>.)

[Culture of trunk washes for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ is
apparently accepted as the gold standard diagnostic test for active
pulmonary tuberculosis in live elephants, because radiographic
examination is not feasible and the clinical presentation is
non-specific (see Summary. Elephant Tuberculosis Research Workshop.
Orlando, FL 21-22 May 2005. This is a detailed description of the
history, diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis in elephants,
available at
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).
The report from Dr. Susan Miikota (ProMED-mail Tuberculosis,
elephants - Nepal (04) 20070702.2111) gives sensitivity and
specificity data of ancillary serologic tests for the diagnosis of
tuberculosis in these animals. I agree with Tom Kelly that these data
most likely apply only to the 22 elephants with culture-confirmed TB
that Dr. Miikota referred to. Clarification from Dr. Miikota would be
appreciated.
The other point made by Tom Kelly refers to a report by Khan and
colleagues in the 9 Jun 2007 issue of The Lancet, that women in
Pakistan are less likely than men to test positive for tuberculosis
because they don't know how to expectorate sputum properly. In this
study, 771 men and 749 women were randomly assigned to get a 2-minute
set of instructions on how to give a proper sputum sample and then
were asked to provide a spot sample and an early-morning specimen
taken upon awakening. Patients in the control group were asked for
the 2 samples only. Instruction significantly increased the
proportion of women who were smear-positive for TB by 63 percent.
There were no significant differences among the men (see
<http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/Tuberculosis/tb/5897>).
