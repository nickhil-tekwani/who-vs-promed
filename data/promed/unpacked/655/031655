Authorities treated more than 700 people for food poisoning after a political rally in southern Mexico this week, officials said. Exactly what caused the food poisoning was unclear, officials from the health ministry in Mexico's Guerrero state said Wed 8 Feb 2012. Authorities were testing food and drink samples from the event and sending representatives to communities throughout the area to look for additional cases.

Alberta Garcia Adame told CNN affiliate Televisa she started to feel sick after eating egg tacos at a rally Tuesday [7 Feb 2012] in Chilapa, Guerrero for Sergio Dolores Flores, who is running for congress as a candidate for Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party. As the number of cases grew, doctors treated many patients at a local hospital and a temporary shelter at the back of a local church, Televisa reported.

Guerrero State Health Secretary Rufino Dominguez said in a statement Wed 8 Feb 2012 that nearly all of the patients had been treated and released.

[There is not enough information in the posting to easily assess the etiology of this rather large outbreak of foodborne illness. In general, in addition to the food ingested, the incubation period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, what symptoms are present, including the presence or absence of fever, and the length of illness are useful in this regard. In what sounds like a short-incubation, short-lived disease process associated with eggs (and perhaps mayonnaise), a staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated link is likely.

Classical enteric disease due to _S. aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting, usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070015.htm:

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed and used successfully to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL]
