State veterinarians are investigating a possible outbreak of African
Horse Sickness (AHS) in Mpumalanga. They have confirmed that 2 wild
horses at Kaapsehoop have died of AHS.
"When speaking to private vets we found that a number of cases
they've treated have also been linked to AHS," said provincial chief
director of veterinary services, Dr Paul Kloeck.
Local tour operators and foresters have reported more deaths in the
mountains around Kaapsehoop, which is home to one of South Africa's
few wild horse populations and is a popular draw card for both local
and international tourists. The horses are the descendants of horses
used during the gold mining era over a century ago.
AHS starts as a fever and then attacks the animal's lungs, eventually
causing it to suffocate to death. The horse may also develop swelling
around the eyes and eyelids, cheeks, lips tongue, neck and shoulders.
There is a vaccine, but Dr Kloeck said it would be difficult to
capture and vaccinate the wild horses. "We can only urge horse owners
to vaccinate their horses and keep them locked indoors at night," he said.
Dr Kloeck attributed the emergence of the disease to heavy rainfall
and humidity in the Lowveld, which increased the number of insects
called culicoides midges that spread the disease.
"Mpumalanga records about 10 AHS cases annually. The rains and humid
weather are suitable for culicoides midges which pass on the disease
to horses," said Dr Kloeck.
He said most cases were reported in February 2006 but that the
prolonged rains meant there could be more cases until June. "We
expect the cases to increase until June when it starts cooling down
and the midges start dying off," said Dr Kloeck.
He said although donkeys and zebras could also contract the disease,
they did not die from it. "This disease only kills horses and cannot
be transmitted to humans," said Dr Kloeck.
He urged that all suspicious cases be immediately reported to a
veterinarian as if left untreated, there was a 95 percent chance the
animal would die.

[The province of Mpumalanga is in northeastern South Africa and
contains 5 game and conservation parks, including the famed Kruger
National Park. Maps and locations of countries surrounding South
Africa as well as the situation of Mpumalanga within South Africa may

The causative agent for African Horse Sickness (AHS) is a
viscerotropic virus, family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus.
AHS is regarded as endemic in the central tropical regions of Africa.
However, the disease has made its way out of the region, appearing in
the Near and Middle East, Spain, and Portugal.
AHS spreads rapidly, with an incubation period as short as 2 days,
but often as long as 7- 14 days. Generally animals have a sub-acute
fever and malaise that often allow the disease to go unnoticed. The
subacute form is sometimes referred to as the cardiac form, producing
high fevers and astounding swellings of the supraorbital fossa (the
depression normally above a horse's eye protrudes dramatically) and
the eyelids, the thorax region and shoulders. The animals usually
succumb within a week.
There is also a respiratory form producing fever, dyspnea, and
coughing. The nostrils are dilated and frothy foam oozes from the
nostrils. The conjunctiva is very red. The animal is focused on
breathing and death is often attributed to anorexia.
A mixed form of these may occur, producing more mild respiratory
signs that do not appear to progress. There is still edematous
swelling and effusions. Death is usually within a week from cardiac
failure. Often the cardiac form is present and is suddenly followed
by the pulmonary form and sudden worsening of the animal's condition.
Lesions are consistent with the clinical signs, consisting of
respiratory edema of the lungs, hydropericardium, petechial
hemorrhages within the pericardium, myocarditis, gelatinous edema
within the neck and thoracic region, pleural effusion, and
hemorrhagic gastritis.

Approximately 70-95 percent of all horses developing the disease will
die, yet the mortality percentage for mules is only about 50 percent
and only 10 percent in donkeys.
Generally it is transmitted by _Culicoides_ spp. midges and not
considered to be directly transmitted. Occasionally it appears to be
transmitted by several species of mosquitoes, including _Culex_,
_Anopheles_, _Aedes spp_ and by the ticks _Hyalomma_ and _Rhipicephalus_.
This particular virus favors warmer conditions, when it has a
preferred vector available. It may move best in moist, mild
conditions and travel long distances on the wind-borne vectors.
Infected horses remain viremic for approximately 18 days, although
the fever may be present for another 4 to 8 days, if the animal
should live that long. Despite their reduced mortality, the viremic
stage in donkeys may last for up to 28 days. Zebras appear to be very
similar to donkeys in this regard.
Differential diagnosis should include anthrax, trypanosomiasis,
piroplasmosis, purpura hemorrhagica, equine infectious anemia, and
equine viral arteritis. However, supraorbital edema is not often seen
in other diseases on the differential list. The most prevalent form
of the virus may dictate if the supraorbital edema is present.
The virus may be isolated for identification with ELISA or PCR;
however, there is no effective treatment. However, there is
prevention with several types of vaccine, from monovalent to
polyvalent. And certainly elimination of vector exposure is an aid in
control. - Mod.TG]
