African Swine Fever in Russia, January, 2011: Preliminary Outbreak Assessment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
The Russia Authorities have informed the European
Union of a suspected case of African Swine Fever
[ASF] in Leningrad region (St Petersburg), near
the EU border (European Union, 2011; see map
[available at the above URL]). Disease has been
preliminarily confirmed by laboratory tests
following recovery of pig carcases from a poultry
manure farm. Control measures and investigations
into the source of the disease are underway.

2. Situation Assessment
According to the report, samples were taken from
dead pigs which had been dumped at a poultry
manure storage site "Poultry Russian Vysotskaya"
in Lomonosov district just over 30km from St
Petersburg and ~100km from the EU border with
Estonia. It is not known where the pigs
originated. There are several possible sources of
infection: the pigs were illegally moved from
currently affected areas in the Caucasus (or
other infected region); local pigs were in
contact with infectious material illegally
brought to the region from an infected area;
underlying infection has been circulating
undetected in the region and the disease is more
widespread than thought [with special attention
to the wild boar population. - Mod.AS].

In September 2009 a single outbreak was detected
in the same region, following illegal movement of
infectious material from the affected regions in
the Caucasus [see archived 20091020.3611,
20091027.3720] The outbreak was quickly stamped
out and surveillance revealed no further spread.
This recent outbreak is concerning as it could
indicate a wider problem not only in disease
distribution but also in biosecurity and
compliance with disease reporting. The proximity
of the location of the pig carcases to St
Petersburg and the St Petersburg ports (one of
the busiest Russian port complexes, handling one
quarter of all foreign trade cargoes) as well as
to the EU border is concerning. This has led the
EU to highlight the requirement for vehicles
transporting pigs to and from Russia into the EU to be adequately disinfected.

However, we would also like highlight that any
transport for other trade goods coming through an
infected region could potentially carry
infectious material if not disinfected, whether
by road or by ship. The poultry farm concerned is
part of one of the largest agricultural groups in
Russia which produces grains and sunflower oil,
baked goods, poultry products and concentrated
feed with agricultural and processing enterprises
in several regions of Russia.

Russia is not on the EU list of approved
countries for imports of live pigs, pig meat or
pig products for either commercial or personal use.

ASF cannot be easily distinguished from CSF on
the basis of clinical signs alone. Diagnostic
capabilities exist in the UK to screen any
suspected cases for both infections. There is no
vaccine available and the disease once
established is very difficult to control.

3. Conclusions
We currently consider the likelihood of
introduction by legal trade in susceptible
livestock or products would be negligible as the
EU (and UK) rules prohibit imports of such trade from Russia.

However this outbreak may have increased the
overall low level of risk of the disease
introduction into EU and UK by other possible
pathways, given that the disease has been
reported in an area in close proximity to the EU
border and with clear transport links.

The risk posed by illegal imports remains
difficult to estimate and emphasises the
importance of appropriate disposal of
international catering waste and vigilance at international borders.

This outbreak highlights the importance of
maintaining strict biosecurity measures at pig
farms, the legislative requirement for cleansing
and disinfection of animal transport, prompt
reporting of suspected cases and the current
prohibition of swill feeding in the UK (and the EU).

[Spatial spread of ASF by means of wild boars
deserves to be put high on the alert list.
Estonia's wild boar population is relatively
dense: their number estimated to be a 5-digit
figure. An Internet search will produce various
wildlife hunting sites ("Come to Estonia for a
really thrilling trophy hunt for wild boar"), and
many hunting enterprises in Russia ("There is no
better place to hunt for a wild boar trophy than
Russia"). This means a hazardous potential of
international hunted game movement.

reported from Russia since Sep 2009, is available at
