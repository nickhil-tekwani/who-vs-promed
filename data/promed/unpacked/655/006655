An outbreak of salmonellosis made 85 workers at a Ukrainian poultry
processing plant ill, the Interfax news agency reported on Wed 4 Jul
2007. The infection took place at the Ptisifabrika Mirnovska chicken
meat factory, in Ukraine's central Cherkassy region.
At least 10 workers affected by the illness were listed in moderate
condition at a regional hospital. The other 75 were reportedly
suffering from a less serious disease, and all were expected to
recover.
Company management investigating the incident blamed omelettes or
pork meat patties served at the plant cafeteria, as the most likely
cause. Health authorities were monitoring closely chicken meat
produced by the factory, and as yet had not found the source, a
Ministry of Emergency Situations official said.
Poultry processing is big business in Ukraine, due to the size of the
market, Ukrainians' love of inexpensive meat products, and the low
local costs of labor and feed needed to manufacture chicken meat.
Public [confidence] over the safety of Ukrainian-produced chicken
has, nonetheless, suffered repeated scares in recent years due to
news reports of shoddy health safety practices by some processors.

[A significant cluster of salmonellosis in a poultry factory
certainly suggests a food-borne source rather than direct contact
with contaminated poultry or eggs, but not enough epidemiologic
information is available.
