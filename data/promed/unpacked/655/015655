[The disease has not been reported to OIE since 2005. The fact that
clinical signs are mild is a bit unexpected, if this is indeed a new
incursion of foot and mouth disease in a country that has not seen
the disease in several years, but the fact that vaccine is being used
to control the disease may explain the current situation, and spread
may be minimal.

The location of the outbreaks is near Tripoli and can be seen on the
map appended to the report referenced above or on the HealthMap
alert. - Mod.PC]
