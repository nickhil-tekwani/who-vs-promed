Deadly virus
------------
Medical examinations have determined that 8 other Chinese sailors
have the deadly virus, but have not developed any illness. The cook,
aged 40, and a crewmember of the vessel, aged 38, died on 9 Apr 2008,
after suffering high fevers for hours. No medication was able to stop
the progression of the disease.

Experts of the Forensic Medicine Institute of Public Prosecutions
[IML] have determined that the cause of death was an adenovirus that
has become extremely deadly.

Adenoviruses are spread by physical contact or through the air and
are one of the causes of the common flu, but were not considered
fatal. At least, not so far.

The virus that causes severe acute respiratory [syndrome], an
atypical pneumonia that first appeared in November 2002 in Guangdong
Province, China, has been ruled out.

The head of the IML, Luis Bromley Coloma, indicated that "we are
facing an adenovirus that has mutated and become deadly, but it is
still unknown what caused the mutation and how fast it can spread",
which is why an Epidemiological Alert has been declared.

The autopsy performed on the 2 victims hurled death, multiorgan edema
in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, and kidneys, and
microhemorrhages in all organs. Toxicological, biological, and
pathological tests performed revealed the presence of the mutated
adenovirus.

Now, health authorities are working to establish where and what
generated the mutation to find a cure or a way to contain it.

"Chan An 168" is a squid and shrimp fishing vessel that sailed from
the port of Yautay, China, on 19 Aug 2007 with 23 people on board.
Since then they have not had contact with dry land. On 13 Dec 2007 it
delivered its catch to another boat and received 2 other crewmembers.
The same happened on 15 Mar 2008.

On 9 Apr 2008, the port captaincy of Callao received a distress call
from the captain of the "Chan An". That morning 2 Chinese crewmembers
-- the cook and a fisherman -- had died. The only symptom was a high
fever lasting from 2-5 hours; none of the medicines on board helped.

Unfortunately, the Navy and International Maritime Health personnel
boarded the Chinese ship to provide the care they needed, without
taking the precautions needed to avoid contagion, hence it has been
decided to quarantine them. The disease can manifest itself in 14
days to 3 months.

Specialists from the IML, and epidemiologists from the Ministry of
Defense, the Navy, and the Ministry of Health, met yesterday 19 Apr
2008] to assess the results of the biological and pathological
examinations in order to take the necessary preventive measures to
avoid spread of the virus.

"The autopsies carried out indicate that the 2 Chinese crewmembers
died from pneumonia resulting from an adenovirus, a cause of the flu
that is not usually fatal. What happened in this case is that the
virus has mutated and become deadly, and we are on an epidemiological
alert,'' the head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Luis
Bromley, said yesterday [19 Apr 2008].

The specialist added that this outbreak has 2 characteristics: the
victims are people with weakened immune systems, having been almost a
year at sea, isolated and living in subhuman conditions. The other
factor is still being studied -- still unknown are the cause that led
to the mutation and how to fight it.

"The entire crew has been evaluated and it has been found that 8
crewmembers are infected with the mutated adenovirus and are under
observation; they can not be treated, because we do not know how to
fight this virus," stressed Bromley.

It has been arranged for 30 Peruvian people who have been to the ship
to provide help and have come into contact with patients remain under
epidemiological surveillance, isolated, and without contact with
their families until the deadly disease has been ruled out. In these
cases ''security measures may sound extreme, but prevention is better
than later to have to bear the consequences if nothing was done,"
asserted emphatically the head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine.

[The identification of a 'mutated' adenovirus as the suspected cause
of the deaths of members of the crew of a Chinese fishing vessel
anchored off Callao is surprising. Adenoviruses are ubiquitous
viruses that can be isolated from both sick and healthy individuals.
Antibodies can be detected in virtually all humans, indicative of
infection early in childhood and possible life-long persistence in
adenoid and lung tissue. Morbidity and mortality associated with
adenovirus infection are low, but adenovirus-associated respiratory
and gastrointestinal disease can be serious especially in
immunologically compromised patients.

There are at east 170 serotypes of adenoviruses, about 50 of which
have been isolated from human sources. The designation 'mutant' or
'mutated' adenovirus is meaningful only in the sense that the
adenovirus recovered from the affected individuals is associated with
signs and symptoms not usually encountered in adenovirus infections.
An adenovirus, however, cannot be excluded as the potential etiologic
agent, particularly as the description of living conditions on board
the fishing vessel suggest that the resistance of the crew to any
infectious agent may have been very low. Information of the condition
of the other crewmembers and those in quarantine will be relevant in
confirming the diagnosis. - Mod.CP]

Callao is located west of Lima, the country's capital, and is part of
the Lima Metropolitan Area. - Mod.CP

Given the long time since the vessel left China, the disease was mostb
likely introduced by one of the new crew members who went aboard in
March 2008 (we are not told whether the fatal cases were those same
2). The adenovirus type is not stated, but the ProMED reader who
contributed this report has suggested that it could be type 14, which
has a 20 percent mortality rate -- see ProMED post Adenovirus
14-associated pneumonia - USA (OR) 20071010.3334. I quote Mod CP's
comment on that report: "Human adenovirus 14 has not previously been
regularly associated with human respiratory disease. It is perhaps too
soon to designate human adenovirus 14-associated pneumonia as an
emerging disease rather than perhaps a co-factor in an unusual disease
situation." Given the prevalence of adenovirus antibody in the
general population, could the finding of the virus in the fatal cases
be merely a co-factor, or even a coincidence, with the actual etiology
of the fatal cases being some other micro-organism? - Mod.JW]
