New fish parasite puzzles pathologists
--------------------------------------
Scientists recently identified a new perch-parasite found in Minnesota's
Leech Lake and Wisconsin's Eagle Chain of Lakes. But they can't yet say
whether it's dangerous to human health, perch or aquatic ecosystems. The
microscopic parasite, discovered in angler-caught perch in the fall of
1999, turns the fish fillet an opaque white and can only be seen when the
fish is filleted. A healthy perch fillet is translucent.
"The infected perch look normal until you fillet them out," said Joe
Marino, who manages the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
pathology laboratory. "But then you can see these white patches on the
fillet, which looks like it has been cooked."
Though the new parasite looks similar to harmless parasites commonly found
in perch and other fish species, Marcino and health specialists from the
Wisconsin DNR were unable to positively identify it. They sent samples to
an expert in the Czech Republic, who believed them to be of the genus
_Hetersporis_, a parasite that has only been reported in fish from Germany,
France, Japan and Taiwan. "It appears this is the first time the parasite
has shown up in North American waters," Marcino said.
Wisconsin state health officials said that the parasite is not known to
harm humans and is killed when the meat is cooked thoroughly. It is not
known if the parasite is an exotic species or is native to North America
and has only recently been discovered.
To prevent the parasite from spreading, Wisconsin health officials
recommend that infected fish or fillets should be disposed of in the
garbage or buried, but not thrown back into a lake.
So that he can learn more about the range of the parasite in Minnesota,
Marcino is urging anglers to contact him if fillets of perch, or the
closely related walleye or sauger, have opaque white portions. He can be
reached at (651) 296-3043 or joe.marcino@dnr.state.mn.us
