A delegation of the General Coordination of the Ebola Response from Goma, composed of some members of the response (Communication, Management and Safety Committees) and WHO, led by Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, Coordinator-General of the Response, came down this [Wed 4 Dec 2019] to Biakato in Ituri.
- As soon as he arrived, the Coordinator-General and his delegation went to the base of the agents of the response of the Ministry of Health and WHO, where the drama of the night of 27-28 Nov 2019 took place in order to ascertain the facts a few days after these sad incidents;
- He then had a meeting with the leaders of Biakato, including chief chieftain Babila Babombi, 2 Mambasa elected deputies, biker presidents, youth and several other local associations. During this meeting, these leaders advocated for the return of the response teams, not only in their community but also in Lwemba;
- This meeting was characterized by the exchange and sharing of strategies to strengthen community engagement and safety nets through community alerts;
- Several recommendations were made at the end of this meeting, the strongest being the recruitment of 80% of the premises in the response to Biakato and Lwemba;
- Ebola Epidemic Response Coordinator, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke reassured the Biakato leaders that the response teams are ready to return, and as this return is desired by the community, the coordination will return gradually.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 5 Dec 2019. WHO: Disease Outbreak News
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-december-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Nine new confirmed cases were reported from [27 Nov to 3 Dec 2019] in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from Mandima (56%, n = 5) and Mabalako (44%, n = 4) health zones.

In the past 2 weeks, violence, widespread civil unrest, and targeted attacks have severely disrupted the Ebola response and restricted access to affected communities in multiple locations. As a result, several key activities of the response experienced diminished performance, including the volume of reported and investigated alerts and the number of contacts registered and followed [see Figs. 1 and 2 at source URL]. The volume of alerts from health zones affected by insecurity is lower than usual, and this has led to an overall reduction in the average number of alerts reported in the last 7 days. Of the 3346 alerts reported, 96% were investigated within 24 hours.

The overall average percentage of contacts under surveillance in the last 7 days is 70%, which is below the average for November [2019] prior to these security events (Fig. 2). This is due mainly to performance being suboptimal in some areas of Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha health zones, with only 82% of contacts followed in Beni, 68% in Mabalako, and 42% in Oicha. These numbers are improving slowly since the events, but fluctuations illustrate the continued impact that security events have on response activities.

In the past 21 days [13 Nov to 3 Dec 2019], 22 confirmed cases were reported from 10 of the 71 health areas within 4 neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces [see Fig. 3 and Table 1 at source URL]: Mabalako (55%, n = 12), Mandima (27%, n = 6), Beni (9%, n = 2), and Oicha (9%, n = 2). The majority of the cases (91%, n = 20) are linked to known chains of transmission. In the past 21 days, a higher proportion of cases (31%, n = 8) have reported a funeral as their potential exposure to EVD compared with the average since January 2019 (7%); this is because of 2 separate community clusters in the health areas of Lwemba (6 cases) and Bingo (2 cases) linked to the burials of 2 probable cases.

As of 3 Dec 2019, a total of 3313 EVD cases were reported [see Fig. 4 at source URL], including 3195 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2207 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n = 1866) were female, 28% (n = 936) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n = 163) were health workers.

- Thu 5 Dec 2019. Gavi to create, fund Ebola vaccine stockpile
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/gavi-create-fund-ebola-vaccine-stockpile
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, today [5 Dec 2019] announced that it will create and fund an emergency Ebola vaccine stockpile, part of efforts meant to streamline the response to the next outbreak, as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 5 new cases in the current outbreak.

The stockpiling plan was approved by Gavi's board, which met this week in New Delhi, India. In the middle of November [2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified Merck's Ebola vaccine, VSV-EBOV, which came just a day after full approval by the European Commission. The WHO's action paved the way for United Nations agencies and Gavi to buy vaccine for stockpiling, and Gavi had signaled that it would take the issue up as part of long-term Ebola vaccine program at its December [meeting].

Gavi said it will open a new funding window with an investment of USD 178 million between now and 2025, which will allow low- and middle-income countries to get the vaccine free of charge. The stockpile will include 500 000 doses, the number recommended by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunizations.

In an announcement today [5 Dec 2019], Gavi's chief executive officer Seth Berkley, MD, said the Ebola vaccine has been extraordinarily effective in tackling the DRC's outbreak, and the stockpiling plan demonstrates the Alliance at its best.

"Now that funding has been approved, we will get to work with manufacturers and our Alliance partners to build the stockpile," he said. "It will be critical for Gavi to secure enough funding for the 2021-2025 period to maintain this Ebola vaccine programme in order to protect people, health systems and economies that may be threatened by this devastating disease in the future."

Among the other elements of the stockpiling plan, lower income countries that need to tap the supply will also receive support for operating immunization campaigns. Wealthier countries will be able to access the stockpile but will self-finance their supply. Gavi also said it would support preventive vaccination outside of outbreak settings of high-risk populations, such as health workers in at-risk countries, based on future recommendations from the WHO's SAGE group.

A coordination mechanism of partner organizations will be set up to decide how and when the vaccine stockpile will be deployed.

In response to today's [5 Dec 2019] Gavi announcement, Jason Nickerson, PhD, humanitarian advisor with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), in a statement sent to journalists said the move is a positive step. He said an international coordinating group that will help manage the Ebola vaccine supply already manages emergency stockpiles of meningitis, cholera, and yellow fever vaccines.

He emphasized that the VSV-EBOV was developed by a public and philanthropic collaboration, not by Merck alone. "MSF calls for a thorough, independent, and transparent estimate of the costs of manufacturing the vaccine, to ensure that the price paid is fair and reasonable," he said.

MSF also called for complete transparency regarding the Ebola vaccine stockpile and said there's an urgent need to have a mechanism in place to pool national stockpiles when and if needed for future Ebola outbreaks.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said in its daily report for yesterday [4 Dec 2019] that Ebola response activities are still at a standstill in Beni, Mangina, and Biakato due to recent security issues. It said health officials, including some from the WHO, visited Biakato yesterday to assess conditions and meet with community leaders about the deadly attacks against Ebola responders.

DRC health officials assured the community that response teams will return gradually, with teams likely to work in the area during daylight hours and return to their homes at night, until security improves and the community's confidence is restored.

Ebola response still impeded in wake of violent attacks: The World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows no new cases today [4 Dec 2019], a sign the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is still hindered after violent attacks in Biakato Mines and Mangina last week that caused workers to retreat from the outbreak's hot spots.

In the latest situation report on the outbreak, the WHO's African regional office said the targeted attacks have severely restricted access to affected communities in multiple locations.

"As seen previously during this outbreak, such disruptions limit contact tracing, surveillance, and vaccination efforts, and they may result in increased transmission," the WHO said. "Following insecurity, the volume of reported daily alerts from healthcare facilities and the community dropped in Beni in the 6-day period from [23-28 Nov 2019] from approximately 400 per day to approximately 170."

From [25 Nov to 1 Dec 2019], the WHO tracked 10 new cases of the deadly virus, half from Mabalako and half from Mandima.

In a promising development, the WHO's regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, MD, announced on Twitter today [4 Dec 2019] that Butembo, a former hot spot, has gone 42 days without a new Ebola case.

- Thu 5 Dec 2019. Japan: vaccine
[Kyodo News, abridged, edited]
https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/12/683541510b4b-1st-ebola-vaccine-clinical-study-in-japan-to-begin-this-month.html

A team of University of Tokyo researchers said Thursday [5 Dec 2019] it will begin a clinical study later this month on a vaccine for the Ebola virus, a 1st in Japan, with the vaccine developed using an artificially produced detoxified virus.

The new vaccine developed by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor at the university's Institute of Medical Science, and others is believed to have fewer side effects compared with those produced abroad, according to the institute.

The researchers said they aim to develop the Ebola vaccine to prevent further outbreaks of the deadly hemorrhagic fever in Africa.

The clinical study will be conducted by the team led by professor Hiroshi Yotsuyanagi at the hospital affiliated with the institute. Thirty healthy adult men are set to receive intramuscular injections of the vaccine and will be checked for fevers as well as the development of antibodies. They will then be monitored for about 6 months to determine the vaccine's safety.

Kawaoka developed the new vaccine using an inactivated Ebola virus that cannot replicate in normal cells. It was proven both safe and effective in tests involving monkeys.

Although possession of the Ebola virus is strictly regulated in Japan, artificially produced viruses are not.

Two major American pharmaceutical companies have also developed Ebola vaccines, with vaccinations underway on the African continent.

Over 10 000 people died in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 in an Ebola epidemic, while approximately 2200 people have died since last year [2018] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire.

The Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with body fluids, such as the blood and excrement, of infected people.

- Mon 2 Dec 2019. Therapeutics
[Science Magazine, abridged, edited]
https://scienmag.com/investigational-drugs-reduce-risk-of-death-from-ebola-virus-disease/

The investigational therapeutics mAb114 and REGN-EB3 offer patients a greater chance of surviving Ebola virus disease (EVD) compared with the investigational treatment ZMapp, according to published results from a clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The new report also shows that early diagnosis and treatment are associated with an increased likelihood of survival from EVD. The results appear online this week in The New England Journal of Medicine [see below]. An announcement made on 12 Aug 2019, noted that the study leaders halted the trial early, on 9 Aug 2019, as recommended by an independent data and safety monitoring board based on its review of preliminary data from 499 study patients. The preliminary analysis found that both mAb114 and REGN-EB3 performed better than ZMapp. The 4th drug, remdesivir, performed similarly to ZMapp. Today's [2 Dec 2019] publication provides a comprehensive analysis of the full dataset from nearly 200 additional patients enrolled in the clinical study.

The clinical trial known as PALM, short for "Pamoja Tulinde Maisha," a Kiswahili phrase that translates to "together save lives," was organized by an international research consortium coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is led and funded by the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) and Ministry of Health, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health. Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, MD, PhD, director-general of the INRB and head of the DRC's Ebola response, and Richard T. Davey, Jr, MD, deputy director of NIAID's Division of Clinical Research, are co-principal investigators for the study.

"Response teams have faced unprecedented challenges in ongoing efforts to save lives and control the outbreak of Ebola in a highly insecure region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD. "Although effective treatments alone will not end this outbreak, the PALM study findings identify the 1st efficacious treatments for Ebola virus disease and therefore mark a significant step forward in improving care for Ebola patients. We thank the study team for their extraordinary efforts to conduct this landmark trial."

The study enrolled 681 people with Ebola virus disease between November 2018 and August 2019 at 4 Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in the cities of Beni, Butembo, Katwa and Mangina. Staff from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), International Medical Corps (IMC), Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the DRC Ministry of Health implemented the trial at the ETCs with support from Congolese staff, the World Health Organization, the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research and The Mitchell Group.

The study was designed to compare mortality among patients who received 1 of 3 investigational Ebola drugs with that from a control group of patients who received the investigational monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp, developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. The other therapies were mAb114, a single monoclonal antibody product developed for clinical use by NIAID's Vaccine Research Center and the INRB and licensed to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Mapp Biopharmaceutical; REGN-EB3, a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, also has provided support for the development of REGN-EB3, ZMapp and mAb114.

The 4 therapies are administered as intravenous infusions. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 are administered as single infusions, and ZMapp and remdesivir are administered as infusions over multiple days. Study participants also received optimized supportive care, including oral and/or intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, monitoring of oxygen levels and blood pressure (with supportive measures as needed), blood transfusions, pain management, and antibiotics and antimalarials as indicated.

The final analysis included 673 participants. The trial began in November 2018 with randomized administration of remdesivir, mAb114 and ZMapp, and the protocol was amended to include REGN-EB3 in January 2019. As a result, the number of outcomes included in the ZMapp comparator group was slightly different for the initial arms (remdesivir and mAb114) relative to the number of outcomes in the ZMapp comparator group for REGN-EB3, based on time of enrollment. Overall mortality was 50% (84 of 169) in all patients treated with ZMapp and 51% (79 of 154) in patients who received ZMapp during the time that REGN-EB3 was included as another trial arm. Mortality rates were lower for mAb114 and REGN-EB3 compared with their respective ZMapp cohorts: 35% (61 of 174) of patients in the mAb114 treatment group and 34% (52 of 155) of patients in the REGN-EB3 group died by 28 days post-treatment. The mortality rate in the remdesivir treatment group, 53% (93 of 175), was similar to ZMapp.

Overall, mortality rates were lower in patients who had less virus in their blood at the time of enrollment (19% overall, with 10% for mAb114, 11% for REGN-EB3, 29% for remdesivir and 25% for ZMapp overall). Mortality rates were higher in patients with more virus in their blood at the time of enrollment (76% overall, 70% for mAb114, 64% for REGN-EB3, 86% for remdesivir and 85% for ZMapp). The analysis also showed that patients receiving either mAb114 or REGN-EB3 cleared the virus from their blood more quickly than participants receiving ZMapp.

Abstract
---------
Background. Although several experimental therapeutics for Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been developed, the safety and efficacy of the most promising therapies need to be assessed in the context of a randomized, controlled trial.

Methods. We conducted a trial of 4 investigational therapies for EVD in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak began in August 2018. Patients of any age who had a positive result for Ebola virus RNA on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were enrolled. All patients received standard care and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to intravenous administration of the triple monoclonal antibody ZMapp (the control group), the antiviral agent remdesivir, the single monoclonal antibody MAb114, or the triple monoclonal antibody REGN-EB3. The REGN-EB3 group was added in a later version of the protocol, so data from these patients were compared with those of patients in the ZMapp group who were enrolled at or after the time the REGN-EB3 group was added (the ZMapp subgroup). The primary end point was death at 28 days.

Results. A total of 681 patients were enrolled from [20 Nov 2018] to [9 Aug 2019], at which time the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients be assigned only to the MAb114 and REGN-EB3 groups for the remainder of the trial; the recommendation was based on the results of an interim analysis that showed superiority of these groups to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 61 of 174 patients (35.1%) in the MAb114 group, as compared with 84 of 169 (49.7%) in the ZMapp group (P = 0.007), and in 52 of 155 (33.5%) in the REGN-EB3 group, as compared with 79 of 154 (51.3%) in the ZMapp subgroup (P = 0.002). A shorter duration of symptoms before admission and lower baseline values for viral load and for serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels each correlated with improved survival. Four serious adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the trial drugs.

Conclusions. Both MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to ZMapp in reducing mortality from EVD. Scientifically and ethically sound clinical research can be conducted during disease outbreaks and can help inform the outbreak response.

- Tue 3 Dec 2019. Humanitarian aid
[Government Europa, abridged, edited]
https://www.governmenteuropa.eu/congo-ebola-outbreak/95639/

The European Commission has announced it will distribute EUR 50 million (USD 55 million) in funding to support vulnerable communities affected by the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

EUR 40 million (USD 44 million) of the funding will be allocated towards improving access to free healthcare for Congolese residents, in particular those suffering from malnutrition and residents of areas hit by the spread of Ebola. A further EUR 10 million (USD 11 million) will go towards supporting efforts to address the food security crisis affecting the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the Ebola outbreak was initially declared in 2018, the EU has issued EUR 47 million (USD 52 million) in humanitarian support, enabling residents to access food and clean water, healthcare services and social protection, as well as working with local communities to halt the spread of Ebola. In November 2019, the European Commission granted market authorisation for an Ebola vaccine.

Janez Lenarcic, Commissioner for Crisis Management, said: "The EU is supporting international efforts to tackle Ebola at all levels, from humanitarian assistance to strengthening the resilience of the national health system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We need to remain vigilant and do all we can to bring this outbreak to an end."

Alongside its financial commitments, the EU is sharing its expertise and resources with the crisis-hit region, making its ECHO Flight humanitarian air service available, providing training in medical evacuations under its Civil Protection Mechanism, as well as offering long-term structural support for the Democratic Republic of Congo's healthcare system.

Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen said: "The Ebola epidemic in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, along with the food security crisis, [is] worsening the humanitarian situation. We are stepping up our support to respond to the basic needs of the population. Our new EUR 50 million support will increase access to healthcare, improve nutrition status of families, especially children, and access to clean water."

- Tue 3 Dec 2019. Communication
[The New Humanitarian, abridged, edited]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2019/12/03/ebola-epidemic-Congo-language-communication
[Byline: Mia Marzotto]

Cas suspect or "suspected case" is just one example of a problematic term used in French across the Ebola response. In a highly multilingual context, local residents might interpret it literally as someone with the symptoms of Ebola who is a bad person ("suspect") with little worth (cas sounds like ka, a diminutive in the local Nande language).

Fifteen months into the Democratic Republic of Congo's latest Ebola outbreak, we are still asking people to overcome the fear of an indiscriminate disease and accept an intimidating medical process while communicating in a way that often creates confusion and frustration.

People long for information in a language they are familiar with. And they want to communicate with positive messages about the "last mile to zero" as the number of cases dwindles. As a humanitarian community, we should and can do this.

The good news is that there's growing recognition about the importance of engaging with communities in the languages they speak and understand. The current response plan includes greater focus on community engagement, recognising that 2-way communication fills a vital lifesaving function. A number of organisations are making a concerted effort to source response teams locally with the right language skills. Responders are also engaging with local media to ensure key messages are shared in accessible languages and formats.

Yet, we are still failing to systematically take into account the languages that people speak and understand, and their communication needs and preferences. This makes it much harder for responders to listen, understand, and provide trustworthy information and services to help people protect themselves and their families from the disease.

Research by the UK-based Social Sciences Research Group shows that responders are perceived as outsiders who speak different languages and don't understand the local communication dynamics. When they are not adapted to local language use and literacy levels, the existing communication materials on the risks of contracting Ebola are not fully understood.

This disproportionately affects women and older men and marginalised language speakers. These groups may have had fewer educational opportunities and be less likely to speak or read the official national languages.

Health communicators also often fail to understand the vital information they are expected to relay and carry the burden of translating this information into local languages unsupported. More recently, Translators without Borders found that people in Beni -- the epicentre of the outbreak -- report improved knowledge of Ebola. However, many people still don't have clear answers to their questions about the disease in a language they are comfortable in.

Ebola-specific terms like EDS ("safe and dignified burial") and "swab" are in French or English and are not consistently translated and explained in local languages. People consider many of these terms inappropriate, and some react negatively to them.

Health communicators soften them by explaining and replacing key terms with descriptions that are not always accurate. This creates confusion and frustration for both community members and health communicators. It also breeds fear as many words like "suspect" and vainqueur ("victor") are associated with ideas of criminality and violence.

Current and future efforts to control the spread of Ebola will be more effective if responders actively address language and communication issues.

What tangible actions can organisations take to get language right in the Ebola response in eastern Congo? First, we need to proactively remedy the mistrust created by communicating poorly. Responding organisations should routinely collect data on the languages and formats local communities prefer, and act on it. Communication materials should also be field-tested to ensure they meet the needs of the people who use them.

Second, we need to limit the use of jargon and words with negative connotations. Responders should work with communities to promote the use of accurate, unambiguous, and less stigmatising words, in the languages people speak and understand. While the use of violent words might be well intentioned, we need to further explore the use of language that respects and empowers people, in all communication channels, including the media.

Third, we need to better train and equip field teams. Regular training and updated communication materials can support them to relay accurate and up-to-date information in plain accessible language.

While such initiatives might appear marginal, their impact can be significant. During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a similar shift toward communication in the relevant local languages was critical to ending the epidemic.

Prioritising simple content communicated in local languages through trusted sources helped responders and communities alike implement effective strategies to support sick people and prevent transmission. Unless we adapt our communications to the needs and preferences of those affected by Ebola, the last mile in eastern Congo could be a very long one.

[This is an important article about language barriers. Communication between different cultures is always difficult, even without the added fear of a deadly disease affecting one's perception. In some situations, the guidelines are clear, such as those for safe and dignified burials, and can be communicated in direct simple language through leading community members to the community as a whole. In other cases, the guidelines are less clear, such as when is it safe to have sex after being considered cured. Since the implication of persistent RNA is not entirely clear, i.e., can there be transmission in the absence of detectable infectious virus but with RNA evident, communication of what is known using clear language becomes critical. - Mod.LK]

[4] Unrest
- Tue 3 Dec 2019. Anger
[Bloomberg News, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Michael J. Kavanagh]

Protests against United Nations peacekeepers and national security forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo's northeast for their failure to halt ongoing violence left several people dead in a region struggling to contain the 2nd-worst Ebola outbreak in history.

Demonstrators in the town of Beni have burned government buildings and attacked UN peacekeepers since last week, following a series of massacres by armed groups that left dozens dead. A Congolese policeman and 3 protesters died Monday [2 Dec 2019] during further clashes, according to UN sources. Police arrested about 30 protesters, including several members of local armed groups.

After a weekend visiting the region, the UN top official for peacekeeping operations urged Congolese to not mistake the UN for their enemy. "Those who are the enemy are the groups that attack and kill the population," Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said Monday [2 Dec 2019] in Kinshasa, Congo's capital. "I say this without ignoring the frustration, sadness and anguish of the population in the region, because it is real."

The unrest is hindering efforts to eradicate the Ebola epidemic, Lacroix said. Four Congolese nationals working on the Ebola response were killed and 5 others injured in 2 attacks by armed groups last week, according to the World Health Organization. Some staff have been evacuated from the region.

More than 1000 people have been killed around Beni in the past 5 years, with the government blaming most of the killings on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist rebel group founded in neighboring Uganda in the 1990s. Violence in the region has increased since late October [2019], when the Congolese army launched a military offensive against the ADF.

UN experts and researchers say other militias and senior Congolese army officers have also been involved in planning and carrying out assaults. More than 100 armed groups are active in eastern Congo and more than a dozen operate around Beni. Sometimes small gangs with machetes hack villagers to death and steal their belongings.

The uptick in violence has led to calls for UN peacekeepers to leave Congo after 20 years. The force, once the UN's largest, will be reduced to about 13 000 troops in January [2020]. The UN has sent reinforcements to Beni, where there are [fewer] than 1000 peacekeepers and military police, Mathias Gillmann, acting spokesman for the UN mission in Congo, said by phone on Tuesday [3 Dec 2019].

"We're facing a system that's founded on asymmetric warfare, with people who are flexible and who hide in the thick jungle," Lacroix said. "There's not a simple, military response that consists of saying, 'let's go, do a few robust offensives and all will be solved.'"

- Mon 2 Dec 2019. Attacks
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy), abridged, edited]

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Ebola response efforts in both Biakato Mines and Mangina in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been halted in the wake of 2 violent attacks late last week that left 4 people dead and 6 injured. Among the dead are a vaccinator, 2 response taxi drivers, and a police officer.

The attacks took place the night of [27 Nov 2019], when unidentified armed attackers targeted a camp housing Ebola outbreak response staff in Biakato Mines, and others attacked the Ebola coordination office in Mangina.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recent violence is part of approximately 390 attacks on health facilities that have killed 11 and injured 83 healthcare workers and patients in the DRC as the country faces the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history.

"There can be no more callous act than to target health professionals working to heal the sick and care for those in need," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, during a speech he made in Goma yesterday [1 Dec 2019]. "Every time an attack like this happens, it disrupts efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak and puts the health and wellbeing of local men, women and children at greater risk. Such senseless violence must stop."

On [28 Nov 2019], Mike Ryan, MD, WHO executive director of emergency programs, said during a press conference that all WHO staff had been removed from Biakato Mines and relocated. "Ebola was retreating and now it is likely to resurge. It will be a tragedy to see unnecessary suffering in communities," Ryan said. "There has been an increase in cases."

A total of 189 people lived and worked at the Biakato Mines response camp, Ryan said, and the attack was a deliberate assault on workers.

In the past few weeks, Ryan said the WHO has lost access to key communities in Beni, Oicha, and now Biakato Mines. These were the last strongholds of the virus, he added, the villages and cities where he expected workers would be able to stamp out the disease.

"At the moment, the interruption of outbreak response has led to a 50% drop in alerts," Ryan said, also noting that surveillance, contact tracing, and vaccination activity all declined, too.

Late last week the WHO said only one-third of its response team in Beni remains in that city, which saw violence between local military and terrorist organizations in mid-November [2019]. In nearby Oicha, attacks have resulted in only 15% of contacts under surveillance as of [26 Nov 2019].

Over the past 5 days, the DRC has reported 9 more Ebola cases, including 3 today, per the WHO's online Ebola dashboard. The outbreak total now stands at 3313 cases, including 2202 deaths.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/doctors-treating-ebola-flee-dr-congo-east-deadly-violence-191205013829630.html

The non-profit group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) pulled its foreign staff out of an eastern region of Democratic Republic of Congo after an armed group tried to enter its compound.

The group is the latest aid agency to withdraw its staff from the Biakato region, after 3 health workers treating Ebola were killed in an unclaimed attack last week at an accommodation camp in Biakato Mines in Ituri province.

That attack prompted the World Health Organization to withdraw its staff from the area.

MSF said that on Tuesday [3 Dec 2019] night a group wielding machetes and sticks broke into the Biakato Health Centre, where it operates an Ebola treatment centre. There were no casualties and the group did not enter the Ebola facility, it said.

A separate group with the same weapons then tried but failed to enter the MSF facility in Biakato Mines. The NGO said they threw stones but did not do any damage.

"Due to a deterioration in the security situation, MSF made the difficult decision to withdraw all non-local staff from the Biakato region," MSF said in a statement.

According to local authorities, the attackers from last week's incident are likely to be members of the Mai-Mai armed militia group, which is fighting for a share of the country's wealth.

On 4 Nov 2019, the authorities said more than 300 attacks on Ebola health workers had been recorded since the start of the year, leaving 6 dead and 70 wounded, some of them patients.

The United Nations Coordination for the Response to Ebola Virus Disease in the DRC, in collaboration with MONUSCO, launched [Wed 4 Dec 2019], the 1st airlift on Biakato in the territory of Mambasa (Ituri), where the epidemic is rife. Its leader, David Gressly, said this operation consists of deploying teams temporarily, by helicopter, to carry out response activities in the field to contain this disease.

"It's very important now to contain the virus, so that it does not escape (from Biakato) to make contaminations elsewhere," said David Gressly.

The decision to introduce the airlift was made following recurrent attacks by the militia, which forced all the agents in charge of the response to leave the area. Mr. Gressly also announced the deployment of the blue helmets and the FARDC to secure this area.

You can follow other details of this interview with Jean-Claude Loky Dile [go to source URL for audio file].

The facilities of the NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ebola treatment center in Biakato were attacked on the night of [Mon/Tue 2-3 Dec 2019]. There was no death, but several material damage. According to local sources, the perpetrators of these attacks are not yet identified.

All Ebola response activities had been suspended there, after the attack on the local treatment center during the night of [28-29 Nov 2019] by suspected Mai-Mai. This attack had 3 deaths and several wounded.
