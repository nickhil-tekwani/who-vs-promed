Increasing hemorrhagic disease in Western North Carolina
--------------------------------------------------------
The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission said today that state biologists are observing an increasing number of epizootic hemorrhagic disease cases in white-tailed deer in Western North Carolina, especially in Caldwell, Wilkes and Surry counties.

The disease has no effect on human health, but it is one of the most significant endemic viral and often times fatal diseases of white-tailed deer in the Southeastern U.S.

The disease is transmitted by a biting midge or gnat and the virus enters deer through the blood stream. Common symptoms of sick animals include emaciation, loss of motor control, fever, lameness, and swelling of the neck and head.

Feverish deer often seek relief near cool bodies of water, resulting in a higher frequency of dead deer near water than on adjacent uplands. Investigations of dead deer usually reveal ulcerations on the tongue, dental pad and palate of the mouth. The mouth may also be bluish in color and the skin flush or reddish, particularly noticeable on the inside of the legs and stomach.

Commission biologists 1st began seeing deer afflicted with the disease in Wilkes and Surry counties. In August [2012], reports of the disease also began coming from Caldwell, Burke, McDowell, Rutherford and Buncombe counties. The hardest hit counties are Caldwell, Surry and Wilkes.

"Most cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are diagnosed by biologists in the field based on examination of recently deceased deer or living deer that appear sick and have no other outward signs of injury," said Daniel Ray, a wildlife commission biologist. "Dead or dying deer infected with EHD are often found near rivers, streams, lakes or ponds. There are no human or domestic pet-related health concerns from this virus. None of us can get it."

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease should not be confused with Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), which is a distinctly different disease that also occurs in members of the deer family. Extensive monitoring since 1999 has yielded no evidence of CWD in North Carolina and strict regulations are in place to reduce the probability of introducing this disease.

Hemorrhagic disease is a general term for 2 distinct viruses. The virus that causes epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is not contagious to humans, dogs, cats or other domestic pets. The virus can occasionally be contracted by other ruminants such as cows and sheep; however, it typically does not cause any signs in these animals and poses no risk.

A similar, but different virus called blue tongue (BT) also affects deer and it does have effects on cows and potentially greater effects on sheep. All of the affected deer sampled in Western North Carolina to date were infected with the EHD virus. None tested positive for BT virus. The threat to cattle or sheep is negligible, according to Commission biologists.

Concerned livestock owners should consult with local veterinarians for more information.

EHD occurs somewhere in North Carolina each year, most often in the Coastal Plain region. The last major outbreak in the state was in 2007. Other notable outbreaks occurred in 1939, 1955, 1961, 1971, 1976, 1988, 1994, 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2011. In years of severe EHD outbreaks, deer mortality in some local areas was often as high as 30 percent. However, in most cases, mortality is much lower.

To report sightings of dead or dying deer, contact the Division of Wildlife Management.

Because the disease cannot spread to humans, hunters should not worry about dressing deer or eating venison. Deer that recover from an episode of EHD develop immunity to future outbreaks.

[EHD is fairly widespread in the USA. These reports are relatively common in the hot summer, especially late summer and fall prior to a frost.

EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the Southeast of USA, but they are also frequently documented further North. The disease is transmitted by biting midges and its occurrence is seasonal, from late summer to early fall. The die-offs cease with the 1st frosts. The EHD virus does not pose a risk for human or livestock health.

High density deer herds may have higher mortality rates; however, the relationship of deer density to the severity of hemorrhagic disease is not clear-cut, as the virus is not spread by direct contact and depends on the dynamics of the arthropod vector. For more information on the disease see comments on ProMED-mail post 20110918.2842.
