In the last 2 weeks, we received in our parasitology laboratory at the Veterinary Research Institute, Peshawar KPK, Pakistan 2 blood smears of bull terrier dogs from the Civil Veterinary Hospital, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan. Both the owners were from Peshawar district but were living in different corners of the district.

The smears were very typical and were showing bulk trypanosomes. When the dogs were clinically examined, they were showing the following features (both the dogs were of bull terrier breed; they were of different ages, 1.5 and 3 years old):

- The dog at age 1.5 years had the highest body temperature with watery diarrhea, was weak and emaciated, dehydrated, with left eye opacity, bilateral lacrimation, swelling of left side from flank region up to the lower abdomen, testes and paw, was fully anorectic and debilitated; Hematology: Hb level 6gm/dl, TLC 12000/Cu mm TRBC 1/Cu mm ESR 120 DLC, Neutrophils 60 percent, Lymphocytes 32 percent, Eosinophils 6 percent, Monocytes 2 percent.

The dog at age 3 years was showing the following clinical signs: Acute dehydration, lethargy, was hypothermic, with left side inflammation from the flank region down to the paw. The dog was showing acute clinical signs of distemper with pus pimples in the groin region, discharging nose, and pale mucosa.

There is very [little] evidence of tsetse flies (the known vector) being present in the area; however, a lot of other flies from the Muscidae family, including _Musca domestica_, horse flies and tabanids, are there due to poor hygienic conditions, the devastating environmental/ecological status, and an influx of migrants from Afghanistan.

[A non tsetse-transmitted trypanosoma, present in the Indian sub-continent (including Pakistan) is _Trypanosoma evansi_, the causative agent of Surra in India and, amongst others, El Debab, El Gafar, Tabourit or MBori in North Africa and Mal de Caderas or Murrina in Latin America. _T. evansi_ is known to infect camels (dromedary and bactrian), horses, buffalo, cattle, dogs and other animals.

The disease title "_Trypanosoma evansi_ infections (including surra)" is included in OIE's list of reportable (multi-species) diseases. According to chapter 2.1.17, "_Trypanosoma evansi_ infection (Surra)," in OIE's Terrestrial Manual 2010: "There is considerable variation in the pathogenicity of different strains and the susceptibility of different host species. The disease may manifest as an acute or chronic form, and in the latter case, may persist for several months, possibly years. The disease is often rapidly fatal in camels and horses, but may also be fatal in buffalo, cattle, llamas and dogs; however, these host species may develop mild or subclinical infections. Wild animals such as deer, capybara and coati can become infected and ill (including death), but they may also constitute a reservoir. Animals subjected to stress -- malnutrition, pregnancy, work -- are more susceptible to disease."

According to Pakistan's most recent available annual OIE report (2009, submitted 20 Oct 2010), Surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_) was present in equines, and trypanosomiasis (Domestic) (unspecified) was reportedly present in bovines, buffaloes, camels, ovines and caprines.

In an earlier case report on canine trypanosomiasis in Pakistan, the authors described the clinical symptoms, haematological examination results, and successful treatment (by a single dose of diminazene diaceturate) of a 2-year old male bulldog at Lahore. They concluded that "it was difficult to distinguish the species of Trypanosoma at clinic, so there is need of serological and molecular tests for the diagnosis of species of Trypanosoma in Pakistan" (see ref. 1).

It would be interesting to note whether the definite identity of the trypanosoma organisms responsible for the dog cases in Pakistan could be laboratory confirmed and specified. Diagnostic methods are described in the comprehensive review in OIE's Terrestrial Manual (version adopted in May 2010), available online at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.17_TRYPANO.pdf. The chapter provides useful additional background on the disease.
