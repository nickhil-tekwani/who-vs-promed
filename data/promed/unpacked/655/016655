[After several weeks without any official outbreak reports, ASF has again been reported in the region of Volgograd Oblast. This is an expected event since, during the last 5 years, the disease has been spreading in Russia.

According to official information reported to the OIE, since the disease was 1st notified in November 2007, 367 outbreaks in both domestic and wild swine have been notified in 33 provinces of the country. In 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013: 1, 45, 54, 78, 55, 65, and 69 were officially reported, respectively (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries; Note: to view information, you need to scroll down to the name of the country, disease and period).

On 25 Dec 2013, Russia submitted to the OIE a final report of the ASF event which began in 2009. There were 110 follow-up reports, with 302 recorded outbreaks for this event. In that final report, the event was considered resolved by 16 Dec 2013. This report can be found at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14575.

Although "stamping out" was the control measure applied, it does appear that ASF is still very much present in Russia and may even be endemic.

The following report from Rosselkhoznadzor/Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance dated 20 Dec 2013 indicates that "African Swine Fever (ASF) continues to spread among wild boars in Russia, including in the territory of the state regional sanctuaries of the Russian Federation," said the Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor.

Thus, the study on 16 Dec 2013 in a Volgograd laboratory of pathological material selected from a dead wild boar from Olkhovskiy, Volgograd region revealed the presence of ASF. In recent weeks, there were no outbreaks registered in Russia. Rosselkhoznadzor has said that the reason for this is very cold weather with temperatures up to -20 C that are currently observed in the European part of the country. Specialists have stated that the number of ASF outbreaks almost always drops in winter, as it is almost impossible for the ASF virus to spread in such frosts.

In 2013, veterinary specialists reported 186 outbreaks of ASF since 16 Dec 2013, which is almost 50 percent higher than the outbreaks during 2012, with a registered total of 121 outbreaks (http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/press/7419.html?_language=en).

It is interesting to note that the number of outbreaks reported by this media source (121 for 2012 and 186 for 2013) is significantly different from the numbers officially reported to the OIE (65 in 2012 and 69 in 2013). - Mod.CRD
