Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 17 of 2017 [1 Jan-26 Apr 2017], Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.

The following is an update on the situation in Brazil.

In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 up to 27 Apr 2017, 3131 cases of yellow fever [have been] reported (715 confirmed, 827 suspected under investigation, and 1589 discarded), including 392 deaths (240 confirmed, 113 discarded, and 39 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 34 per cent among confirmed cases.

According to the probable site of infection, the cases were reported in 399 municipalities, while the confirmed cases were distributed among 123 municipalities in 6 states (Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Pará, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Tocantins).

With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, 61 were in Espírito Santo, 165 in Minas Gerais, 4 in Pará, 3 in Rio de Janeiro, and 7 in São Paulo. In descending order, the CFR among confirmed cases by state is 100 per cent in Pará, 41 per cent in São Paulo, 34 per cent in Minas Gerais, 30 per cent in Espírito Santo, and 2 per cent in Rio de Janeiro.

During the last week, no cases or epizootics were confirmed in new municipalities in the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro.

In Minas Gerais, the date of symptom onset of the last confirmed case remains 14 Mar 2017, while the additional 9 cases reported between the yellow fever bulletins published by the Brazil Ministry of Health on [19 and 26 Apr 2017] are cases with symptoms onset prior to that date.

In Espírito Santo, the majority of cases have been confirmed in the south-central part of the state, and the municipalities that account for 31 per cent of the confirmed cases are Ibatiba (22), Colatina (21), and Santa Leopoldina (20).

In Rio de Janeiro, the last case was confirmed on 20 Apr [2017] in the Maricá municipality. In São Paulo the date of symptoms onset of the last confirmed case is 6 Apr 2017.

To date, _Aedes aegypti_ has not been reported to have a role in transmission. However, confirmed epizootics in large cities, such as Vitoria in Espírito Santo and Salvador in Bahia, represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.

Figure 1 shows the trend in the number of reported cases, according to classification (confirmed, discarded, under investigation), in the 4 states that account for 99 per cent of all the confirmed cases.

Figure 2 illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics, and epizootics under investigation that correspond to the cumulative total in three different dates.

Since the beginning of the outbreak up to 27 Apr 2017, a total of 3467 nonhuman primates (NHP) epizootics have been reported, of which 474 were confirmed as yellow fever, 1367 remain under investigation, and 88 were discarded. Between the release by the Brazil Ministry of Health of yellow fever bulletins no. 37 and 38, an additional 222 epizootics in NHP were added.

Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Amazonas, Bahia, Goiás, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Rondônia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.

Reports of epizootics currently under investigation in states bordering Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela represent a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.

Recommendations
---------------
Given the current yellow fever situation in Brazil and the emergence of cases in areas where cases have not been detected in several years, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges member states to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in areas of known virus circulation.

PAHO/WHO encourages member states to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated, when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Vaccination
-----------
The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 per cent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 per cent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed. There have been rare reports of serious side effects from the yellow fever vaccine.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO/WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:
- conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 per cent coverage among the resident population of these areas;
- countries that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct immunization campaign. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination;
- ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling;
- depending on vaccine availabilities, Member States should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks;
- postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.

Precautions
-----------
It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
- the vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts of 200 cells/mm3 or more requiring vaccination;
- pregnant women should be vaccinated in an emergency situation and following recommendations of health authorities.
- vaccination is recommended in lactating women who live in endemic areas, since the risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is lower than the benefits of the vaccination of breastfeeding women.
- for pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.

The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:
- immunocompromised individuals (Including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy);
- people with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.

[The outbreak appears to be declining. Fortunately, there are no instances documented of _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission, although that risk will continue as long as the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is occurring. Unfortunately, killing of monkeys by concerned citizens has continued, although the Brazil government is attempting to halt that practice through education.

Individuals planning on traveling from the USA to the affected areas in Brazil, or other countries where YF is endemic, should seek vaccination as soon as possible because there is a predicted vaccine shortage starting in mid- to late summer, this year (2017) in the USA.
