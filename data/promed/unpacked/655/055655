["In Europe, the first outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 were reported in August 2020 in Russia in both poultry and wild birds. Since then, a new wave of epizootic outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several European countries especially in wild birds, but also in poultry starting from mid-October (2020).

"The current HPAI H5 epidemic is still progressing in Europe, Asia and Africa causing severe impact due to dead and culled birds in the infected premises. It is more likely that the source of introduction in these outbreaks is through migratory wild birds and onward local spread. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17. Report of increased number of outbreaks in wild birds indicate periods of heightened risk in countries due to migratory flyways during this season. Consequently, improving on-farm biosecurity measures is a priority to reduce the likelihood of exposure to poultry.

"Veterinary Authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity."

Prior to this time, there had been no reports of H5N8 affecting humans. However, on 20 Feb 2021 Russia notified the World Health Organization that in December 2020 HPAI H5N8 had been isolated from 7 individuals who worked in a poultry processing plant (see ProMED-mail posting 20210221.8204014). - Mod.CRD
