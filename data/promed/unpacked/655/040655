[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR- also known as KATA among herders in West
Africa because of the readily apparent cough and nasal discharge) can be a
devastating disease, especially in animals that have not been previously
exposed. Often local markets or watering holes can provide contact loci for
the exposure of susceptible animals who then bring the disease back to the
herd. In such cases, mortality and morbidity statistics as indicated in
this report can easily occur.
More details on the clinical presentation and distribution of the disease
in Africa can be obtained by consulting my Mod comments in "Peste des
petits ruminants - Congo Rep: OIE 20060805.2170".
The location for this outbreak can be seen on the WAHID webpage on the OIE
site. It indicates the outbreaks are located in the north western part of
Kenya, fairly near the borders with Uganda and Sudan. - Mod.PC]
