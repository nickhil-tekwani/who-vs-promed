There are two more confirmed cases of dengue this week -- both in patients
who did not travel outside the US in the two weeks prior to onset of
illness. One in a Nueces County resident (who did not travel out of the
US, but did travel to Laredo) and another in a Willacy County resident (who
denies any travel in the two weeks prior to illness onset).
Thus, 12 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Texas since July 1, 1999.
Eight cases were in Webb County residents; two of these cases were locally
acquired. The remaining four cases were in residents of Galveston,
Hidalgo, Nueces, and Willacy Counties; the patients in Nueces and Willacy
Counties did not travel outside the US in the two weeks prior to onset of
illness.
