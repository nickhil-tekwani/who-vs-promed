A citizen found the apparently injured fox and took it home, realizing after several days the fox had become ill. The fox was euthanized and tested positive for rabies, resulting in all of the family members having to undergo post-exposure treatment for the fatal disease.

"This particular case emphasizes the importance of enjoying wildlife from a distance, no matter how cute they may appear," said Lois Gary, a spokesperson for the Peninsula Health District.

The health district encourages citizens to vaccinate their pets, report all exposures to animals, refrain from coming into contact with wild animals and abstain from feeding pets outside or leaving trash uncovered. Anyone with information regarding exposure to the fox in Chisman or Boathouse Creek is asked to call the Health Department at 757-594-7340. Citizens can call the Yorktown Animal Control dispatch after hours at 757-890-3621.

The rabid fox found last week in Yorktown came into contact with a dog, which is now being monitored at his home for 45 days. Peninsula Health District environmental health supervisor Howard Masters said the dog overpowered the fox during a fight in the Chisman Creek and Boathouse Creek area of York County.

The dog's owner killed the fox and notified the Peninsula Health District, who collected the fox's remains for testing, which came back positive for rabies. The dog, who Masters said was up-to-date on vaccinations, was given a booster shot and is currently undergoing a 45-day confinement in its home "just as a precaution," Masters said. He stressed the importance of getting pets vaccinated to prevent rabies and avoiding contact with wildlife.

The health district encourages citizens to vaccinate their pets, report all exposures to animals, refrain from coming into contact with wild animals and abstain from feeding pets outside or leaving trash uncovered. Anyone with information regarding exposure to the fox in Chisman or Boathouse Creek is asked to call the Health Department at 757-594-7340. Citizens can call the Yorktown Animal Control dispatch after hours at 757-890-3621.

Correction: The article has been updated to reflect the circumstances surrounding the rabid fox. Incorrect information was provided in a previous version.

[There was one response [5 Mar 2015 at 9:27 am] to "Rabid Fox Found in Yorktown," from Bonnie: "The Health Dept will NOT test an animal thought to have rabies unless it has had contact with a human or pet. So when you read how many rabid animals have been found in an area, it is a very incomplete number!"

Bonnie has a sound point. In general, sick and dead wildlife are ignored and do not undergo necropsy or laboratory workup. As a result the full extent of rabies risk from sick wildlife can only be guessed at. In this newspaper I found multiple search requests for a dog that had bitten someone; a 2 Nov 2014 report of a rabid raccoon in York County; a 22 Aug 2014 report on a rabid bat found in a home in James City County; a 21 Jul 2014 report of a rabid raccoon in James City County; a 19 Mar 2014 rabid coyote found in Williamsburg; and a 28 Feb 2014, rabid fox in York County; and then more reports for 2013. If you want to study rabies in wildlife, Virginia is the place to go.

In the meanwhile the moral of this confused account is keep well away from any wild animal behaving strangely or even out in the daylight away from its normal habitat. Do not let your dog get involved, and make sure that he or she is up to date with rabies shots. - Mod.MHJ
