Pertussis, a disease that can lead to death especially among newborns, is more frequent in Bahia. According to data of the State Secretariat of Health, Sesab, between January and May 2014, 159 cases were reported, an increase of 25 percent from same period of 2013, when 127 cases were reported. A total of 300 cases were reported for the whole of 2013.

The municipality of Feira de Santana is the most affected. According to the WHO, pertussis is the 5th most common cause of death in children under 5 years of age of the diseases preventable by vaccines.

In 2013, there were confirmed cases in all age groups, but those less than one year old continued to be the most affected, Jacy Andrade, medical infectious disease specialist and director of the Specialized Service in Immunization and Infectious Diseases (SEMI), stated. She alerted adolescents and adults, who have been registering an increase in incidence, that they are transmitters of the bacterium to the small-children group.

[In the USA, "cocooning" of the susceptible neonate has included immunization of close family contacts as well as the pregnant female. Almost all the significant morbidity and mortality of infection with _Bordetella pertussis_ occurs in infants less than 6 months of age.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea sometimes with hypoxia-induced seizures, usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000, and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL
