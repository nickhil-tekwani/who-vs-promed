Protected bats sold as meat in food markets
Bat meat is being illegally sold in shops and restaurants, an investigation
has revealed. The mammals, which are considered a delicacy in many parts of
the world, are changing hands for as little as UKL2 in food markets and
shops.
Despite international laws outlawing the trade in bats or their consumption
for food in Europe, The Sunday Times found fruit bats openly on sale in
British shops and restaurants last week.
One reporter was offered a lump of smoked bat at a shop in south London. A
worker at a cash-and-carry in Brixton pulled the meat from a box and
wrapped it in brown paper. He boasted the meat was imported from Ghana and
charged UKL1.86 for the hand-sized portion.
Analysis of the meat by independent scientists found that the bones within
it matched those of fruit bat samples. The meat was virtually rancid and
partly decomposed. It was infested with foreign beetle larvae. Later, when
confronted over the sale of the meat, the shopkeeper, who declined to give
his name, refused to discuss it.
In Birmingham, a reporter who posed as a meat trader was promised bats
"within a few days" by a vendor at the city's daily meat market. Another
reporter was offered bat meals in a cafe off the Old Kent Road in southeast
London. The reporter asked a waiter in the African restaurant if bat was
being served and was offered a curry, served with vegetables and rice.
Tony Hutson, from the Bat Conservation Trust, said: "This is the first time
we have heard of bat meat being openly sold in Britain. It is obviously a
serious concern for us."
In some parts of Africa and Asia, where the animals have long been an
important source of food, fruit bats are hunted by professional "trappers".
They use shotguns to displace dozens of bats from mango trees and, once
exposed, the creatures are shot down. It is a lucrative business. In Ghana,
where they are common, the bats are served up at social occasions such as
weddings.
They are a luxury item on the menus of restaurants in the Seychelles, where
bat curry can be purchased. Typically, the bat is skinned, cooked and
served with ground rice. It is also sometimes marinated in coconut milk as
an hors d'oeuvre. Bats are not only prized as food, but are also valued as
a remedy for asthma and kidney ailments in parts of southeast Asia and as a
cure for infertility among women in Nigeria.
The trade in bats is held responsible for the dramatic reduction in some of
the rarest of the more than 160 species of fruit bat in Malaysia and
Indonesia. Worldwide>concerns about the threat to the bat population,
exacerbated by destruction of habitats, prompted an international ban on
trade in bats under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES).
"It is a real worry that protected bat species are being killed and
imported undetected, not to mention the danger to public heath of eating
uninspected meat," said Richard Barnwell, from the World Wide Fund for
Nature.
In Malaysia, bats are believed to be the source of a virus that has killed
more than 100 people. It is not known how the virus, which causes brain
fever, has jumped species, but bats have been identified as the most likely
reservoir. Scientists are also investigating whether bats are the source of
Ebola, an incurable disease.
Bats are not the only endangered animals in demand in Europe. Last week The
Sunday Times revealed that restaurants in Brussels were serving chimpanzee
meat.

[Bear in mind that it has not been proved that Nipah virus can be
transmitted by eating muscle. It is thought that Nipah virus is passed
from fruit bats to pigs through accidental consumption of excreta of bats
roosting near piggeries, & by analogy, transmission from bats to humans
most likely would occur from infectious blood or excreta into small wounds
on the hands during butchering & preparation of the meat. In any case, if
the meat is arriving in Europe smoked & putrid rather than frozen, it is
unlikely to contain any viable virus. - Mod.JW
