News of the response
Elections 2018
--------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, and the President of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Corneille Nangaa, had a working session this Thu 22 Nov 2018 in the Cabinet of the Minister. A joint commission between the 2 institutions was set up to coordinate their activities in the areas affected by the Ebola epidemic during the election period. The teams have already begun the work of harmonizing the maps to identify the precise location of the polling stations to be installed in the health zones affected by the epidemic. This will allow the Ministry of Health to deploy handwashing and temperature control devices at the entrance to all polling stations. "We are working together to ensure that every citizen can exercise their right to vote in all constituencies of North Kivu, including those where the disease currently occurs," said the Minister of Health.

Community engagement
--------------------
On Wed 21 Nov 2018, student representatives from several universities and higher institutions in Beni began their series of outreach sessions to youth groups hostile to the Ebola response. This awareness raising aims to educate these groups of young people about the behaviors to adopt to avoid being contaminated as well as the importance of not hampering the work of medical teams. The targets of this campaign are the young people in the 10 districts of Beni that have recorded the greatest number of resistances.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 33 498 people have been vaccinated, including 16 527 in Beni.

#Ebola thread:
1. 7 more cases today and 3 deaths. They bring the outbreak totals to date to 393 confirmed and probable cases and 222 deaths. Worth noting: 117 people have survived their infections and have been discharged from care.

2. I noted recently that within a few weeks this outbreak will become the 2nd largest ever; it's on track to pass the 2000 outbreak at Gulu, Uganda, where 425 cases were recorded. At the current rate of new cases, this could happen before the end of November [2018].

3. @MinSanteRDC reports that talks are underway with the elections commission to plan for safe elections. There's a lot of concern next month's elections could amp up the in violence in North Kivu. As @WHO @DrTedros says: #Ebola shouldn't be politicized.

4. The #Ebola response continues to try to get the community in North Kivu onside with containment measures. Latest effort: Meeting with youth groups in Beni who have impeded safe burials and other containment efforts.

Earlier Branswell tweets:
1. A critical facet of controlling an #Ebola outbreak is figuring out who has been exposed and monitoring their health daily so they can be isolated asap if they start to get sick. Given the importance of this, this number -- percentage of contacts followed -- is quite worrisome.

2. I don't mean to criticize the #Ebola responders; they're working in very taxing and dangerous circumstances, dealing with people who aren't co-operating in some cases. But 89 percent means 500 people weren't followed today. This risks losing track of transmission chains.

3. @WHO leaders have said in the past that when there's violence, their ability to do follow up flags and this percentage drops, but they get it up again when things calm down. Hope this is just a vestige of last Friday's [16 Nov 2018] violence.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
---------------
- Katwa [North Kivu]: of the new cases in the Katwa health zone, 5 are family members living in the Rughenda health area.

[2] Response
- Wed 21 Nov 2018. DRC: MSF base robbed in South Kivu "hideout territory"
[Actualite, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://actualite.cd/2018/11/21/rdc-une-base-de-msf-cambriolee-au-sud-kivu
[Byline: Justin Mwamba]

"On the evening of Tue 20 Nov 2018, the base of the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), located in Lulimba, in the territory of Fizi, was the subject of an armed robbery committed by unidentified men, valuable goods were taken away, but no one was seriously injured," an MSF/Holland official in South Kivu said.

In this hideout territory of armed groups, MSF is supporting the Baraka and Lulimba hospitals in the care of cholera patients.

A convoy of this NGO, which left the city of Uvira for the city of Baraka with drugs, was looted [Fri 16 Nov 2018] by armed men at the village Muchimuchi, located 7 kilometers [4.4 mi] from Baraka, in the territory of Fizi (South Kivu), according to concordant sources.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) temporarily left its Tushunguti base in the Bunyakiri health zone, Kalehe territory (South Kivu), following violent clashes between 2 Mai-Mai factions (Raia Mutomboki). All the medical staff had been relocated and temporarily installed at the Numbi base, about 3 by motorcycle from Tushunguti. The NGO returned to this locality after a return to calm.

- Thu 22 Nov 2018. South Sudan, Rwanda ramp up Ebola prevention efforts
[Devex, abridged, edited]
https://www.devex.com/news/south-sudan-rwanda-ramp-up-ebola-prevention-efforts-93835
[Byline: Christin Roby]

As the Democratic Republic of the Congo's health ministry describes the ongoing Ebola outbreak as the worst the country has experienced, its neighbors remain on high alert for the risk of the virus spreading across the border.

Since the outbreak was declared on 1 Aug 2018, a variety of factors have stifled the efforts of local responders to prevent transmission, including the proximity of the outbreak to the Congo River and access restrictions in conflict-affected areas.

The World Health Organization has given the all-clear to alerts that have been raised so far by neighboring countries. Still, preparedness activities are being implemented in 9 surrounding nations, with Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda earmarked as top priorities for preventative support.

"The prevention stage is the most critical to prevent ... the spreading of the outbreak ... [but] we are very much preparing in case the preventive stage flips to response," explained Olivia Headon, South Sudan spokesperson at the International Organization for Migration.

The UN migration agency has focused its efforts on border screenings, water, sanitation and hygiene, and displacement tracking. To date, IOM has screened more than 21 600 people at 7 border points in South Sudan, with no alert cases found, Headon confirmed. It is also rehabilitating the water system at a local health clinic, and tracking migration trends across the border.

Interagency response in South Sudan has boosted the country's Ebola prevention efforts and improved response capabilities. Earlier this month, a high-level coordination meeting of U.N. agencies and other humanitarian partners led to the formation of a strategic advisory group whose purpose is to provide technical support to the Ebola national task force in areas such as surveillance, risk communication, psychosocial support, rapid response, and safe and dignified burials.

"The government and humanitarian community are far more prepared now for an Ebola outbreak than they were before the North Kivu outbreak [because] screening points and referral pathways have been established," Headon added. The challenge now, she said, is funding. As of 10 Nov [2018] USD 7.3 million had been mobilized in South Sudan, representing 45 percent of the total required for comprehensive preventative activities there.

In Rwanda -- another priority country with a border just 150 kilometers [93.2 miles] from the North Kivu outbreak -- a national Ebola contingency plan was created in August by the Rwandan Ministry of Health, with the aim of identifying areas for technical support and financial contribution from international partners. The plan spans a 6-month period through January 2019 for the 11 districts considered most at-risk, including the capital city of Kigali.

Up to 60 000 people cross the Rwanda-DRC border for trading and personal activities each day, bringing a high risk of cross-border transmission, according to the Rwanda Red Cross Society. A national rapid response team is meeting weekly to monitor updates and coordinate strategies. The local Red Cross, for example, has been tasked with community contact tracing, risk communication, safe and dignified burials, and psychosocial support, among other activities. It has also carried out simulation exercises in Rubavu, the territory considered most at risk of an outbreak.

Since Rwanda has never experienced Ebola, "the impact is expected to be worse in case of an outbreak," the organization warned in its latest preparedness update, with "high population density is also a risk factor making awareness campaigns ... essential." Rwanda Red Cross has partnered with the Rwandan Ministry of Health to produce radio shows and broadcasts on Ebola. It has also printed more than 1300 posters to distribute in priority areas and supported mobile cinema sessions.

In South Sudan, Headon agreed. "One remaining challenge has been that people don't understand why they have to wash their hands with chlorinated water, and if they don't understand, they are not invested [in doing it]," she explained. "Therefore, more than anything else, communication is a key part in preventing and containing Ebola."

While an Ebola vaccine awaits approval, it has already been deemed "effective" and "safe" by a WHO-led study. Vaccination of health and frontline workers at priority sites in Uganda began on 7 Nov, and preparations are underway for similar preventative vaccinations in Rwanda and South Sudan.

[3] Vaccine: RFI
Date: Wed 21 Nov 2018
From: Karl Johnson <microcaddis@gmail.com> [edited]


Can anyone report details of the vaccination campaign? We need to know how many, if any, of those vaccinated came down with Ebola disease, and also the interval before onset, as well as the outcome of infection.

Remember, the original work with non-human primates told of lifesaving results post-vaccination after virus inoculation. These data are vital to get the "unproven" label from a product that is clearly most important in disease prevention.

[ProMED thanks Dr Johnson [who led the team that originally discovered and named Ebola virus in Zaire - Mod.JH] for this question and welcomes any information readers have to offer. It is important to know details of the response to the vaccine and not merely that it is effective. - Mod.LK]
