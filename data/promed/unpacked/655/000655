Officials tracking distemper outbreak in raccoons
-------------------------------------------------
Wildlife biologists are investigating an apparent outbreak of canine distemper that's racing through the local raccoon population.

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) in the past 2 weeks has collected 8 raccoons that turned up dead in Ashland, Talent, Phoenix, Jacksonville and South Medford, and 6 already have been confirmed as suffering from distemper.

Last year 6 dead raccoons collected in Jackson and Josephine counties tested positive for the disease, said Mark Vargas, ODFW's Rogue District wildlife biologist.

"We've had it before in foxes, and now we're starting to see it a lot more in raccoons," Vargas says. "When the raccoon population gets high, you often see distemper outbreaks, and I don't think there's a storm drain in Jackson County without a family of 'coons in it."

Distemper does not affect people, but pets are susceptible, particularly if pet owners haven't kept up with distemper vaccinations, Vargas said. Distemper is a highly contagious and generally fatal virus that regularly spikes in urban areas of the Pacific Northwest when local populations of raccoons, skunks and other animals surge. Infected animals often have runny noses and eyes, are listless in daylight, and often appear disoriented and uninterested in food or water.

Biologists are keeping tabs on distemper-infected raccoons and foxes around people, Vargas said, because signs can be similar to rabies. Biologists want to check every raccoon that died near people to test for distemper and rabies, which can pose health threats to people. Anyone who finds a dead raccoon near a house should call ODFW to report it. If possible, double-bag it, and wear gloves when handling it, Vargas said.

Residents who find a live raccoon with distemper signs can euthanize it if they live outside of city limits, Vargas said. Biologists don't plan to go out to find and euthanize sickly raccoons, he said.

Similar outbreaks swept through the Rogue Valley's raccoon populations in the early 1990s and mid-2000s.

In a 2005-06 outbreak, ODFW banned the trapping and release of raccoons in the wild, and the outbreak eventually stopped. But biologists said it was unproven that the ban on releases alone ended the outbreak.

The cause of the outbreaks was unknown, but animals can spread it from nose-to-nose contact or a shared food source, which is not common in the wild and is associated with people feeding wildlife.

Humans should avoid touching any wild animals, especially those suspected of carrying a disease, Vargas said.

[Canine distemper in raccoons starts slowly, initially appearing as an upper respiratory infection, with a runny nose and watery eyes developing into conjunctivitis (the most visible signs. As time wears on, the raccoon can develop pneumonia. The raccoon may be thin and debilitated and diarrhea is a clear symptom. In the final stage of the disease, the raccoon may begin to wander aimlessly in a circle, disoriented and unaware of its surroundings, suffer paralysis or exhibit other bizarre behaviour as a result of brain damage.

Many of these signs are indistinguishable from, and therefore often mistaken for, the signs of rabies which can be determined only by laboratory testing.

Raccoon distemper is cyclical and can spread and wipe out entire colonies of raccoons. The disease is transmitted through airborne droplets, direct contact with body fluids, saliva or raccoon droppings.

No treatment exists for canine distemper in raccoons (thereby increasing the need for prevention and control). Infected raccoons are usually euthanized. Control of distemper outbreaks includes the removal of dead animals' carcasses, vaccination of at-risk domestic species to decrease the number of susceptible hosts, and a reduction in wildlife populations which also reduces the number of potential hosts. The canine distemper virus is inactivated by heat, formalin, and Roccal R. Disinfection of premises with a dilution of 1.30 bleach will help to reduce spread.

Pet owners should insure their pets are vaccinated against rabies, and dog owners should include distemper as well as rabies. Canine distemper virus cannot be passed from dogs or raccoons to humans.
