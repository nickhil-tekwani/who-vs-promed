The Kentucky Department for Public Health has announced that Kentucky now has 832 cases of hepatitis A and 6 deaths related to the outbreak. A total of 52 Kentucky counties have reported outbreak-associated cases, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health.

They said that similar to outbreaks in other states, the primary risk factors for acute hepatitis A have been homelessness and illicit drug use.

From 1 Aug 2017 to 9 Jun 2018, the number of outbreak-associated cases is highest in Jefferson county with 453 cases. Boyd county has 98, Carter county has 56, Greenup, and Bullitt counties have 36 reported cases of outbreak-associated hepatitis A cases. Montgomery, Hardin, Nelson, and Warren counties have 6-19 cases reported.

[Most of the cases have occurred in the Louisville area. Over the past 2 weeks, an average of 101 cases per week is an impressive number.

The number of cases of hepatitis A in Kentucky has continued to expand at an impressive rate. It is unclear how many of the cases are included in the, now common, risk group of homeless and illicit drug using adults and how many cases have spilled over into MSMs (men who have sex with men) or related to infected food handlers. An aggressive immunization campaign as well as addressing sanitary issues in the homeless cohort are needed. The number of cases in Kentucky is rapidly increasing and will quickly surpass the number in southeast Michigan. Non-action will, no doubt, result in spillover into other populations. - Mod.LL

The Metro Public Health Department (MPHD) has confirmed 26 cases of hepatitis A in Nashville [Tennessee] since December 2017. The agency says for the 1st time since the outbreak started, 2 homeless persons are among the confirmed cases. Communicable Disease and Emergency Preparedness Interim Director Rachel Franklin expects the outbreak to "likely last for a number of months."

In response to the outbreak, the Health Department continues to work with the homeless and at Davidson County Sheriff's Office [DCSO] facilities to distribute hepatitis A vaccines. 4 cases of hepatitis A were confirmed among DCSO inmates last week.

MPHD says the current strain of hepatitis A matches strains of recent outbreaks around the country.

[The Nashville area of Tennessee appears to be one of the latest areas in the USA to report an outbreak of hepatitis A. Nashville, sometimes called "Music City", is affected which could affect the large tourist industry of the city. As these outbreaks continue to occur, it seems clear that cities should preemptively address their homeless situations before outbreaks begin. Ignoring these marginalized populations is clearly part of the problem. - Mod.LL

Missouri state and local health officials issued a health advisory due to the hepatitis A outbreak in the southeast part of the state.

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) has reported 127 confirmed outbreak cases of hepatitis A virus infection since September 2017.

Hepatitis A infection is a vaccine-preventable illness. The primary means of hepatitis A virus (HAV) transmission in the United States is typically person-to-person through the fecal-oral route (that is, ingestion of something that has been contaminated with the feces of an infected person).

Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain, and jaundice. Although rare, atypical extra hepatic manifestations include rash, pancreatitis, renal disease, arthritis, and anemia.

As outbreaks in Southern California, Utah, and southeastern Michigan have waned, a number of new ones have been occurring in other states. The one in Kentucky appears to be leading the pack in rate of increase. - Mod.LL]
