An outbreak of the sugarbeet disease cercospora has been found in
weed beet near Luton, Bedfordshire, by researchers from Broom's Barn.
The outbreak has prompted fears that the recent warm weather could
cause the disease to spread rapidly and [growers] were told to be
vigilant, following a spell of temperatures above 25 deg C [77 deg F].

The most important sugarbeet disease in continental Europe and the
USA, where it causes considerable yield loss, cercospora spreads
during warm, humid weather. "We've highlighted the possibility of the
disease occurring for the past couple of years, given the trend for
rising temperatures, but it hasn't shown itself. But if it stays warm
and humid, this could be the year that it does," Broom's Barn's Mark
Stevens said.

Growers starting to think about fungicide applications in the next
couple of weeks should keep the cercospora threat in mind, he advised.

[_Cercospora beticola_ is considered the most destructive foliar
pathogen of sugarbeet worldwide. The fungus affects most species of
_Beta_ (cultivated and wild) and has also been reported on many weed
species which can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on sugarbeet
(_Beta vulgaris_) include circular leaf spots with characteristic
black centres that coalesce and, in severe cases, can lead to
complete leaf collapse. During severe outbreaks, new leaf growth can
be seen emerging from the centre of collapsed leaves. The disease
reduces yield and quality of beet crops. Disease management generally
relies on fungicides, but resistant _C. beticola_ strains are
emerging. Partial genetic resistance available in _Beta_ varieties is
used in breeding programmes to develop new crop cultivars.
