[From a previous post: Shedd officials have discussed the possibility of
using a process of irradiating the fish to kill the bacteria, but that
process would sterilize the food so completely, it might be even more
dangerous than the erysipelas bacteria, Boehm said.

"There are all sorts of bacteria that are part of normal physiological
system for which the animal has a natural immunity," he said. "If you
killed (all the bacteria), then any bacteria that later slipped back into
their system could be a killer. We don't want animals that are naive of all
potential pathogens."
*****
This sounds like a fallacious argument to me. Irradiated food does not make
ones immune system "naive"! Animals in captivity are not micro-organism
free, so the immune system still has something to do. If irradiated food
could lead to this, then we (meaning humans) should be concerned about
eating irradiated food. The irradiated food argument is this would reduce
our exposure to potential food borne pathogens, thus improving our health.
I would think the same would apply to whales fed irradiated fish. In fact
the water environment in which they live probably gives them greater
exposure to pathogenic organism than we who live in the air. (Moist
environments are more favorable to micro-organisms, then is air, with it's
danger of desiccation.)
The concern seems to be that exposure to a pathogen they were not already
exposed to, would lead to disease. Is this not the usual definition of a
disease process? And wouldn't it be great if we could immunize ourselves so
we would not be "naive" of any pathogenic organism! This is too idealistic
for today's world.
