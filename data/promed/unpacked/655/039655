A norovirus outbreak traced to raw oysters from British Columbia has crossed the Canadian border, and USA officials say an unusual strain of the virus is involved.

About 100 people in California have reported becoming sick with symptoms of norovirus after eating raw oysters from British Columbia, according to the California Department of Public Health. The ill people said the oysters were sold by restaurants and retail stores.

"Laboratory testing has confirmed norovirus infection in several patients from both California and Canada. Although the number of reported new illnesses has decreased during the last week, the investigation is ongoing," the California health department reported [Tue 1 May 2018].

In Canada, 172 people have become ill after eating raw oysters from 4 oyster farms in Baynes Sound, British Columbia, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The farms were closed between [23 Mar and 13 Apr 2018]. They will remain closed until further notice.

The outbreak involves an unusual strain of the highly contagious norovirus, according to a statement from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP).

"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said [Mon 30 Apr 2018] that multiple states are currently affected by outbreaks related to raw oysters from British Columbia. It added that lab analysis has identified that an uncommon type of norovirus is involved," according to the CIDRAP statement.

As of [Tue 1 May 2018] night, the CDC had not posted any information about the outbreak. A spokeswoman at CDC did not comment on the outbreak on [Tue 1 May 2018]. She referred Food Safety News to the agency's general information page on norovirus and the FDA notice.

However, the FDA reported [Mon 30 Apr 2018] night that it was investigating the outbreak "along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and state and local partners. The FDA is working on tracing the oysters in the United States. The agency knows the implicated oysters were distributed to California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington state. However, other states may have received the oysters directly from Canada or from other distributors in the United States.

Restaurants and retailers in the United States can identify the implicated oysters by looking for the following landfile numbers located on the shellfish tags: CLF 1402060, CLF 1411206, CLF 1400483, and CLF 278757.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
Public health officials in the United States and Canada warn that all raw shellfish can harbor dangerous viruses, parasites and bacteria. Oysters are particularly prone to such pathogens. Quick steaming oysters will not kill norovirus and other pathogens, according to the CDC. To be safe, seafood must be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145 deg F [approx. 63 deg.C].

Raw oysters can cause illness in anyone, but they are particularly dangerous for young children, older adults, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems. Oysters and other food contaminated with noroviruses usually looks, smells and tastes normal.

Some foodborne illnesses caused by oysters, such as listeriosis, can take up to 70 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Norovirus, however, usually causes symptoms within 12 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated foods or beverages.

Most people infected with norovirus develop diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain. Diarrhea tends to be watery and non-bloody. Diarrhea is more common in adults and vomiting is more common in children. Regardless, symptoms can easily result in dehydration requiring intravenous fluids.

People who think they might have become ill from eating possibly contaminated oysters should talk to their healthcare providers. Contact your healthcare provider if you have diarrhea that lasts for more than 3 days, or is accompanied by high fever, blood in the stool, or so much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down and you pass very little urine.

[The contaminated farms on Vancouver Island, BC are not named and the source of the contamination is also not clear. Possibilities considered in earlier outbreaks this year 2018 included sewage leak or perhaps an unusually cold winter that also meant less sunlight, which affected the oysters' ability to filter toxins. The oyster farms are spread over a large area, and a single point source has not been identified. A separate report from the BC Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) said 4 oyster farms have been linked to the illnesses.

There is no information on the strain of norovirus other than that it is unusual. If any subscribers have information on the strain, it would be appreciated.

CIDRAP [Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy] reported that illnesses began In Canada's outbreak between the middle of March 2018 and the middle of April 2018, according to the PHAC [Public Health Agency of Canada] update. The number of new cases has declined, a sign that the outbreak may be slowing. - Mod LK
