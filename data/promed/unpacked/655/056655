Death of soldier from Missouri will be investigated amid spike in pneumonia
cases
---------------
Epidemiologists are investigating 2 unusual deaths from illness among troops
in the Middle East to see whether they are related to 10 cases of severe
pneumonia, The Springfield News Leader reported.

A 20-year-old male from Missouri died of an illness 12 Jul 2003. His parents
said the disease caused various organs to break down. 2 researchers have
already been sent to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where
this patient was treated before his death.

The U.S. Army surgeon general's office told The News Leader an additional
team of 6 researchers is preparing to fly to Iraq to investigate. The cases
under investigation have occurred since 1 Mar 2003. Another soldier died
about a month earlier, on 17 Jun 2003.

Col. Robert DeFraites, the surgeon general's senior preventative-medicine
physician, said officials have not yet been able to identify a specific
bacterium or virus that could have caused such severe cases of
pneumonia. "It's not entirely unheard of for this to happen," said DeFraites.
He said that in the past 5 years, 17 soldiers have died of acute respiratory
distress syndrome. However, he said it is uncommon for pneumonia to cause a
breakdown in organs other than the lungs.

[If the numbers presented in the above newswire are correct, 10 severe
pneumonia cases with 2 deaths over a 5-month period do not appear to be an
outbreak of a highly infectious agent. Clearly more information on the
clinical courses of the cases is necessary before drawing any conclusions
here. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from reliable sources
on this apparent [long-drawn-out] cluster of severe respiratory illness. -
