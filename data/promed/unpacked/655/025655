The local administration of Depok has finally elevated the status of its hepatitis A outbreak and considers it to be a full-blown extraordinary occurrence (KLB), compared to its previous partial KLB.

The head of Depok Health Agency, Novarita, said the increased health warning was mainly attributed to the fact that hepatitis A still loomed over SMPN-20 junior-high students in the City of Depok.

"Based on our data, the spread is not limited to SMPN-20 students but has also spread further. That is why we changed the outbreak's status to KLB," said Novarita during her visit to the school today, 29 Nov 2019.

This has effectively pushed the city to provide a budget to overcome the outbreak. She said that every sufferer of hepatitis A under the KLB status would receive medical treatment for free from 20 Nov 2019 - 20 Jan 2020. "The bills will be paid by the Depok City administration," she said.

Depok's records state that 9 hepatitis A patients were receiving treatment at the Depok City General Hospital from the 15 SMPN-20 students who were initially admitted to the hospital.

[It is unusual to see outbreaks of hepatitis A in the developing world, as sero-surveys suggest close to 100% seropositivity by age 10 from asymptomatic infection earlier in childhood. The diagnosis of acute HAV infection is made by finding anti-HAV IgM in suspected cases. A cluster in a single school would suggest a food or water exposure in the school, and the report suggests cases occurring outside the student body. - Mod.LL
