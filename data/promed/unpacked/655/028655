Coconut industry threatened by lethal yellowing
-----------------------------------------------
During a visit of Tanga Region recently President Jakaya Kikwete
urged experts to carry out research on how to deal with coconut
lethal yellowing disease that affects palms in coastal areas. He told
councillors of Pangani District Council that many coconut palms have
been destroyed in Tanga, Coast, and Lindi Regions.

President Kikwete explained that the disease was spreading fast and
that the area between Lushoto and Mkinga districts was a vivid
example of how lethal yellowing was adversely affecting coconut
production. The Pangani District Agriculture and Livestock officer,
Mr Simon Buteera, told the President that short term measures were
being taken to control the disease. According to experts, there are
few remedies against this type of decay.

A National Coconut Development Programme provides financing and
technical assistance in support of expanded coconut research,
breeding of lethal yellowing resistant coconut varieties, and
selection to develop higher yielding, more disease and drought
tolerant varieties/hybrids. President Jakaya Kikwete has said the
government has keen interest to increase output of cash crops
including coconut that could earn the country foreign exchange.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_
Phytoplasma palmae). Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening
of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to
be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved
in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the
pathogen cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as
reservoir hosts. LY is spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa,
while in Asia there are a number of coconut diseases suspected to be
caused by related phytoplasmas.

LY affects many palm species, but at least for coconut palm,
susceptibility may vary between cultivars or even within cultivars
depending on the region where they grow. For example LY has killed 90
percent of the highly susceptible Jamaican Tall variety in Jamaica
while Malayan Dwarf varieties are highly resistant. Symptoms can be
suppressed by regular tetracycline treatments, but commercial control
of LY relies on replanting with resistant varieties. Unfortunately,
an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf
hybrids has recently been reported, which is causing great concern
for coconut replanting programmes worldwide.
